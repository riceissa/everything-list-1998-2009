No, it's better visualised as 'being a not-mirror' :-)
<br />
Imagine you embedded a mirror in your head, but you were only interested
<br />
in everything the mirror was not. That is, the image in the mirror is 
<br />
manipulating the space intimately adjacent to the reflecting surface.
<br />
Keep the space, throw the reflecting surface and glass away. What you are 
<br />
interested in is 'being' that space, not the mirror. When you do that
<br />
the 'movie screen' that is the experiential field becomes part of you. Yes
<br />
it's a play, only 1 viewer who literally 'is' the theatre, no regressing 
<br />
homunculi.
<br />
<br />[David Nyman]
<br />
Oddly, I think I *see* what you mean (and I use the term advisedly).  One
<br />
of the problems we experience in discussing these issues (certainly  I do,
<br />
anyway) is the lack of a really effective way to share powerful 
<br />
*visualisations* of what we're proposing. Not everything we're trying  to
<br />
express is formalisable (at this stage anyway) in mathematical or 
<br />
strictly logical terms. I've tried to express before this image of the 
<br />
relationship between what-is-functioning-as-perceiver and
<br />
what-is-functioning-as-percept, and the picture in my head was always 
<br />
something like you describe. And the key aspect is that you *are* this 
<br />
relationship, your grasp of the situation is unmediated, there is no 
<br />
regress. For me, this is the primary intension of 'exists', and it lies 
<br />
at the heart of what I confusingly referred to as 1-person primacy - 
<br />
meaning only that you can't come by any of this unless you *are* the 
<br />
entity in question. The commitment is total - there is no way of
<br />
climbing outside of this to study the situation 'objectively'.
<br />
<br />[Colin Hales]
<br />
Glad to 'see' that you 'see'. :-)
<br />
<br />It is very interesting to see how much trouble people have with this and
<br />
it is very ironic because it is the position we naturally inhabit (all
<br />
observation is subjectivity), yet the subjectivity delivers the capacity
<br />
to behave objectively so brilliantly we think we have actually stepped
<br />
back from it... but as you say...
<br />
<br />&quot;there is no way of climbing outside of this to study the situation
<br />
'objectively'&quot;
<br />
<br />Yet that is what we scientists insist we are doing! Without subjectivity
<br />
there's no 'objectivity' (in the form of an 'as-if' or virtual
<br />
objectivity) to be had. The descriptions we define as 'objective' and
<br />
describe 'objectively' are merely generalisations in respect of
<br />
appearances of what bruno would call 'objective' (actual) reality...what
<br />
it is that is actually there, whatever it is that is the 'underlying
<br />
reality'..... That also delivers the appearances into your brain/via your
<br />
brain, which as actually made of the underlying reality, not of anything
<br />
we divine through the appearances it delivers.
<br />
<br />Indeed I would hold that our subjective experience (subjectivity)is our
<br />
one and only intimate and complete connection to the underlying reality
<br />
and it is the existence of it (subjectivity) 'at all' which is most
<br />
telling/instructive  of the true nature/structure of the underlying
<br />
reality, not the appearances thus delivered by subjectivity.
<br />
<br />As I think I have said before: 'seeing' is evidence of the underlying
<br />
reality and its capcity to deliver 'that which is seen'. The latter
<br />
delivers two sorts of evidence
<br />
<br />a) more evidence of the organisation of the underlying reality
<br />
b) what we regard as objective evidence used by scientists in formulations
<br />
of emopirical laws that organise the appearances but tell us nothing about
<br />
the underlying reality because we throw (a) away for no reason other than
<br />
it is our culture to do so.
<br />
<br />There's a lot more to observation than merely 'that which is seen'. The
<br />
act of seeing at all is also observation.
<br />
<br />Metaphorically... if you hear &quot;X is true&quot; being said you get 2 lots of
<br />
evidence, not one:
<br />
c) some evidence in support of the proposition that &quot;X is true&quot;
<br />
d) more definite evidence of the proposition &quot;somebody said something&quot;
<br />
<br />'that which is seen' corresponds to &quot;X is true&quot;
<br />
The underlying reality is the 'somebody'
<br />
<br />Science calls any consideration of the 'somebody' as evidenceless
<br />
non-scientific metaphysics and spurns/eschews it when is is actually
<br />
_more_ evidenced! in that (d) is a better supported claim than (c)
<br />
<br />That's about the lot on 'observation' except to wonder when mainstream
<br />
science (in particular cosmology and neuroscience) finally 'get it'. This
<br />
simple cultural foible hides the key to 'everything'. The belief that the
<br />
'underlying reality is actually made of quantum mechanics (as opposed to
<br />
being merely described by it) to me looks like a mass delusion of the most
<br />
bizarre kind. Thomas Kuhn should be marching up and down with placard
<br />
saying &quot;NO MORE EVIDENCE-ISM&quot; &quot;EVIDENCE DISCRIMINATION UNFAIR TO
<br />
UNDERLYING REALITY&quot;. :-)
<br />
<br />cheers,
<br />
