Here we go again about the meaning of meaning and other IDs of terms we love to use w/o proper IDs.
<br />
English con tribution: 
<br />
Tom's 3 &quot;why&quot;s can be understood in (at least?) 2 ways: 1. asking for the origination as cause of the topic, - OR 2. asking for a purpose - as a goal - of it. 
<br />
Since I do not consider the second aspect (at all?) I turn to the first one, which I do consider, but don't really know. 
<br />
In 'science' (reductionistic that is using topical model views) we search for the most obvious iniciator (entailer) within the model of observation and pronounce it 'cause'.
<br />
In my (poorly identified) &quot;originational&quot; determinism it is the entire totality (who knows what that may be) and its cummulative changes that result in our observed moves   
<br />
(changes) and happenings. 
<br />
<br />You wrote: &quot;...science cannot create values and personal meaning.&quot; Especially not our ongoing one. 
<br />
I also agree with the &quot;being a person&quot;  part (- as a personal FEELING), however there might be some similarity between such feeling and the one about Tom's 'God&quot;. None of them are 'instrumentally verifiable' - which btw. is no &quot;must&quot; in my value-system to be acceptable. 
<br />
Both (consider only these two) are prejudicial personal belief systems, naybe excluding each other in toto. 
<br />
And so is my position, not including either of them &lt;G&gt;). 
<br />
I have no such firm point as some on this list seem to have (Bruno, etc.) and stay on my well established ignorance of &quot;I dunno&quot;&lt;G&gt;.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
One question, however, seems firmly askable:
<br />
WHAT SHOULD WE CALL   &quot;  L I F E  &quot; ????
<br />
(For sure not the biochem-game, not a transcendent comp, not - maybe - a restricted (physical?) term in  'a' biosphere' and not without including WITH the 'materially' explained features an extended form of mentality - the ideation also including phenomena callable 'inanimate').

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">  &gt; &gt; &gt; that there ultimately is no meaning.  I am arguing that the ultimate

<em class="quotelev3">  &gt; &gt; &gt; source of meaning has to be personal.  I'm just saything that my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">  &gt; &gt; &gt; argument is of the form, &quot;If meaning is not ultimately based on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">  &gt; &gt; &gt; personal God, then there is no true meaning, because...&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">  &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">  &gt; &gt; I realised when I was about 12 or 13 years old that there could not be any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">  &gt; &gt; ultimate meaning. I was very pleased and excited with this discovery, and ran
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">  &gt; &gt; around trying to explain it to people (mostly drawing blank looks, as I remember).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">  &gt; &gt; It seemed to me just another interesting fact about the world, like scientific and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">  &gt; &gt; historical facts. It inspired me to start reading philosophy, looking up words like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">  &gt; &gt; &quot;nihilism&quot; in the local library. It also encouraged me to question rules, laws and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">  &gt; &gt; moral edicts handed down with no justification other than tradition or authority,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">  &gt; &gt; where these were in conflict with my own developing value system. Overall, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">  &gt; &gt; think the realisation that there was no ultimate meaning was one of the more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">  &gt; &gt; positive experiences in my life. But even if it hadn't been, and threw me into a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">  &gt; &gt; deep depression, does that have any bearing on whether or not it is true?

<em class="quotelev2">  &gt; &gt;

<em class="quotelev2">  &gt; &gt; Stathis Papaioannou
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">  &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; It's interesting that in my observations quite a lot of people have an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; eye-opening experience around the age of 12 regarding the meaning of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; life.  Perhaps it has to do with entering puberty and forming our own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; sense of purpose.  I guess you might know something about this from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; your background, Stathis.  For me it was when I was eleven, I think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; triggered by starting to go to a boarding school and living away from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; my parents.  One night I had this overwhelming sense of God's presence,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; a sense of ultimate love surround me and reassure me that everything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; was going to be all right.  And I felt a deep sense of gratitude just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; for being alive.  It was a strict boarding school (religious!), and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; there was a real sense of competition, but when my mom asked me in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; letter how I was doing, I said, &quot;I'm just fine, as long as they don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; cut my head off!&quot;  Anyway, from then on I felt &quot;centered&quot;, or at least
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; I had a &quot;center&quot; that I could go back to, because I knew that I was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; loved by the One from whom Everything/Everyone comes from.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; My view of this is that we form our view of meaning as a process of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; thought about whatever resources we have.  For instance, someone could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; look around them at the options for defining meaning, and choose not to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; base their meaning on any so-called &quot;ultimate&quot; source.  However, this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; general process in an of itself doesn't seem to actually prove one way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; or other that a particular basis of meaning is the &quot;real&quot; basis of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; meaning, if such a thing actually exists.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Right.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; How does this relate to the Everything List?  That's a good question,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; and is one of the questions I want to pose on this thread.  Does the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; Everything idea, or discussions at the Everything &quot;level&quot; have anything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; to do with the meaning of life?  Does it shed any light on the meaning
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; of life, or meaning in general; or vice versa: does the meaning of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; life, or one's view of meaning, have any significant effect on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; Everything issues, and if so how?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; Certainly in the view of many big thinkers, the meaning of life is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; central question of philosophy, and it seems that philosophy has a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; central bearing on the topic of this List.    For example Albert Camus,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; in his The Myth of Sisyphus says:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; &quot;There is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; suicide.  Judging whether life is or is not worth living amounts to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; answering the fundamental question of philosophy.  All the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; rest--whether the world has three dimensions, whether the mind has nine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; categories or twelve categories--come afterward.  These are games; one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; must first answer...  If I ask myself how to judge that this question
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; is more urgent than that, I reply that one judges by the actions it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; entails.  I have never seen anyone die for the ontological argument
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; [for the existence of a god].  Galileo, who held a scientific truth of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; great importance, abjured it with the greatest of ease as soon as it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; endangered his life.  In a certain sense he did right.  That truth was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; not worth the stake.  Whether the earth or the sun revolved around the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; other is a matter of profound indifference.  To tell the truth, it is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; futile question.  On the other hand, I see many people die because they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; judge that life is not worth living.  I see others paradoxically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; getting killed for the ideas or illusions that give them a reason for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; living (what is called a reason for living is also an excellent reason
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; for dying).  I therefore conclude that the meaning of life is the most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; urgent of questions.&quot;
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course: questions of personal meaning are not scientific questions. Physics 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;may show you how to build a nuclear bomb, but it won't tell you whether you 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;should use it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">  &gt; Besides the question of how meaning relates to this List, the question
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; of meaning itself can be asked at several different levels, so I'll
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; list a few:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; 1) Why does the universe exist?  Why is there something rather than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; nothing?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; 2) Why do human beings in general exist?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; 3) Why do I exist?
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;These questions can be answered at the level of explanation and description 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;(i.e. scientifically) rather than at the level of meaning, i.e. I exist because my 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;parents met, humans exist because they evolved naturally, etc. The point I 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;have been arguing in recent weeks is, and perhaps here we are in agreement, 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;science cannot create values and personal meaning. On the one hand my will 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;to live is easily explained as something programmed into me by evolutionary 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;processes; on the other hand, what it feels like from the inside, the sense of its 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;importance to me can only be understood by *being* a person. This is the irreducible 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;quality of first person experience: consciousness is what is left when what can 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;possibly be known by observing an entity is subtracted from what can possibly be 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;known by being that entity.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Where I think I disagree with you is that you seem to want to reduce the irreducible 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;and make values and personal meaning real world objects, albeit not of the kind that 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;can be detected by scientific instruments, perhaps issued by God. But in proposing 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;this you are swapping one irreducible entity extremely well-grounded in empirical 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;evidence (I know I'm conscious, and I know that when my brain stops so does my 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;consciousness) for another irreducible entity with no grounding in empirical evidence 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;whatsoever.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">  &gt; The purpose of listing these three questions is not to deal with all of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; them on this thread necessarily, but to show that the question of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; meaning of life really is connected to the universal questions that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; this list tries to address.  One's answer to any one of these questions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; can affect his/her answer to the other questions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; It seems that we all have to eventually come to the question of the end
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; of our lives.  (Even if immortality, quantum or other kinds, is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; reality, the question of the end of our lives is a topic addressed even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; on this List.)  So as one man on United Flight 93 said before giving
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; his life to save others, &quot;Let's roll!&quot;
