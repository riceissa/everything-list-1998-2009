<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You are too kind.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You know, in the seventies, last century, I met three or four times  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; d'Espagnat in Paris. I am very glad for him. It is a sincere  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inquirer well aware that something was informative, to say the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; least, in the EPR quantum weirdness, and in the quantum measurement  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I read all his four first books, and two of them has been my bible,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with respect to the quantum &quot;mystery&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Despite a good, open minded description of Everett &quot;many-worlds&quot;, he  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prefers to stick on a veiled but fuzzy reality, yet of the platonist  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; kind. I am sure he could appreciate comp, if that was taught. To be  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; frank I have not read his more recent last books. Klein in Paris is  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; also very nice. Thanks for the link and for you wishes. Next year is  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a bit too early I think.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; About creativity I agree perhaps with Brent. I am not sure it could  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be taught. Respect of the creativity of the other, can be taught,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but then only by example, by practice not by theory or suggestions.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The human mind is too &quot;much creative&quot; per se, and creativity is like  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consistency in machine. To make a theory could lead to a contrary  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; effect.
</em><br />
<br /><br />But who can say that creativity cannot be taught when no institution  
<br />
sets out to do so? Who even understands what creativity actually is? A  
<br />
few do, but only a few listen. They tend not to be academics and  
<br />
because of this, academics dislike them and their work. It is true,  
<br />
they tend not to rely on other people's work and so don't go around  
<br />
quoting the right authors or reverencing the right superluminaries of  
<br />
the past. Why I like Wolfram's approach; they revisualise the entire  
<br />
game. They don't go about inventing theories and setting out to argue/ 
<br />
defend them or prove themselves right and everybody else wrong. They  
<br />
don't get their thrills like that. They set out to design and  
<br />
construct. They question and challenge everything, they stare at the  
<br />
mid-section of a pencil and wonder whether its design might be  
<br />
improved. That is natural creativity - when properly encouraged and  
<br />
taught. Who you gonna call? A guy with a theory or a guy with the  
<br />
right tool in his hand for the job? Creativity can be taught using  
<br />
tools designed for the optimal use of our kind of active self- 
<br />
organising information system. The basis of creativity and the mind  
<br />
was understood by 1969 by Edward de Bono. He modelled the mind as an  
<br />
active self-organising information system. I mean - we are not  
<br />
computationalists on this list for nothing, I take it! The particular  
<br />
memory-surface that is the entity we usually call the 'mind' has been  
<br />
shown to be a pattern-generating and a pattern-reading-using entity.  
<br />
Because of this, the crucial factor is the _sequence_ of the arrival  
<br />
of all information, as it always is in linear systems requiring  
<br />
continuity. Time makes it that things settle into defined patterns  
<br />
sooner or later. This process lays down the assymetrical founding  
<br />
patterns we recall (patterns of recognition). These, amazingly, grow.  
<br />
They never shrink.
<br />
<br />It amazes that you think the human mind is &quot;too creative&quot; by nature.  
<br />
The reverse is surely the truth. The human mind has evolved over time  
<br />
to be as uncreative as possible. &quot;Better Be Safe then Sorry&quot; is a very  
<br />
strong algorithm in our atavistic unconscious. Or else, the Church -  
<br />
with its maidservant: Education - throttled it out of civilisation  
<br />
when it was seen that the church's teachings might be under attack  
<br />
because people were starting to know how to think creatively about  
<br />
information, facts and evidence and started to restructure things...
<br />
<br />Left to themselves, patterns tend to grow by continuity. This means  
<br />
that established patterns do not change but only get added to.  
<br />
Equilibrium sets in; gravity does the work. With mind as with matter.  
<br />
&quot;If it ain't broke, why fix it?&quot; sets in. Things start to rot as we  
<br />
poo in our petrie dish. In order to restructure a pattern so as to put  
<br />
the contained information together in a new and better way requires  
<br />
some act of discontinuity. That's what creativity does in a self- 
<br />
organising information system like the human mind. It provides a  
<br />
necessary sideways step across (laterally) the oh-so-well-established  
<br />
memory patterns to reveal the hidden sidetrack leading straight to  
<br />
your goal (at a 5th of the original cost, and with a whole bunch of  
<br />
other stuff nobody could have imagined. It's the &quot;dare to imagine and  
<br />
go out to do it&quot; part of the mind.) Veeeeeeery underdeveloped.
<br />
<br />Because information creates assymetrical patterns of memory in the  
<br />
mind, there remains the eternal possibility that we missed something  
<br />
important at the time the tramtracks of our memory were laid down  
<br />
because of incomplete perception. There may be any number of good  
<br />
reasons why our perception is always incomplete in any given  
<br />
situation, one of them being, you guessed it: Goedel's Incompleteness  
<br />
theorem. This means we may be missing vital systems information that  
<br />
would give us more confidence in our data about the world if only we  
<br />
might creatively _bet_ on the right horse for once?
<br />
<br />There arises the mathematical necessity in an information system like  
<br />
this to use _discontinuity_ at some point to stop things settling into  
<br />
local pockets of equilibrium. Creativity is too often associated with  
<br />
'genius' and as such only happens in fits and starts - like when the  
<br />
next genius bothers to get born and do chose geniale...a better way to  
<br />
characterise creativity is via humour, the laugh at the punchline or  
<br />
some other moment when the previously hidden information sidetrack is  
<br />
revealed. If you can put across a good joke, chances are you are a  
<br />
creative. Everybody understands (or should understand) humour as the  
<br />
natural snap-reflex of the mind when we snap out of one pattern and  
<br />
achieve another ON THE SAME DATA. This is why there is not even one  
<br />
blessed laugh in religious doctrine. Religious thinking (what we may  
<br />
have to stoop momentarily to call &quot;Theology&quot; with a capital T) has  
<br />
gone nowhere in over 18 centuries. The church has nurtured ONLY  
<br />
critical thinking in civilisation, Bruno! Nobody can convince me that  
<br />
creativity has thrived under the influence of the Church. Creativity  
<br />
was thrown out of science and religion and philosophy and tolerated  
<br />
only in the arts, that's what happened. And the artists were made to  
<br />
live in garretts and sing for their supper!!
<br />
<br /><br />Creativity has been the victim of repression in western thinking since  
<br />
Socrates, who, along with Plato and Aristotle are the sods responsible  
<br />
for giving us the our critical-thinking-dominated and design-energy- 
<br />
deficient thinking system. OK - so get the bloody Athenian Academy  
<br />
doors yanked open and let's get this thing sorted out by golly! You  
<br />
have great reverence for Greek thinking, Bruno - I just want to slap  
<br />
them all around the gills for their lack of design, their lack of  
<br />
creative, generative thinking energy. It's all argument bloody  
<br />
argument. I am right sir and you are wrong sir! The truth lies with  
<br />
me! No sir it is you who are wrong sir! You are without merit! So what  
<br />
have these two guys created while yelling at each other? Where's a  
<br />
good tradie when you need one? They've all turned into bloody lawyers!
<br />
<br />There is a good argument that goes if you never try to teach  
<br />
creativity you will never know whether it is possible. The answer is  
<br />
it is possible and formal techniques are available. Training in  
<br />
thinking skills - including Lateral Thinking (=structured creativity)  
<br />
have never been more urgently needed in humanity's increasingly urgent  
<br />
struggle against indomitable forces like the weather and the economy.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; About academies, I agree with many things you say, but I do think  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; also, that they are the worst, except for all the others. Expertise  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are needed, and interdisciplinarity will develop through  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interdisciplines, which will constitute new disciplines. It is the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; opening of the mind to new disciplines which is lacking.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Like the teaching of Thinking Skills in schools, an  
<br />
interdisciplinarian terrain.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Old academies can be rotten, that is true. But then we need new  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; academies, or we need to reopen the very old one, the one by Plato.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />But for goodness sake leave the Gang of Three (Soc, Plat, Arist) dead  
<br />
and buried willya!!?? We don't need Plato the GUY to have Platonia now  
<br />
do we? He was a fascist and a slave-owner. Socrates just wanted  
<br />
everyone to agree with him. Bullshit he was showing people how to  
<br />
uncover the 'truth'. He was a SOPHIST. He was exercising the sacred  
<br />
art of seduction on his audience. He was selling - which is what  
<br />
'sophistry' is. He sold them only the front left wheel of the car.  
<br />
Socrates did NOT sell the whole car! He sold critical thinking skills  
<br />
only. He OVERSOLD his buyers on critical thinking. NEVER trust a Greek  
<br />
bearing gifts!!!!!
<br />
<br />We were left with a thinking system devoid of creative, generative,  
<br />
provocative design energy. The church REDISCOVERED all of this  
<br />
wonderful fascist stuff at the time of the Renaissance when the first  
<br />
schools were established in Europe and used critical thinking as a  
<br />
tool to repress creative thinkers = heretics (those possessed of the  
<br />
magical ability to put given data together in new ways to give a new  
<br />
view). They and the Evil Education Empire have been pushing  
<br />
argumentative/adversarial/I win-you lose, lawyer-style thinking as the  
<br />
basis of all thinking ever since. No wonder we pang for a Michelangelo  
<br />
or an Einstein to lift us out of it. But this laziness of waiting for  
<br />
Darwinian Evolution to solve our deepest problems is unfortunately  
<br />
lacking in design, crfeativity and imagination once again...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And learn to come back to seriousness in fundamental human or person  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter (very hard task).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The layman is still in advance here, in a sense. The &quot;everything&quot;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quest, will leads also to experts. Experts are not bad, only bad  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experts are bad, especially the one who talk negatively about a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; field they does not really know.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes, I exaggerated my take on experts on purpose. But who has not  
<br />
encountered a closed mind today or yesterday? Everybody goes to  
<br />
school. Remember, it is the sequence of the arrival of the data that  
<br />
forms the patterns that determines how the future unfolds.
<br />
<br />Two restaurants A and B open up, side by side. Both offer reasonably  
<br />
equivalent services. The problem is how to get some momentum  
<br />
happening. Nobody, it seems, will be attracted to eat at an empty  
<br />
restaurant. So one of the restaurants cracks and does something  
<br />
creative (which might also include the possibility of their not doing  
<br />
anything) and somehow gets one person to sit and eat in the  
<br />
restaurant. A second customer, faced with the choice of an empty  
<br />
restaurant or a restaurant with one customer then experiences the  
<br />
&quot;Better Be Safe Than Sorry&quot; atavistic-memory instruction kick in and  
<br />
goes into that restaurant. Then a third arrives, and a fourth etc.
<br />
<br />The outcome is that you have one restaurant that is a booming success  
<br />
and one next door that is a complete failure and all this without any  
<br />
data. This is what I mean by saying the patterns of recognition are  
<br />
assymetrical; they travel always to continuity without some mechanism  
<br />
for interrupting them (the 'mathematical necessity' for lateral  
<br />
thinking.)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A good expert is someone who can remain silent when he does not  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; know. I agree with many of your points and tones. I just point on  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; points which, perhaps by reading to quickly, gave me the feeling  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that you could criticize the wrong cible.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK, I judge academics as much by their prejudices as by their beliefs.  
<br />
The belief that creativity cannot be taught is based on a prejudice  
<br />
against ever being seen as 'wrong' in some sense. No academic ever  
<br />
seems to understand that sometimes you have to be 'wrong' under the  
<br />
conditions of the present reality to provoke a change following which  
<br />
the action taken will be seen to be very much the 'right' thing to  
<br />
have done. Only you could not see this before. Occasionally, in order  
<br />
to continue travelling North, you might have to turn South. It will no  
<br />
doubt appear logical to you after you have experienced it, but was  
<br />
highly illogical before. In other words, at certain moments (moments  
<br />
of stagnation or local equilibrium) it becomes logical - even  
<br />
desirable - to be 'illogical' or wrong. A provocative statement or  
<br />
action will doubtless make better sense AFTER the sought-after change  
<br />
has occurred.
<br />
<br />There can therefore be a class of statement for which NO reason exists  
<br />
before the statement is made. It's value will, by hindsight, be seen  
<br />
to lie in its leading toward a restructuring of the existing  
<br />
information so that patterns invisible before are now visible to the  
<br />
mind. This is what Socrates and his mates were definitely NOT selling  
<br />
that fine, hot day in Athens.
