<br />
Brian,
<br />
<br />Your inquiries about FL is an uncharted but important one.
<br />
<br />I'd like to suggest though that your approach is too 
<br />
conventional and 'consistency' is not the ultimate
<br />
criteria for evaulating it's connection with validity 
<br />
or more importantly - feasability - in context with
<br />
'logic' - and mathematical value judgements.
<br />
<br />I've taken a wholly different/radical approach which
<br />
has been productive.  &quot;Existential Probability&quot; is a
<br />
strong and broader base to use and in general is 
<br />
an umbrella-space for all logic systems.  I call the
<br />
most generalized form &quot;Stochastic Logic&quot;.  It has the
<br />
interesting attribute of placing FL and QM on a par, 
<br />
in the scheme of things, with direct connection with
<br />
Boole, and Aristotelian logic before-that.
<br />
<br />In historical framing, it can be seen that the earliest
<br />
logics were limited-specific-condition logics and that
<br />
each new step was toward 'improved generalization'.
<br />
<br />The leap that FL makes is removing the boundaries of 
<br />
the probability space and pushing toward a 'logic'
<br />
system that copes with Cantorian infinities and
<br />
transfinites.  It pushes towards plural-criteria
<br />
logic (what you've indicated as akin to Multi-modal).
<br />
<br />It is a critically important step that out-paces
<br />
all the conventional analysis.  Think of it as the 
<br />
tool to developing utile computation/description 
<br />
methods for 'logic' evaluation of the (so far) 
<br />
intractible &quot;many bodied&quot; problem.  Complexity math
<br />
is one way of coping with -some- factors of many-bodied 
<br />
systems, but even that math hasn't been fully scrutinized 
<br />
or (logically) evaluated for kladistic characteristics
<br />
yet.  I've looked some of the equation forms and found
<br />
some interesting things going on in 'recursion' equations
<br />
that relate to breaking away from 'zero to one' boundary 
<br />
restriction.
<br />
<br />I discuss a bit of it in general vernacular at 
<br />
<br />&lt;<a href="http://www.ceptualinstitute.com/uiu_plus/uiu05charting.htm">http://www.ceptualinstitute.com/uiu_plus/uiu05charting.htm</a>&gt;
<br />
<br />Feel free to contact me directly at integrity -AT_SYMBOL- prodigy.net
<br />
(remove the spaces) if you'd like to discuss in more detail.
<br />
<br />I made an effort several years ago to get Lotfi Zadeh speaking
<br />
with Herb Simon (just before he died) in the hopes that traditional 
<br />
and leading edge probability theories could find commonality.
<br />
<br />They did talk some but nothing definitive or fruitful came
<br />
from it - mainly because each had too much vested interest 
<br />
in separate academic venues.  And because second and third
<br />
generation 'probabilists' were so dedicated to their particular
<br />
stances on 'how the math &quot;should&quot; be done', instead of opening
<br />
themselves to combining the methodologies into a grander
<br />
schemata - it's going to take someone or someones with -your-
<br />
sensibility and intuitions to make it happen.   :-)
<br />
