<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No doubt this is true.  But there are still two somewhat-related problems.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One is, you can go back in time to the first replicator on earth, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think of its evolution over the ages as a learning process.  During this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time it learned this &quot;intuitive physics&quot;, i.e. mathematics and logic.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But how did it learn it?  Was it a Bayesian-style process?  And if so,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what were the priors?  Can a string of RNA have priors?
</em><br />
<br />I'd say that biological evolution bears little resemblance to Bayesian 
<br />
learning, because Bayesian learning assumes logical omniscience, whereas 
<br />
evolution cannot be viewed as having much ability to make logical 
<br />
deductions.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And more abstractly, if you wanted to design a perfect learning machine,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one that makes observations and optimally produces theories based on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them, do you have to give it prior beliefs and expectations, including
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; math and logic?  Or could you somehow expect it to learn those?  But to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; learn them, what would be the minimum you would have to give it?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm trying to ask the same question in both of these formulations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; On the one hand, we know that life did it, it created a very good (if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perhaps not optimal) learning machine.  On the other hand, it seems like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it ought to be impossible to do that, because there is no foundation.
</em><br />
<br />Suppose we create large numbers of robots with much computational power, but 
<br />
random programs, and set them to compete against each other for limited 
<br />
resources in a computable environment. If the initial number is sufficiently 
<br />
large, we can expect that the ones that survive in the end will approximate 
<br />
Bayesian reasoners with priors where actual reality has a significant 
<br />
probabilty. We can further expect that the priors will mostly be UDist 
<br />
because that is the simplest prior where the actual environment has a 
<br />
significant probabilty. Thus we've created foundation out of none. Actual 
<br />
evolution can be seen as a more efficient version of this.
<br />
<br />Now suppose one of these suriviving robots has an interest in philosophy. We 
<br />
might expect that it would notice that its learning process resembles that 
<br />
of a Bayesian reasoner with UDist as prior, and therefore invent a 
<br />
Schmidhuberian-style philosophy to provide self justification. I wonder if 
<br />
this is what has happened in our own case as well.
