<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Dear Brent,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;    I can try but a tyro can do not better than a professional.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Often a tyro can do better because he recalls the difficulties that have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; become intuitive to the professional.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have noticed that. ;-)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;    Do you know what relation exists between linear functionals and an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;appropriate vector space? A duality, but somehow I suspect that you will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;not be capable of imagining this mathematical duality as having anything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;all to do with a mind-body duality; especially since you seem fixated on a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;particular set of words and have a hard time grasping the outline of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;idea that those words represent.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [BM]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You're right that I have difficulty imagining that; but I don't think I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should have to &quot;imagine&quot; it.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was being hopeful. ;-)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Whoever is putting forward a theory of mind should be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; able to explain how the mathematics they use to describe it relates to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mind.  For example, duality relates things pairwise.  I'm now imagining a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pink elephant.  What is the physical thing dual to that imagining?  If you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some pattern of neuron activity in my brain, I'd say that's a good
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hypothesis.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The information structure is the dual to the &quot;physical thing&quot;.
<br />
Information is &quot;not&quot; physical, but does require some physical structure to
<br />
interact with other information. This is what Pratt meant when he points out
<br />
that Cartesian dualism and the monist hypothesis have a problem when trying
<br />
to consistently explain how bodies interact with bodies and minds with other
<br />
minds.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me back up my argument that Information is *not* physical.
<br />
Information is the &quot;stuff&quot; of representations.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To begin let me point out that the claim that information is physical
<br />
implies, unassailably, that for each and every physical state there is *at
<br />
most* one datum (let us assume that this datum is the Kolmogoroff string)
<br />
associated with it because the relationship between object and . This
<br />
implication is contradicted by basic facts: Given any physical object, there
<br />
is *at least* one representation of the object.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object, when considered in terms of its states, that has only one
<br />
possible representation is a strange object indeed, Kolmogoroff's argument
<br />
notwithstanding, because there are more than one symbolic system (grammar -
<br />
contra Chomsky!) that can be used in the representation and there is more
<br />
than one way that the symbolic representation can be arranged (semantics).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This points us to the conclusion that it is a mistake to assume that
<br />
information &quot;bits&quot; and physical states, which are the &quot;stuff&quot; of physical
<br />
objects, are one and the same and thus to the need of an alternative.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [BM]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But then why should I not regard the neural activity as the physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correlate of the imagining, &quot;weak dualism&quot; as the author (Cassiel Sophia?)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you cite below denominates it.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am proposing that there is a &quot;physical correlate&quot; of the information
<br />
aspect of the &quot;imagining&quot;, but in a way that is different from Sophia's.
<br />
BTW, I pasted that link as a way to present some background not as an
<br />
advocation of his thesis.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;    If we consider minds and bodies, not in terms of *static substances*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; but in terms of the transformations that their existence entails, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; nature of the duality that Pratt explains is both obvious and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; unavoidable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; As to its predictiveness,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; let me point out that it solves the epiphenomena problem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of both mental and material monism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [BM]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Pratt says that there is no direct interaction between physical events,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they are always mediated by a common mental event (and vice versa).  So
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; how does carbon get produced in the Sun?  Is God thinking about about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; atoms so they can interact?
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, let's be clever and throw out a challenge in the form of a very
<br />
complex situation and then wait for a misstatement in the reply to be a
<br />
counterpoint in your favor. Is this Rhetoric 101 practice or a discussion?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to try to answer the point about &quot;no direct interaction&quot;; that is
<br />
the meat of Pratt's thesis. What he points out is that direct interaction
<br />
requires that both of the entities involved share a common substrate such
<br />
that they can exchange substances. This is the basic assumption in physics
<br />
for the past 2,000 years, but contains a contradiction that has been
<br />
overlooked: that substances must have all of their properties a priori
<br />
specified.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This assumption is at the heart of classical determinism and only since
<br />
the advent of QM has it begun to be questioned. The problem that it entails
<br />
for any notion of interaction is that it makes it impossible to consider
<br />
information in anything other than the same a priori specified way.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This a priori specificity is not problematic if and only if one never
<br />
considers exactly how to represent time and related transitivity in one's
<br />
ontology. IMHO, the paradox that appears when noting that there is a
<br />
distinction between the &quot;past&quot; state of an object and its possible &quot;future&quot;
<br />
state. Classical determinism would have us believe that the relationship
<br />
between states at t_1 and t_2 are strictly reversible and thus representable
<br />
by bijective maps between them. The problem with such, even before we get to
<br />
QM, is that it gives us no explanation of the origin of thermodynamic
<br />
entropy.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are proposing hypothesis about the nature of the Universe we must
<br />
be very careful that the hypothesis does not contradict itself!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the theory of properties of objects are required to be a priori
<br />
specified or just pre-specifiable (ala the Universe is a Turing Machine
<br />
idea), then there must be some consistent way to account for how the
<br />
specific properties of states obtain such that we have a predictive model
<br />
that is faithful to our experience and experimental evidence.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know now, from such experiments as the delay choice experiment, EPR,
<br />
and others, that is it inconsistent to assume a priori specifiability! Given
<br />
this falsification of the hypothesis we are in need for alternatives. Pratt
<br />
offers one such alternative. If we are going to seriously consider the
<br />
question as to how carbon is produced in the sun we do not have to add more
<br />
to the current model that exists, we only need to look carefully at how the
<br />
amplitudes of the wavefunctions involved evolve.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pratt's model is completely consistent with QM formalism and, no, does
<br />
not require any kind of &quot;God thinking about it&quot; for it to happen. You seem
<br />
to be conflating your own straw dog argumentatives about what dualism is
<br />
with Pratt's account. It may be safe to claim that you did not understand
<br />
the content of his paper at all.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [BM]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That at least I can understand.  And since I can understand it, I can see
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that it is full of holes.  First, Sophia preemptorily dismisses idealism;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I've heard a much better defense of idealism than the one he provides of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dualism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Second, he assumes a false dichotomy between determinism and free will.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dennett has done a good job of explicating the compatibilist position in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Elbow Room&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not my job to defend Sophia and I will not waste my time trying.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Third, Sophia, mischaracterizes mind-brain identity &quot;Be that as it may,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our present point of view we can take it as just another affirmation of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; weak
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dualism, the dualism which denies any autonomy whatsoever to mind.&quot;  This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'weak
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dualism' could just as well be regarded as denying autonomy to the brain.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain, as matter in a physical state, doesn't constitute a mind - only a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as the substrate of a physical process constitutes a mind.  I see no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; looking at a process as something more than the elements involved.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sophia cites the zombie planet as a refutation of WD; but it is more of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem for dualism.  Under WD a zombie is impossible - the &quot;epiphenomena&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consequence of the phenomena.  He says, &quot;For an epiphenomenalist, it can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only a brute fact that consciousness supervenes when the cortex of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appropriately innervated. There is no conceivable reason why this should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happen
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for it serves no purpose that would favour it from an evolutionary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; standpoint.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But what account can a dualist give of this?  Why doesn't mind enter into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relation with matter when the matter consists of a dog, or a cucumber, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rock.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then he makes some more fallacious characterizations of weak dualism:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Nothing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whatsoever that makes a difference to what goes on in the real world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; follows
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from the supervenience of the mental upon the cerebral.&quot;  In WD, mind is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; supervenience; the neural processes constitute the thoughts - as voters
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; voting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constitute an election.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; He continues, &quot;We might just as well have evolved, therefore, as totally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; insentient automata. Thus, when we ourselves design artificial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intelligence,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; however sophisticated, we do not reckon on their becoming conscious.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Actually, we *do* reckon on AI machines being conscious to whatever degree
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we design them to be.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  See John McCarthy (the father of AI) website.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pratt's proposal does not seem to argue against AI at all. In fact, the
<br />
roots of his work are in Computer Science and the &quot;mechanism&quot; that he uses
<br />
in his dualism would work the same for any kind of system.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sophia also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seems to have forgotten his earlier observation that consciousness is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sporadic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and cannot be more than a small part of mind.  Now he is arguing as if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness is the whole of mind.  Having the inner narrative of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness is not at all inexpicable on evolutionary grounds; consider
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Julian Janes &quot;The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bicameral
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mind&quot; as well as John McCarthy's explanation of why we wouldn't want to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; give much consciousness to a robot.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  WD has the advantage of explaining why we have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no conscious memories prior to a certain age that happens to correlate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with beginning to learn language.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It explains why we lose memories due to concussion and brain lesions.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That does not conflict with Pratt's thesis! The correlation between
<br />
brain state and mind event that he proposes is such that the physical
<br />
aspects constrain its dual; there is no separate and independent
<br />
&quot;disembodied
<br />
spirit&quot; here!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [BM]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sophia's &quot;argument&quot; against WD based on 'free-will' isn't even an honest
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argument.  It's like arguing that we can't give up the idea of a flat
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; earth because it will make navigation impossible.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not see that discussion. Thank you for pointing it out.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's obvious that Sophia's heart is really with the psi.  He refers to,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;...accumulating experimental evidence of high quality,...&quot;  Something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only a true believer could swallow.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  After at least sixty years of scientific attempts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to discover psi, it remains a ephemeral as ever.  It's always there until
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you look carefully and the more controls the less the effect.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That disabuse of psi assumes that the mechanical model (of mind) is
<br />
correct! I confess to being sanguine about the understanding of psi, if only
<br />
because I have had my own experiences with it and have close friends that
<br />
are deeply involved with physics that have as well. Does 1st person
<br />
experience make one a &quot;true believer&quot;? Whatever...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [BM]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; By the way, do you mind if we take this back to the everything-list?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maybe someone there can explain Pratt for me.
