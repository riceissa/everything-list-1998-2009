<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Im dont know. Im in two minds now. I think my own objection to Sam Johnsons 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'refutation' is based on a very strict definition of knowledge which entails 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some notion of certainty. To be only 99% certain is not enough on this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definition to know something. Its a little sceptical isnt it? We lock people 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; away on a weaker definition that that. We dont require certainty to inhibit 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; someones freedom, why then in philosophy or science?
</em><br />
<br />*Certainty* is a bug-a-boo. It is a great and dreadful siren call
<br />
that must be ignored.  Certainty does not exist.  All our claims
<br />
are only conjectural. While it may be argued that for each of
<br />
us Descartes' &quot;I think therefore I am&quot; is pretty certain, it
<br />
just doesn't carry much information and is kind of useless.
<br />
<br />Have you studied any PCR?  That is, &quot;Pan-Critical Rationalism&quot;?
<br />
A number of us here would highly recommend it. It really seems 
<br />
to be the best overall philosophy. It's powered by the single
<br />
most powerful idea in science, evolution.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Beyond the impressive and dazzling display of mathematics here and beyond 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Berkley's almost pathological suspicion of perceptual inference, any theory 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that denies extension is deeply unintuitive. Clearly the onus is on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Idealists - of whatever ilk - to present an explanation of non - extended 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; extension that makes some sense, rather than just make the mind boggle. It 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does feel sometimes as though Idealists are sophists tinkering with logic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more than reality - how things could have been, rather than are.
</em><br />
<br />Well, that's how it *feels* to me too. Unfortunately, if things could
<br />
be *proven*, then either the realists or the idealists would have given
<br />
up centuries ago. Sure, sometimes the advocates in one camp or the other
<br />
really are ignorant, or you can show that there are some facts that as
<br />
individuals they've really not taken into account in their thinking.
<br />
But abandon all hope that any philosophical movement can be shown to
<br />
be incorrect.
<br />
<br />This is not to say that progress is impossible. Consider an idea
<br />
like Aditya has:  what is the real difference between an event
<br />
and an observer-moment?  In trying to answer that question, many
<br />
of us may learn something (at least for our own purposes).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why, I feel like asking, would the cause of my perceptions be so different 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from the picture of the world effected?
</em><br />
<br />I guess you mean &quot;what could cause my perceptions that would
<br />
be different from the picture of the world influenced or affected?&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Doesnt it make more sense to say that the world appears extended,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; material and not 'ideal' because that is in fact how it is, there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; must be a symmetry between what is perceived and what causes those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perceptions even if we can not probe that symmetry to any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; satisfaction?
</em><br />
<br />Yeah, I'd say so. &quot;The *fact* that the world is material&quot; is
<br />
a wonderful first approximation, and I heartily endorse it.
<br />
Of course, Eternal Truth #2 intercedes (&quot;every statement must
<br />
be further modified&quot;) and so it has to be qualified.
<br />
<br />First, it's not a fact, really. We're best off to *regard*
<br />
it as a fact, of course, for many reasons (chiefly because
<br />
you don't go to jail when you fail to pay your bills, etc.).
<br />
But it could be that we're just processes within some
<br />
unimaginable substrate.  E.g., we could be computer
<br />
simulations.  But I expect you know all this.
<br />
<br />Second, it's so *close* to being a fact, given our theories
<br />
of physics, that every other alternative I know of pales
<br />
into improbable (but not impossible) insignificance. Even
<br />
if we were a computer simulation, for example, chances are
<br />
very good that MWI is true, and that sometime somewhen
<br />
there really was a good old Milky Way galaxy with versions
<br />
of us in it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Im not sure that a realist would be happy by transcendental 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argument like that, but it makes a little sense to me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps there is something in Sam Johnson's quip afterall.
</em><br />
<br />Well, *this* realist finds it palatable, (if it turns out that
<br />
it's really right to call me a realist, I guess it is).
<br />
<br />Lee
