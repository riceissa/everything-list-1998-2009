This is a continuation of the &quot;Indescribable merde&quot; thread, title which I had enough
<br />
of.
<br />
<br />In my previous post I explained how a purely deterministic universe ( a state machine)
<br />
could not have any branching. Transitions represented in phase space would appear to
<br />
be lines that never cross. If two lines join, then they stay joined for ever, since
<br />
there is no mechanism for splitting them. Indeed if such a splitting mechanism did
<br />
exist, then it would have to be indeterminate or &quot;outside&quot; this universe. Once this
<br />
universe gets into a loop, then it stays in that loop for ever.
<br />
<br />Bruno Marchal has explored the concept of first person indeterminacy by means of what
<br />
we may call the &quot;Star Trek&quot; transporter. If the transporter operates such that a
<br />
person (Bruno)  is transported from  Brussels to both Moscow and Washington, in effect
<br />
creating two copies, then, from the first person point of view, he argues, there is
<br />
indeterminacy in so far as the final destination is concerned.
<br />
<br />How can that indeterminacy be reconciled with the idea of keeping the universe purely
<br />
deterministic which preclude the possibility of indeterminacy?
<br />
<br />I believe that the solution to this paradox lies in the fact that the transporter is
<br />
not perfect. In fact, it is the transporter that generates the indetermincy. Here is
<br />
why.
<br />
<br />If the transporter was perfect, then,  obviously,  the copies would have to be
<br />
perfect. This means they would have to include all their extensions which includes
<br />
clothing, close environments and far environments. To be rigorous, let's say that all
<br />
the environment withing a light cone of the observer is reproduced by the transporter
<br />
such that no information can possibly be lost.
<br />
<br />Such a transporter feat would have to transform at the speed of light,  both
<br />
Washington  and Moscow, and make them in the image of Brussels. I am not sure if this
<br />
enormous feat of civil engineering would be welcome, but this is besides the point.
<br />
Now, with this extended transporter operation,  the copies being transported to the
<br />
new Washington and the new Moscow would have no way of knowing that they are still not
<br />
in Brussels!  In fact, one could argue that from their point of view, the transporter
<br />
has not worked and they are still in Brussels. Therefore, from the first person point
<br />
of view, there is no indeterminacy!
<br />
<br />Therefore, it appears that the only way to generate indeterminacy, even first person
<br />
indeterminacy,  in a deterministic universe, is to allow the definition of a person's
<br />
consciousness to be fuzzy. Bruno's assumption that indeterminacy can be deduced from
<br />
COMP is faulty. It may be that indeterminacy is a fundamental, rather than derived
<br />
property of consciousness. It may be that it is an anthropically imposed property and
<br />
necessary condition for consciousness.
