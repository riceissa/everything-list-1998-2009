RE: Gill Jannes - <a href="http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/0904/0904.0867v1.pdf">http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/0904/0904.0867v1.pdf</a>
<br />
<br />It's strange how cracks in the received view emerge and propagate. The 
<br />
issues in this paper are exactly the issues that lead to my construction 
<br />
of the 'Dual Aspect Science' paper, which I have tried to attach to this 
<br />
email[1]. The Jannes words that stand out for me:
<br />
<br />= = = = = = = = = = = = = =
<br />
(b) Page 9. &quot;Thinking of the relata as the concrete objects that we 
<br />
encounter from *experience or observation*, and their relations as 
<br />
structures described by human-independent abstract mathematics, is a 
<br />
serious oversimplification, as illustrated by my third argument.&quot;
<br />
= = = = = = = = = = = = = =
<br />
<br />Yes yes yes! Serious indeed. The solution to the conundrum is literally 
<br />
the Dual Aspect Science (DAS) framework. The framework isolates the 
<br />
reality of existing empirical science (all of it, as we currently 
<br />
inhabit it) as:
<br />
<br />(i) intrinsically and systematically conflating scientific measurement 
<br />
with scientific observation. _It is even in the Jannes quote above. 
<br />
EXPERIENCE &lt;IS&gt; OBSERVATION._ Literally!
<br />
(ii) erecting extra belief systems 'about' the laws thus created
<br />
(iii) trying to get at a (i) version of a 'theory of everything' (TOE) 
<br />
by assuming that there is one, single one of these to be got from our 
<br />
position inside the described system.
<br />
(iv) Systematically constructing TOEs that are theories of everything 
<br />
EXCEPT scientists and scientific observation and then deciding that is 
<br />
'everything', rather than merely 'everything that such a theory can 
<br />
predict'.
<br />
(v) The existence of a pre-perceptual universe is also mistaken for a 
<br />
universe without a scientist in it!
<br />
<br />This I find very frustrating. A description of a pre-perceptual universe 
<br />
is easy to construct. All you have to do is postulate that the universe 
<br />
is made of an ambiguous structural primitive, say X_stuff, and then stop 
<br />
making that an identity with the 'stuff' revealed by an observer made of 
<br />
X_stuff, within the described system of X_stuff. The description of :
<br />
<br />(a) relating _non-unique_ X_stuff (that can create an observer of 
<br />
X_stuff's appearances)
<br />
and
<br />
(b) the _non-unique_ descriptions of  Jannes'   &quot;concrete objects that 
<br />
we encounter from experience or observation&quot;
<br />
<br />_do not have to be the same description_. Currently we do (b) only 
<br />
(Single-Aspect Science = SAS). Neither (a) nor (b) need be assumed 
<br />
unique. Nor are we justified in forcing of (a) = (b) or (a) = 
<br />
impossible.  We need to get over ourselves as revealers of the single 
<br />
ultimate truth....this, in its worst light - is religion. This is our 
<br />
biggest problem. The rot set in when quantum mechanics became a religion 
<br />
in the early 20th century.
<br />
<br />(a) and (b) are two completely separate but intimately enmeshed/mutually 
<br />
consistent but non-unique descriptions of which (b) is customised to the 
<br />
(HUMAN) observer. To an alien observer with a different observational 
<br />
capacity: (b) would be the same and (a) would be different. However, 
<br />
both human and alien would be equally predictive! Both human and alien 
<br />
are made of the same (a) stuff.
<br />
<br />Why do we continually conflate explanation with description and elevate 
<br />
them both beyond a status as merely having predictive utility?
<br />
Why do we continually fantasise about realities as mathematics or some 
<br />
other 'ism-made-real?
<br />
What is so wrong with describing an underlying reality?
<br />
Why do we insist we are outside the system we describe from within, when 
<br />
the situation literally defines how we describe it?
<br />
<br />The attached DAS framework solves all these issues with a 100% 
<br />
empirically testable outcome. DAS puts together 02 completely separate 
<br />
sets of 'laws of nature'. The existing one (T)  is is appearances 
<br />
explored as grammar.  The new one (T') is structure explored with 
<br />
automata. The upgrade SAS =&gt; DAS is seamless. Nothing is lost. SAS laws 
<br />
remain intact. _Both are  equally empirically supported by the evidence 
<br />
system: human P-consciousness_. The T' set explains P-consciousness. You 
<br />
need zero extra belief systems. You need zero philosophy (what I 
<br />
reluctantly call metaphysics). Indeed you can completely abandon 
<br />
consideration of all 'isms as '/interesting but predictively inert/'.
<br />
<br />The big RUB? You have to accept that the universe is fundamentally 
<br />
unknowable at some level - or 100% knowable only in an 
<br />
asymptotically/limiting condition fashion. Physicists have to 'get over' 
<br />
the idea of a one-stop-shop TOE. The good bit? You finally get to truly 
<br />
explain things (in a causal necessity sense) - instead of merely 
<br />
describing them and then believing you have explained.
<br />
<br />For those interested... the DAS work may be viewed as a rework of 
<br />
Bohmian implicate/explicate order, where I have extended 'hidden 
<br />
variables' to include EVERYTHING (as an underlying structure). The 
<br />
underlying structure is separately described and joined, not merely with 
<br />
a neat seam with existing quantum mechanics (via quantum potentials), - 
<br />
but joined with the rest of science through the prediction of an 
<br />
observer who sees a universe behaving (b)-ly. The 'hidden variables' are 
<br />
literally the underlying structure (yes, a real living, scientifically 
<br />
tractable pre-perceptual noumenon) - which is described using 
<br />
CRUTCHFIELD style automata, not grammar.
<br />
<br />Stare at the automata = structure aspect.
<br />
Be inside the automata = appearance aspect
<br />
<br />Two aspects.
<br />
