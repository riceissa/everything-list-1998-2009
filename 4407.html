<br />
With regard to the question of the significance or impact of the MWI,
<br />
this is where Wei Dai's emphasis on the importance of decision theory
<br />
comes in.  The question is, are there things we would rationally do
<br />
differently if we knew that all possible worlds existed, things that
<br />
would be irrational in a single universe?
<br />
<br />In a single-world model we have uncertainty about the world we live in,
<br />
its past, present and future.  This can be captured by a probability
<br />
distribution over possible worlds.  We then use that probability
<br />
distribution to make our decisions.  But in a many-worlds model, we
<br />
also have a probability distribution over possible worlds, and we would
<br />
also use that probability distribution to make decisions.  Given this
<br />
similarity, are there cases where we would rationally decide differently
<br />
in the many-worlds universe than in the single-world universe?
<br />
<br />Wei explored some possibilities along these lines in his postings
<br />
in mid 2002.  One such situation could be demonstrated with a simple
<br />
thought experiment.  Suppose you are going to flip a coin, and you will
<br />
be given a piece of fruit as a result, either an apple or an orange.
<br />
Also suppose that beforehand you can decide which kind of fruit you will
<br />
be given for each of the two possible coin flip outcomes: for example,
<br />
you could receive an orange on heads and an apple on tails, or any of
<br />
the other three possibilities.  Let us also suppose that you like both
<br />
fruits but slightly prefer apples to oranges.
<br />
<br />Conventional decision theory is designed to handle exactly this sort
<br />
of situation.  According to those principles, you would act to maximize
<br />
your expected utility.  Since you get more utility from an apple than
<br />
from an orange, and the coin flip has a 50-50 chance of coming up
<br />
heads or tails, your expected utility is maximized by specifying that
<br />
you will get an apple whether the coin falls heads or tails.  This is
<br />
very obvious even without being expressed in the mathematical form that
<br />
decision theory uses.
<br />
<br />Wei suggested that in the context of a many-worlds universe (not just
<br />
the quantum MWI but even for a broader set of possibilities), you might
<br />
not make this same decision.  You know that when the coin flips, the
<br />
universe is going to effectively branch and both possibilities are going
<br />
to be actualized.  Let us suppose that in addition to slightly preferring
<br />
apples to oranges, you have a strong value preference for diversity.
<br />
You like variety and you dislike having everything the same everywhere.
<br />
In that case, you might rationally choose to receive an apple on heads
<br />
but an orange on tails.  While this slightly reduces your average
<br />
pleasure level in terms of tasting the fruit, this could be more than
<br />
compensated by your increased pleasure at knowing that you are enjoying
<br />
diverse experiences in the two worlds.
<br />
<br />So here is an example where belief in multiple worlds could lead a
<br />
rational person to behave differently than belief in a single world.
<br />
For this effect to occur, I think our preferences in the many-worlds
<br />
case have to depend on relations between the worlds, rather than
<br />
independently on conditions in each world.  We're not just acting to
<br />
maximize the expected outcome in each world averaged across all of them,
<br />
we're acting to maximize the utility of the &quot;big picture&quot;, the entire
<br />
set of worlds affected by our acts, considered as a whole.  To the extent
<br />
that a whole is more than the sum of its parts, actions in a multiverse
<br />
model may justifiably be different than in a single universe.
<br />
