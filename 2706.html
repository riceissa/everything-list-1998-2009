<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;You'll have to define what &quot;effectively decide&quot; means and how to apply 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that concept generally. (Have you introduced it before? I think this is the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;first time I've seen it.)
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should have mentioned this _explicitly_ last time but you're linking 
<br />
the 'effectively' to the wrong word.  It goes to show the disadvantages of 
<br />
conversing by email, since this little misunderstanding of phrase seems to 
<br />
have been inflated into a big issue :)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said he 'would effectively decide his own fate'.  I meant he 'would 
<br />
decide a fate that is effectively his own'.  So, really, I never used the 
<br />
term 'effectively decide' as a linked phrase, but rather 'effectively ... 
<br />
his own'.  Meaning just that the amount of fate he decides has the same 
<br />
measure he does and is of the same type 'he' would evolve into.  Hence ...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     I thought the meaning to be obvious in this context.  The simplest 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interpretation of your little experiment is that whatever fraction of him 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;push a particular button, is the same fraction of him that end up with the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;corresponding payoff.  That's how I always interpreted it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     If the measure of him is the same for the 2nd round as for after 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;both rounds, then it's the same as if each copy gets to influence its own 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;payoff.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(The above was clearly not enough to tell you what I meant, even though 
<br />
I really _thought_ it would be, so I explicitly did so above, now.  Of 
<br />
course, who knows what you'll read into the new wording ...)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;In my original message I never talked about multiple copies in round 2. I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;was assuming that there would be just one copy in each round, but the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;measures of the copies would be different. You were the one who brought up 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the idea of 1 copy in round 1, and 100 copies in round 2 (presumably the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;measures of the copies are the same) as an analogy. I tried to work with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;your analogy, but here it seems to break down.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I actually said was &quot;You might see this better by thinking of 
<br />
measure as the # of copies of him in operation.&quot;  For me that's not just an 
<br />
analogy, although the number can of course be infinite (with the way to take 
<br />
the limit to be specified).  That's basically my definition of &quot;measure&quot;.  
<br />
(Where I use different implementation-mappings to define the &quot;copies&quot;.)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course people often use a more generalized notion of &quot;measure&quot;, which 
<br />
I can play along with for hypothetical purposes.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;Suppose in round 2 he gets the $-9 payoff if any of the copies decide 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to push button 1. Intuitvely, each copy affects the fate of every other 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;copy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     Now you're changing the game.  And it is a game, since as you said 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;yourself, each guy affects the others.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Again, I was trying to follow your analogy. But really what I have in mind 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is that in round 2 there is just one copy, which just affects itself.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is just one copy, we must ask why the measure would be greater. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;At first glance it would seem that this argument of yours could actually 
<br />
help me against those who would want to decouple the notions of &quot;measure&quot; 
<br />
and &quot;# of implementations&quot;, since indeed it would not make sense for the 
<br />
expected utility of choosing 1 to be greater, and my way it clearly isn't.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I doubt it is that easy.  First, technically one should not 
<br />
assume a priori that consciousness is the same as decision-making.  
<br />
Therefore, there is no reason the measure distribution of consciousness 
<br />
should really come into decision-making at all.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, suppose the guy has a magic switch on top of his head, 
<br />
which can be set to 0 or 1, and that his measure is equal to the value of 
<br />
the switch.  Assume he can't tell what position it's in.  For round 1 the 
<br />
switch will be set to 0, while for round 2 it's set to 1.  (This is a slight 
<br />
extension of your experiment.)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should he assume that he must be in round 2?  If so the zombie in round 
<br />
1 will also assume that.  So, overall, he would have been better off if he 
<br />
decided in advance that he would always push button 2, instead of trying to 
<br />
decide during the experiment.  That won't do.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the solution is that one must define a &quot;decision measure&quot; and 
<br />
this will always be equal to the number of copies.  The zombie in round 1 
<br />
gets equal weight because it is a computer making a decision.  The computers 
<br />
should act as though the Bayesian probability of being one type of computer 
<br />
or the other is based on that.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, it does not prove that they are equally conscious.  Indeed, for the 
<br />
latter purpose the guy should _believe_ he is in round 2, even though he 
<br />
shouldn't _act_ as if he is.  And that's because *he can't* act.  _Bodies_ 
<br />
act, _not minds_.  The zombie in round one will say to himself &quot;I am 
<br />
conscious and in round 2&quot;, but luckily his error will not be experienced by 
<br />
a conscious being and that's the point.  A similar argument goes if he just 
<br />
has low measure.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless, that is, you believe in reductive computationalism, like me!  
<br />
Then there can be no zombies.  Do you think my above defense of the zombie / 
<br />
near-zombie concept is plausible?  I hope not, but it's what I would expect 
<br />
to see from dualists or (with a related experiment) furstpursunasts, so it's 
<br />
better to put it out there myself ...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     Who isn't? :)  I admit it's not a perfect model, though.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Why have this model at all? What's the advantage?
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a good approximation in many situations.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     Unlikely.  First, there may be no maximum of f.  For example, f 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;could be proportional to the depth of the thought (roughly, the age the guy 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;seems to be) as well as to a &quot;happiness&quot; factor.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;A genie comes to you and says he can grant you any wish, if you agree to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;first being tortured for a year. Would you accept? What if there is only 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;10% probability that he will grant you the wishes? 1%? .1%?  If there is no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;maximum of f for you, then you would agree no matter how small the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probability is or how long the torture lasts, since you would just wish for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a thought that has a sufficiently high utility that even after being 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;multiplied by that probability is still larger than the disutility of being 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;tortured.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's called a career in academic physics :(
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Do you think this is reasonable?
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It might be.  You'd have a similar situation with _any_ unbounded 
<br />
utility function.  And a bounded one seems pretty bad.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     Second, it is unlikely that his resources would be such that doing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;so would maximize the utility.  Even if they are, it doesn't seem so 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;strange that he would want to relive his happiest moment.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But it is strange that he would value each re-simulation of his happiest 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;moment as much as the original moment. For example, a person who has a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;utility function in the form you described would be indifferent between 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;running a re-simulation of a past sexual experience and having a new sexual 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;experience. Obviously genes that cause this kind of preferences are not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;going to be evolutionarily successful, and we shouldn't expect that most 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;people have these kinds of utility functions or will have them in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;future.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Running simulations has not been an option during the time in which man 
<br />
evolved, so that is not an argument against such utility functions being 
<br />
common now.  Masturbation while thinking of the past is definately not the 
<br />
same.
