I apologize to the group for my last outburst.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; us how you really feel.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         Judging by the reaction to my sugar coating - which it WAS -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; maybe that wouldn't be such a good idea.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;      But consider this:  Is the branch in which you win the lottery not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; already occupied?  How will it profit this lottery winner if you, finding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; yourself in another branch, kill yourself?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;You seem to be using the model where state reduction is a process of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;differentiation of pre-existing universes, rather than the actual forking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;of a single universe into multiple daughter universes.  But neither
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;approach is inherently superior to the other.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Even in your model, where all (future) &quot;branches&quot; are already occupied,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;many branches are completely identical prior to differentiation.  It is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;reasonable to consider your &quot;identity&quot; or &quot;consciousness&quot; as being common
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;to all of these branches.  You are not living in just one of them,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;you span all of the identical ones.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         I guess that depends on the definition of 'you'.  It sure doesn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seem reasonable that I'm living in a branch where I won the lotto.  I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't remember doing that.  Some other guy did that who's almost like me.
</em><br />
<br />No, *exactly* like me.  That's the whole point.  For every &quot;me&quot;, if you
<br />
buy that &quot;everything exists&quot; (which I assume you do, since you're a
<br />
member of this list, but I don't know if I've read you explicitly
<br />
state it) then consider &quot;me&quot; as being the configuration of atoms,
<br />
particles,
<br />
wave states, whatever, bounded by some space, say the external layer of
<br />
my
<br />
skin.  For each me, there are an infinite number of universes outside of
<br />
&quot;me&quot;.  Some in which I did win the lottery, and others in which I
<br />
didn't.
<br />
<br />Hal was saying, and I agree with him, that it makes no sense to talk of
<br />
&quot;me&quot; as being one particular &quot;instance&quot; of that configuration so
<br />
defined.
<br />
How could it be that I am one of those, and not one of the others?  Each
<br />
one is identical.  It's a fundamental feature of QM is that for two
<br />
identical particles, it is not possible to track one or the other over
<br />
time.  Let me know if you need me to explain this to you.  It definitely
<br />
applies, in this argument.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;      Your belief that you will magically leap into the body of this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; winner, at the same date and time as you die, is absurd.  You guys take
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; one true fact - that the effective probability of finding yourself to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; that winning guy, given that you find the date and time to be such and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; such, and that your name is such and such, etc. - is nearly one.  But you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; don't understand what it means and you sure as hell don't use it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; correctly, and the result is this monstrous quantum cult of death.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; With the concept of identity I described, or the concept of a universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; which branches at the time of state function collapse, there is no leap
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; involved.  It is a continuous process.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         Wrong.  It makes no difference if you assume that worlds branch.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Off topic note: When did the term 'collapse' start applying to the MWI?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Last I heard the MWI was the antithesis of that.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         Think of it from the point of view of the guy who won the lottery.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If the other branches commit suicide, can he then say &quot;I wouldn't be here
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; otherwise, I'd be in another branch&quot;?  Of course not.  He would still have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; been there and is totally unaffected by what goes on in the other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; branches.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         As far as continuous, don't forget that it is not the selection of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the lottery numbers that kills you.  It's what happens after that, after
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the branching already occurred a macroscopic time ago.  You know you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; didn't win and that death is coming, but you still think you can leap to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the other distant branch.  Not very continuous.
</em><br />
<br />Well, you misunderstood the device.  The death is completely automatic,
<br />
and completely outside the user's control.  There's never an instant
<br />
when he knows he will die.  That's a fundamental feature of the machine.
<br />
<br />But I'm sure you'll object that anyway, macroscopic events have still
<br />
taken place which prevent me from jumping to another universe, from
<br />
which mine has already split.  But here I disagree.  I never like
<br />
discussions of QM where talk degenerates into discussions of the
<br />
difference between microscopic and macroscopic phenomena.  It seems
<br />
to me, as I've tried to point out in other recent posts, that the
<br />
entire &quot;rest of the universe&quot;, that I'm not looking at right now,
<br />
must be in a superposition of states.
<br />
<br />What's the qualitative difference between saying that a photon went
<br />
through both slits when I wasn't looking, and, say, that the cat is
<br />
both dead and alive until I look in the box?  That's the whole
<br />
beauty of MWI - that there is no distinction necessary between
<br />
macroscopic and microscopic.  So, let's take it one step further,
<br />
and say that everything I'm not looking at now is in a superposition
<br />
of states.
