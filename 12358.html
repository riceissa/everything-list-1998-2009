<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; that humans succumb often to wishful thinking, and still more often to

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; If you are not sure of any clear meaning of the personal God being the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; source of everything, including of course truth, this entails not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; knowing the other things too.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is that not an authoritative argument?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What if I ask to my student an exam question like give me an argument
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; why the square root of 3 is irrationnal. Suppose he gives me the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correct and convincing usual (mathematical) proof. I could give him a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bad note for not adding: &quot;and I know that is the truth because truth is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a gift by God&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Cute, I can directly give bad notes to all my students, and this will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; give me more time to find a falsity in your way to reason ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />Just to clear this up, my above statement was not meant to be an
<br />
argument. I purposefully used the word &quot;entail&quot; rather than &quot;imply&quot;.  I
<br />
wasn't saying that you cannot believe in some kind of truth without
<br />
believing in the personal God.  However is makes sense *from my
<br />
perspective* (of belief in the personal God) that you do not have a
<br />
basis for any truth on which personhood can be based, which *from my
<br />
perspective* (which I *have* been arguing for in general) needs more
<br />
than the impersonal core.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The card records facts. To judge them historical is already beyond my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; competence. Why the bible? Why not &quot;the question of king Milinda&quot; ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />My approach on the Everything List has been to argue for the necessity
<br />
of the personal God as the ultimate basis for Everything.  If someone
<br />
wants to research the historical record sufficiently to convince
<br />
themselves one way or another about the Bible or Jesus' resurrection,
<br />
that's great, and I can give them some sources, but it's probably too
<br />
contingent for this List.  But I do have response to your comment on
<br />
universal-ness below.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; My whole argument is that without it our hope eventually runs out and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; we are left with despair, unless we lie to ourselves against the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; absence of hope.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here Stathis already give a genuine comment. You are just admitting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your argument is &quot;wishful thinking&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />I was being too poetic ;)  By &quot;despair&quot; I meant nihilism, the belief
<br />
that there ultimately is no meaning.  I am arguing that the ultimate
<br />
source of meaning has to be personal.  I'm just saything that my
<br />
argument is of the form, &quot;If meaning is not ultimately based on the
<br />
personal God, then there is no true meaning, because...&quot;
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; By &quot;these words&quot; I was referring to the John quote from the Bible.  The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; actual fulfillment was Jesus (the Word/Logos).  He spanned the infinite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; gap, like you said above, perhaps analogous to hypercomputation,...all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in one step.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Note that most notion of hypercomputation does not make it possible to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; escape the G/G* logics, and when they do escape it, the price is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; abandon of personhood.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is a general argument which is independent of the comp hypothesis:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to escape the G/G* (and the related hypostases) you have to &quot;abandon&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your self or the person-hood (personal-ness I would like to say).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />I agree I was too loose in my use of hypercomputation as an analogy.
<br />
Actually the direction of the &quot;spanning&quot; was downward, going from G*
<br />
(celestial) to G terrestial, described by the Greek work kenosis
<br />
(emptying).  This does not mean that God the Father (the personal
<br />
fulfillment of the first hypostase), or the Holy Spirit (...second
<br />
hypostase) discontinued to exist, but that the Logos became flesh and
<br />
dwelt among us, so that we could see his grace and truth.  Again, this
<br />
does not mean that we cannot believe and seek truth, and have a feeling
<br />
that we are on the right track, without a relationship with the
<br />
personal God.  This means that the ultimate source of all truth made
<br />
himself known to us on a human level and solved the problem of evil.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This is why Jesus was the Word, the Logos.  God simply shouting words
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; out of the sky or something would have this problem.  This is why I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; said that the incarnation was primary in God's communication to us.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK, but why not Nagarjuna instead? What is so special about Jesus
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (beside our culture) ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />Death itself is the ultimate effect of evil: separation/isolation from
<br />
everything and everyone.  Jesus proved his divinity by raising
<br />
*himself* from the dead.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; For any belief I have I try to figure out if I would have had that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; belief in completely different context. &quot;Jesus&quot; or &quot;Nagarjuna&quot; does not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; survive such a test. For example I would not have believed in Jesus in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the case I would have born in the time of Plato, nor would I believed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in Euler would I have born on a different planet, but it make sense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that I would have believed in the content of their message. This forces
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; us to make the argument the most universal possible, the less
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; culturally influenced.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />I am not saying that God's communication is an exhaustive communication
<br />
of all truth, i.e. all facts (scientific, historic, etc.) that it is
<br />
possible for us to know.  It was a message saying, &quot;I am here. I love
<br />
you. I am your source of meaning. Here is my hand to rescue you from
<br />
darkness/meaninglessness and death/isolation.  Your
<br />
meaning/relationships are actually, ultimately, based on something:
<br />
Me.&quot;
<br />
<br />I am not building an argument from the ground up to everything (see my
<br />
last comment below).  This thing has been handed down to me, I admit,
<br />
but it can be investigated by anyone interested.  So I can't make the
<br />
argument up the way I want it.
<br />
<br />Accordingly, regarding universal-ness, the personal God would have to
<br />
communicate this message to us with a means specific to this planet.
<br />
(I don't know what he has done for other planets.)  We would not really
<br />
be able to believe him if he did not become one of us (we would just
<br />
say, &quot;You don't know about my experience as a human&quot;).  To truly
<br />
communicate with a human, you have to be a human.  He became one human,
<br />
took on human death, and proved his divinity by raising himself from
<br />
death, and then the message was spread by those who believed in him.
<br />
<br />In a similar manner as &quot;I don't know about other planets&quot;, I would say
<br />
I ultimately don't know about other people (first person pov and all
<br />
that), what it means for them to believe in the personal God's love for
<br />
them.  All I know is the way I've heard it (Jesus being the personal
<br />
God's hand to us).  To try to worry and orchestrate how all of that
<br />
works for everyone would be going way above my competence.  But this
<br />
doesn't negate the truth of the personal God.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; How do you know? Are you willing to assume this clearly and build some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; axiomatization?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This follows from the acceptance of the personal God who is love (among
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the three Persons I outlined using the hypostases) independently of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; anyone/anything else.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In an axiomatization the meaning does not depend on the choice of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; words. Would your argument be palpable with axiomatic definition?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Do you know and accept Godel's axiomatisation of St-Anselme definition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of God?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />To the last question, yes.  However, I think that Godel's
<br />
axiomatization also applies to an impersonal god.  The axioms for a
<br />
personal God would have to include all three persons as I outlined with
<br />
the four hypostases.  This is for reasons similar to the reasoning of
<br />
the hypostases, with the added axiom that the ultimate One is personal
<br />
and that the three persons somehow communicate and love one another.
<br />
This is the basis on which there can be communication and love among
<br />
other persons.  In a way, communication and love are on a par with
<br />
truth on the ontological scale.  This is an important point.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I agree, words are not enough.  Here again, the primary communication
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of love was not words e.g. a command to love, but the actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; expression by the action of incarnation and giving his life and death.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In a story. I can appreciate symbolically.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you want Jesus playing a personal role in our 3-person approach,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just pray Him to make a 3-person communicable sign.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />This goes back to his death and resurrection, which opened up the way
<br />
again for our relationship with the personal God.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; I am not sure, because we can bet. We can make act of faith. We can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; learn from our mistakes, we can change our minds and still keeping
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; faith, faith corrected by reason and experiences can only grow. Only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;bad or wrong faith&quot; (generally based on wishful or fearful thinking)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; can fear to be &quot;corrected&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; A bit like it is more easy for a parent to &quot;punish&quot; his child when the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; parent &quot;truly&quot;  loves it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But this hope is without an ultimate basis.  Real hope has an ultimate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; basis.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; All the lobian point is that as far as the word &quot;real&quot; means something,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we cannot use it and still keep the scientific attitude (humility,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; modesty).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />This goes back to comp's taking arithmetic truth as the basis for
<br />
&quot;reality&quot;.  I am saying that this kind of truth is not broad enough for
<br />
Everything.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Knowledge is personal.  Without an ultimate personal basis, we cannot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; expect or hope for more, because we have nothing to begin with.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I make it plain that S4Grz1, alias the arithmetical first person (the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; solipsist topos of &quot;conscience &amp; m canisme), alias the third hypostase,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is a good candidate for the ultimate personal basis. Here you should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appreciate. In a way it vindicates both Nargarjuna and Jesus, with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; same proviso that their &quot;stories&quot; (Jesus resurection, Nagarjuna
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reincarnation) should not be taken literally (by adults).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />Yes, because for instance if Jesus' story is taken literally, and he
<br />
claimed to be the Son of God and proved it by raising himself from
<br />
death, then this would contradict the impersonal basis of comp.
<br />
<br />Also, Nagarjuna did not claim to be God in human form, and he did not
<br />
prove it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Again, the &quot;sacred text&quot; by itself is not sufficient.  The proof is in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; God's actual act of love toward us.  For us, love is expressed in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; meeting our need, which was our being lost and dead, separated (by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; evil, by definition) from truth, meaning and life.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You refer to personal things. If you are lucky enough to be blessed by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Love, it is ok, especially if it inspire you to work toward a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; communciable theory. But nobody can use such reference in a theory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Even, and I would say especially in a &quot;theological&quot; theory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />This is just my argument again: Without a personal God, we don't have a
<br />
basis for these personal things.  I am not trying to develop a theory
<br />
from the ground up (upward emanation).  My argument is just presenting
<br />
the problem and lack of solution, and then saying that the answer has
<br />
been given from the top down (downward emanation).  St. Paul reasoned
<br />
with the Greeks about the problem (meaninglessness, evil, etc.) in the
<br />
same way, and then simply proclaimed the &quot;good-news&quot; answer.  The only
<br />
way he could proclaim it from their context was by saying that he
<br />
noticed they had an altar with the inscription: TO AN UNKNOWN GOD.
<br />
This reminds me of the One or 0-person.  He then said, &quot;Now what you
<br />
worship as something unknown I am going to proclaim to you.&quot;  Then he
<br />
went on to tell them about the personal God.  You can read what he said
<br />
in Acts 17:24-31 here:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2017:22-31;&amp;version=31">http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2017:22-31;&amp;version=31</a>;
<br />
<br />In this configuration of Everything, our part is not to build
<br />
everything from the ground up (which is required if there is no one &quot;up
<br />
there&quot; to give us anything), but to just look at the evidence for what
<br />
God did to show us he exists and has solved our problem of inescapable
<br />
meaninglessness and death, and believe.
<br />
<br />This doesn't mean that, if we believe that God is our ultimate source
<br />
of meaning, we don't need to do anything for any purpose whatsoever.
<br />
On the contrary, it gives both *consistent* and *complete* meaning to
<br />
what we do and it takes away our need to spend our lives in fear of
<br />
meaninglessness and isolation/death.
