Dear Bruno,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First let me state that the reason that I am discussing this idea with
<br />
you is so that I can &quot;kill two birds with one stone&quot;. I would like to better
<br />
understand your thesis and would like to see how it accounts for or solves
<br />
the &quot;epiphenomenona&quot; problem so that I can evaluate a model that I am
<br />
working on.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     In <a href="http://www.cis.udel.edu/~case/self-ref.html">http://www.cis.udel.edu/~case/self-ref.html</a> we find a very

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;informative discussion of self-reference and the way that infinite

N -&gt;
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;N functions can completely capture physics and the exclusive usage of
</em><br />
Well
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;founded statements in mathematics, I propose to set them aside for the
</em><br />
sake
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;of a discussion.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have cut and pasted the exact words used:
<br />
<br />Machine Self-Reference
<br />
The robot pictured below has a transparent front and is facing an
<br />
(expandable) board, a little to its right, and a mirror, a little to its
<br />
left. It's transparent front enables it to see in the mirror its complete
<br />
underlying mechanism, flowchart, or program. The board serves for input,
<br />
output, and intermediate computations. Such a self-referential or
<br />
self-reflecting robot has data access, then, to a complete (low level) self
<br />
model.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />It is depicted already having copied onto the board a portion of its
<br />
``program'' (corrected for mirror reversal). Note that the robot's self copy
<br />
is projected externally to the robot itself. In this way infinite regress is
<br />
not required for the robot to have complete (low level) self knowledge. The
<br />
use this robot makes of its complete (low level) self knowledge is whatever
<br />
was built into it, but it could have been anything algorithmic.
<br />
<br />For general computer programs, in contexts where mirrors may not be
<br />
available, a quiescent (low level) self-model can be obtained by a mechanism
<br />
logically similar to the self-replication mechanism employed by
<br />
single-celled organisms.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [BM] I am not sure which &quot;external aspect&quot; you allude to. Case'w work
</em><br />
relies
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on the second recursion of Kleene, which gives easy way to construct
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-referential programs. The &quot;mirror&quot; is really in machine's head.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok, but if, as you state, the 'mirror' is really in the machine's head
<br />
we are only shifting the 3-person view; instead of seeing the robot standing
<br />
in front of a mirror, we zoom inside the robot's innards and find the
<br />
'mirror'. This does not chance anything.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, you are making a different point since the 'mirror'
<br />
that Case and you (I think) are thinkng about is not a physical 'mirror' or
<br />
any other physical object. That is to be expected given that we seem to be
<br />
discussing the subtleties of an immaterail monist theory, but does nothing
<br />
to blunt the point of my question: Hw does an immaterial monist theory give
<br />
a consistent meaning to notions such as &quot;transitivity&quot;, &quot;concurrency&quot;,
<br />
&quot;persistence&quot; and other properties that are associated with physicality?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The basic idea is very easy. Let D be a duplicator in the sense that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the program D applied to X, written DX, gives a description of X apply to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; itself, that is XX.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So DA gives AA. DB gives BB. DC gives CC, ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What gives DD?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes. DD gives DD. It's an example of a duplicating program.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no difficulties with such notions, but would like to see a more
<br />
general situation discussed such as how we can have a formal model of
<br />
multiple 1-person intentionalities. I see this more general stuation as
<br />
being the exact analogy of the &quot;problem of time&quot; in physics and given my
<br />
interest in that problem I am engaging in this discussion. ;-)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; For all transformation T you can generalize and find a program which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computes T applied to itself. Simple reproduction is the particular case
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; when T = the identity transformation: take a new &quot;duplicator&quot; which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; apply to any X, written DX, gives T applied to a description of XX, that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is T(XX). Now DD gives T(DD). DD gives T applied to itself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So you get self-referential machines by the substitution of some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [variable of some transformation] by duplicator applied to themselves.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok, but where is the notion of &quot;persistence&quot; that is implicit in the
<br />
chain:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; take a new &quot;duplicator&quot; which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; apply to any X, written DX, gives T applied to a description of XX, that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is T(XX). Now DD gives T(DD). DD gives T applied to itself.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is obviously a transitive property here since we have to both
<br />
consider all of these machines, X, DX, T, XX, T(XX), T(DD) and DD as being
<br />
distinct from each others and yet have some relation between each other. If
<br />
we have a transitive relation or property, it seems necessary that there is
<br />
an assumption of persistence, even if it is that X = X for all instentional
<br />
statements s which are &quot;about&quot; X.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see Kripke's &quot;possible worlds&quot; idea to be the first explicit
<br />
elaboration of this notion that I am trying to discuss and it is implicit in
<br />
all philosophical discussion of &quot;objects&quot; even if they are considered as
<br />
&quot;immaterial&quot;. We have to assume some basis set or class and it seems that
<br />
the property of &quot;persistence&quot; is tacitly assumed for such. But what I am
<br />
trying to point out is that persistence as implied by the formal statements
<br />
of &quot;X exists&quot; does nothing to &quot;substantiate&quot; (Literally!) those statements
<br />
and &quot;transitivity&quot;, such as implied by statements such as your here, are a
<br />
related but different property. Both need to be, at least, accounted for in
<br />
our models.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You could say that the self-referentiality comes from the language
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; chosen, but working with Rogers numerical representations, the \phi_i,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you can show the reasoning constructive and machine, or programming
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; language, independent.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What remains true is that any self-referential program needs a universal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; program to run it, for making the self-referentiality manifest.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have never deny that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok, I am not questioning whether or not there &quot;exists&quot; self-referential
<br />
programs (plural???) or a &quot;Univiversal program&quot; (singular???), I am
<br />
wondering about how do we go from formal existence postulation to the
<br />
possibility of &quot;maniferstation&quot; itself. This is where I think that there is
<br />
a problem if only in that the domain of explanatory power of such models
<br />
only applies to a very narrow range. Here we find the following:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.cis.udel.edu/~case/slides/krt-consc-cs-slides.ps">http://www.cis.udel.edu/~case/slides/krt-consc-cs-slides.ps</a>
<br />
<br />page 6. (I hope that my correctiond for LaTex are correct.)
<br />
<br />***
<br />
Fix a standard formalism for computing all the (partial) computable
<br />
functions mapping tupes
<br />
from N (the set of non­negative integers) into N . Code number the
<br />
programs/machines in
<br />
this formalism onto N. Let \Delta p( . , ... , .) be the (partial) function
<br />
(of the indicated number of
<br />
arguments) computed by program number p in the formalism.
<br />
<br />Kleene's Theorem
<br />
(\forevery p)(\thereexist e)(\forevery x) [\Delta e(x) = \Delta p(e, x)].
<br />
<br />p plays the role of an arbitrary preassigned use to make of self­model. e is
<br />
a self­knowing pro­gram/machine corresponding to p. x is any input to e.
<br />
Basically, e on x, creates a self­ copy and, then, runs p on (the self­copy;
<br />
x).
<br />
In any natural programming system with efficient (linear time) numerical
<br />
cod­ing/decoding of programs, passing from
<br />
any p to a corresponding e can be done by a linear time algorithm;
<br />
furthermore, the resultant e itself efficiently runs in time
<br />
O(the length of p in bits + the run time of p)
<br />
***
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We notice that the domain and range of the functions is N (the set of
<br />
non­negative integers), thus it is being assumed that this model that only
<br />
uses N -&gt; N functions can give us a model of &quot;self-reference&quot; that is
<br />
sufficient to, at least, avoid the infinite regress that in implicit in the
<br />
usual notion of machines creating models of themselves.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I understand of this is that we are intentionally limiting the
<br />
class of functions and the domain and range so that the infinite regress
<br />
does not occur. It is additionally interesting to notice a pair of
<br />
statements that Case makes on page 3 of the above mentioned paper:
<br />
<br />&quot;Infinite regress! M inf. hence M not a machine.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;therefore M can not contain a model of itself&quot;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This notion of &quot;containment&quot;, in itself, begs the question that I am
<br />
asking!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What the universal dovetailer argument shows is that from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point of view of the machine, if she looks closely enough to its probable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; local implementation, that is near its comp substitution level, she will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; describe not one universal machines, but MANY one.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exactly what is the formal statement of &quot;if she looks closely enough to
<br />
its probable local implementation&quot; or equivalently, &quot;near its comp
<br />
substitution level&quot;? Are you assuming some kind of &quot;delta-epsilonics&quot; here?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I still do not understand how you go from UDA to 1-uncertainty. Please
<br />
point me to the definitions again. ;-)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; QM confirms that. But people  have invented selecting rules, like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the collapse of the wave or some guiding potential, making things look
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more Aristotelian. But Everett comes and said &quot;why for?&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hold on! The &quot;collapse of the wave function&quot; is introduced to try to
<br />
explain the disparity between the non-distributive and non-Boolean aspect of
<br />
QM and the logic implicit within individual 1-person experiences. QM has
<br />
been compared by David Finkelstein to a relativity of experiments, where
<br />
there does not exist an absolute universal experiment.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I re-read D. Finkelstein's essay: Finite Physics, it seems that what
<br />
you and other computationalist are proposing is identical to that Prof.
<br />
Finkelstein is trying to generalize:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;An abolute or nonrelativistic physics ... postulates
<br />
<br />1) a universal experimental language,
<br />
2) a universal experiment, and
<br />
3) a universal experimental subject.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The universal experiment is the simultaneous determination of all the
<br />
variables of the system. The universal subject is the universe itself. Both
<br />
figure explicitly, fdor example, in Laplace's fantasy of the intelligence
<br />
who knows all and does nothing.&quot;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is easy to see the analogy!
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And I come, if you want, and just say that if you take seriously the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Everett comp then you can ask &quot;why for?&quot; even for the Schroedinger
</em><br />
Equation.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would kindly submit that neither you not I understand exactly what the
<br />
SWE is, but to say that Everrett's comp idea exists without SWE is absurd!
<br />
It is the SWE that defines the &quot;thereexist X&quot; postulation of the &quot;relative
<br />
states&quot; that are considered as &quot;worlds&quot; or &quot;minds&quot; or &quot;histories&quot;, etc. ,
<br />
such that without X being assumed to exist the notion of self-aware entities
<br />
of self-referential systems is meaningless noise, at best!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not because you should dismiss it, but because if it is true, it should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be derivable from LOGIC + ARITHMETIC. That the result of the UDA proof.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not dispuse &quot;LOGIC + ARITHMETIC&quot;. I am just wondering how it is that
<br />
you can assume that LOGIC + ARITHMETIC can be meaningfull and persistent
<br />
entities without having to deal with the obvious infinite regress that is
<br />
entailed. If there is no &quot;externality&quot; upon which to mirror internal
<br />
properties, how do you avoid the regress?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BTW, I like the idea of using non-well founded set theory because in it
<br />
infinite regression and circularity are not problematic at all, but the nice
<br />
and neat notions inplicit in Church-Turing thesis vanish.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;SPK:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     Your model, as I understand it, ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; BM:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I'm afraid you miss the point. It is not a &quot;model&quot;. It is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a theory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is a &quot;theorem&quot;, a deductive argument. If you don't understand it,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you should tell me at which step of the reasoning you are stuck.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even so, the theorem is based on an assumption!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am not so interested in knowing if the hypotheses are true. I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; enough glad for showing them refutable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; When a computationalist practitioners accepts an artificial digital
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain, he does not ask for a model in its head. He asks and hope for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the real thing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no clear evidence that a digital emulation of brain activity
<br />
will have an analogous digital 1-person associated. The strong AI hypothesis
<br />
is merely that, a hypothesis. I am remined of the discussion that some have
<br />
made regarding a book within which a complete description is written of
<br />
Einstein's brain. Is it assumed that the mere enumeration, assuming
<br />
enumerability, of the states of Einstein's brain is enough to give us a
<br />
1-person existence of Einsten? This is silly at best!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In case he survives (= COMP) he can bet he is immaterial. He can choose
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is body and travel on the nets, without any stable body. The UDA result
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is that this imateriality is contagious, in some sense, the environment
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cannot be more material than himself. Descartes, Hume, and Kant have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; partially describe this.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am pointing out is that you are assuming at least the possibility
<br />
of an &quot;embodiment&quot;, even if there does not exist a single stable &quot;body&quot;. We
<br />
can extend the Einstein book to a data base that is continuously circulated
<br />
between servers on the internet, but the question remains, unless the
<br />
possibility of a physical server with some non-zero persistence of &quot;being&quot;
<br />
is assumed, even the notion of an Einstein data base becomes impossible.
<br />
This exposes a problem deeper than that of the causal non-efficasy of
<br />
&quot;matter&quot; within a immaterial monist theory!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It boils down to saying that you can not postulate your cake and eat it
<br />
too!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; SPK:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;would seem to make the &quot;mirror/ sketch
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;pad&quot; to be a derivative or &quot;epiphenomenona&quot; of the UD,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; BM:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why epiphenomena? They are phenomenal appearances, stable patterns in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consistent machines memories. Dreams if you want, but stable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dreams in which they have partial control ...
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does the word &quot;stable&quot; mean in your thinking here?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And thanks to the G/G* difference we get communicable and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; incommunicable truth. Thanks to the Z/Z* difference we get
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; room for both physical measure and physical sensations, as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; uncommunicable physical result of (self)measurement.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; SPK:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;e.g. that physicality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;itself is merely derived from the intetionality of arithmetic statements,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; BM:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok, well how do we go from intesionality to persistence such that a
<br />
3-person view is even possible?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; SPK:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;what x implies about y. My argument is that if physicality is mere
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;epiphenomenona, is it sufficient to merely have a &quot;belief&quot; by S that x
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;implies y to have a causal consequence on the possible behavior of S,
</em><br />
such
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;that if x did not imply y behavior would be 3-person distinguishable?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; BM:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ... would be 1-person plural distinguishable (for the technical reason
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the quantum, seems to appear at the star level. I am not yet sure).
</em><br />
<br /><br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that you can explain this further soon!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But you are right.  That is, if that is believable and consistent.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is not that mind acts on matter, but it is more like the arithmetical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; border of mind defines matter. Roughly speaking.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is this &quot;arithmetical border of mind&quot; any different from the
<br />
Cartesian cut, the distiction between subject and object?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; SPK:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     What I seem to be getting at is how do you relate 1-uncertainty to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;3-person belief? I see the paper by Pratt that I have mentioned before
</em><br />
makes
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;some headway on this question, but have not seen any of your comments
</em><br />
about
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; BM:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We will come back later on Pratt. It is very technical and he redefined
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mind and body in a very special sense. I guess something interesting. We
</em><br />
will
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; see if it helps for the Z1(*) semantics ...
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very eager to see this!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Don't hesitate to send a readable description of Pratt's &quot;headway&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for us all, anyway. Explain perhaps enough for explaining the subtle point
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which, if I understand you, would make comp inconsistent, or perhaps
</em><br />
trivial.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok, it seems that this is inevitable, but you realize that if a person
<br />
that is familiar with computer science, such as yourself, is having
<br />
difficulties understanding Pratt's paper, imagine the mere amateur such as
<br />
myself! I find this incredible! Is there nothing in his paper that gives you
<br />
a &quot;toehold&quot; on what he is talking about? BTW, you are not the first to not
<br />
understand his idea! I have tried to engage Pratt directly in a discussion
<br />
of his paper and so has Peter Wegner, but he seems to not be willing to do
<br />
so for some reason.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since so much of my own idea depends on Pratt's notions, I will try to
<br />
produce a &quot;readable description&quot;, but it will take some time and effort.
<br />
<br />Kindest regards,
<br />
