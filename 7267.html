<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;will be created in a distant town. You've got a minute to press that button

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;as often as you can, and then you are getting tortured.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;What are you going to choose (Stathis and Bruno)? Are you *really* going to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;choose (2), and start pressing that button frantically? Do you really think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it will make any difference?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I'm just imagining having pressed that button a hundred times. Each time I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;press it, nothing seems to happen. Meanwhile, the torturer is making his
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;knife nice and dull, and his smile grows ever wider.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Cr^%^p, I'm definitely choosing (1).

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Ok, sure, each time I press it, I also step out of a booth in Moscow,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;relieved to be pain-free (shortly to be followed by a second me, then a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;third, each one successively more relieved.) But I'm still choosing (1).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now, the funny thing is, if you replace &quot;torture&quot; by &quot;getting shot in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;head&quot;, then I will pick (2). That's interesting, isn't it?
</em><br />
<br />This is a good question. It reminds me of what patients sometimes say when 
<br />
their doctor confidently explains that the proposed treatment has only a one 
<br />
in a million risk of some terrible complication: &quot;yes, but what if I'm that 
<br />
one in a million?&quot; In a multiverse model of the universe, the patient *will* 
<br />
be that one in a million, in one millionth of the parallel worlds. This 
<br />
means you can arrange experiments so that the copies generated on the basis 
<br />
of an unlikely outcome are segregated, making it seem to this subset that 
<br />
the improbable is probable or, as in the above example, the contingent is 
<br />
certain.
<br />
<br />When you press the button in the torture room, there is a 50% chance that 
<br />
your next moment will be in the same room and and a 50% chance that it will 
<br />
be somewhere else where you won't be tortured. However, this constraint has 
<br />
been added to the experiment: suppose you end up the copy still in the 
<br />
torture room whenever you press the button. After all, it is certain that 
<br />
there will be a copy still in the room, however many times the button is 
<br />
pressed. Should this unfortunate person choose the coin toss instead?
<br />
<br />Say you do choose the coin option, and let's allow that you can toss the 
<br />
coin as many times as you want in the minute you have before the torture 
<br />
starts. If the MWI is true, in half of the subsequent worlds the coin comes 
<br />
up heads and the version of you in these worlds can still expect torture; 
<br />
while in the other half, the coin comes up tails and the torturer lets you 
<br />
go. Now, let's add this constraint: suppose that you are the copy for whom 
<br />
the coin always comes up heads, however many times you toss it. After all, 
<br />
in the MWI it is certain that there will be such a copy, however many times 
<br />
the coin is tossed. Should this unfortunate person give up on the coin and 
<br />
try begging for mercy while he still has some time left?
<br />
<br />Here's another version of the of problem, this time without torture. Suppose 
<br />
you have the opportunity to use a machine which, when you put $2 in a slot, 
<br />
will destructively analyse you and create 10 copies. Of these copies, 9 will 
<br />
each be given $1 million in cash, while the 10th copy will get nothing other 
<br />
than another opportunity to use a similar machine. Suppose you are the copy 
<br />
who keeps putting coins into the machines and not winning anything. How long 
<br />
will it be before you decide you are wasting your money?
<br />
<br />What these examples all have in common is that the &quot;unlucky&quot; copies are 
<br />
singled out and, ironically, it is these copies who have control over the 
<br />
process (button, coin) which results in their bad luck. If the experiments 
<br />
were changed so that, in the copying process, only one randomly chosen copy 
<br />
were actually implemented, the apparent probabilities would remain the same 
<br />
but it would not be possible to separate out an unlucky group, and the &quot;best 
<br />
choice&quot; would not be problematic. This is how probabilities work in a single 
<br />
world model, and our minds have evolved to assume that we live in such a 
<br />
world.
