<em class="quotelev1">&gt; incompatible, so it can't be.
</em><br />
<br />I got hold of Maudlin's paper yesterday and I will hopefully post more
<br />
on it this weekend.
<br />
<br />The computationalist hypothesis is that implementing a certain kind
<br />
of computation is necessary and sufficient for creating consciousness.
<br />
It is an important part of this hypothesis that the implementation must
<br />
include counterfactuals.  That is, the implementation must mirror not
<br />
only the behavior of the program given the specific inputs encountered
<br />
on the run, but it must have been such that if other inputs had occured,
<br />
the implementation would still have faithfully followed the rules of
<br />
the program.
<br />
<br />This last point is the crucial part for the paradox Maudlin constructs.
<br />
<br />The supervenience thesis is that whether consciousness occurs depends
<br />
solely on the physical activity of the system.  Two systems with the
<br />
same physical activity will both produce the same consciousness.  In
<br />
particular, adding an inert object which does not interact with the
<br />
system should not change its degree of consciousness.
<br />
<br />Although these two theses appear compatible, they are contradictory.
<br />
To oversimplify somewhat, the reason is because of the need to implement
<br />
counterfactuals in order to produce consciousness in the computationalist
<br />
hypothesis.  Since counterfactuals don't actually occur, this contradicts
<br />
the supervenience hypothesis, which says that consciousness should only
<br />
depend on physical activity, which means it depends on what actually
<br />
happens.
<br />
<br />Maudlin constructs an elaborate variant on a Turing machine.  It is
<br />
used to replay a previously computed conscious experience, and we want
<br />
to ask whether the replay is conscious.  Because it is a replay we
<br />
know exactly what states it will go through, but it is not enough,
<br />
by the computationalist hypothesis, to arrange that the machine
<br />
goes through such a series of states.  In addition, the machine has
<br />
to handle counterfactuals - that is, it must be such that if the
<br />
input were different from what was used on the earlier runs, then it
<br />
will still do the right thing.
<br />
<br />Maudlin proposes to add to the TM a mechanical clockwork computer which
<br />
handles counterfactuals.  This portion of the computer would be activated
<br />
if the input were different from what is expected.  It is only used in
<br />
that case, otherwise the main TM just plows through the states that
<br />
were pre-computed from an earlier run.
<br />
<br />Now, because this is a replay and all the inputs are the same, the
<br />
clockwork computer will never actually be activated.  Nevertheless
<br />
this extra clockwork mechanism MUST be present, according to the
<br />
computationalist hypothesis, otherwise the system does not handle
<br />
counterfactuals and so is not conscious.
<br />
<br />Maudlin then proposes to insert a chunk of wood among the gears of
<br />
the clockwork computer such that if it ever tried to start running, it
<br />
would be blocked.  This piece of wood does not need to touch anything,
<br />
it just needs to be positioned so that if the gears tried to turn they
<br />
would jam on the wood.  (Keep in mind that the gears never actually do
<br />
start to turn.)
<br />
<br />By doing so he has changed the machine so that it no longer handles
<br />
counterfactuals properly.  Hence by the computationalist hypothesis,
<br />
the machine will no longer be conscious.  However, his inert chunk of
<br />
wood makes no actual difference in the activity of the machine.  Hence
<br />
by the supervenience hypothesis, the machine continues to be conscious.
<br />
<br />The two theses give opposite predictions and hence are incompatible.
<br />
<br />This short description does not really do Maudlin's 20-page argument
<br />
justice but hopefully explains the basic idea.
<br />
