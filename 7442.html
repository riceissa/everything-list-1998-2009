<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Well, ....you've already admitted that a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;little memory loss does not threaten your identity!  Recall the Aussies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;you wrote about who customarily lose an entire evening's inebriation :-)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, and I also admitted that there is an inconsistency in my position. 
</em><br />
<br />Well, if you ever aspire to having a consistent position on these
<br />
issues, don't forget the &quot;duplicates are selves&quot; view.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Having my duplicate who has already diverged live on while I die is not just 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; memory loss, but rather replacement of the lost memories with someone 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; else's, which I feel is a greater threat to my identity and which I would be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; less likely to agree to.
</em><br />
<br />It's &quot;someone else&quot; just because that's the *feeling* you have about
<br />
it! Since you have &quot;the feeling&quot; that you are the same person today
<br />
that you will be tomorrow, perhaps some day you can achieve the
<br />
feeling that your duplicate sitting across the room is really you too.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Memory loss would be more like having myself backed 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; up and the backup run after I have died. If the backups are frequent, I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suppose it is better than no backup at all, but I would still feel afraid of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dying. At its most basic, for me anyway, the fear of imminent death is the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fear that the person I am *now* will be wiped from the universe and never 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have any more experiences.
</em><br />
<br />Have faith in physics. If from *every* objective measure, a Stathis
<br />
will be awaking tomorrow in your bed, and will do things and talk to
<br />
everyone just like you, then he is you. There are no souls. You must
<br />
have faith.  The physics of the situation is all that there is.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The same consideration ought to apply to memory loss, but people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't generally think of it that way, because they know 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that they'll be OK afterwards, on the basis of past experience.
</em><br />
<br />Just because they're not used to thinking of it in the right way,
<br />
does not preclude our embracing the right way that we should be
<br />
thinking of it.
<br />
<br /><br />Yes, it's true:  the very first thing you learned on this Earth
<br />
was how to tell what was outside your body from what was inside,
<br />
and slowly your concept of self was formed. But we can see now
<br />
that it was wrong. We can see now that if you are to have a
<br />
consistent view of what self is, then it must include all processes
<br />
that (from the viewpoint of physics) are indistinguishable from
<br />
you. Or rather, which are very, very similar (like the you yesterday,
<br />
or the you across the room).
<br />
<br />Just embrace it: when you see your duplicate across the room,
<br />
and you know all the facts of his and your existence, just
<br />
repeat: &quot;There by the grace of God go I&quot;.
<br />
<br />Lee
