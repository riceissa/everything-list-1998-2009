<br />Remember that I am working in David Lewis's framework.  Each world is a
<br />
physical object: a bunch of matter, connected together spatiotemporally.  So
<br />
I do not need to work with specifications, but with concrete chunks of
<br />
stuff.  There is nothing further illuminating to be said in a lewisian
<br />
context, really, about what makes two concrete chunks of stuff the same
<br />
chunk, is there?
<br />
<br />I have the vague suspicion here that by using words like
<br />
physical/matter/concrete/chunk, you're skirting the issue of how worlds are
<br />
specified in the general case, by narrowing the scope to worlds whose only
<br />
constituents are material -- literally, having mass and occupying space.
<br />
What about worlds consisting of a single point of space, populated by
<br />
(soul-like?) entities whose (of course non-spatial) internal specifications
<br />
and external relationships change over time?  I fear you're taking a
<br />
short-cut that relies on our intuition that ordinary baryonic matter has a
<br />
privileged and obvious and natural way to be specified.
<br />
<br />By the way, I think I disagree even with the the spatiotemporal stipulation
<br />
of Lewis. It makes more sense to me to define a world as a causal closure
<br />
rather than a spatiotemporal closure, but perhaps that would give up on an
<br />
ambition of Lewis to analyze causality rather than consider it a primitive.
<br />
For example, what if a world consists of two disconnected regions of space,
<br />
between which there can still be causal relations?  Would Lewis just say
<br />
that the events are temporally related even though not spatially related?
<br />
(Hopefully he wouldn't try to introduce some extra spatial &quot;dimension&quot; by
<br />
which to allow a coordinate specifying which region, as such an effort could
<br />
I think be confounded.) If so, then maybe my disagreement with Lewis is that
<br />
I would define time in terms of causation, where he would define causation
<br />
in terms of time....
<br />
<br />That said, I am making an assumption that there is only one copy of each
<br />
world.
<br />
<br />As I understand it, a virtue of the information-theoretic perspective is
<br />
that if we define worlds as one-to-one with their minimal K-specifications,
<br />
we don't have to bother with questions like whether there can be copies of
<br />
worlds.
<br />
<br />I suppose one could recover the &quot;measure&quot; the authors you cite have if you
<br />
suppose that there is a copy of each world for every arrangement-description
<br />
of it.  But I do not see why one would suppose that.
<br />
<br />I'm a novice when it comes to the concept of measure, but my sense is that
<br />
these many-worlds theorists restrict themselves to methods of
<br />
world-specification in which different specifications map by definition to
<br />
different worlds. 
<br />
<br />Most observers are going to be in worlds with a much higher cardinality of
<br />
stuff than our world contains.  Our world probably only has a finite number
<br />
of particles.  The cardinality of worlds just like ours until tomorrow but
<br />
where \aleph_8 neutrons appear in San Francisco down-town, causing
<br />
everything in the universe to collapse is much greater than the cardinality
<br />
of regular worlds.  In fact, I think what I am saying here will apply even
<br />
on information-theoretic measures.
<br />
<br />That depends on what you mean by &quot;regular&quot; worlds. If you mean worlds just
<br />
like ours with no deviation from our laws, you may be right. But if you mean
<br />
worlds apparently just like ours due to having no observed deviation from
<br />
our laws, my intuition is to disagree.

Alastair Malcolm points out
<br />
(<a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/search.html?query=pruss">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/search.html?query=pruss</a>) that Lewis
<br />
addressed this subject in On The Plurality Of Worlds, p. 118:
<br />
<br />We might ask how the inductively deceptive worlds compare in abundance to
<br />
the undeceptive worlds. If this is meant as a comparison of cardinalities,
<br />
it seems clear that the numbers will be equal. For deceptive and undeceptive
<br />
worlds alike, it is easy to set a lower bound of beth-two, the number of
<br />
distributions of a two-valued magnitude over a continuum of spacetime
<br />
points; and hard to make a firm case for any higher cardinality. However,
<br />
there might be a sense in which one or the other class of worlds
<br />
predominates even without a difference in cardinality. There is a good
<br />
sense, for instance, in which the primes are an infinitesimal minority among
<br />
the natural numbers, even without any difference in cardinality: their
<br />
limiting relative frequency is zero. We cannot take a limiting relative
<br />
frequency among the worlds, for lack of any salient linear order;
<br />
<br />My suspicion/hope is that the work I cited by Malcolm/Standish/Schmidhuber
<br />
suggests an approach to defining such a linear order, by which we can judge
<br />
that apparently regular worlds predominate over apparently irregular worlds.
<br />
(Alastair, Russell -- am I reading you correctly?)
<br />
<br />(The one or two papers you linked to that I looked at made the assumption
<br />
that there was a fixed maximum cardinality of things.  But why assume that?)
<br />
<br />I'm not sure which assumption you mean. Can you point it out in e.g. Malcolm
<br />
or Standish? (I'm cc'ing them by virtue of everything-list.domain.name.hidden)
<br />
<br />Best wishes,
