This is yet another delayed response; the story of my life really ...
<br />
<br />Jason: &quot;By physically reversible I don't mean we as humans can undo 
<br />
anything
<br />
that happens, rather physical interactions are time-invertible.  If you
<br />
were shown a recording of any physical interaction on a small scale, an
<br />
elastic collision of particles, the decay of a nucleus, burning of
<br />
hydrogen, it would be impossible for you to tell if that recording were
<br />
being played in reverse or not, since it is always possible for that
<br />
interaction to occur as it does in either direction of time.&quot;
<br />
<br />MP: This is only true for 'individual' reactions on the micro scale, but 
<br />
even then the 'truth' about the reversibility can only really be 
<br />
maintained by hiding the truth about the context. For example, it is 
<br />
logically possible for certain atomic nuclei to collide at just the 
<br />
right velocities and fusion will occur. In reality however the 
<br />
probability of what are normally fission products coming together to 
<br />
make a uranium nucleus is so close to zero you are never going to see 
<br />
it. [I don't know much about the physics but my casual believe is that 
<br />
heavy elements are created through various long and complex 'ratchet' 
<br />
accretion pathways in which nuclear isotopes of H or He enter heavier 
<br />
nuclei.] Like wise the burning of hydrogen; it seems simple enough and 
<br />
yes it is 'reversible', but does the reverse occur? Not where you and I 
<br />
can see it.
<br />
<br />Jason: &quot;Quantum mechanics makes the universe seem random and 
<br />
uncomputable to
<br />
those inside it, but according to the many-worlds interpretation the
<br />
universe evolves deterministically.  It is only the observers within
<br />
the quantum mechanical universe that perceive the randomness and
<br />
unpredictability, but this unpredictability doesn't exist at the higher
<br />
level where the universe is being simulated (assuming many-worlds). &quot;
<br />
<br />MP: I don't think I can accept this. Maybe I sound arrogant in saying 
<br />
this, but I think the idea of simulation is used a bit too loosely. I 
<br />
know there are those lurking on the Mind &amp; Brain list and JCS-online who 
<br />
would say I am 'the pot calling the kettle black', because I am always 
<br />
asserting what I call UMSITW [pronounced um-see-two for English 
<br />
speakers] - updating the model of self in the world - is the basis of 
<br />
consciousness. But they misunderstand me, because I do not say there is 
<br />
anyone else doing simulation, merely that we experience being here 
<br />
because the universe has evolved self sustaining regions within itself 
<br />
which maintain their structure by means of dynamically modelling 
<br />
themselves and their local region so as to avoid fatal dangers while 
<br />
obtaining everything they need from their environments. My point here is 
<br />
simply that the universe is its own best simulation and that any ideas 
<br />
of something greater, such as a Matrix type operation, are science 
<br />
fiction only. Why? Because for a feasible universe like the one we seem 
<br />
to inhabit to be deterministic does not require that it is predictable 
<br />
nor that it can be repeatable. Nobody knows to what extent quantum level 
<br />
events are intrinsically random as opposed to being _pushed from 
<br />
'behind' or 'below'_ so to speak.
<br />
<br />That is one thing. Another thing is that no entity or set of entities 
<br />
could know if their 'simulation' attempt was doing what they wanted in 
<br />
every detail because to attempt to find this out would interfere 
<br />
irreversibly with the unfolding of the world. This latter objection can 
<br />
be sidelined by accepting that there are no entities with any such 
<br />
intention therefore it is irrelevant. For those who would be 'believers' 
<br />
in Sky God, as well sceptics, this puts divine intervention pretty much 
<br />
off limits.
<br />
<br />OK, that leaves the concept of pseudo-emulation: another hidden 'level' 
<br />
of structure embodied in calculation. I guess this can be represented by 
<br />
either
<br />
1/ the movie '13th Floor' - which I think much better than 'Matrix' 1, 
<br />
2, and 3 in terms of its encapsulation of interesting philosophical 
<br />
questions - or
<br />
2/ Bruno's 'Yes Doctor' hypothesis.
<br />
<br />These might seem to be very different but I don't think so. The key 
<br />
point is that a wilful entity or conspiracy seeks to emulate all or part 
<br />
of another wilful entity's world to the extent that the latter can't 
<br />
tell the difference when the change is made. Doubtless Bruno has a far 
<br />
more exacting definition and sets of caveats, but I insist on 
<br />
plain-English. As far as I can see, the assertion that this MUST be 
<br />
possible in principle because 'we' can imagine a mathematical 
<br />
implementation, just begs the question. I do not think there is anything 
<br />
shameful in 'reifying' physics, because if we exist and know that we do 
<br />
it has to be because we BELIEVE in ourselves and our world. Believing in 
<br />
something IS reifying it. When we understand that the basic mechanism 
<br />
underlying this process is the activation of a model of whatever it is, 
<br />
the whole question of mind and consciousness is demystified. This does 
<br />
not remove the wonder, or the challenges, of living in the amazing 
<br />
universe. It should mean that we spend less money on snake oil though!

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; please excuse my ignorant interjections here but, as a

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; non-mathematician, non-philosopher, I need to work things into a plain

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the edges of things get fuzzy with far more ease than they get straight

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and clear cut. Furthermore I am beginning to wonder if the apparently

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'straight' and clear cut boundaries to concepts and so forth are not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; merely figments of my imagination. I don't think I go anywhere as far as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; John M. in this but then maybe that is just because I fear to let go of

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; my sceptical reductionist walking stick. :-)

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Jason: 'perform an infinite number of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; computations with a finite amount of energy, but only if the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; computations done on that computer are logically reversible.'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; MP: Surely 'logically reversible' does not necessarily imply no entropy,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; just that for the purposes of the concerned observer, the computing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; system can return to a state that is sufficiently close to the original
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; state so that the inputs can be discovered. More or less by definition,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; entropy increases and manifests as deterioration of the substrate and as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the need to supply more energy to travel through the system than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; otherwise is calculated to be necessary to obtain the minimum changes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; needed to embody the changes of state in the calculating system.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Right, logically reversible computations on their own do not imply no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; increase in entropy by the computing system, but for a computing system
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to operate with no net increase in entropy, the computations it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; performs must be logically reversible.  This is because: &quot;For a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computational operation in which 1 bit of logical information is lost,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the amount of entropy generated is at least k ln 2, and so the energy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that must eventually be emitted to the environment is E   kT ln 2.&quot; (
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversible_computing#More_on_Landauer.27s_principle">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversible_computing#More_on_Landauer.27s_principle</a> 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; )  Note that the computing substrates needed to implement such an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; efficient computer are well beyond our current level of technology and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are only theoretical.  However there is as of yet, no known reason why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an arbitrarily efficient computer could not be built.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A reversible computation is one that has a 1 to 1 mapping between input
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and output.  For example if if I compute x=x+3, every input has a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unique output, given the function and the result it is possible to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; determine the input.  However the same could not be said of a function
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; defined as x=x modulo 3, or x=0, where there are a finite number of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; outputs.  These computations are not reversible because it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inpossible to get the input given function and the output.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Jason: 'The physical interactions that occur in this universe are also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; reversible.  e.g. An electron can accept a photon and move to a higher
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; energy state or an electron can emit a photon and move to a lower
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; energy state.  Does reversible physics imply that a computational model
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of said physics would involve entirely reversible computations? '
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; MP: This concept of 'reversible' is very useful, but to how great an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; extent is it just a convenient fiction? My understanding is that you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; can't fire *a particular* photon at a particular atom and guarantee that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; your favourite electron will rise to the predicted level. I mean it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; either will or it won't.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; By physically reversible I don't mean we as humans can undo anything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that happens, rather physical interactions are time-invertible.  If you
</em><br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interaction to occur as it does in either direction of time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Conversely as I understand it [AIUI] the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; subsidence of an electron to a lower orbital is only predictable in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; statistical sense. Once again is it not that the real world entities
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; must be dealt with in a statistical manner, either as bulk substances,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; predictable due to the averaging of activities of the individual quantum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; particles, or as individual quantum items manifesting radical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; indeterminacy?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Quantum mechanics makes the universe seem random and uncomputable to

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Either way AIUI, the computational model will manipulate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; symbols denoting the real world physics and there is no guarantee that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; any such computing system could overcome the limits imposed by entropy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and quantum indeterminacy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm not sure what you are saying here.  Are you saying that a perfectly
