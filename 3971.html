Hi Tim, hi People
<br />
<br />This post is a continuation of
<br />
<a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m3908.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m3908.html</a>
<br />
where I try to explain the role of Yetter's book in the
<br />
ultimate derivation of physics from machine psychology.
<br />
<br />Note that the gain of such derivation would be:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) The possibility of experimental refutation of comp.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(just by comparing the comp-physics and empiry).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Thanks to the difference G* minus G, (that is the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(godelian) difference between machine psychology (G*)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and machine's machine psychology (G)) we have a non
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trivial source for *physical sensation* (as true
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inferable non communicable (non provable) truth. For
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;example consciousness can be seen as instinctive
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inference of consistency.
<br />
<br /><br />I was saying (in m3908) that Yetter's book bears on both
<br />
side of the mind-body problem, where roughly speaking MIND
<br />
is defined by boolean classical logic and MATTER by
<br />
quantum logic.
<br />
<br />I will try to be as short and informal as possible, at
<br />
the risk of being slightly incorrect.
<br />
<br />Recall that the UDA shows that physics, from the point
<br />
of view of machine m in state S_m is given by the structure
<br />
(hopefully a probability domain structure) on the set of
<br />
accessible consistent extensions of S_m.
<br />
<br />The AUDA strategy consists in interviewing a consistent
<br />
machine (and its guardian angel) about its consistent
<br />
extensions. The abstract structure corresponding to such
<br />
discourse are given by G and G*  (called GL and GLS in
<br />
Boolos 1993, or PRL and PRL^omega in Smorynski 1985, ...).
<br />
<br />G formalizes what a machine can prove about itself, and
<br />
G* formalizes what is true about the machine. The non
<br />
empty character of G* minus G reflects the incompleteness
<br />
phenomenon: there exists a lot of truth that the machine
<br />
cannot prove about itself. The main example is the simple
<br />
consistency statement -[]f, or equivalently &lt;&gt;t.
<br />
<br />When I say G captures the provable propositions by the
<br />
machine about itself, I am really talking about third
<br />
person propositions bearing on correct *descriptions* of
<br />
itself.
<br />
<br />This concerns the computationalist which faces description
<br />
of his body and brains for exemple. It is not, and cannot be
<br />
the intuitive first person &quot;I&quot;.
<br />
<br />But we can defined this intuitive first person &quot;I&quot; by the
<br />
thaetetus' definition of knowledge linking provability (the
<br />
G box) and truth; this by defining a new box, and thus another
<br />
modal logic, by []p &amp; p. The counterintuitive aspect of the
<br />
Godelian formal provability comes from the fact that
<br />
provability is not linked to truth, or, more precisely,
<br />
it is not linkable to truth by the machine (but such a link
<br />
is easy stuff for its guardian angel who know the truth
<br />
about the machine!).
<br />
<br />With formula you have
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;G does not prove   []p  equivalent with []p &amp; p
<br />
<br />but
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;G* does prove []p  equivalent with []p &amp; p
<br />
<br />If you define a new box [1]p by []p &amp; p   ([] = the G box)
<br />
<br />You have obviously that [1]p -&gt; p, because ([]p &amp; p) -&gt; p
<br />
(because &quot;((a &amp; b) -&gt; a)&quot; is a tautology.
<br />
The logic of that new box is given by the modal system S4Grz
<br />
and it permits the association of a canonical intuitionist
<br />
logic, and even a topos, to the consistent machine. It plays
<br />
the role of the first person associated to the machine.
<br />
<br />But the Kripke semantics of S4Grz, [that is fundamentally
<br />
the geometry of the possible accessible worlds or accessible
<br />
states in which the theorem of S4Grz are invariant (and non
<br />
dependant of the valuation of the sentence letter p, q, r ...)]
<br />
is given by antisymmetric frame.
<br />
<br />It has been shown, through Godel, McKinsey and Tarski,
<br />
Grzegorczyk, that the classical modal S4Grz is a classical
<br />
version of intuitionist logic. Very genuine for a first person.
<br />
<br />In a similar manner Goldblatt 1974 has succeeded to show that
<br />
the modal logic, know as B in the literature, is a classical
<br />
version of quantum logic (a weaker form of the Birkhoff
<br />
von Neumann 1936 quantum logic).
<br />
<br />So it would be nice if our interview of the machine (and its
<br />
angel) lead us to B, or near B, at least, giving us a quantum
<br />
logic for the background of the comp-physics.
<br />
<br />But the beginning of the interview, where we defined the
<br />
first person in term of G, lead us to the antisymetric S4Grz,
<br />
and that's odd because the Kripke semantics of B, that is the
<br />
Kripke frames of B are the symmetric one.
<br />
<br />There is no need to despair! After all the G frame are
<br />
irreflexive (no worlds are accessible from themselves), and
<br />
the S4Grz frame are reflexive. But we did succeeded going from
<br />
the irreflexive G frame to the reflexive S4Grz.
<br />
<br />Still, when I discover the antisymmetry of &quot;my&quot; first person,
<br />
and given that the physics should appear in the discourse
<br />
of the machine first person, I conclude that quantum logic
<br />
was not in the near horizon of the interview, and I try,
<br />
without clear success to make appear a weaker (substructural)
<br />
logic which has some physical smell too, and which was the
<br />
Girard linear logic. So I have first conjecture that the
<br />
(re)definition of physics in the G and S4Grz logics should lead
<br />
to linear logic. Unfortunately the relation between linear
<br />
logic and quantum logic was itself not obvious too. Then,
<br />
a curious paper appears making an explicit relation between
<br />
linear logic and &quot;certain models for the logic of quantum
<br />
mechanics&quot;. That paper was &quot;Quantales and (noncommutative)
<br />
linear logic&quot;, it appears in 'The Journal of Symbolic Logic&quot;
<br />
(volume 55, n°1, 1990) and was written by Yetter.
<br />
<br />Yetter's paper will enhanced my interest in linear logic,
<br />
which will lead me to category theory (the *-autonomous one
<br />
which gives models for linear logic) then quickly toward the
<br />
monoidal closed category, etc.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From Yetter's paper I will understand the importance (for
</em><br />
my derivation of physics from machine) of finding
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;good tensorial products
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;good topologies
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;good dualities
<br />
<br />and I will search for them ... without success. I'm still
<br />
searching!
<br />
<br />Still the miracle *will* occur: the translation of UDA in
<br />
arithmetic (classical machine language) leads automatically
<br />
to the symmetric B.
<br />
I explain quickly. (I have explained this in other posts).
<br />
<br />To have a probability 1 for a &quot;physical certainty&quot; p, we need
<br />
[]p (that is p is true in all accessible worlds, if that
<br />
exists) and &lt;&gt;p (there is an accessible world where p is true).
<br />
<br />So we must refine the &quot;[]p ===&gt; []p &amp; p&quot; transformation by
<br />
&quot;[]p ===&gt; []p &amp; &lt;&gt;p&quot;
<br />
Then, just taking into account that the state/world must be
<br />
accessible by the universal dovetailer. This is done by
<br />
restricting the realisations of the sentence letter to the
<br />
\Sigma_1 arithmetical sentences, i.e. those which have the
<br />
shape ExP(x) with P decidable (E = &quot;it exists&quot;).
<br />
<br />This gives a logic for which the logic B, without the
<br />
necessitation rule, is sound (but not complete).
<br />
Now that loss of the necessitation means we get a weak logic,
<br />
hopefully a substructural linear sort of quantum logic.
<br />
Actually I got a family of such logics: the Z and X logics.
<br />
(Z, Z0, Z1, ..., X, X0, X1, ... then the same with &quot;*&quot;).
<br />
X1* should give physics, X1* minus X1 should give the
<br />
physical sensations, the X_alpha, alpha ordinal gives
<br />
room for extremely weak form of computationalism, etc.
<br />
<br />This is why I am excited by Yetter's book from the MIND
<br />
toward MATTER link motivation.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* * *
<br />
<br />But I said that I dig also in the reverse direction, that
<br />
is from the MATTER-toward-MIND link. Here Yetter's book is
<br />
also interesting. Since I read Kitaev's paper
<br />
See <a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/quant-ph/9707021">http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/quant-ph/9707021</a>
<br />
I have begun to grasp the deep relation between quantum
<br />
topology and quantum information. I have also realised how
<br />
to get tensorial products without global tensor structure
<br />
as it is explained explicitely in the paper by Freedman
<br />
entitled &quot;A magnetic model with a possible Chern Simons phase&quot;.
<br />
See <a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/quant-ph/0110060">http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/quant-ph/0110060</a>
<br />
Modular functor, an abstract form for anyon-type quantum
<br />
computer also appeared in the work of &quot;linear-sort&quot;of
<br />
logician like Blute, Cockett and Seely with their linear
<br />
functor. So we see that the logician themselves begun
<br />
to add on the MATTER-toward-MIND path *and* the other
<br />
way too.
<br />
<br />This is hardly astonishing. Girard build his &quot;system F&quot;
<br />
as a reconstruction of Hilbert program after Godel
<br />
demoslished Hilbert initial program. And Girard got his
<br />
linear logic by making his system F just more symmetric.
<br />
My own work can be seen as going directly from Godel
<br />
to the needed weaker logic by listening directly to what
<br />
a machine can say about its limitations, and its limitation's
<br />
border.
<br />
I am conjecturing the Z and above all the X (*) logics define
<br />
&quot;naturally&quot; some sort of machine-first-person accessible
<br />
quantum computing machine. That would close the
<br />
mind-&gt;matter (BIT-&gt;QUBIT) path.
<br />
<br />The book by Yetter could help familiarization with
<br />
the braided monoidal categories and their possible use
<br />
in quantum computing. Alas it is a short book and Yetter
<br />
does not make explicit link with his noncommutative
<br />
linear logic. Also, the second part of the book is
<br />
not self-contained and looks rather hard.
<br />
<br />This ends my hopefully not too self-centered, but
<br />
certainly quite &quot;self&quot;-centered comment on Yetter's book.
<br />
<br /><br />Hoping having been not too short. Er ... or too long :)
<br />
<br /><br />Have a nice week-end,

<br /><br />(*) With the transformation []p ===&gt; []p &amp; &lt;&gt;p &amp; p, p \Sigma_1
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as described by G*. (compare with the Z logic where
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[]p is transformed into []p &amp; &lt;&gt;p, this is a re-applica-
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tion of the thaetetus's trick).
