<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From Osher Doctorow osher.domain.name.hidden, Sat. Nov. 30, 2002 1005
</em><br />
<br />I agree generally with Tim May on mathematics and physics vs computers and
<br />
AI.   My most amusing example is something of a Jonathon Swift parody of all
<br />
four of these fields.   Gulliver lands on an island inhabited by
<br />
mathematicians, physicists, computer scientists/computer engineers, and AI
<br />
people, all competing.  He notices that they all rushing ahead to greater
<br />
and greater complication and complexity and so on, and it occurs to him that
<br />
this might be their weak point.   Could they all have overlooked something
<br />
simple [question-mark].   He discovers, as it so happens that I discovered
<br />
some 20 or so years ago, that they are all using division and multiplication
<br />
to formulate relationships involving influence and causation [I omit
<br />
calculus limits for those unfamiliar with them], and minimally using
<br />
subtraction and addition.   Gulliver then reformulates all of their theories
<br />
using subtraction and/or addition, and it turns out that all of the
<br />
resulting theories are completely different from the old ones.   Not one
<br />
person among all the island's so-called geniuses had come up with the very
<br />
tiny idea of changing from division/multiplication to subtraction/addition
<br />
in all of their work.   Upon presenting this fact to the gathered people of
<br />
the island, the people debate for a long time, and then decide that Gulliver
<br />
knows more, so they decide to drop their entire four fields and start all
<br />
over again much more slowly, this time not racing to greater complication
<br />
before analyzing the simple concepts that they are using.  The name Socrates
<br />
is mentioned as an example.   The predictions of several popular science
<br />
writers on the island such as Professor Kaku to the effect that computers
<br />
are going to almost literally swamp everything else are accordingly
<br />
considerably modified to say the least.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; direction now
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; wholly unanticipated.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It will be interesting and exciting if you are right, but I think the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; kind of AI you describe above and below is further off than 10-30
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; years, though perhaps not 50 years.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Right now we analyze data about the microworld in a very crude way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; For
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; example, we scan Fermilab data for &quot;events&quot; -- but what about all the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; data that isn't &quot;events&quot; but contains meaningful patterns?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Create an AI mind whose sensors and actuators are quantum level, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; allow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; it to form its own hypotheses, ideas, concepts, ontologies....  Do you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; really think it's going to come up with anything as awkward and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; overcomplex
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; as our current physics theories?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have no idea. True, it may come up with all sorts of weird theories.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But, absent new experimental evidence, will these new theories actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tell us anything new?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Your point about AIs exploring physics is an interesting one. And you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are right that Egan has his AIs, his uploaded Orlandos and even his
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computer-produced Yatima, looking very much like humans. Not at all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like the &quot;Entities&quot; of Vinge's &quot;Deepness,&quot; Zindell's &quot;Neverness,&quot; or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Stephenson's &quot;Hyperion&quot; series. But let us imagine that an advanced AI
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; were to be turned loose on a Newtonian world. I can well imagine that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such an entity, left to its own devices, might come up with weird names
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for inertia, mass, friction, etc. Perhaps even synthetic combinations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of what we take to be the basic vectors of classical mechanics. Instead
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of 3-space being so primal, phase spaces of 6, 18, and even many more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dimensions would perhaps be more &quot;natural&quot; to such a mind. (Needless to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; say, given that today's best AI programs and computers are having a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very hard time even doing &quot;naive physics,&quot; a la ThingLab and its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; descendants, I'm not expecting progress very quickly. And ThingLab is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more than 20 years old now, so expecting massive breakthroughs in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; next 10-20 years seems overly optimistic.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; More importantly, would an AI version of classical physics, complete
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with incomprehensible (to us) phase spaces and n-categories and so on,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; including constructs with no known analogs in our current universe of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discourse, would this version give any predictions which differ from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our own? In short, would the AI's version of physics give us any new
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My hunch is no. It might be better at solving some problems, just as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the mental architecture of birds may give them much better abilities to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; solve certain kinds of 3D problems than we have had to evolve, and so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on for many other such examples, but would the physics be different or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; new?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I will grant that had such minds existed earlier in the development of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics they might have anticipated certain things decades or centuries
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ahead of humans, so I will grant that in this sense they might have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; found &quot;new physics.&quot; And hence I will grant that perhaps an alien mind,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or an AI mind, might be able to look at what we have already measured
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with our machines and may be able to see new physics we have not found.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Interesting topic, to be sure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (On a tangent, we also have some experience with non-Western cultures
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; coming to modern science with their own &quot;alien intelligence&quot; (to a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; slight extent, not a fraction of the alien intelligence a non-H.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sapiens would have) and we can examine the question of whether their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non-Western outlook gave them any particular insights into science or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fresh points of view. My verdict is that no, the non-Western outlooks
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; were not particularly important. Sure, Gell-Mann drew some ideas of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Eightfold Way,&quot; but the group-theoretic developments were there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anyway. Ditto for Eastern ideas of other sorts, I think. And ditto for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the feminist notion that masculine ideas apparent in physics need to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; supplemented with more feminine, nurturing, holistic kinds of crapola.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I am in danger of digressing into political topics, which I don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; want to do here on this list.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I suspect our current physics theories are overcomplex because they're
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; based
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; on extrapolating into the microworld, mathematics and intuitive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; concepts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that originated primarily in models of our everyday physical world.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Particle theory... wave theory ... path integrals. There are no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; particles,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; waves or paths down there....   There is no &quot;observation&quot; either....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; No
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; strings.  No membranes.  Our attempts to project these concepts onto an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; inappropriate domain may well strike future quantum-domain-natural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; minds as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; mildly hilarious...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Probably so. But at any given point in time the best we can do is to do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the best that we can. We of course cannot just wait for the machines...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Whether there &quot;are&quot; branes and strings and spins and suchlike at the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Planck scale is unknown to me, but physicists seem to be making
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; progress in acting as if such things have some meaning.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The universe is not a rubber sheet, either, but it can help to think of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; gravity with the rubber sheet model (though an Arcturan squid creature
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; might use a Flozzleblet to picture gravity, and an AI might use
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something entirely different).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is true that taking the &quot;at hand, all around us&quot; experience we have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with physical objects and with the logic of physical objects is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problematic at the quantum level. The fact that small things do not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behave the way rocks and spoons behave, being either here or not here,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; having some speed which can be measured, etc., is why quantum mechanics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is so weird to newcomers and others. So, yes, the physical world is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; really made of rubber sheets or strings or little blue balls called
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; electrons. But the fact that reality is so weird is not, in my opinion,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an argument of any kind that we should not try to make some sense of it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with the best arsenal of tools and concepts we can gather.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Humans may or may not arrive at a workable TOE before the advent of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; AI's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; with quantum-level sensors and actuators.  Following this advent,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; however,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the progress of fundamental physics will be unimaginably fast, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; will move
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in humanly-unimaginable directions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Will mathematics be central to this new physics?  Maybe.  But not our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; mathematics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I disagree fairly strongly on this point. I think our mathematics is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what is most lasting, albeit the mathematical ideas change names and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; new ideas become more important.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And I expect the mathematics the AIs develop, or that alien cultures
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; may already have, will look like a &quot;coordinate transformation&quot; on our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; space of mathematical basis vectors. Their categories may be slightly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different, but the underlying structure will be similar. (If natural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; transformations are what &quot;slide&quot; one category and its morphisms into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other categories and morphisms, 2-categories, 3-categories, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; n-categories in general are the tools for looking at how these natural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; transformations slide around.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Anyway, this was part of why I decided to start thinking about AI
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; rather
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; than fundamental physics ;-&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; AI remains interesting, but I think new views of physics will be coming
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from AIs long after other important things come out of AI. Just my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; opinion.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (For example, some friends of mine are doing interesting work on using
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; systems of several million machine agents to data mine large amounts of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; financial data. It seems likely that this kind of work on machine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; learning, pattern extraction, support vector machines, and a plethora
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of other &quot;AI tools&quot; will have major effects on the world of economics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and forecasting. And on creating financial derivatives (synthetics)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which are alien to human thinkers/investors.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I think Greg Egan's fiction is great, but I also think Diaspora is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; badly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; flawed futorology, because his uploaded minds never get tremendously
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; intelligent than humans.  I don't think that's a very realistic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; prognostication, though it makes for easier storytelling.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I totally agree. His characters were all recognizably human. Where were
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the entities with the equivalent of a truly alien intelligence, or with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an IQ of 1000? (Not of course in the sense of thinking 5-7 times faster
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than the average bright person on this list, but of having many times
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the difference in conceptualizing power than an Einstein or a Wolfram
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has over a 100 IQ drone.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Where were the &quot;Jupiter-sized brains&quot; so beloved of the Extropians and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Transhumanists?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Vinge would say, apropos of your &quot;easier storytelling&quot; point, that such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; minds are on the other side of some flavor of Singularity, with little
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to say except to say that there are &quot;Entities&quot; out there, brooding and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thinking their deep alien thoughts like some kind of unseen Lovecraft
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; monster.
