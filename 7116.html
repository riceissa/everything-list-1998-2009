Jonathan Colvin writes, regarding the Doomsday argument:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There's a simple answer to that one. Presumably, a million years from now in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Galactic Empire, the Doomsday argument is no longer controversial, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it will not be a topic for debate. The fact that we are all debating the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Doomsday argument implies we are all part of the reference class: (people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; debating the doomsday argument), and we perforce can not be part of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Galactic Empire.
</em><br />
<br />Well, I don't want to open up discussion of the DA.  Suffice it to say
<br />
that good thinkers have spent considerable amounts of time considering
<br />
it and don't necessarily think that this reply puts it to bed.
<br />
<a href="http://www.anthropic-principle.com">http://www.anthropic-principle.com</a> has an exhaustive discussion.
<br />
<br />[Regarding measure and size]
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I find these conclusions counter-intuitive enough to suggest that deriving
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure from a physical fraction of involved reasources is not the correct
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way to derive measure. It is not unlike trying to derive the importance of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; book by weighing it.
</em><br />
<br />Don't be too eager to throw out this concept of measure.  It is
<br />
fundamental to the Schmidhuber and Tegmark approach to the multiverse.
<br />
It allows deriving why induction works as well as Occam's razor.
<br />
It explains why the universe is lawful and has a simple description.
<br />
It allows us in principle to calculate how likely we are to be in The
<br />
Matrix or some such simulation vs a basement-level universe.  It is
<br />
quite an amazing quantity of results from such a simple assumption.
<br />
I don't think you will find anything else like it in philosophy.
<br />
<br />As far as the specific issue of measure and size, suppose you agree
<br />
that making copies of a structure increases its measure, but you object
<br />
to the idea that scaling up its size would do so.  Years ago I came up
<br />
with a thought experiment that adopted the position you have, that size
<br />
doesn't matter.  (That's what my wife kept telling me, after all...)
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From that I proved that copies didn't matter either, which wasn't too
</em><br />
appealing.  Today I would say that my premise was wrong.  Size matters.
<br />
<br />Here is a simple example.  Suppose we have a book in a computer memory.
<br />
Now we make two copies of the book in memory.  Perhaps you will agree
<br />
that this increases its measure.  Maybe the measure doubles, or maybe
<br />
it doesn't go up quite that much, but it does increase.
<br />
<br />Now suppose we arrange the two copies interleaved in memory.  Instead of
<br />
&quot;It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...&quot; in two places,
<br />
we have &quot;IItt  wwaass  tthhee  bbeesstt  ooff  ttiimmeess...&quot;.  Is this
<br />
still two copies, or is it one copy with extra big data representation?
<br />
The difference is not so clear.  This should suggest, maybe there isn't
<br />
any difference in terms of measure of the two cases.
<br />
<br />I have several other examples I have used as well.  In one I have a
<br />
pair of electronic computers running exactly the same program side by
<br />
side, in lockstep.  This is two instances and arguably the program has
<br />
larger measure.  Now I attach wires between the corresponding parts
<br />
of the electronic circuits that make up the computers.  Point A in the
<br />
left computer is attached to point A in the right computer, and so on
<br />
for every circuit element. These wires have variable resistance that
<br />
can be smoothly changed from full conductivity to perfect insulation.
<br />
<br />When the wires are insulated, there is no interaction between the two
<br />
computers and there are two copies.  When the wires are conductive, the
<br />
corresponding circuit elements are electrically joined so the system acts
<br />
like a single computer that is twice as big.  By varying the resistance
<br />
we can smoothly go from one case to the other.
<br />
<br />Imagine a conscious program running on this system.  When there are two
<br />
computers, perhaps there are two conscious entities, each with their
<br />
unique identity.  When there is only one computer, there is only one
<br />
consciousness.  Yet we can switch smoothly between the two.  We can go
<br />
from two people to one and back!  How much sense does that make?
<br />
<br />I wouldn't put it like that today, but if we just focus on measure,
<br />
we again go from a pair of computations to a computation that is twice
<br />
as big.  It makes sense that the two cases would have the same measure.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From these and other thought experiments I find that it is not as
</em><br />
surprising as it seems at first to imagine that increasing size increases
<br />
measure.  The fact that it follows immediately from Schmidhuber's simple
<br />
principle only came to me recently.  I find it interesting and provocative
<br />
that these two independent arguments lead to the same conclusion.
