<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;ultimate reality that the everday world can only imperfectly approximate.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This is a perfect example of what I'm complaining about. The quote implies 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that the term &quot;Platonism&quot; can be used as just another term for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;mathematical realism&quot;, but then it immediately provides a definition that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;goes beyond simple mathematical realism. The belief that mathematical

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;entities exist independently of the human mind - that humans discover

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mathematics rather than invent it - does not automatically entail the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;belief that there's a &quot;heaven of ideas&quot; containing (say) the Essence of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Horseness which everyday horses only imperfectly approximate. These two 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ideas are logically distinct, and it seems sensible to call them by two 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;different names. I prefer &quot;mathematical realism&quot; and &quot;essentialism&quot;, or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;maybe &quot;Platonic essentialism&quot;. I'd prefer not to use the term &quot;Platonism&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;all by itself, but if I had to use it, I'd use it to refer to &quot;Platonic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;essentialism&quot;, not &quot;mathematical realism&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Perhaps you could say more on &quot;Platonic essentialism&quot;, but I would have 
<br />
attributed the beginning
<br />
of Essentialism to the Aristotle reading of Plato. Plato is too vague on 
<br />
these question imo. Aristotle essentialism is much more clear especially 
<br />
through the development of modal logic (Aristotle's invention). But it is a 
<br />
complex problem which I find premature.
<br />
Quine criticized the use of quantifier in modal logic because, he argues, 
<br />
this would reintroduce essentialism in the scientific field. Comp is 
<br />
vaccinated in that respect because the modal logic G and G* have quantifier 
<br />
entirely defined by their arithmetical interpretations, so that there is a 
<br />
clear non essentialist view of them, and at the same time, it explains why 
<br />
some form of essentialism is just inevitable once we listen to the (sound) 
<br />
machine's point of view.
<br />
Note that in my these I have not use the Gq and Gq* (G and G* first order 
<br />
extension).
<br />
Ruth Barcan Marcus wrote a book on that 
<br />
Quantifier-in-modal-logic/essentialism question. See
<br />
<a href="http://www.fordham.edu/gsas/phil/klima/ESSENCE.HTM">http://www.fordham.edu/gsas/phil/klima/ESSENCE.HTM</a> for a nice link with 
<br />
references.
<br />
Now I agree with you, let us avoid the use of the term &quot;platonism&quot; (only 
<br />
mathematicians use it for (mathematical) realism. Note that I avoid it most 
<br />
of the time, but I could defend it's use as well, giving that Pythagore and 
<br />
Plato have appreciate it so much.  With comp, note, there is a sense to say 
<br />
that not only the &quot;almost-one-horse lives&quot; in Platonia, but all possible 
<br />
apparently concrete one too.
<br />
But that is probably a good reason to avoid the terme &quot;platonism&quot; before 
<br />
being sure everyone grasp that aspect of comp.
<br />
Sometimes I define an arithmetical realist as someone who believes in all 
<br />
the the propositions of the form (A or not A) with A an arithmetical 
<br />
proposition. That's enough for my use of the term. G. Boolos make a case 
<br />
that there is no notion of &quot;alternative world&quot; without the use of the (A or 
<br />
not A) exclude middle propositions.  I have order his book &quot;logic, logic 
<br />
and logic&quot; and don't know yet his argument, which I find a priori 
<br />
astonishing giving that you can do (and people does that) intuitionistic 
<br />
modal logic (that is manage a notion of possible world without the exclude 
<br />
middle principle).
<br />
To finish, Kory, I would avoid the term &quot;essentialist&quot; giving that its 
<br />
modern philosophical use is more precise than our admittedly rather 
<br />
imprecise use of it. It is better not to use the word more precisely than 
<br />
the way we are using them ....
<br />
This reminds me one of my favorite replies by Bruno in the (not so well 
<br />
known) &quot;Sylvie and Bruno&quot; by Lewis Carroll. By memory:
<br />
There was a herd of sheeps near Bruno who was talking with the Professor 
<br />
somewhere in the country, and Bruno said &quot;oh, look there is about 1004 
<br />
sheeps there in the field&quot;. The Professor told him that he should not say 
<br />
&quot;about 1004&quot; but &quot;about 1000&quot; giving that &quot;about&quot; is in contradiction with 
<br />
the precise use of &quot;4&quot;. Bruno replied that he was absolutely sure about the 
<br />
four, seeing them near here, and that he was using the &quot;about&quot; concerning 
<br />
the use of &quot;1000&quot;  giving that he could hardly be sure of that!
<br />
Since, I am used to call that error (suspected by the Professor in Bruno's 
<br />
exclamation), the 1004 error:
<br />
It is the error consisting of using words in a way more precise than the 
<br />
way you are using them.
<br />
Not all jargon are 1004 errors, but 1004 errors lead always in the limit 
<br />
toward jargon.
<br />
Kory, I am not pretending that your are &quot;jargoning&quot; but I would like to 
<br />
avoid the risk of pointing to the essentialist debate too early, especially 
<br />
without the modal logical tools. But I will try to avoid &quot;platonism&quot;, and 
<br />
this should indeed make me and CMR more alike with respect to the ontology.
<br />
This is equivalent to say yes in the test for &quot;platonism&quot; given in the 
<br />
Podnieks page.
<br />
CMR, do you believe that a running program (on an ideal computer) will 
<br />
stop, or will not stop?
<br />
<br />Bruno
