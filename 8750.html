<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In the UDA it is said that the Correct Level Of Substitution (I'll 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; call is CLOS for short) is unknowable.  I agree: Just intuitively, in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a closed system, how could we know if something wasn't exactly right?  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It would result in the future being different than it would have been, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but we wouldn't be aware of the difference.  We would just accept that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as reality.
</em><br />
<br /><br />But smoking a cigarette or drinking tea or things like that also result 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;in the future being different, and in those case many will still say 
<br />
they did survive the cigarette, tea, ... And those possible different 
<br />
stories are of a type such that it is reasonable to say the CLOS 
<br />
(Correct Level of Substitution) has been chosen, despite you are right 
<br />
we cannot know it.
<br />
More apt to share your intuition here would be &quot;agnosic mental 
<br />
disease&quot;, where, for example,  someone get blind after some use of 
<br />
(classical) teleportation, but get also amnesic relatively to 
<br />
everything concerning vision. He would say &quot;I did perfectly survive&quot; 
<br />
although we could have reasonable doubt it is so.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Since the CLOS is unknowable, then we should be able to talk about an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unknowable, yet true, probability P(CLOS) that each substitution is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; done at the CLOS.
</em><br />
<br />I think it would be foolish to choose the LOS (the level of 
<br />
substitution) in any probabilistic way. Real doctors will argue for 
<br />
some level with argument from biology or physics. If he knows &quot;comp&quot; 
<br />
and its consequences, he will know that nothing can give certainty in 
<br />
this matter.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; By the way, we know at least P(CLOS) &lt; 1 because the doctor is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; guessing, ...
</em><br />
<br />I could temporarily agree.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; ... and P(CLOS) = 1 would implies that the doctor knows and can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; actually implement it.
</em><br />
<br />Not at all. Suppose some doctor choose the right level, which exists by 
<br />
comp. The doctor will not know it, as we already agree on that point. 
<br />
Still, platonistically P(CLOS) = 1.
<br />
Look at this analogy: I give you a dice and ask to bet on the result 
<br />
you can get. You can tell me you will get six with probability = 1/6. 
<br />
*I* could know that the dice is unfair or corrupted, and that the real 
<br />
probability is, let us say 1/2. For the CLOS, nobody (even Gods) can 
<br />
know the real probability, but for the derivation of the LAWS of 
<br />
physics, we need just to compute the probability for all the CLOS, 
<br />
given that the Universal Dovetailer generates all your continuations at 
<br />
all correct levels, by construction.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK, so now for my question.  So when we talk about finding a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probability measure on the 1-determinancy (I don't know if that's the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exact right words),
</em><br />
<br />I guess you were meaning 1-indeterminacy.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't we have to multiply this probability measure by the unknown 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; P(CLOS) to get the actual probability measure?
</em><br />
<br />Sure. Except that nobody will ever computes those exact &quot;actual 
<br />
probability measure&quot;. It would be like computing the weather 
<br />
probabilities by computing the Feynman Integral on all particles/waves 
<br />
of the planet earth together with the probabilities that Feynman got 
<br />
the right integral + the probability that I am not dreaming, etc. (this 
<br />
mix unfaithfully the different sorts of uncertainty).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But this would imply that the probability measure is impossible to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; find out to any degree that would be called scientific, since it is a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; function of P(CLOS), i.e. the step of faith in saying &quot;Yes&quot; to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doctor who doesn't know anything.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You are confusing perhaps two levels of uncertainties. The probability 
<br />
measure could be computable if comp is true. What is impossible is to 
<br />
know the probability are the correct one, except we can test this 
<br />
experimentally. We can still believe correctly in those probabilities, 
<br />
and this, for sure, without knowing we are correct. It is the same with 
<br />
physics. We cannot know for sure that QM is a or the correct theory, 
<br />
but this does not prevent us to bet on it, and then to use its 
<br />
probability theory. No serious scientist will take into account that QM 
<br />
could be false to change the probabilities implied by it. If QM makes a 
<br />
wrong prediction, QM will be refuted, nobody will correct it simply by 
<br />
multiplying the QM uncertainties by some higher level of 
<br />
epistemological uncertainty. I think.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In fact, if each moment is equivalent to a substitution (not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessarily at the CLOS!), as comp says, then there would be an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exponential decay of our identity, as sort of identity entropy.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Sure. That's almost a proof &quot;by the absurd&quot;, that we should be very 
<br />
careful before mixing type of uncertainty.
<br />
Remember that the goal will not even consist in deriving some tools for 
<br />
computing the comp proba, but consists in deriving the mathematical 
<br />
structure of those comp-proba, so as to compare them with the empirical 
<br />
QM proba.
