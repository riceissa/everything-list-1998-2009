I make a comment on Wei Dai, as quoted by Hal Finney, and then I Hal 
<br />
Finney's answer.
<br />
<br /><br />Le 14-juil.-05, à 23:03, Hal Finney a écrit :
<br />

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; One day, Earth is contacted by a highly advanced alien civilization, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; they tell us that contrary to what most of us think is likely, not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; all of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the fundamental physical laws of our universe are computable.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I recall that the comp hyp (I am a machine) entails that the apparent 
<br />
universe cannot be the result of a computation (but can appear (first 
<br />
personally) *through* the infinite execution of a non terminating 
<br />
computation like UD* (the infinite trace of the Universal Dovetailer).
<br />
I have discussed this at length with Schmidhuber on this list, but he 
<br />
dismissed the 1-3 difference so we were not able to progress.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Furthermore,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; they claim to be able to manufacture black boxes that work as oracles 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the Halting Problem of Turing machines (one query per hour). They give
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; us one free sample, and want to sell us more at a reasonable price. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of course we won't be allowed to open up the boxes and look inside to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; find out how they work.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; So our best scientists test the sample black box in every way that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; can think of, but can't find any evidence that it isn't exactly what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the aliens claim it is. At this point many people are ready to believe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the claim and spend their hard earned money to buy these devices for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; their families.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hal Finney:So in terms of induction, the situation is that we do test 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; after test
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to see if this box acts as a halting-problem oracle (HPO, we always
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; need more 3 letter acronyms around here).  And it passes all the tests.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So then we apply induction and say, since it's acted like an HPO in our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tests, we will go ahead and assume that it really is an HPO.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The problem is that HPOs are theoretically impossible.  We have a proof
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of it, in fact we have a lot of proofs.  So how do we reconcile this?
</em><br />
<br /><br />I guess you mean that &quot;testing HPO&quot; is theoretically impossible. I 
<br />
agree with comp. But some &quot;hyperturing&quot; thesis we could test HPO (the 
<br />
fact that nobody can give a protocol for testing HPO in a finite time 
<br />
suggests that &quot;hyperturing thesis&quot; could be non plausible.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, one possibility is that the proof is invalid.  It's a pretty
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simple proof so we look at its assumptions.  Fundamentally it assumes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that computation is a finitary process.  We can only do a finite amount
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of computation in a finite time.
</em><br />
<br /><br />This is equivalent to the comp hyp.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To act as a real HPO it would seem to be necessary for the box in some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way to deal with infinities.  There would have to be an actual infinity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in there somewhere.
</em><br />
<br /><br />... and in &quot;our head&quot; to understand the HPO. Note that a test exists in 
<br />
the limit by computing the OMEGA Chaitin number (through an infinite 
<br />
always self-correcting procedure which stabilize in a non constructive 
<br />
way).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But again, we generally assume that there are no actual infinities.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In physics they are called singularities, which means places where the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; laws of physics break down.  In fact even the prospect of an actual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; infinity in a theory is seen as a sign that the theory is wrong or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; incomplete.  Relativity puts singularities at the center of black 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; holes,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but it is assumed that quantum gravity will fix these, in fact this is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one of the main motivations for work on quantum gravity.
</em><br />
<br />OK.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Disbelief in actual infinities, like disbelief in HPOs, is not really
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rooted in observation and induction.  We don't disbelieve in them 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simply
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because our universe seems to be devoid of them.  In fact, on the face
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of things there is evidence that actual infinities may really exist in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our universe.  Relativity theory has its infinites; there are quantum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; models which hint at the possibility as well, and even old fashioned
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Newtonian gravitation on point particles, like is studied in high 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; school
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics, implicitly embeds infinities and can construct an HPO.
</em><br />
<br /><br />That is right. Mathematically HPO and actual infinities are not 
<br />
obviously inconsistent. They are obviously consistent for those who 
<br />
believe in the consistency of ZF (Zermelo Fraenkel Set Theory).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But still,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nobody believes that this stuff will work.  It's always assumed to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a mistake which future work will correct.  (Google hypercomputers or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; super-Turing computers for some theoretical models of HPOs.)
</em><br />
<br /><br />(Note, in passing, that G and G* remains sound and complete for those 
<br />
hyper-turing machine. Actually what I call comp could be called in that 
<br />
contest omega-comp. I think (but don't have a full detailed proof of 
<br />
it) that for all constructive (Church-Kleene) ordinal alpha, the logic 
<br />
of self-reference (G and G*) remains stable for alpha-comp. Solovay's 
<br />
proof makes it possible to get proper extensions of G and G* for 
<br />
strong, non constructivist generalization of provability, like &quot;being 
<br />
true in all *transitive* models of ZF&quot;.
<br />
Of course &quot;&quot;being true in just all  models of ZF&quot;, is equivalent, by 
<br />
Godel's COMPLETENESS (not incompleteness) theorem to provable in ZF, 
<br />
and this leads to completeness and soundness of G and G*.
<br />
Let me quote the footnote 28 of mùy sane paper:
<br />
<br />[G and G* are sound and complete for larger systems, and can be 
<br />
enriched for providing non-comp notion of belief, for example Solovay 
<br />
got that G together with the formulas B(BX-&gt;BY) v B(BY-&gt;(BX&amp;X)) gives a 
<br />
system which is sound and complete for the (set theory) propositions 
<br />
which are true in all transitive models of ZF (Zermelo Fraenkel set 
<br />
theory).  For a proof see Boolos 1993. Solovay got also that G together 
<br />
with the formulas B(BX-&gt;Y)vB((BY &amp;Y)-&gt;X) captures in the same way the 
<br />
propositions true in all models  VKappa with kappa an inaccessible 
<br />
(rather big) cardinal. In case we find, as a measure on the consistent 
<br />
histories, a consistent subset of physics, but don’t find all of 
<br />
physics, making comp false, similar Solovay extensions of G and G* 
<br />
could provide psychologies of some “non machine” notions. See R. M. 
<br />
Solovay (1976): “Provability Interpretation of Modal Logic,” Israel 
<br />
Journal of Mathematics, 25:287-304.]
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So where does our disbelief come from?  Why are we so skeptical?  We 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have very good grounds from observation.  The mere fact that we've 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; never
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seen X isn't strong evidence that X doesn't exist.  We discover new 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all the time, amazing things.  Why should HPOs be any different?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It seems that our disbelief in HPOs and in other manifestations of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; infinity is somehow rooted in mathematics itself.  We have an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instinctive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aversion to the possibility of an actual infinity existing as something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we can interact with.  We believe that mathematics is essentially a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; finite endeavor, at least in terms of how it manifests in the real 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Note that you talk a little bit as you were (again?) postulating the 
<br />
existence of a real world, when in other post you acknowledge the 
<br />
interest of deriving it from the observer-moments.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And yet there are plenty of mathematical models of infinities.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The study of transfinites is a very active part of set theory, in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fact it is entirely what makes set theory non-trivial.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Likewise, with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the super-Turing work people have constructed hierarchies of ever more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; powerful infinity machines.  So there is no dearth of mathematical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; models
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to deal with infinities.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In response to early work on transfinites the mathematical school 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; called
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constructivism arose.  Constructivists reject most of mathematics that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deals with infinities.  I am not too familiar with the history but I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; believe that they were concerned about the many potential paradoxes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and the possibility that our intuition was a poor guide to truth in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; treacherous waters of the transfinites.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Constructionism has not gained much ground among mathematicians;
</em><br />
<br /><br />The problem for the constructionist is that the work they do find 
<br />
terribly interesting applications in non-constructive mathematics! 
<br />
There is a fertile back and forth between constructive and 
<br />
non-constructive mathematics.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I get the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; impression that it's just not that much fun to do math that way.  But 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seems to accord well with our instincts about the world.  Perhaps we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could say that it is all very well for the mathematicians to construct
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; their transfinite castles in the air, but when it comes to reality,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we are constructionists.
</em><br />
<br /><br />This is *very* debatable.
<br />
1) A down to earth problem on the braids group has been solved by using 
<br />
large cardinals.
<br />
2) Girard succeeds in blurring the distinction between constructive/non 
<br />
constructive. In some sense classical linear or quantum  logics are 
<br />
more constructive than constructive linear logics.
<br />
3) George Boolos, commenting a solution of a puzzle by Smullyan, shows 
<br />
that decision theory needs non classical thought (like the excluded 
<br />
middle principle).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Wei Dai: Fortunately, the Artificial Intelligence in charge of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; protecting Earth from interstellar fraud refuses to allow this. Having
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; been programmed with UD+ASSA (see Hal Finney's 7/10/2005 post for a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; good explanation of what this means), it proclaims that there is zero
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; probability that Halting Problem oracles can exist, so it must be pure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; chance that the sample black box has correctly answered all the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; queries
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; submitted to it so far.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The moral of this story is that our intuitive notion of induction is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; fully captured by the formalization of UD+ASSA. Contrary to UD+ASSA, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; will not actually refuse to believe in the non-existence of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; uncomputable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; phenomena no matter what evidence we see.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Our theories say that it can't happen.  Yet in this case we have an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observation where it seems like it does happen.  So what do we do?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It helps in the analysis to distinguish what people actually do from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what they &quot;should&quot; ideally do.  People are imperfect reasoning machines
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and there is no fundamental or theoretical interest in explicating 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; every
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; detail of what they believe and what they don't.  No doubt it would be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible to build up a complete formal theory and model of a given 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; human
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain that would fully explain how it does induction, full of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; complicated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rules and contradictions.  That's not the interesting question.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The harder question is, what *should* we do, in this situation?  I see
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; two possibilities.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One is to hold to our theories.  No matter how many times we see
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this machine work, we disbelieve it.  We assume it is a trick.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />But concerning the HPO I don't think we can do the test at all. We 
<br />
cannot know if the machine does the trick. If the machine solves and 
<br />
give the proof for the first 2^64 math problems corresponding to the 64 
<br />
first digit of Chaitin OMEGA, all we can conclude is that they are very 
<br />
advanced in math. Testing an HPO box just measure the advance of the 
<br />
extraterrestrial math. Even if they open the box and show us it is not 
<br />
just a summary (-la-OMEGA-Chaitin's way) of their &quot;annals of 
<br />
mathematics&quot;, we will not been able to understand it, or if we do, then 
<br />
the extra-terrestrial will indeed refute Church thesis and comp.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Others have suggested ways the trickery might be done.  It would be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; extremely difficult and technologically challenging, but not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; impossible.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; These tricks require effort that would be characterized by extremely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; large numbers, but not infinities.  If we are skeptical that they could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; put such large numbers together, we should be infinitely more skeptical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that they can manage infinities.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The other possibility is to change our theories, and apply induction.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Faced with the evidence of a machine that seems to work, we accept that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; maybe it really does work.  And if so, then our theories are wrong and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we need new ones.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is a hard course because of the peculiar grounding of the theories
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; involved.  As described above, they aren't based on observation.  They 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; much more fundamental.  They have to do with our deepest beliefs about 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nature of reality and perhaps even the nature of logic and mathematics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's questionable to me whether any finite set of observations in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; real
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world has the standing, the philosophical strength, to change our 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; beliefs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about the nature of something as ethereal and unphysical as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematics.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree, at least for a large part of math.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But maybe it's the right thing to do.  After all, our imperfections,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our existence as creatures of a mundane reality, make us prone to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; error.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We might be wrong about anything.  Arguably, an optimal induction 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; engine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stands ready to change any and every one of its pre-existing beliefs,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; when they are strongly enough contradicted by the evidence.  So perhaps
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we really should change our minds about mathematics, forget about that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constructionism nonsense, and accept that infinities exist and are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; real,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and here's one that we can touch and poke at.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; What can we do to repair this flaw? Using a variant of UD, based on a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; more powerful type of computer (say an oracle TM instead of a plain 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; TM),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; won't help because that just moves the problem up to a higher level of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the computational hierarchy. No matter what type of computer (call it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; C)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; we base UD' on, it will always assign zero probability to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; existence of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; even more power types of computer (e.g., ones that can solve the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; halting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; problem for C). Intuitively, this doesn't seem like a good feature.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Earlier on this mailing list, I had proposed that we skip pass the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; entire computational hierarchy and jump to the top of the set 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; theoretic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; hierarchy, by using a measure that is based a set theoretic notion of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; complexity instead of a computational one. In this notion, instead of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; defining the complexity of an object by the length of its shortest
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; algorithmic description, we define its complexity by the length of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; its shortest description in the language of a formal set theory. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; measure would be constructed in a manner analogous to UD, with each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; set theoretic description of an object contributing n^-l to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; measure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of the object, where n is the size of the alphabet of the set theory,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and l is the length of the description. Lets call this STUM for set
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; theoretic universal measure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Are you confident that this is well defined?  I understand 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Schmidhuber's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; approach: pick an arbitrary UTM, run a random program through it, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; take
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the bit pattern that comes out as the information object.  The fraction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of programs that produce a given information object is the measure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is there a similarly mechanical way of understanding the concept of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; object description in the language of set theory?  Can you sketch how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that would work?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Well, Tegmark tried but did not succeed. Of course you can list the 
<br />
definition of set object or of set of proof. But then &quot;computationnaly&quot; 
<br />
is it like working in very weak theory, and concerning proof, well this 
<br />
is not &quot;closable&quot; for the diagonalization procedure so this is 
<br />
&quot;forever&quot; a relative concept. Formally, if the proofs are checkable (in 
<br />
finite time) the invariant you can capture is already given by G and 
<br />
G*.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; STUM along with ASSA does a much better job of formalizing induction, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I recently realized that it still isn't perfect. The problem is that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; still assigns zero probability to some objects that we intuitively 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is very unlikely, but not completely impossible. An example would be a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; device that can decide the truth value of any set theoretic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; statement. A
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; universe that contains such a device would exist in the set theoretic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; hierarchy, but would have no finite description in formal set theory,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and would be assigned a measure of 0 by STUM.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I'm not sure where this line of thought leads. Is induction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; unformalizable? Have we just not found the right formalism yet? Or is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; our intuition on the subject flawed?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The mainstream view, I gather, is that induction is indeed 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unformalizable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The contrary claim, that induction can be formalized, would be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; considered
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; controversial.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Right, but this does not prevent mathematical analysis.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Another way to express the problem is to think of trying to build an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; optimal induction machine.  It could use Bayes theorem to update its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; beliefs, but what about the priors?  Same problem.  We could use the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Universal Prior but it gives probability 0 to HPOs.  Then there are all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; those other priors that implicitly assume infinite computation, so 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does it stop?  There are no end to infinities, and as Wei's example 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shows,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is apparently no place to stand once you start down that road.
</em><br />
<br />Mmh..., Prior, Bayes, ... required ASSA. But comp needs RSSA. (old 
<br />
discussion).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It would be absurd to suggest, say, that everything up to Aleph-23
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has Platonic existence, while infinities from Aleph-24 on up are mere
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mysticism.  Likewise, building a universe out of a UTM+HPO doesn't make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense because as Wei says, there is a 2nd-order HPO, an HPO2, which is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; beyond the scope of UTM+HPO, so what if the aliens show up with one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of those?
</em><br />
<br /><br />This rejoins my critics of Tegmark.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  For a multiverse model to make sense it has to be simple,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distinctive and (ideally) unique.  We don't quite achieve uniqueness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with the UDist (due to the arbitrary choice of a UTM which creates a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multiplicative constant difference on measure), which is a major flaw.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But adding oracles makes the problem infinitely worse.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here's what I conclude.  If we really believe in the Universal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Distribution, then we ascribe probability zero to HPOs.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree, except that methodologically, once we accept Church thesis, 
<br />
this is not something we can decide, we must prove that there is no 
<br />
other choice.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; That means
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that in Wei's story, indeed the aliens are tricking Earth.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Most probably (unless not comp).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If we try to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; imagine a universe where the aliens are legitimate and have real HPOs,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that is impossible.  We are just confusing ourselves if we think such a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe could be real.  There is no point in even considering thought
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiments based on it, any more than imagining what would happen if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aliens showed up with a logical formula which was obviously 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simultaneously
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; true and false.  So given that we stand upon the UDist, there is no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; need
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to pay much attention to these kinds of thought experiments.
</em><br />
<br />Nor with the UD ;)
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would suggest that evidence for or against the UDist should come
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more from the fields of mathematics and logic than from any empirical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience.
</em><br />
<br />Yes.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; My hope is that further study will lead to a computational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; model which is distinguished by its uniqueness and lack of ambiguity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That seems necessary for this kind of explanation of our existence to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be successful.
</em><br />
<br />ASSA + Udist:   I doubt it can work. But who knows?
<br />
RSSA + UD: they are &quot;concrete&quot; evidence it works. No?
