</em><br />
<br />It's precisely this issue that was my motivation for first posting to
<br />
this list on what has unfortunately been termed '1st-person primacy'.
<br />
In fact, all and any terms for what I've been attempting to point to
<br />
seem to be unfortunate because *all* our language is steeped in an
<br />
implicit assumption of an ontic dichotomy that does not in fact exist.
<br />
To repeat my original assertion (and I believe that this is valid
<br />
regardless of one's commitment to comp or materialism or whatever
<br />
else): whatever exists does so within a single ontic domain within
<br />
which distinctions of 'point of view' are merely contingent on which
<br />
side of an otherwise arbitrarily drawn line of distinction happens to
<br />
be making the report. What follows from this is that 'what appears to
<br />
exist' and 'what appearances refer to' are equally real (i.e. real in
<br />
the same sense) and equally aspects of this single domain.
<br />
<br />'What appears to exist' is that part of the domain that is playing the
<br />
role (at a given point) of a picture or model (or mirror, in your
<br />
terms) of another part to which it is informationally connected, and
<br />
with which it co-varies. 'What appearances refer to' - or as we usually
<br />
say 'what exists' - is then merely our term for the co-varying part. In
<br />
the special case where 'you' are one part, and 'I' am the other, it is
<br />
easier to see that the terms '1st'-' and '3rd-person' - or 'subjective'
<br />
and 'objective' - can be used alternatively in an analysis of the
<br />
situation, and that clearly no change in ontic status could logically
<br />
follow from this.
<br />
<br />I think we will never be able to engage with the issues you describe
<br />
until we realise that what we are faced with is a view from the inside
<br />
of a situation that has no outside. Our characterisation of 'what
<br />
exists' as 'outside' of 'what appears to exist' is the
<br />
sleight-of-intuition that introduces the fatal ontic duality. But there
<br />
is no such duality. We simply *are* this situation, and its
<br />
multifarious forms of differentiation comprise the structures from
<br />
which 'we', our 'experiences' and their 'referents' seamlessly emerge.
<br />
Our challenge as scientists is never to forget that our observations
<br />
and theories all point back at ourselves (there is no other direction).
<br />
If they don't account for 'what appears to exist' this is as great a
<br />
failing as inconsistency with 'what appearance refers to', since these
<br />
attributions are merely distinctions of emphasis in the analysis of any
<br />
given situation.
<br />
<br />You could call this the solipsism of the whole, because there is
<br />
nothing else. I know this is as clear as mud, because the language just
<br />
doesn't exist, and I lack the inspiration to introduce it, and my
<br />
hackneyed old terms just get hijacked into familiar and misleading
<br />
connotations. Oh well....

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; About solipsism I am not sure why you introduce the subject. It seems

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Explainning matter as a pattern of experiences , rather than in

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a &quot;stuffy&quot; way, is methodological solipsism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am doing a detailed look at the relationship between solipsism and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; science. I am writing it up...will post it on the list (if that's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK...it's not too big!) when it's Ok to read.. I am surprised at what I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; found. The feedback on solipsism is interesting...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Russel is right in the sense that 'as-if' instrumentalism seems to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; characterise scientific behaviour...where scientists act 'as-if' the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; external world existed. At the same time, the facts of neuroscience tell
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; us that scientific evidence arrives as contents of phenomenal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness, so science is, in fact, all about correlated appearances...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and it is an 'as-if' solipsism. That is, science is also acting 'as-if'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; solipsism ( as per &quot;1Z&quot; 'methodological solipsism) defines the route to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; knowledge but is actually in denial of solipsism!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The weird state that seems to be in place is that science is tacitly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; radically solipsistic in respect of what evidence is available (phenomenal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness is all there is), whilst scientist's actual behaviour denies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this solipsism and tacitly adopts the 'as-if' stance in respect of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence of an external world. The net affect is that the external world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is assumed to exist, consciousness is eschewed as evidence of anything in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; its own right and objectivity allows correlates of appearances within
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness to literally define the workings of the (assumed existent)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; external world. Science is a methodological-solispsist-in-denial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instrumentalism? whew!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This paradoxical situation I have analysed out and, I hope, straightened

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scientifically study phenomenal cosnciousness... which I think I have said
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; previously.... so many ways to get to the same place!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'll probably dump the text of 'Solipsism and Science' to the list
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tomorrow. Who'd have thought that in looking at AI i'd end up forced to

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; analyse solipsism in science?
