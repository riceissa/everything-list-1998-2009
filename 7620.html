<br />
One question I am uncertain about is this: how well could we test a
<br />
supposed halting-problem oracle (HPO) box?
<br />
<br />In particular I wonder, suppose it turns out that P=NP and that further
<br />
there is an efficient algorithm to solve any NP problem.  For those
<br />
unfamiliar with this terminology P means polynomial time, and we say
<br />
that problems in P can be solved efficiently.  NP means nondeterministic
<br />
polynomial time, and essentially this means that for problems in NP, we
<br />
can efficiently test a purported solution for correctness.  Whether P
<br />
is equal to NP or merely a subset of it is one of the major unsolved
<br />
problems of computer science.
<br />
<br />But what if the aliens have solved it, and (somewhat to our surprise)
<br />
the answer is that every NP problem can be efficiently solved.  And they
<br />
have embedded this NP solving algorithm (along with some other ones)
<br />
in the HPO box.
<br />
<br />My concern is that to test the HPO box we could for example give it
<br />
a problem we have solved and see if it gets the answer.  But success
<br />
might just imply that the HPO had substantially (but not astronomically)
<br />
greater computing power than the human race can bring to bear.  Or we
<br />
could give it a problem we can't solve and then check the answer the
<br />
HPO gives, but if the answer is testable that would mean it is in NP,
<br />
and so even success in this area could be explained if P=NP as above.
<br />
<br />It is much less philosophically challenging to imagine that P=NP than
<br />
to imagine that a true HPO could exist.  Things would be different if
<br />
we ever get a proof that P &lt; NP but we aren't in that situation now.
<br />
<br />Are there other tests we could give, harder ones, that could give us
<br />
evidence that it was a true HPO, that could not be fooled by an NP solver?
<br />
<br />My knowledge of these areas is pretty spotty.  The only non NP problem I
<br />
know of offhand is the travelling salesman problem, finding the shortest
<br />
path visiting everyone of a set of cities with specified distances
<br />
between each pair.  Proposed solutions cannot be tested efficiently,
<br />
as far as I know.  If the box solved travelling salesmen problems for
<br />
us, it might be a boon to salesmen but we would not necessarily know if
<br />
we were getting truly optimal paths.
<br />
<br />So in Wei's story, when the scientists go to test the HPO box, how strong
<br />
is the evidence that they can reasonably expect to get for it being a
<br />
real HPO?  And I suppose a practical point arises as well; even if it
<br />
is not a true HPO, if it is nevertheless able to solve every problem we
<br />
give it, it's probably worth the money!
