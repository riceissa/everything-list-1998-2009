<em class="quotelev1">&gt;remember reading Larry Niven's &quot;All the Myriad Ways&quot; around 1970 or

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;off the idea and began publishing a lot on it. (DeWitt assigned much

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;Everett-Wheeler-Graham&quot; theory. Way too charitable to Graham, I

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;think.)I learned of your list a while back, but wasn't 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;super-interested in what I thought (and partially still think) is a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;fanciful idea, akin to the late David Lewis' &quot;plurality of worlds&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;philosophy (that everything we can imagine must have reality). Saul 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Kripke's &quot;possible worlds&quot; work was more interesting, as it is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;closely linked to linguistics and AI and predictions about the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;future (&quot;If Oracle were to announce bad earnings tomorrow, then this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is what would probably happen,&quot; a possible worlds &quot;story&quot; which is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of course very close to some discussions of alternate _presents_. In 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;fact, no different, except more practical.)
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Mmh... Most people here have a good understanding of the &quot;many&quot;-idea, by which
<br />
I mean have realised that the idea of a unique universe is far more speculative
<br />
that O universe or many universe. I will not insist.
<br />
Perhaps you could read the very interesting paper by Louis Crane, 
<br />
which is quite
<br />
convincing on the importance of category theory in frames of quantum gravity+
<br />
observers, and which use cleverly Everett relative states. He even 
<br />
concludes that
<br />
his proposal can be seen as an attempt to fuse the many worlds with general
<br />
relativity. It is a paper by Crane entitled &quot;categorical physics&quot;. He gives
<br />
the TEX source somewhere on the net. (If you don't find it I can eventually
<br />
send you a photocopy). One day I will talk you about the work of Yetter on
<br />
models for non commutative linear logic. Yetter is at a relevent crossroad of
<br />
logic and physics imo. (Then I guess you heard about Crane, Kauffman Yetter
<br />
papers?)
<br />
About linguistic use of Kripke, most of them, imo, use technical approach
<br />
of language to explain problems ... away. Beware sophisticated tricks for
<br />
putting interesting (but hard) problems under the rug.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Personally, I'm not (yet) &quot;taking seriously&quot; either the David Lewis 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;plurality of worlds&quot; or Max Tegmark &quot;everything&quot; or Greg Egan &quot;all 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;topologies model&quot; ideas. At least not yet. I need to learn a lot 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;more of the language first.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I am more problem driven, and even &quot;mind-body&quot; problem driven. I gave an
<br />
argument in this list (argument on which my phd thesis is based) that 
<br />
IF we are machine then physics is utimately reducible to machine's 
<br />
psychology. The laws
<br />
of physics emerge from some collection of sharable &quot;dreams&quot; by machines, where
<br />
a dream is basically a computation seen from first person point of view.
<br />
And first person notion are captured by 1) memory, 2) S4 modal logic, 
<br />
3) toposes
<br />
(but only in my technical notes for the 3).
<br />
I hope you will continue to read my posts now that I confess that I am not
<br />
sure physics is the *fundamental* way to get a TOE. Still, my favorite theory
<br />
is quantum mechanics, so much that I want to provide serious foundation for it.
<br />
Looking at nature, and other empirical evidence is not enough serious for me!
<br />
I may be wrong, or the computationalist hypothesis may be wrong, don't depress
<br />
to quickly ;) Thesis and links in my URL below.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I saw a streaming video talk given by the topologist Michael 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Freedman at MSRI. URL for his talk &quot;Anyons in Mathematics, Computer 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Science, and Physics&quot; is:
</em><br />
<a href="http://www.msri.org/publications/ln/msri/2000/subfactors/freedman/1/">http://www.msri.org/publications/ln/msri/2000/subfactors/freedman/1/</a>
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Some interesting stuff on quantum computation and the braid 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;category, but inasmuch as I know even less about knots than about 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;category theory, I can't say much about his work.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Thanks, I will look at it.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt;Have you read Everett?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Hugh Everett, I assume you mean. Yes, indeed. I have the book edited 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;by Bryce DeWitt and Neill Graham, &quot;The Many-Worlds Interpretation of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Quantum Mechanics,&quot; 1973. I think this is how many in the physics 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;community encountered MWI, through DeWitt's late 60s, early 70s 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;re-analysis.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes. Note that Everett just abandons the wave collapse postulate. The &quot;many-
<br />
world&quot; expression came latter (through DeWitt I think, indeed). I mean what
<br />
Everett proposed is a new theory, not a new interpretation of a theory.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Ironically, my general relativity instructor at UC Santa Barbara was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Jim Hartle, known then (1973) for his work on photon black holes and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;such, and later famous for collaborations with Gell-Mann on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;consistent histories&quot; and 'wave function of the universe&quot; and with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Hawking.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Even before, Hartle makes the same derivation as Graham, about the same time.
<br />
Consistent histories are good ways to tackle QM basic problem seriously. I have
<br />
appreciated the work of Savvidou, a student of Isham. Savvidou's 
<br />
thesis is available
<br />
on Los Alamos archive. You have been lucky having Hartle as intructors :)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt;Quite important. He just embeds the physicist in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;physical world. My own work is a (radical) generalisation of that idea
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;in the sense that I embed the &quot;arithmetician&quot; in the arithmetical world,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;making it a first order citizen.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Sounds intriguing. I'm currently less-focused on the role of human 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(or machine) observers.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Ah, but if you search for a TOE, you will never get rid of the human, 
<br />
or machine or
<br />
whatever sort of observers ....
<br />
And honestly TOPOSES are objective approach toward the subject and its horizon.
<br />
I disagree with Smolin use of topos for dismissing the &quot;other&quot; worlds. That is
<br />
just a modern reinstantiation of the solipsistic move. What exist is 
<br />
what I feel?
<br />
I am much more platonist than that! ('course Smolin book is very 
<br />
nice, but I don't
<br />
follow him on that point).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Isham makes an excellent point about time-varying sets, echoed by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Smolin. In a nutshell, while the logic of a quantum universe (or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;cosmological universe, perhaps) may follow a Heyting logic where 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;the cat is neither alive nor dead,&quot; once _any_ observation or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;measurement, whether a machine or a written note or a memory or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;whatever, then the logic is Boolean, as we &quot;are used to.&quot;
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now obviously we're all familiar with this as the basic &quot;measurement 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;collapses the wave function&quot; model, so there is at first glance 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;nothing new here (you skeptics out there are right to be skeptical). 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;However, the topos-theoretical point of view, in which topos logic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(Heyting) is used instead of Boolean logic, seems to me to make the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;interpretation&quot; problem (Copenhagen vs. MWI vs. Cramer vs. ...) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;largely go away.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Everett clearly proposed a new *formulation* of QM. Just SWE (+ math decor).
<br />
The collapse of the wave packet has never been succesfully explained. 
<br />
It introduces
<br />
a cut subject/object which has never been succesfully defined. To use 
<br />
TOPOS against
<br />
Everett formulation is like using an electronical microscope to 
<br />
sharpen a flint.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I just wish mathematicians would do more of what John Baez in his 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;papers: show the reader the motivations.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Gosh...I wish too. But for some mathematicians, transparent 
<br />
motivations are just
<br />
forbidden, alas!
<br />
<br /><br />Bruno
<br />
<br />PS
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Another nice book on toposes for logically minded reader is the book
<br />
by J.L. BELL &quot;Toposes and Local Set Theories&quot; (Oxford Science Publications,
<br />
Clarendon Press 1988). It is the same Bell who wrote an important paper
<br />
on &quot;a new approach of quantum logic&quot; which plays some role in my work 
<br />
(ref in the
<br />
thesis). It is not the J.S. BELL of BELL's inequality.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) The notion of categoricalness for a model in logic is not 
<br />
related to category theory.
