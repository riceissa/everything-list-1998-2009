<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the sake of the argument.
</em><br />
<br />So, while the contents of my experience...the things that I'm
<br />
conscious OF are complex and structured, my conscious experience of
<br />
these things is singular and indivisible.
<br />
<br />As such, I feel that it is reasonable to say that conscious experience
<br />
itself is uncaused and fundamental.
<br />
<br />Given that conscious experience is uncaused, it can't be explained in
<br />
terms of other things, like quarks and electromagnetism or numbers and
<br />
arithmetic.
<br />
<br />Uncaused things can't be explained.  They just are.
<br />
<br />So what causes the complexity and structure of the things that I am
<br />
conscious of?  Nothing.  That's just the way my experience is.
<br />
<br />No explanation can be given for uncaused fundamental events or
<br />
entities.  And further, no meaningful explanation can be given for
<br />
events or entities that are themselves *wholly* caused by uncaused
<br />
events.  These things just are.
<br />
<br />So let's say a closed system of entities comes into being uncaused.
<br />
Any properties that the individual components of this system have are
<br />
also uncaused, and the ways that the components interact are uncaused
<br />
as well.  This system is a universe unto itself.
<br />
<br />So I am saying that no matter how this system evolves, no aspect of
<br />
the system can ever be given a meaningful explanation.  The
<br />
meaningless of it's initial state means that all subsequent states are
<br />
equally meaningless in an absolute sense.  All that we can do is
<br />
describe what the system does.  But description is not explanation.
<br />
Further, even if the system seems predictable, there is no reason to
<br />
think that it will continue in it's predicitablity.  And neither is
<br />
there any reason to think that it won't continue it's predictable
<br />
pattern.  The system follows it's own &quot;uncaused&quot; rules, which we may
<br />
be able to guess at, but which we cannot know, due to the system's
<br />
fundamentally uncaused nature.
<br />
<br />I think this is more obvious if you look at the system as a &quot;block
<br />
universe&quot;, where time is treated as a sort of spatial dimension, and
<br />
so all states of the system exist simultaneously, like my previous
<br />
example of the block of granite.  Why does state B follow state A?
<br />
Why is slice B adjacent to slice A?  Because that's just the way this
<br />
uncaused system is.
<br />
<br />Looking for meaning in the system is like looking for hidden messages
<br />
in randomly generated character strings.  You may find them, but the
<br />
messages can not have any real meaning, no matter how meaningful they
<br />
look.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In the conclusion I don't understand the last sentence, which seems to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; me a proposition for abandoning theorizing in that field.
</em><br />
<br />Well, the search for a theoretical model that is fully consistent what
<br />
what we consciously observed is still a reasonable goal in terms of
<br />
challenging intellectual endeavor.  And if that's what your future
<br />
conscious experiences hold for you, then that's what you will do (no
<br />
free will here).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Machines are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; more fundamental than consciousness?  Or machines are just a way of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; representing conscious experience?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Machines/numbers cannot represent conscious experiences.
</em><br />
<br />You are correct, I misspoke.  I should have said &quot;machines are just a
<br />
way of representing the CONTENTS of conscious experience.&quot;
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Comp can make the conscious experience much more fundamental than the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Aristotelian materialist usually think, yet consciousness is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arithmetically &quot;caused&quot;. It is an attribute of universal machine (in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an even weaker sense than usual) related to their ideal self-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consistency. It generates the belief in a reality, and the infinities
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of corrections which ensue.
</em><br />
<br />To me this has as much of an &quot;explanatory gap&quot; as materialism.
<br />
Consciousness is caused by arithmetical relationships?  Why would this
<br />
be?  Why would arithmetical relationships result in conscious
<br />
experience?
