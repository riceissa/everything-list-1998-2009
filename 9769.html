<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Actually I was about to say that nominal question are suggestive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (anybody can answer by principle of a mailing list), and nominal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; question when thread interferes makes possible to send less
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; mails. But I agree here I miss miserably ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not sure what mistake you think you made  :-)
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I see what you mean :)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;   but whatever, it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could not have been very important.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Well thanks :)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I take the opportunity to ask you Lee what is your expectation in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; front
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of the running of a Universal Dovetailer?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, I once got fairly up to speed on the subject of the UD (i.e.,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I understood it about half as well as you, Hal, Schmidhuber, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the rest of the gang here), but it just didn't grab my enthusiasm.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Given that Plato School has been closed for more than 1500 years, and 
<br />
that Aristotelian Naturalism is still the common dogma of most 
<br />
scientist, I do not expect so much *enthusiasm*.
<br />
Just trying to share plausible *understanding*.
<br />
As for some practical possible consequences I am not such much 
<br />
enthusiast myself, but then I don't put QM in the trash, despite the A 
<br />
bomb.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So I will take the liberty of imagining a scenario that may have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a (small) chance of answering your question.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Fair enough.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I find out that some aliens have set up a colony on the moon.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Worse, they've subscribed to the everything list, and having
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; never had had the notion before on their home planet, are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; designing---AND INTENDING TO CUT LOOSE---a Universal Dovetailer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; made from some weird computronium substance!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This will either be very good news, or very bad news, because the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; compute speed of their substance is utterly incredible. If they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; turn the damned thing on for even one whole second, it's easy to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; calculate that any given human being will have most of his solar
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; system OMs generated by it, all his life on Earth relegated to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relative insignificance.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think that I would be in favor. Because I am having a good life
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (i.e. better than one-percent worth living), and believe than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; human happiness derives mostly from chemicals in the brain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; produced by genetic settings.  So most of the copies of Lee
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Corbin that are generated by the UD should, on the average,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; also have good lives.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (It's possible that even miserable people reading this can find
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; solace in supposing that their genetic setting are not an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intrinsic part of their identity, and that in most instantiations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in most universes, their lives are rather good.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But alas, that's the limit of my knowledge about the UD.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Mmmhhh...
<br />
Given that you told me your lack of enthusiasm for the UD, it will be 
<br />
hard for me to give a detailed comment. But don't hesitate to ask me 
<br />
any explanation for the following statements:
<br />
<br />1) the UD needs to run forever to get any interfering probabilistic 
<br />
influence of first person destiny.
<br />
<br />(Actually, IF Hal Finney UDIST (universal distribution based on 
<br />
Kolmogorov complexity was correct in eliminating both the third person 
<br />
rabbits *and* the first person rabbits, a case could be made that a 
<br />
sufficiently large portion of the UD's trace would be enough, but this 
<br />
needs more work to be make precise ...).
<br />
<br />2) You did agree (don't ask me to find the post :) that the proposition 
<br />
&quot;W or M&quot; was the correct *first person* bet on the most close immediate 
<br />
future personal sensation in the destructive self-duplication 
<br />
experiment, where you are destroyed in Brussels and reconstituted in 
<br />
both Washington and Moscou (with our without delays ?). W is for &quot;I 
<br />
will feel to be in Washington&quot;, and W = &quot;I will feel to be in Moscow&quot;.
<br />
&quot;W or M&quot; is always correct.
<br />
&quot;W &amp; M&quot; is always false  (with that protocol).
<br />
<br />3) If you get the first sixth step of UDA, which means basically that 
<br />
you would understand that the way of quantifying that first person 
<br />
indeterminacy cannot depend on the real/virtual/(arithmetical) nature 
<br />
of the reconstitution, and, most importantly, that it does not change 
<br />
when arbitrary delays of reconstitution are introduced.
<br />
<br />4) and the UD is a program which reconstitutes you in your present 
<br />
state(s)  (for all your present states, the pasts one, the futures one 
<br />
and all the intermediates and parallels) through all computational 
<br />
histories. You met *the* comp first person indeterminacy. To predict 
<br />
exactly the observable trajectory of the observed (as well as possible) 
<br />
moon, you need ... some first person (plural) computation statistic. If 
<br />
grandmother's physics or quantum field theory gives correct approximate 
<br />
results, it means both should emerge from that 1-computation statistic.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And my eyes glaze over every time I come to extended discussions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about &quot;1st person&quot;, considering as I do those to be a linguistic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mistake/death-spiral almost as bad as discussions about qualia.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I guess the trouble is exactly there. Thanks for your frankness. But 
<br />
note that in the UDA reasoning (like in Everett QM) we use a rather 
<br />
simple third person approximation of the first person: it is just their 
<br />
personal memory sequences, like &quot;WWWMWMMMWMMWW&quot;.
<br />
<br />Things are becoming just much more precise in the interview of the 
<br />
self-introspecting universal (lobian) machine, where the first person 
<br />
(the soul) is *then* defined by the knowing subject, and for this one I 
<br />
take Theaetetus' definition (like Plotinus, cf Bréhier).
