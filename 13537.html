Hi again.... very busy...responses erratically available...sorry...
<br />
<br />&lt;my blah blah snipped&gt;
<br />
<br />COLIN
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; RE: 'creativity'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ... Say at stage t the biosphere was at complexity level X and then at
</em><br />
stage t = t+(something), the biosphere complexity was at KX, where X is
<br />
some key performance indicator of complexity (eg entropy) and K &gt; 1 ....
<br />
<br />RUSSEL
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thats exactly what I mean by a creative process. And I also have a
</em><br />
fairly precise definition of complexity, but I certainly accept
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proxies as these are usually easier to measure. For example
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bedau-Packard statistics...
</em><br />
<br />COLIN
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; This could be called creative if you like. Like Prigogine did. I'd
</em><br />
caution
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; against the tendency to use the word because it has so many loaded
</em><br />
meanings that are suggestive of much more then the previous para.
<br />
<br />RUSSEL
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Most scientific terms have common usage in sharp contrast to the
</em><br />
scientific meanings. Energy is a classic example eg &quot;I've run out of
<br />
energy&quot; when referring to motivation or tiredness. If the statement were
<br />
literally true, the speaker would be dead. This doesn't prevent sensible
<br />
scientific discussion using the term in a well defined way. I know of no
<br />
other technical meanings of the word creative, so I don't see a problem
<br />
here.
<br />
<br />COLIN
<br />
It may be technically OK then, but I would say the use of the word
<br />
'creativity' is unwise if you wish to unambiguously discuss evolution to a
<br />
wide audience. As I said...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Scientifically the word could be left entirely out of any desciptions
</em><br />
of the biosphere.
<br />
<br />RUSSEL
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Only by generating a new word that means the same thing (ie the well
</em><br />
defined concept we talked about before).
<br />
<br />COLIN
<br />
I don't think we need a new word....I'll stick to the far less ambiguous
<br />
term 'organisational complexity', I think. the word creativity is so
<br />
loaded that its use in general discourse is bound to be prone to
<br />
misconstrual, especially in any discussion which purports to be assessing
<br />
the relationship between 'organisational complexity' and consciousness.
<br />
<br />COLIN
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The bogus logic I detect in posts around this area...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'Humans are complex and are conscious'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'Humans were made by a complex biosphere'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; therefore 'The biosphere is conscious'
</em><br />
<br />RUSSEL
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps so, but not from me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To return to your original claim:
</em><br />
<br />COLIN
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Re: How would a computer know if it were conscious?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Easy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;The computer would be able to go head to head with a human in a
</em><br />
competition.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The competition?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Do science on exquisite novelty that neither party had encountered.
</em><br />
(More interesting: Make their life depend on getting it right. The
<br />
survivors are conscious).&quot;
<br />
<br />RUSSEL
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Doing science on exquisite novelty&quot; is simply an example of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; creative process. Evolution produces exquisite novelty. Is it science -
</em><br />
well maybe not, but both science and evolution are search
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; processes.
</em><br />
<br />COLIN
<br />
In a very real way, the procedural mandate we scientists enforce on
<br />
ourselves are, to me anyway, a literal metaphor for the evolutionary
<br />
process. The trial and error of evolution  = (relatively!) random
<br />
creativity followed by proscription via death(defeat in critical argument
<br />
eg by evidence) =&gt; that which remains does so by not being killed off. In
<br />
science our laws of nature are the same.... on the knife edge, validity
<br />
contingent on the appearance of one tiny shred of contrary evidence. (yes
<br />
I know they are not killed! - they are usually upgraded).
<br />
<br />RUSSEL
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think that taking the Popperian view of science would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; imply that both science and biological evolution are exemplars of a
</em><br />
generic evolutionary process. There is variation (of hypotheses or
<br />
species), there is selection (falsification in the former or
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; extinction in the latter) and there is heritability (scientific
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; journal articles / genetic code).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So it seems the only real difference between doing science and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evolving species is that one is performed by conscious entities, and the
</em><br />
other (pace IDers) is not.
<br />
<br />COLIN
<br />
I think different aspects of what I just described (rather more
<br />
colourfully :-) )
<br />
<br />RUSSEL
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But this rather begs your answer in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; trivial way. What if I were to produce an evolutionary algorithm that
</em><br />
performs science in the convention everyday use of the term - lets say by
<br />
forming hypotheses and mining published datasets for testing
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them. It is not too difficult to imagine this - after all John Koza has
</em><br />
produced several new patents in the area of electrical circuits from an
<br />
Evolutionary Programming algorithm.
<br />
<br />COLIN
<br />
The question-begging loop at this epistemic boundary is a minefield.
<br />
[[engage tiptoe mode]]
<br />
<br />I would say:
<br />
(1) The evolutionary algorithms are not 'doing science' on the natural
<br />
world. They are doing science on abstract entities whose relationship with
<br />
the natural world is only in the mind(consciousness) of their grounder -
<br />
the human programmer. The science done by the artefact can be the
<br />
perfectly good science of abstractions, but simply wrong or irrelevant
<br />
insofar as it bears any ability to prescribe or verify claims/propositions
<br />
about the natural world (about which it has no awareness whatever). The
<br />
usefulness of the outcome (patents) took human involvement. The inventor
<br />
(software) doesn't even know it's in a universe, let alone that it
<br />
participated in an invention process.
<br />
<br />(2) &quot;Is this evolutionary algorithm conscious then?&quot;.
<br />
In the sense that we are conscious of the natural world around us? Most
<br />
definitely no. Nowhere in the computer are any processes that include all
<br />
aspects of the physics of human cortical matter. Without knowing exactly
<br />
why it is the case that cortical matter bestow qualia on us... what I can
<br />
definitely claim (because I know what is in the chips at the atomic level
<br />
and I know what is in cortical material at the atomic level)  is that in
<br />
no way does the computer include all the aspects of the cortical matter
<br />
that we utilise in our scientific behaviour. Science is grounded in
<br />
cortical-qualia (via observation)...The computer cannot be scientifically
<br />
claimed to have qualia...ergo is not conscious...
<br />
<br />...Which will now hit the question-begging boundary.....as to the of the
<br />
question-begging thing.... (and please don't jump into the solipsism mud)
<br />
<br />FACT: The ONLY _scientifically_ provable example (.ie. a generalisation
<br />
about the natural world that remains tentatively unrefuted) we have of a
<br />
real known consciousness is ourselves (scientists). The scientific proof?
<br />
= Science exists/is possible/is successful and fails without human
<br />
cortical qualia being involved The word 'consciousness', invoked in this
<br />
context means specifically and only the cortical qualia in which sciencwe
<br />
has been grounded. This is a scientifically provable proposition I can
<br />
make without knowing what qualia are.
<br />
<br />Based on this, of the 2 following positions, which is less vulnerable to
<br />
critical attack?
<br />
<br />A) Information processing (function) begets consciousness, regardless of
<br />
the behaviour of the matter doing the information processing (form).
<br />
Computers process information. Therefore I believe the computer is
<br />
conscious.
<br />
<br />B) Human cortical qualia are a necessary condition for the scientific
<br />
behaviour and unless the complete suite of the physics involved in that
<br />
process is included in the computer, the computer is not conscious.
<br />
<br />Which form of question-begging gets the most solid points as science?  (B)
<br />
of course. (B) is science and has an empirical future. Belief (A) is
<br />
religion, not science.
<br />
<br />Bit of a no-brainer, eh?
<br />
<br />Cheers
