Hello,
<br />
<br />One might take the position that consciousness just is..., and is focused at a
<br />
particular point we might call
<br />
an identity. If we assume time is an illusion, the idea of being much older
<br />
than the apparent vehicle consciousness,
<br />
would hold.
<br />
<br />As for the statement: &quot;I exist because somewhere I am computed.&quot; under the
<br />
assumption of infinite consciousness,
<br />
it is its own computation. The machinery to compute and the thing to compute
<br />
are the same thing.
<br />
It exists everywhere existence is. In this model the physical body would be a
<br />
focal point.
<br />
<br />In this model, an identical computation could not yield a separate
<br />
consciousness.
<br />
<br />One might consider, if it is the method of observation which determines what is
<br />
observed.
<br />
If one assumes a limited perspective as the initial conditions of observation,
<br />
then one observes
<br />
only what he expects. Those things defying explanation, tend to be ignored less
<br />
the whole
<br />
framework collapse.
<br />
<br />If one considers the kind of thinking and theory generation possible with the
<br />
thinking prevalent
<br />
100 years ago as compared with today, one can see that the initial assumptions
<br />
seem to be the
<br />
limiting factor in what can be explained. For example, 100 years ago, it was
<br />
scarcely believable
<br />
that powered flight was possible, much less a mission to the moon. This is not
<br />
just a matter of data
<br />
in a book to derive one's possible creative space. I maintain it has more to do
<br />
with consciousness
<br />
expansion. That is, one cannot help but have expanded consciousness as the
<br />
result of experiencing,
<br />
thinking, and creating. A very simplistic example involves learning to drive a
<br />
car with a manual transmission.
<br />
At first one labors to consider the coordination of clutch, brake, throttle,
<br />
and gear shift. Ten years with
<br />
such experience this same person can drop into any vehicle with a manual
<br />
transmission and drive it, adapting
<br />
quickly to the given parameters of the given vehicle. From one perspective this
<br />
is just a hardwired skill set.
<br />
But upon close inspection, one can describe just about all aspects of the state
<br />
space of operating a manual
<br />
transmission vehicle, even what would happen if things are done incorrectly.
<br />
This demonstrates a tie between
<br />
a skill and consciousness. One can further learn to operate any machinery that
<br />
involves torque control and
<br />
perhaps a clutch very quickly based on the experience of operating a manual
<br />
transmission vehicle. This
<br />
implies extrapolation of fundamental dynamic elements into a new model, all
<br />
done very quickly.
<br />
<br />If a mechanic drives a car and in the process of operating it feels certain
<br />
things, he can quickly determine
<br />
what if anything is causing the disturbance. This implies not only the
<br />
consciousness development of a
<br />
casual operator, but also that of a mechanic, who can model the mechanical
<br />
workings in his head on the fly.
<br />
This is not a simple model either, feel, vibration, sound, all tie into a model
<br />
which he can then verbally describe
<br />
at length.
<br />
<br />The point of these examples is to demonstrate that consciousness grows with
<br />
experience and learning. This
<br />
example also demonstrates crudely that the expanded consciousness can grow
<br />
faster with each new addition
<br />
to it.
<br />
<br />Now again consider the observer observing his own consciousness. He makes some
<br />
simple observations in
<br />
terms of language and established bodies of knowledge. What he learns by
<br />
observation is flavored by what
<br />
he has to compare it to. As he learns what's possible to learn by observation
<br />
of his consciousness, it grows
<br />
with each observation. Forcing the observer to hit a target that moves faster
<br />
the more it is observed.
<br />
<br /><br />One might then consider another possibility. If my theory is correct about
<br />
consciousness, then this moving
<br />
target would continue to move toward infinite awareness. That is, aware of all
<br />
things in the universe, multiverse, or
<br />
what have you.
<br />
<br />(It also could move within the space such that it spirals in circles and leads
<br />
no where.)
<br />
<br />This  could be tested. Consider that thoughts can also serve to expand
<br />
consciousness. One creates a thought,
<br />
this thought facilitates consciousness expansion by creating a kind of tool for
<br />
seeing consciousness. In general
<br />
we do this anyway. Anytime one creates an explanation of a concept that more
<br />
readily facilitates understanding
<br />
by other observers, he's created a kind of dynamic tool for seeing. To
<br />
continue, the experimenter might
<br />
consider abstract thoughts that target the most direct route to a goal. This
<br />
goal being rapid expansion of consciousness.
<br />
The thoughts would be created and chained successively.
<br />
<br />(observation is done through awareness, not theory fitting or direct probing.
<br />
Doing so causes consciousness to
<br />
collapse on itself)
<br />
<br />To illustrate: One clears his mind, imagines a thought/awareness that
<br />
facilitates expansion, then releases the
<br />
thought and holds his mind blank to disallow preconceived thinking to interfere
<br />
with what is created. One then
<br />
continues to repeat the process as gently and as quietly as possible.
<br />
<br />With practice this process gets easier and easier. Eventually one notices how
<br />
thoughts interact. One even experiences
<br />
pure awareness irrespective of the five senses. One develops senses in terms of
<br />
pure abstract creations. One in
<br />
effect creates senses with thoughts. From observations made with the new
<br />
senses, one creates new ones.
<br />
<br />This process can be optimized into a continuous flow. One might dare to
<br />
consider that if consciousness is already infinite,
<br />
but simply unrealized, that he can simple imagine an arrival point without
<br />
considering the method for arriving there. Meditating
<br />
upon this hypothetical point using the thought chaining method outlined, one
<br />
does arrive somewhere. If my theory is correct,
<br />
the intelligence already there, will answer the request of the observer focal
<br />
point. The observer merges with the entire process
<br />
required to deliver the conscious focal point to the desired arrival point.
<br />
<br />I offer this above description and exercise as a method to collect more data.
<br />
I feel if one imposes to many expectations in
<br />
terms of theories and logic that they effectively box themselves in by what
<br />
they expect.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     Whatchya mean?  I wouldn't mind acquiring a new argument against FIN

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; add to the ones I give, but your statement doesn't appear to make any

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You wrote earlier that consciousness can't be transferred to a copy. But

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness isn't transferred, the copies had the same consciousness

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; already because they were identical.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would say: I exist because somewhere I am computed. You appear to say that

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (forgive me if I am wrong) I must identify myself with one computation. Even

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an identical computation performed somewhere else will have a different

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; identity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My objection is that the brain is constantly changing due to various
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; processes. The typical timescales of these processes is about a millisecond.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; FIN thus predicts that I shouldn't find myself alive after a few

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; milliseconds.
