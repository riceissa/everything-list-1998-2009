<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Physics is the fixed point of universal machine self observation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That would be a very impressive result if you could prove it - and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prove that there is no other empirically equivalent model.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I will try to explain, as simply as possible, that this has been  
<br />
proved. Indeed by UDA[1...8].
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I've long been of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the opinion that space and time are constructs.  I also think the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; integers and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arithmetic are constructs.  But so far I understand your thesis to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics consists of certain relations among experiences regarded as  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; events.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You can say so, although this is already a simplification. Useful to  
<br />
give an idea to the layman, but also capable of making rise to non  
<br />
genuine objection for the expert. I will not try to un-simplify your  
<br />
point, if I can say, and I will interpret it favorably.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  This solves the mind-body problem by making the body a construct of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mind.  So far, so good.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK. OK. (well, to be sure, consciousness remains to be explained, but  
<br />
consciousness will be explained by the gap between G and G*, but this  
<br />
is locally out of the current topic).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Further, you hold that these relations are Turing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computable and so exist in Platonia as a subset of all arithmetic.
</em><br />
<br /><br />If by &quot;these relations&quot; you mean those related to my mind, then I am OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I like this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; better than Tegmark's idea of our physics as a subset of all  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematics because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your idea is more specific and leads to questions that may be  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; answerable.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I don't think it is a question of &quot;liking&quot;, but ... I share your liking.
<br />
<br />Remember that I pretend that all what I say is a direct consequence of  
<br />
the (digital) mechanist assumption. And then it is Church thesis which  
<br />
makes such an approach so robust.
<br />
<br />Nobody can know my opinion on the matter. (Except that once I said &quot;I  
<br />
don't know&quot;).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; still see some problems:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; First, it doesn't eliminate the possibility that some other subset  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of Platonia,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; e.g. geometry or topology, might also provide a representation of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our physics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In fact, given that our knowledge of physics is imprecise, it seems  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; likely that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there are infinitely many subsets of Platonia that are models of our  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics.
</em><br />
<br /><br />No. To predict first person experiences, we have to integrate (sum on,  
<br />
taking into account of) ALL the representations occurring in the  
<br />
universal deployment.
<br />
Ontologically, we have all computations. The UD generates, by  
<br />
dovetailing all those computations. Your next state is determined by a  
<br />
measure of uncertainty bearing on all computations going through your  
<br />
present state.
<br />
What is obvious for the naturalist, i.e. the fact that your next state  
<br />
is determined by your present state by a simple computational equation  
<br />
(like SWE), is NOT obvious for the digital mechanist. There is already  
<br />
a continuum of (infinite) computations---involving white rabbits,  
<br />
white noise, and all computational and non computational beings--- 
<br />
going through your current state. If a physics emerges from that, it  
<br />
is just an open problem if that physics is computational or not,  
<br />
actually we just don't know yet if that physics even exists or not  
<br />
(with comp). What we know, is that IF a physics emerges THEN it takes  
<br />
into account, and sum up, infinities of computations.
<br />
This follows by taking steps 5, 6 and 7, and 8 (when not executing the  
<br />
UD).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Of course you can argue that even a non-computable model of physics  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; may be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; approximated by a computable model to an adequate degree.  But this  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just pushes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the question off to what is &quot;adequate&quot; and it does not warrant  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rejecting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; materialism as explicated by Peter.
</em><br />
<br /><br />The &quot;rejection of materialism&quot; is really step 8 (the movie graph). It  
<br />
explains why we don't have to run the UD, and why we can rely on the  
<br />
&quot;natural&quot; UD determined by all true (and provable, here) sentence of  
<br />
even just Robinson Arithmetic.
<br />
<br />Your current state of mind, and indeed the state of mind of all  
<br />
possible Loebian machines (far richer than Robinson Arithmetic) occurs  
<br />
in all finite or enumerable approximations of any possible &quot;model&quot; of  
<br />
physics rich enough to generate your states. But, mainly because you  
<br />
cannot be aware of the delay done by the UD, you, from your first  
<br />
person point of view, are living in the infinite union of all those  
<br />
finite approximations. Again: there is no reason a priori why they  
<br />
have to be computable (and giving the subdovetailing on the reals,  
<br />
they have to posses uncomputable aspects when we look at ourself below  
<br />
our level of substitution.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Second, is the problem of finding the fixed point, or distinguishing  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the measure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on all the Turing computations that picks out our physics.  I  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have some results, such as &quot;no computation can know which  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computation it is&quot;,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which are interesting, but do not pick out any particular physics.
</em><br />
<br /><br />All right. But I don't derive physics there. Physics is just shown to  
<br />
be given by the science which pick your more probable &quot;next first  
<br />
person state&quot; or OM, which exists in aleph_0 exemplars in the  
<br />
Universal Deployment, and belongs to 2^aleph_0 histories. This is the  
<br />
conclusion of UDA. We see here that comp predicts already something  
<br />
&quot;physical&quot;: the many worlds&quot;, or the many consistent histories.
<br />
Then to extract physics more precisely is very difficult, but that  
<br />
should have been expected, giving the non constructive top-down  
<br />
approach. We are just pushing the comp hyp to its ultimate consequences.
<br />
But then I recover a part of physics: the logic of the observable  
<br />
propositions with probability/credibility one. For technical reason  
<br />
they are modelized by the provability-and-consistency(-and-truth) of  
<br />
the sigma_1 propositions. (four and fifth hypostases). And this gives  
<br />
a quantum logic, and the shadow of measure on the computations as seen  
<br />
by a universal machine embedded in the universal deployment. But this  
<br />
is already AUDA. (arithmetical UDA).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; There's a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; general problem here in that the current best theories of physics  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are based on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; continuous variables.
</em><br />
<br /><br />This should be expected when we assume mechanism. Keep in mind the  
<br />
step 7, physics should predict your next state of mind, and it depends  
<br />
on 2^aleph_0 histories. If you look at yourself or at your  
<br />
neighborhood close enough (below your substitution level) you can  
<br />
expect to &quot;see&quot; the white rabbits somehow, you have to expect a  
<br />
blurring of an infinity of computations, a bit like a cloud of  
<br />
histories. The border of that cloud could be called the white rabbit  
<br />
cloud: it is the extremely rare histories, like the border of an  
<br />
electronic orbital describes very rare events (an electron far away  
<br />
from the nucleus for example.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Many physicists think that an ultimate theory would be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discrete,
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />This is highly implausible, assuming comp. I know that if we want  
<br />
quantize gravitation, then space and time should be quantized, but  
<br />
then I hope other things will remain continuous, like the statistics  
<br />
(hoping it is enough).
<br />
But for the reason above, the first persons cannot escape the  
<br />
&quot;feeling&quot; or the &quot;appearances&quot; of continua (assuming mech.).
<br />
<br />You really have to process carefully the step seven, and remember that  
<br />
your first person point of view are determined by all the third person  
<br />
describable computations going through your actual comp state (the  
<br />
comp supervenience).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; but nobody knows how to make a discrete theory from which our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; continuous theories would emerge.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />The comp hypothesis provides such a theory. Physics being a first  
<br />
person (plural) construct, it has to rely on the infinite union of all  
<br />
the finite piece of all computations accessing your state.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Let me know at which step (1?, ... 8?) you have a problem? The only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; one not discussed thoroughly is the 8th one.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; To be sure, do you understand the nuance between the following  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; theses:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; WEAK AI: some machines can behave as if their were conscious (but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; could as well be zombies)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; STRONG AI: some machines can be conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; COMP: I am a machine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; We have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; COMP =&gt; STRONG AI =&gt; WEAK AI
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; WEAK does not imply STRONG AI which does not imply COMP. (it is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; because machine can be conscious that we are necessarily machine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ourself, of course with occam razor, STRONG AI go in the direction of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; COMP).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Does those nuances make sense? If not (1...8) does not, indeed, make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; sense. You just don't believe in consciousness and/or person like in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the eliminative materialism of neuro-philosophers ( the Churchland,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; amost Dennett in &quot;consciousness explained&quot;).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As my lawyer friend says, &quot;I'm not in the belief business.&quot;
</em><br />
<br /><br />Scientists have beliefs.
<br />
Mystics have knowledge.
<br />
Beliefs are refutable and revisable. Science evolves and grow.
<br />
Knowledge is not refutable and not revisable, and, in its pure  
<br />
platonic form, is invariant.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Or you make us very special infinite analogical machines, but then  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; drop the digital mechanist thesis (even the naturalist one, which has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; been shown inconsistent by 1...8.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think it might be that the universe is not computable.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />But, after step 1...8, what do you mean by universe?
<br />
If I am a (correct) machine, whatever supports me cannot be a machine.
<br />
<br />Unless, to be complete, I am the entire universe. I say &quot;yes&quot; to the  
<br />
doctor if the artificial brain simulates the entire cosmos and the  
<br />
entire cosmological history. In that case there is only one universe,  
<br />
only one &quot;bruno marchal&quot;, and it can be a computational object  
<br />
because, although the UD generates it an infinity of time, there are  
<br />
no variations among the genuine computations. No white rabbits here.  
<br />
But a big &quot;others mind problem&quot;. I think I have to explain this to  
<br />
Jason, so I will not insist here. I could also suggest to really  
<br />
revised the seven and height steps, keeping cautiously in mind the  
<br />
first and third person distinction.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I think it is very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; likely that one's consciousness is computable, at least for a finite  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time period.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />That's the comp hyp. It entails my consciousness is &quot;processed&quot; in a  
<br />
denumerable but infinite part of the deployment, and the measure is  
<br />
determined by the continuum of computations which exists as domain of  
<br />
comp indeterminacy. By step 5 (and 8) we are always under the fate of  
<br />
that indeterminacy.
<br />
A set of computable things is not necessarily computable, and the comp  
<br />
hyp makes the computability of the universe, or any big whole, very  
<br />
implausible.
<br />
<br />The mind body problem is that tricky!
<br />
If mind is computable, then the body is not.
<br />
If the body is computable, then the mind is not.
<br />
<br />And if the body is computable, and if we still assume comp, then the  
<br />
mind is computable (by comp) and the body is not, so we get that the  
<br />
body is computable and the body is not computable. Contradiction.  
<br />
Meaning, if comp is true, the body, or the universe is NOT computable.  
<br />
The UD never generate a physical universe, it always generate set of  
<br />
histories from inside which observers categorize into a universe, from  
<br />
their points of view. The brain or more generally the lobian machine,  
<br />
act as a filter or a selector of a reality from an uncomputable set of  
<br />
computable histories.
<br />
<br />I would be pleased if you could be kind enough to tell me  if I have  
<br />
been able to justify why the first person universe (be it physical or  
<br />
mathematical, or whatever) cannot be computable.
