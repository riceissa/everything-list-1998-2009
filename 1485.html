<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this new development and the realisation would be made that their universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *is* a Life simulation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Would it?  This is a questions I've thought about some.  Would the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; fundamental mechanism of the life simulation be deducible by these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; SAS's?  Perhaps the only things that would be &quot;knowable&quot; by these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; SAS's would be higher level structures, which they might interpret
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; as, for example, eleven dimensional quantum mechanical strings, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; something.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I didn't say that the fundamental life simulation would be deducible by these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Life SAS's, just that they would begin to play around with the 'Life' game and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; then notice a correspondence between some of the structures they were
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; discovering in their Life simulations and some of the structures their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; particle physicists were discovering. Once such a coincidence had been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; noticed they'd be able to develop testable hypotheses that would go to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; show that their universe was a Life world, and then they'd be left with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; trying to calculate the boundary conditions (probably impossible in their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; case).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But, what you've just described is the deduction by these Life SAS's that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they live within a fundamental life simulation!  So you've contradicted
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; yourself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />My fault: I meant that the fact that their own world was a Life simulation would
<br />
perhaps not be *directly* deducible (i.e. by 'boiling down' their seeming laws of
<br />
physics until they got to '23/3', the Life rules), or at least much less likely than
<br />
<br />discovering Life first and building up a larger and larger library of larger and
<br />
larger
<br />
Life objects (as we are currently doing) until a correspondence is noted between
<br />
the larger members of this library and the smaller members of their physicists'
<br />
library of fundamental 'particles'. At this point I'd say that the Life rules had
<br />
been
<br />
discovered but perhaps not deduced.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I was trying to suggest that this deduction might be completely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; impossible to them -- that their life world might look like something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; completely different, because, as I suggested, only &quot;higher level
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structures&quot; might be available.  I don't know what that means,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exactly.  I'm sure there's been research on this idea -- I know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there's a vast body of literature on the game, and I'm not knowledgable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about it at all.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />I don't see any hard reason why such a deduction/discovery should be
<br />
impossible. I'm not totally familiar with the literature either. Obviously
<br />
(as in my extreme example) some information about the fine structure
<br />
of their world would be inferred by whatever scientific roundabout route,
<br />
but the same goes for our investigation of our world. When was the last
<br />
time you had direct experience of a muon?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; But, assuming that the lowest level structure of their world is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; discernable, I would expect there to be a significant difference
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; between the measure of those creatures and the measure of other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; creatures - us perhaps.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I don't know on what grounds you make that assumption but I'll go
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; along with it. I'm definitely not assuming that our universe is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; game of Life.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Right, well, I'm guessing from this response that you didn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand what I was trying to say.  Mea culpa.  I explicitly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumed that our universe is *not* a game of life, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then I went on to conjecture about why we don't find ourselves
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in such a world.
</em><br />
<br />Well to be fair you assumed this further down as part of an argument,
<br />
unless I missed some previous posting on account of being new to
<br />
this mailing list. But I do disagree with your argument...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; So if we further assume that our universe is *not* a game of life,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; and if the AUH is true, then by the SSA I would conclude that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; probability of any SAS finding itself to be in a game of life is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; probably zero.  That is, the set of SAS's inside a game of life is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; of measure zero relative to the set of SAS's inside universes like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; ours.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<br />How do you deduce that the prob of being in a game of Life is 0? I under-
<br />
stand all the stuff about measure (I'm a mathematician) but where do
<br />
you get the Life-like universes vanishing?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; In the bizarre nature of infinite sets, not all SAS's are in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; universes like ours, but in fact the probability of being in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; universe like ours is 100%.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And here I make a desperate, arm-waving leap, from the idea that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am a random sample, to the conclusion that SAS's &quot;like me&quot; are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the most numerous.  Whatever &quot;like me&quot; might mean, I think it's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fair to guess that it wouldn't include SAS's inside a game of life,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unless you're talking about the ones generated within the UD.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />No I mean the one's you get 'for free' by running Life sim on a large
<br />
enough random field. (Take digits of pi if you don't like 'random').
<br />
<br />I agree: your leap is a desparate, arm-waving leap. My SAS within a
<br />
Life simulation could be justified in making the same leap, surely. Even
<br />
though he/she/it would be by your argument totally wrong.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I don't believe in infinite sets. But I'd accept a rephrasing along the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; lines of &quot;the probability of being in a universe like ours is very close
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to 100%&quot;. Still like to see the reasoning though. (Or perhaps a reference).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What does this mean, &quot;I don't believe in infinite sets?&quot;  Do you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; believe in the number 42?  Do you believe in green?  Do you believe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in (pick any human)?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />I was being a bit cheeky putting the belief in such bald terms, but I do sort
<br />
of mean it. I think arguments about sets being vanishingly small are a bit
<br />
suspect in this sphere of philosophy (and also avoidable: on could take e.g
<br />
a computation theoretic approach and use the a priori measure to assign
<br />
'probabilities' to the existence of SSA's).
<br />
<br />Yes, I believe in the number 42, the colour green and my Uncle Mike.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; More interestingly still: when are *we* going to discover some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; CA or similar which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; turns out to be *our* universe? In my lifetime I hope.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What does &quot;CA&quot; stand for??
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />Cellular automaton. Life but generalised in terms of rules, dimension, number of
<br />
poss. states. etc. Sorry not clear. To reveal a personal prejudice, I have a very
<br />
strong hunch that our universe *is* a CA of a particular type, but we can let that
<br />
go if you like...
