Hi everybody!
<br />
<br />I've been very busy these days and not able to follow the recent
<br />
discussions on the list. And woow! there seems to be a lot to catch up!
<br />
Rather than trying to recapitulate all past universes I just try to
<br />
immiscate in the present discussion.
<br />
It seems that again the difficult point is how to define identity, i.e.
<br />
what allows to gather a number of different subsystems into the same &quot;I&quot;?
<br />
I already expressed my point of view that this can not be done in an
<br />
absolute way in MWI. Unlike most of you, I don't think that we can be
<br />
defined or assimilated to some computation. So the meaning of &quot;other
<br />
implementations of me&quot; is not obvious at all. I think that the identity is
<br />
meaningful only in a classical spatio-temporal frame, which is
<br />
approximately realized through &quot;classical histories&quot; of MWI. In these
<br />
classical universes (subparts of the &quot;big&quot; Universe), we can follow
<br />
continuously a macroscopic system (such as &quot;us&quot;, but also any other
<br />
&quot;object&quot; or &quot;being&quot;), which IMPLIES a continuous function of space and time
<br />
(although allowing some branching events during quantum measurements) . Out
<br />
of this frame, identity is meaningless.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But if you believe in the computationalist hypothesis, then you'd
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have to assume that at some point, a simulation of a human becomes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;close enough&quot; to be identical.  That is (to oversimplify) when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; each particle is simulated to within a Plank length, then the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; simulation becomes indiscernable from the original, and thus
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; identical.  If this is true, then I would no longer expect the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; physical laws to give rise to ever-increasing cardinality of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; universes, since that could never increase the cardinality of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the set of humans past aleph-0, anyway.
</em><br />
<br />Again it seems that i am one of the few not believing in this possibility!
<br />
I summerize my objections for the new contributors:
<br />
<br />Objection 1 : unlike what some of you seem to believe, QM forbids the
<br />
measurement of a quantum state, because the (complex) value psi(x,t) does
<br />
not correspond itself to an observable. We can only check statistically the
<br />
prediction of QM concerning measurements of classical quantities x, p, E,
<br />
but not measure a particular quantum state (including ours)...
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Objection 2 : even if the world were classical (which it is not of course)
<br />
we are constantly interacting with our environment. The simulation of a
<br />
complete Universe with a machine embedded in this very Universe (so
<br />
including the machine itself) is impossible. So an &quot;exact&quot; simulation,
<br />
leading to exactly the same evolution, is physically impossible.
<br />
<br />Objection 3 (maybe the worst) : we do not have a finite description of the
<br />
physical reality that would allow to &quot;describe &quot; it exactly (nothing to say
<br />
of predicting its evolution). Even Wheeler DeWitt equation, superstring
<br />
theory and so on are at best putative hypothesis that could possibly answer
<br />
some problems raised by quantum field theory, but nobody can claim that
<br />
they are &quot;THE&quot; ultimate TOE. &quot;Simulating  each particle to within a Plank
<br />
length&quot; is also meaningless for the moment, since the Planck length is just
<br />
the scale at which we do not know how to simulate anything...
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Up to now, physics has only offered approximate descriptions of reality
<br />
which tend to describe better and better the observations. That's all and
<br />
that is already something! forget about ontology...
<br />
<br />Gilles
