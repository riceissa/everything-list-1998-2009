<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The empirical problem with the ASSA is that under most reasonable

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proposals for the absolute measure, observer moments corresponding to

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; younger people have higher measure than older people. Whilst the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reference class issue puts a lower bound on how old you would expect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to be, it seems unlikely that children aged 4 or 5 could be considered
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; excluded from the reference class - I can remeber being conscious at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that age, and children of that age seem conscious from the outside.
</em><br />
<br />I don't understand why measure should decrease with the age of a person. Of
<br />
course, once you take into account the possibility of dying then you will
<br />
see a decrease. But ignoring that, the measure should be conserved. The
<br />
measure for being in a particular state at age 30 should be much smaller
<br />
than the measure for being in a particular state at age 4, but after
<br />
summation over all possible states you can be in, you should find that the
<br />
total measure is conserved.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The second problem with the ASSA is lack of subjective time. I have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; always argued that subjective time is necessary to experience anything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at all. This is a direct consequence of computationalism, but I think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is more basic than computationalism (since I don't really count myself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as a computationalist).
</em><br />
<br />Let's define observer moment as a program in some computational state (maybe
<br />
it is better to consider programs in different computational states as
<br />
distinct programs). That program must have information stored in itself
<br />
about past events and must have a sense of a subjective time.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now I don't expect to convince you of this - I never succeeded in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; persuading Jacques Mallah. However I do want to point out that even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with the ASSA, one should not expect to experience survival of the WTC
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with some loss of memories. The most likely outcome is another
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer moment with high measure - namely being a newborn baby. In
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other words, what you'd experience is reincarnation.
</em><br />
<br />I think that if you take into account the ''entropic'' effect of there being
<br />
more states for you to be in at higher age, then you can end up at a large
<br />
range of ages.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To get the effect you were suggesting would require another type of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; SSA, about which I have complete failure of imagination.
</em><br />
<br />I think it is similar. You have a set of all universes which we identify
<br />
with descriptions or programs. Embedded in these descriptions are
<br />
descriptions of self aware substructures. A measure on the set of all
<br />
programs defines a measure on the set of all substructures. I then say:
<br />
''That's all there is''. The proponents of RSSA go further and postulate new
<br />
rules about what the next experience of a SAS should be. What you are
<br />
actually doing is promoting our experience of the flowing of time to
<br />
fundamental law. However, this is something that should be derived from more
<br />
fundamental concepts.
