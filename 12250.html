It seems your answer is that it's just a convention that you happen to have
<br />
learned - a mere artifact of culture as propounded by various
<br />
post-modernists.
<br />
JM:
<br />
In our culture and its predecessors primitive observations led to
<br />
explanations at the level of the then epistemic cognitive inventory, which
<br />
increases continually. Those simplistic ideas were retained and mended in
<br />
later 'science' of better learning epochs but the basis has not changed: a
<br />
&quot;physical&quot; view of &quot;facts&quot; and the way we still do value them as our
<br />
&quot;reality.&quot;  Composed into 'models' (groups) of their own.
<br />
If you call a newer look - based upon newer epistemic enrichment - as
<br />
&quot;propounded  by various post-modernists&quot; - well, so be it, I don't consider
<br />
it pejorative.
<br />
<br />Brent (on the &quot;101&quot;):
<br />
We are influenced by it because it has been very successful.  I don't fly in
<br />
airplanes designed by alternative engineering.  Unconventional ideas
<br />
interest me only in so far as they work as well or better than conventional
<br />
ones.
<br />
JM:
<br />
I think I hear a mix up of &quot;the only one we have&quot; for &quot;the best one there
<br />
is&quot;. Your airplanes fall off the sky sometimes (spare me the statistics,
<br />
please, 1 is more than enough) contraceptives fail, houses burn down for
<br />
electric failures, there are wars in the conventionally based social
<br />
culture, our biosphere is going berserk because of our perfect scientific
<br />
applications, we have technology-related diseases, nuclear fall outs,
<br />
medical mishaps, politicians (oops) and food poisoning, bridge collapses and
<br />
other innumerable examples of safety failures of our '101'-based perfect
<br />
efficiency in this world. We live (and use) the ONLY one we have. Our
<br />
pretension lists the benefits and deems it the best. For the caveman the
<br />
BEST weapon was the hand-ax. For a priest the best science is HIS theology.
<br />
For a monotheist the best god is his god.
<br />
If you are not interested in the 'unconventional novelties' before they
<br />
prove to be superior then our ongoing ignorance, you will never get to them.
<br />
I go for it, not necessarily successful, but I try. And don't give up.
<br />
I don't believe that you want to stay put in the science-religion of our
<br />
axioms, emergence, 'givens', chaotic paradoxical beliefs and the
<br />
cosmologists' Big Bang narrative. And all the other marvels based on '101'.
<br />
Atoms, molecules, spin, energy, space, time, mass, gravitation, electricity,
<br />
light, life, mind, etc. just to name some.
<br />
They all are usable tools for some practical tasks as long as we have no
<br />
better ones
<br />
to use  and explanation for them.
<br />
In the meantime have a happy new year
<br />
<br />John M
