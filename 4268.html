<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (I think Egan gives us a fairly plausible, fictional timeline for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; figuring this stuff out: a workable TOE by the middle of this century,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; i.e., within our lifetimes. That is, a theory which unifies relativity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and QM, and which is presumably also brings in QED, QCD, etc.
</em><br />
...
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then perhaps several centuries of very little progress, as the energies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to get to the Planck energy are enormous (e.g., compressing a mass
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about equal to a cell to a size 20 orders of magnitude smaller than a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proton).
</em><br />
...
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course, breakthroughs in mathematics may provide major new clues,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which is where I put my efforts.)
</em><br />
<br />I think this is certainly a plausible prediction of the future, but I see it
<br />
as an unlikely one.
<br />
<br />I think that intelligent software programs will be brought into existence
<br />
within the next 10-50 years, and that among other effects, this will cause a
<br />
physics revolution.  Furthermore, it will be a revolution in a direction now
<br />
wholly unanticipated.
<br />
<br />Right now we analyze data about the microworld in a very crude way.  For
<br />
example, we scan Fermilab data for &quot;events&quot; -- but what about all the other
<br />
data that isn't &quot;events&quot; but contains meaningful patterns?
<br />
<br />Create an AI mind whose sensors and actuators are quantum level, and allow
<br />
it to form its own hypotheses, ideas, concepts, ontologies....  Do you
<br />
really think it's going to come up with anything as awkward and overcomplex
<br />
as our current physics theories?
<br />
<br />I suspect our current physics theories are overcomplex because they're based
<br />
on extrapolating into the microworld, mathematics and intuitive concepts
<br />
that originated primarily in models of our everyday physical world.
<br />
Particle theory... wave theory ... path integrals. There are no particles,
<br />
waves or paths down there....   There is no &quot;observation&quot; either....  No
<br />
strings.  No membranes.  Our attempts to project these concepts onto an
<br />
inappropriate domain may well strike future quantum-domain-natural minds as
<br />
mildly hilarious...
<br />
<br />Humans may or may not arrive at a workable TOE before the advent of AI's
<br />
with quantum-level sensors and actuators.  Following this advent, however,
<br />
the progress of fundamental physics will be unimaginably fast, and will move
<br />
in humanly-unimaginable directions.
<br />
<br />Will mathematics be central to this new physics?  Maybe.  But not our
<br />
mathematics.
<br />
<br />Anyway, this was part of why I decided to start thinking about AI rather
<br />
than fundamental physics ;-&gt;
<br />
<br />I think Greg Egan's fiction is great, but I also think Diaspora is badly
<br />
flawed futorology, because his uploaded minds never get tremendously more
<br />
intelligent than humans.  I don't think that's a very realistic
<br />
prognostication, though it makes for easier storytelling.
<br />
