<br />I think this is generally a very good paper - probably because I agree with
<br />
most of what I can understand of it! My comments follow.
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;Introduction
<br />
.
<br />
.
<br />
Note that there is no need for the UTM to actually exist, nor is there any
<br />
need to specify which UTM is to be used -- a program that is meaningful on
<br />
UTM1can be executed on UTM2 by prepending it with another program that
<br />
describes UTM1 in terms of UTM2's instructions, then executing the
<br />
individual program. Since the set of all programs (infinite length
<br />
bitstrings) is isomorphic to the set of whole numbers N, an enumeration of
<br />
N is sufficient to generate the ensemble that contains our universe.&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />For me, 'generate' is far too strong. I would only allow something like
<br />
'index' here.
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
.
<br />
.
<br />
In this paper, we adopt the Schmidhuber ensemble as containing all possible
<br />
descriptions of all possible universes, whilst remaining agnostic on the
<br />
issue of whether this is all there is.1 Each self-consistent mathematical
<br />
structure (member of the Tegmark ensemble) is completely described by a
<br />
finite set of symbols, and a finite set of axioms encoded in those symbols,
<br />
and a set of rules (logic) describing how one mathematical statement may be
<br />
converted into another.&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />There will be structures with an infinite number of axioms, but not
<br />
functionally (ie visibly) for our kind of universe.
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;Universal Prior
<br />
.
<br />
.
<br />
where |p| means the length of p, gives the size of the equivalence class of
<br />
all halting programs generating the same output s under the UTM U. This
<br />
measure distribution is known as a universal prior, or alternatively a
<br />
Solomonoff-Levin distribution.&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />Reference to, say, L&amp;V here?
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
.
<br />
.
<br />
The answer is that the UTM is not important, but information is. Information
<br />
is only information when interpreted by something, and the only things
<br />
interpreting the universes are precisely the self-aware substructures
<br />
inhabiting the universes. We should expect to find ourselves in a universe
<br />
with one of the simplest underlying structures, according to our own
<br />
information processing abilities.&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />I can't agree with this, if I understand you correctly. This implies that as
<br />
our information processing abilities increase, we could in principle expect
<br />
to find ourselves in another kind of universe. Or another,
<br />
not-too-dissimiliar SAS in our universe, with a different kind of
<br />
information theory, could disagree with us as to what kind of universe we
<br />
should expect to be in. We can only attempt to find natural bases for
<br />
measures that are anthropically unbiassed and have sufficient generality to
<br />
cater for all logically possible universes. Of those that seem to qualify,
<br />
TM's en masse can only lead to a rough guide to the simplicity of a TOE, as
<br />
you have shown; a basis involving axioms and symbols *may* be better.
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;The White Rabbit Paradox
<br />
A criticism levelled at ensemble theories is to consider universes
<br />
indistinguishable from our own, except for the appearance of something that
<br />
breaks the laws of physics temporarily, e.g. a white rabbit is observed to
<br />
fly around the room at specific time and place. There are two possible
<br />
explanations for this:
<br />
1.
<br />
that there is some previously unknown law of physics that caused this rather
<br />
remarkable phenomenon to happen. However, it would have to be an extremely
<br />
complex law, and thus belong to a rather unlikely universe. &gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />Presumably this follows from the last section on the Universal Prior.
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;2.
<br />
that there is some ``glitch'' or ``bug'' in the program governing the
<br />
universe, that allows some of the ``don't care'' bits to be interpreted.
<br />
Since there are many more ways a program can fail, than be correct, surely
<br />
then, the ``White Rabbit'' universes should outnumber the lawlike ones.&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />It has already been established that each element of the 'Schmidhuber
<br />
plenitude' is representable by a mathematical structure. So there must be
<br />
such a structure corresponding to a 'buggy' program. Hence 2. is just
<br />
another form of 1.
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;Consider more carefully the latter scenario. In most of the universes
<br />
where the ``don't care'' bits are interpreted, the ``don't care'' bits will
<br />
be devoid of information, and appear as random noise to the self-aware
<br />
entity, and thus the universe is indistinguisable from a law-like one.&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />'random noise' implies that it is part of the universe. Again, if it affects
<br />
the world, even if not discernable to a SAS, it will be covered by a
<br />
physical law, and so come under 1. above.
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;Quantum Mechanics
<br />
In this section, I ask the question of what is the most general (i.e.
<br />
minimum infomration content) description of an ensemble containing
<br />
self-aware substructures. Firstly, it seems that time is critical for
<br />
consciousness -- i.e. in order for there to be a ``flow of consciousness''.
<br />
Denote the state of an ensemble by phi. This induces an evolution equation
<br />
<br />d phi
<br />
------    =    i H (phi, t)
<br />
d t                                         &gt;&gt;
<br />
<br /><br />It seems to me that some QM is assumed to generate this - surely other
<br />
equations can model time dependency (eg without an imaginary component).
<br />
(Also you may wish to clarify that the ensembles of this section aren't the
<br />
ensembles of the introduction.)
<br />
