<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; like the functionality of a scientist without involving ALL the

functionality (especially qualia) of a scientist must be based
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; on assumptions - assumptions I do not make.

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I gave a counter example, that of biological evolution. Either you

should demonstrate why you think biological evolution is uncreative, or
<br />
why it is conscious.
<br />
<br />Colin
<br />
You have proven my point again. It is not a counterexample at all. These
<br />
two &quot;either-or&quot; options are rife with assumption and innappropriately
<br />
contra-posed. The biggest? = Define the context/semantics of 'creative'.
<br />
Options:
<br />
<br />#1 The biosphere is a massive localised collection of molecular ratchet
<br />
motors pumped infinitesimal increment by infinitesimal increment against
<br />
the 2nd law of thermodynamics upon the arrival of each photon from the
<br />
sun. If the novelty (new levels nested organisational complexity)
<br />
expressed in that collection/process can be called an act of
<br />
creativity...fine...so what? I could call it an act of 'gronkativity' and
<br />
it would not alter the facts of the matter. I don't even have to mention
<br />
the word consciousness.
<br />
<br />The organisational complexity thus contrived may or may not include
<br />
physics that makes some of it (like humans) conscious. I could imagine a
<br />
biosphere just as complex (quaternary, 100ernary/etc structure) but devoid
<br />
of all the physics involved in (human) consciousness and the behavioural
<br />
complexity contingent on that fact. That alternate biosphere's complexity
<br />
would simply have no witnesses built into it and would have certain state
<br />
trajectories ruled out in favour of others. This alternate biosphere would
<br />
have lots of causality and no observation (in the sense that the causality
<br />
is involved in construction of a phenomenal field of the human/qualia kind
<br />
is completely absent). This blind biosphere is all 'observation' O(.)
<br />
functions of the Nils Baas kind that is completely disconnected from
<br />
consciousness or the human faculty for observation made of it.
<br />
<br />Making any statement about the consciousess of a biosphere is meaningless
<br />
until you know what the physics is in humans...only then are we entitled
<br />
to assess the consciousness or otherwise of the biosphere as a
<br />
whole or what, if any' aspects of the word creative (which , BTW was
<br />
invented by consciousness!) can be ascribed to it.....the same argument
<br />
applies to a computer, for that matter.
<br />
<br />Until then I suggest we don't bother.
<br />
<br />#2 Creativity in humans = the act of being WRONG about something = the
<br />
essence of imagining (using the faculty of consciousness - the qualia of
<br />
internal imagery of all kinds) hitherto unseen states of affairs in the
<br />
natural world around us that do not currently exist (such as the structure
<br />
of a new scientific law or a sculture of a hitherto unseen shape).....
<br />
this has nothing to do with the #1 collection of ratchet motors....except
<br />
insofar as the process doing it is implemented inside it, with it (inside
<br />
the brain of a human made of the ratchet motors).
<br />
<br />That's how you unpack this discussion.
<br />

<br />BTW thanks.....I now have the BAAS paper on .PDF

Baas, N. A. (1994) Emergence, Hierarchies, and Hyperstructures. In C. G.

Artificial Life, held June 1992 in Santa Fe, New Mexico, Addison-Wesley,

<br />
<br />I'll send it over...
