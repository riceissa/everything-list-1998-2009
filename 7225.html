</em><br />
<br />...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Suppose we are going to flip a biased quantum coin, one which has a 90%
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;chance of coming up heads.  We will generate the good or bad experience
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;depending on the outcome of the coin flip.  I claim that it is obvious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that it is better to give the good experience when we get the 90% outcome
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and the bad experience when we get the 10% outcome.  That's the assumption
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I will start with.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now consider Tegmark's level 1 of parallelism, the fact that in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sufficiently large volume of space I can find a large number of copies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of me, in fact copies of the entire earth and our entire visible universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(the &quot;Hubble bubble&quot;?).  When I do my quantum coin flip, 90% of the copies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;will see it come up heads and cause the good experience for the subject,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and 10% will see tails and cause the bad experience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I will also assume that my knowledge of this fact about the physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;universe will not change my mind about the ethical value of my decision
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to give the good experience for the 90% outcome.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now the problem is this.  There are really only two different programs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;being run for our experimental subject, the guy in the simulation.  One is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a good experience and one is bad.  All my decision does is to change how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;many copies of each of these two programs are run.  In making my decision
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;about which experiences to assign to the two coin flip outcomes, I have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;chosen that the copies of the good experience will outnumber copies of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the bad experience by 9 to 1.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But if I don't believe that the number of copies being run makes a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;difference, then I haven't accomplished what I desired.  The fact that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I am running more copies of the good program than the bad wouldn't make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;any difference.  Therefore there is no actual ethical value in what I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have done, I might have just as validly reversed the outcome of my coin
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;flips and it wouldn't have made any difference.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In this way I reach a contradiction between the belief that the number
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of copies doesn't matter, the belief that the existence of distant
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;parallel copies of myself doesn't make much difference in what I should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;do, and the idea that there is value in making people happy.  Of these,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the most questionable seems to be the assumption that copies don't matter,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;so this line of reasoning turns me away from that belief.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I can come up with similar contradictions from simpler cases like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;our own observations of subjective probability.  The fact that I do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;experience a subjective 90% chance of seeing the quantum coin come
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;up heads corresponds very well with the fact that 90% of the copies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of me will see heads - but only if I assume that the multiplicity of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the copies matters.  After the coin flip, in a certain voume of space
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;there are 90 copies of me that see heads and 10 copies that see tails.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But within the two groups all copies are identical (neglecting other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;quantum events which would further split me).  If the multiplicity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;doesn't count, then there are really just two outcomes and I might
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;expect to subjectively experience equal probability for them.
</em><br />
<br />It's a bit hard for me to come up with a satisfactory answer to this 
<br />
problem, because I don't start from the assumption of a physical universe at 
<br />
all--like Bruno, I'm trying to start from a measure on observer-moments and 
<br />
hope that somehow the appearance of a physical universe can be recovered 
<br />
from the subjective probabilities experienced by observers (note that this 
<br />
does not mean that all physical processes are a kind of dream in the minds 
<br />
of high-level intelligent beings like ourselves; I think the mathematical 
<br />
description of the set of all observer-moments in a theory of consciousness 
<br />
would probably be something like a set of graphs describing the causal 
<br />
relationships between events in that observer's 'brain', and even very 
<br />
simple causal patterns, like those created by the random jostling of 
<br />
molecules in a rock, could be fellow observer-moments, albeit very simple 
<br />
ones, which we are observing 'from the outside' just like we can only 
<br />
experience other people's minds from the outside). Without having any clear 
<br />
idea of how to do this derivation of an apparent physical universe from the 
<br />
conditional and absolute measure on observer-moments, I don't really know 
<br />
what the appearance of multiple physical copies would correspond to in terms 
<br />
of conditional or absolute measure on observer-moments.
<br />
<br />But my speculation would be this: multiple copies only increase first-person 
<br />
measure to the extent that, from a third-person perspective, they are likely 
<br />
to create more *distinct* observers with a memory of the split going one way 
<br />
than of the split going the other. So if we look at some very large region 
<br />
where there are 90 copies of our local region of the universe where the 
<br />
quantum coinflip went one way and only 10 copy of our local region where the 
<br />
coinflip went the other way, then even if those 90 copies run in lockstep 
<br />
for a while, chances are good that eventually random events in each region 
<br />
will cause them to diverge. The end result would be that, after sufficient 
<br />
time, in this very large region you'll have 100 distinct regions which all 
<br />
share the same history up until that coinflip, with 90 having records of the 
<br />
flip going one way and 10 having records of it going the other. And given my 
<br />
views on splits having an &quot;anticipatory&quot; quality (so if you're split into 
<br />
two and then one copy is scheduled to be split 999 times later, that will be 
<br />
reflected in your subjective probabilities in the initial split), I 
<br />
naturally tend to think that this means you'd have a 9 times greater 
<br />
probability of experiencing the coinflip outcome that will later lead to 90 
<br />
divergent copies, even if the 90 copies run in lockstep initially.
<br />
<br />But like I said, it's difficult to make any definite claims about why we 
<br />
experience quantum probabilities the way we do, especially since no one has 
<br />
come up with a way to derive a simple frequentist notion of probability from 
<br />
the universal wavefunction in the MWI.
