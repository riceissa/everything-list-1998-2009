<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I think it would be simpler if you responded directly to quotes from my

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;previous post, rather than just making general statements about issues 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;raised in that post. For example, here you continue to *assert* that there 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;is something inherently time-based about logical statements, but you don't 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;in any way explain what is wrong with my counterargument from that post:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   I was still having reading difficulties with my new lenses so this was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;easier for me.
</em><br />
<br />OK, no problem.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;'The laws of logic need not be thought of as rules of &quot;discovery&quot;, they 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;can be thought of purely as expressing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;Expressing&quot; seems to be a time dependent process.
</em><br />
<br />I don't think it needs to be. When we say a certain set of symbols 
<br />
&quot;expresses&quot; something, in the most abstract sense we're just saying there's 
<br />
a mapping between the symbols and some meaning.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  static relationships between static truths, relationships that would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;exist regardless of whether anyone contemplated or &quot;discovered&quot; them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;As are my kernels of information.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;For example, in every world where X and Y are simultaneously true, it is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;also true that X is true, even if no one notices this.'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Sure,  That is a kernel.  Observation does not make a kernel a kernel.
</em><br />
<br />OK, but this isn't really relevant to my question, namely, why does any of 
<br />
this require time?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Likewise, you didn't address my point that &quot;I can't think of any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;historical examples of new mathematical/scientific/philosophical ideas 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;that require you to already  believe their premises in order to justify 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;these premises&quot;,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I believe Bruno said that some information systems included a set of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;beliefs.  As I recall the &quot;premises&quot; are these beliefs.  Justification 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;comes from emotions [based on other beliefs] surrounding the resulting 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;system such as simplicity, elegance of apparent explanation etc.   So it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;seems to me that justification is part of belief.
</em><br />
<br />My point is that if I want to demonstrate the truth of some statement X to 
<br />
you (without appealing to new empirical evidence), I look for some set of 
<br />
premises that we *already* share, and then try to show how these premises 
<br />
imply X. I can't think of any historical example where someone's new idea is 
<br />
accepted by other people without the person appealing to common premises 
<br />
they already share. Can you?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;and you didn't address my question about whether you think there could be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;a world/kernel where a vehicle simultaneously
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Again time inserts itself as the notion of &quot;simultaneously&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />&quot;Simultaneously&quot; shouldn't be taken too literally, &quot;X and Y are 
<br />
simultaneously true&quot; is just a shorthand way of saying that X and Y are 
<br />
truths that both apply to exactly the same domain, whether &quot;same domain&quot; 
<br />
means &quot;same universe&quot;, &quot;same time&quot;, or whatever. For example, if I say 
<br />
&quot;Ronald Reagan was President of the U.S. in 1985&quot; and &quot;Bill Clinton was 
<br />
President of the U.S. in 1995&quot;, these are two non-contradictory truths that 
<br />
apply to the domain of &quot;U.S. history in our universe&quot;, so in that sense they 
<br />
are &quot;simultaneous&quot; truths about this domain even though they refer to 
<br />
different dates. On the other hand, if I said &quot;Ronald Reagan was President 
<br />
of the U.S. in 1985&quot; and &quot;Lex Luthor was President of the U.S. in 1985&quot;, and 
<br />
both applied to the domain of &quot;U.S. history in our universe&quot;, then this 
<br />
would be a contradiction. But if I made clear that the first statement 
<br />
applied to the domain of &quot;U.S. history in our universe&quot; and the second 
<br />
applied to the domain of &quot;U.S. history in an alternate universe&quot; then there 
<br />
would no longer be any contradiction in these statements.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;had different numbers of wheels,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If the world was a CA and half the applicable cells were in a two wheel 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;state and half in a three wheel state what would that be?
</em><br />
<br />I can't really picture a CA where the state of a cell specified a number of 
<br />
wheels, but never mind--this would clearly involve no contradiction, because 
<br />
the statements &quot;the cell is in a 2-wheel state&quot; and &quot;the cell is in a 
<br />
3-wheel state&quot; would not apply to the same domain, since they refer to two 
<br />
*different* cells. There is only a logical contradiction here if both apply 
<br />
to exactly the same domain--in this case, the same cell in the same &quot;world&quot; 
<br />
at a single time. Do you think it could be possible for two contradictory 
<br />
statements about the state of a single cell at a single moment in a single 
<br />
world to *both* be true?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;Should we have the hubris to impose this somewhat questioned concept on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;all other universes?  In my view the states of all universes preexist in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;the All [as some of the kernels] and &quot;Physical Reality&quot; washes over them 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;in some sequentially inconsistent way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;So do believe the statement &quot;the states of all universes don't preexist in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;the All, and 'Physical Reality' does not wash over them in any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;sequentially inconsistent way&quot; would be false? If so, it seems that you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;yourself have the &quot;hubris&quot; to apply the logical law of noncontradiction to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;statements about reality as a whole.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I am just try to think of the simplest system that contains no information 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and yet has a dynamic that could support what might be the universe some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;may believe they inhabit.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But then is there really a process like &quot;think&quot;?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The All as I defined it [my current proposed belief] contains a kernel for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the Nothing as well as a kernel for the All thus the nesting.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From the inside perspective we are forced to be in, all we have to justify 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;such a belief system is our own beliefs re efficiency, beauty, etc. etc. so 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;our beliefs justify our beliefs.  Is this not self referential?  I do not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;intend to impose that on the system as a whole.
</em><br />
<br />You didn't really answer my question above. What I'm asking is, every time 
<br />
you make a statement about reality as a whole, do you intend to deny that 
<br />
the negation of your statement is true? For example, above you say that &quot;The 
<br />
All contains a kernel for the Nothing as well as a kernel for the All.&quot; If I 
<br />
make the statement &quot;The All does *not* contain a kernel for the Nothing *or* 
<br />
a kernel for the All&quot;, would you then say my statement is false? Please give 
<br />
me a yes-or-no answer to this question, if at all possible.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;I do not agree with your &quot;rather&quot; based cancelation of the residual 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;information issue since I see it as an unnecessary complication of my own 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;method.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;rather based cancellation.&quot; If you're 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;talking about my point that every statement could be simultaneously true 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;and false if you throw out the laws of logic, obviously *I* don't believe 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;this is a good way to solve the &quot;residual information issue&quot;, since I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;think it's nonsensical to allow logical contradictions. But since you seem 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;to be saying the laws of logic aren't absolute, I was just pointing out 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;that you would have no basis for denying that statements about reality can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;be simultaneously true and false. If you say that it is an &quot;unnecessary 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;complication&quot; to allow statements about reality as a whole to be both true 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;and false, then you are in effect saying it would be an unnecessary 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;complication to claim that the laws of logic don't apply to reality as a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;whole!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I just believe in my own sense of neatness.  You gave two apparently 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;contradictory statements which when put in the same pot seem to sum to what 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I propose for the whole system absent the &quot;rather&quot;. I wish to avoid 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;including our &quot;laws of logic&quot; as a necessary component of a kernel.
</em><br />
<br />But if you &quot;wish to avoid&quot; allowing statements about reality to be both true 
<br />
and false, that means you &quot;wish to avoid&quot; allowing reality as a whole to 
<br />
contain logical contradictions! The two ideas are exactly equivalent.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;My point is that it is more pleasing to think of the dynamic as being 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;inconsistent [each state has no cause effect link of any sort to any other 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;state] if there are other components of the All that are inconsistent.  But 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;these are not really the same thing and I begin to think the latter is a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;side bar issue.
</em><br />
<br />There is nothing &quot;inconsistent&quot; in a logical statement about having no 
<br />
causal links between states--such an idea does not imply any logical 
<br />
contradictions (ie it doesn't imply that two contradictory statements can 
<br />
both be true in precisely the same domain). I think you are misunderstanding 
<br />
what the &quot;laws of logic&quot; really mean, examples like different cells of a 
<br />
cellular automata having different states or different states in a series 
<br />
having no causal relationship to one another don't contradict the laws of 
<br />
logic in any way.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Does that mean you say the statement &quot;each state of the dynamic is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;completely dependent on the current state&quot; is false?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I believe we should avoid applying logic to a zero internal information 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;entity such as the All.  I believe this causes problems.
</em><br />
<br />You didn't answer my question. Would you say the statement &quot;each state of 
<br />
the dynamic is completely dependent on the current state&quot; is false, or would 
<br />
you say it's true, or would you say it is neither true nor false, or what?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;As to does mathematics contain information, mathematics has the potential 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;to erect boundaries so by my definition it is information.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;But doesn't *any* statement you make about reality as a whole, like &quot;each 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;state of that dynamic has to be completely independent of the current 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;state&quot;, erect a &quot;boundary&quot; between itself and its negation, in this case 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;&quot;each state of the dynamic is completely dependent on the current state&quot;?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I distinguish between actual boundaries and the potential to erect one.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The All is full of boundaries between kernels but has no potential to erect 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;more.  In your &quot;dependent&quot; case one has to manage the dependency rules - a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;necessary potential to erect boundaries.
</em><br />
<br />How about the statement &quot;The All is full of boundaries between kernels but 
<br />
has no potential to erect more&quot;. Isn't there a &quot;boundary&quot; between this 
<br />
statement and its opposite, namely &quot;The All contains no boundaries between 
<br />
kernels but does have potential to erect more&quot;? Would you say the first 
<br />
statement is true and the second is false?
