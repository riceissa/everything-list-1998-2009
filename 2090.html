<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;      QM is the laws of physics that best explains what we see.  I think 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that says it all.  I should point out that there is really no summation 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;involved, especially not a sum over worlds.  There is just -i hbar d/dt psi 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;= H psi.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  Of course, you could write psi as a sum of orthogonal functions and you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;could choose nearly decoherent such functions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;      In the computationalist view, there is a wavefunction, and it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;implements computations.  These implementations may resemble those that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would be produced by classical mechanics, modified by interference terms 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that may be small.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;OK, the Shoedinger equation is  -i hbar d/dt psi = H psi, Why? Why does the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;equation have an imaginary form? What is the meaning of Planck's constant 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it the CONTEXT of the MWI? Just saying, as you do, that the SE is what it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is just because, is adopting the same POSITIVIST attitude as the Copenhagen 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;school. I am looking for the INTERPRETATION of this equation in terms of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the MW. Is it possible to derive this equation from a PURELY 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;COMPUTATIONALIST APPROACH?
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you mean to derive it from the AUH (+ computationalism), I don't 
<br />
blame you for wanting that.  That's the holy grail.  It would be one of the 
<br />
greatest intellectual achievements in all of human history.  The Nobel Prize 
<br />
would be the least of it.  Don't hold your breath.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wouldn't be mucking around with trying to measure wabbittiness if I 
<br />
could derive the SE from the AUH.  As it is, the best I think is practical 
<br />
is trying to predicts things like wabbittiness, and to argue that the SE 
<br />
*could* be what a typical observer-moment in the AUH would see.  We expect 
<br />
the observation to be consistent with apparent laws of physics that are 
<br />
relatively simple, in a universe that is computationally deep.  (See the 
<br />
discussion Wei Dai and I had soon after I joined this list.)  Getting more 
<br />
specific is hard.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for positivism, what you say is false.  Even if (as I did *not* say), 
<br />
the SE is not derivable from the AUH, that's not a positivist statement.  A 
<br />
positivist would say there is really no SE in existance, but we can use the 
<br />
SE to make predictions.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;You say that psi can be written in terms of orthogonal (decoherent)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;functions. Are those functions equivalent to the individual worlds in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;MW? If so, then we certainly have the ability to be affected by several 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;such worlds simultaneously because of the phenomenon of superposition. What 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;does this say about consciousness? Does consciousness have &quot;thickness&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;across the MW? How does this fit with the ideas of Lewis and Kriepke?
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't misquote me.  I said it could be written in terms of nearly 
<br />
decoherent functions.  On that 'nearly' hangs interference, the basic 
<br />
property of QM and our main defense against the 'collapse' idea.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Individual worlds' - a matter of definition.  &quot;Many worlds&quot; is a great 
<br />
way of describing QM - until the details start to matter, in which case 
<br />
those words can cause as much confusion as enlightenment.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know what ideas L&amp;K have.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;      You still don't know what computationalism means?  It means that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;certain computations give rise to consciousness.  It does not explain 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;behavior at all, and does not allow zombies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It seems that you need to be more precise. Computationalism ASSUMES that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;certain computations give rise to consciousness. It does not EXPLAIN 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consciousness. And without a third person/ first person theory you can only 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;talk about behaviors as observed from a third person point of view without 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ever describing what it is to be (yourself) conscious.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You say assumes, I said asserts.  Whatever.  True, computationalism 
<br />
makes no claim about *why* computations are conscious.  There are two 
<br />
schools of thought about why: reductionism and dualism.  Both are compatible 
<br />
with computationalism.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reductive computationalism is the belief that consciousness is nothing 
<br />
more than computation.  Obviously, if this could be proven, it would not 
<br />
have to compete with the rival school.  That is obvious, isn't it?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can certainly talk about consciousness, though.  And 
<br />
computationalism explicitly, and by definition, does talk about it.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as for describing what it's like *qualitatively*, that's impossible. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Language cannot convey that regardless of your ideology.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I hope you soon see the light (in more ways than one).  Get well 
<br />
soon.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From: Russell Standish &lt;R.Standish.domain.name.hidden&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Basically, the i in the equation is to ensure that the Hamiltonian is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;hermitian, which is required by the law of conservation of probability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(d/dt (psi* psi))=0. This latter law is simply the statement that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;axiom saying the probability of the certain event is 1, and shall
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;remain so for all time.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you know Russell, I find your &quot;derivation&quot; of the SE quite wanting.  
<br />
As far as conservation of probability, it is not obvious that measure should 
<br />
be conserved as a function of time.  In fact, measure is not strictly 
<br />
conserved.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The i is there to make the equation simpler to write.  Of course one 
<br />
could write it in terms of real quantities only, such as amplitude and 
<br />
phase.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;As for the value of hbar, this is to fix a rather arbitrary set of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;units we happened to choose to measure the world in. If we did
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;everything in terms of Planck units, hbar=1.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This one you got right.  Of course, one could ask about the 
<br />
dimensionless 'constants' of physics, and make an anthropic principle 
<br />
argument.
