<br /><br />Of course, I agree. Both are really you. That is why you must
<br />
say, as you say, &quot;I don't know&quot;. That is the computational undeterminacy.
<br />
The only important point (to proceed) is that with comp you survive,
<br />
and that from all your futur point of view you have a precise memory
<br />
of where you have survived. It has been either W or M.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Perhaps when other posters (not you) write about continuity of

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consciousnes they mean that a persons consciousness cannot be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;duplicated even if their physical being is duplicated - but I believe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you explicityl reject this view.  In which case I'm not sure what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;continuity of consciousness&quot; means either.
</em><br />
<br />You talk on Jesse Mazer's post. I will comment it. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I note that duplication can be done for elementary particles and perhaps
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;even small assemblages of elementary particles (e.g. He nuclei, small
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;atoms) but it may well happen that the laws of physics (even if they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;derive from psychological or computational bases) may forbid the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;duplication of something large enough and complex enough to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;self-conscious.  Not all thought experiments are possible.
</em><br />
<br />Have you heard about the no-cloning result in QM. It is not
<br />
possible to duplicate an arbitrary state of a even a single
<br />
photon. But this is irrelevant because all that stuff about
<br />
self-duplication are just preparation for the use of it with
<br />
the universal dovetailer, which produces all those 
<br />
duplications in some automatic way. 
<br />
I agree with you that not all thought experiments are possible
<br />
or interesting. But with the hypothesis that we are machine,
<br />
the self-duplication thought experiment is possible.
<br />
This can be made totally precise with some use of informatics
<br />
(diagonalisation, etc.), but it seems to me that it is best
<br />
not going in technics when it is not necessary.
<br />
<br />But here you are really speculating on some physical laws
<br />
which would prevent the possibility of self-duplication.
<br />
Why? 
<br />
<br />Here, we are just at the very beginning of the proof that if
<br />
we are digital machines then physics *must* be reductible
<br />
to the law of machine's psychology, that Reality is a web
<br />
of number's dreams. 
<br />
<br />It seems that you have understand the computational undeterminacy,
<br />
but that you are not curious to see where we are lead.
<br />
Of course I will not repeat myself. Just look at the sketch
<br />
of the proof in  <a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m1726.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m1726.html</a>
<br />
(Or the shortest presentation in my CC&amp;Q paper).
<br />
<br />Most of the present discussion comes from the disagrement
<br />
between Schmidhuber and me on the way &quot;the all
<br />
computations&quot; version of the &quot;everything&quot; idea must be
<br />
used for getting some computer science explanation of the
<br />
laws of physics.
<br />
<br />Oh I see you say to Jesse Mazer:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [...]  What possible experiment
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;could decide whether &quot;I&quot; had become the I-in-Washington and not the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I-in-Moscow.  The very hypothesis of the thought experiment makes this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;question unaswerable.
</em><br />
<br />I agree. This is because &quot;experiment&quot; is a third person concept.
<br />
But the *experience* is very simple and answerable from the 
<br />
experiencer's point of view. And so the &quot;unaswerability&quot; is
<br />
something communicable, and in practice it means there is
<br />
an undeterminacy.
<br />
After the duplication you just look where you are.
<br />
Each you will get the anwer, and no more than that is needed
<br />
for going to the next step of the argument.
<br />
(Each you will understand what I mean by undeterminacy).
<br />
Note that my whole work is &quot;pure third person&quot; communicable.
<br />
With hypotheses it is possible to get third person propositions
<br />
*on* first person's discourses. (This was provide by the use
<br />
of the diary in my precedent post).
<br />
<br />In case you dislike the conclusion, remember that you can
<br />
always trash away the comp hypothesis.
<br />
But unless you find a flaw it seems to me I have proved
<br />
that if we are machine the laws of physics emerges from
<br />
a statistics on possible dream/computations.
<br />
(Here a dream is just a first-person description of some
<br />
set of relative computations).
