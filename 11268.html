I will reply to your comment to me on-list - this is a private remark.
<br />
I leave part of your reply to Marc here to refer to personally.
<br />
See please, after your signature

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(from your post:)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Smolin's loop quantum gravity is the physics of the soul which has not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; yet fallen (!). String theory, or better the string theories landscape
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (as described by Smolin himself) would describe ... the gate of hell,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; or the state of the fallen soul: the fourth hypostase
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Very funny.  So... I take it you don't like String Theory and think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; loop quantum gravity is the way the truth and the light? ;)
</em><br />
<br />Well, you should not infer this from the fact that I suspect &quot;string
<br />
theories&quot; appears with the 4th hypostases, given that I am rather proud of
<br />
having isolated them.  If you look to &quot;Conscience and Mecanisme&quot; and to the
<br />
Lille thesis you will see that at that time I was (wrongly) believing that
<br />
physics could not occur but in the 4th and 5th hypostases. I thought that
<br />
S4Grz1 collapses. Since then I have been able to prove that the 3rd
<br />
hypostase does not collapse (under the comp restriction) but that they
<br />
already defines an arithmetical quantization (that is: proves the main
<br />
&quot;physical modal formulas:
<br />
p -&gt; BDp and Bp -&gt;
<br />
p), and I still don't know if this is a good new, except that it shows
<br />
that the pure first person (the &quot;soul&quot;) has already a foot in &quot;Matter&quot;.
<br />
But that soul's physics is like a pure physics completely detached of
<br />
any &quot;background dependence&quot;, and at first sight it is a good place for
<br />
something resembling &quot;Loop Quantum Gravity&quot;.
<br />
The fourth and fifth hypostases, nevertheless, gives the only physical
<br />
modalities which split through the G/G* distinction so that only them can be
<br />
used for relating the non communicable qualia with the sharable quanta. Also
<br />
they predicts many many exotical geographies, and currently, through the
<br />
Moonshine Mystery + modular speculations, are closer to the strings
<br />
theories.
<br />
To be sure the &quot;experimental physicist in me&quot; (if there is any) has no
<br />
competence for judging Loop versus String arguments. On the contrary, the
<br />
many hypostatic nuances forced by the quantization of
<br />
incompleteness (defined by the p-&gt; BDp + inverse Goldblatt transform) makes
<br />
me willing to believe that both Loops and Strings are correct,  but does not
<br />
address the same problem.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm prepared to believe that space and particles are not fundamental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but are emergent.  However Bruno, I'm not yet convinced the same is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; true for time.  I don't see how time can be removed from our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; descriptions of reality.  I'll read the things you mention at some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point.
</em><br />
BM:
<br />
This is a bit weird because there has always been a tradition since
<br />
Pythagoras, Plato, ..., Einstein, ... to consider that time is not part
<br />
of the ontology (except under the form of arithmetical induction axioms
<br />
(which I already put in the epistemology)).
<br />
In general people are more &quot;shocked&quot; when I say that comp force space to be
<br />
emergent than when I say that time is emergent.
<br />
Note also that I don't remove time from the description of reality, I
<br />
remove time from reality, if only because I recover time in the
<br />
description of reality possible for the self-introspecting machine.

JM:
<br />
The second part is mostly congruent with how I feel. The first part,
<br />
however... (I got stuck e.g. with the term: &quot;nth hypostase&quot; - etc.)
<br />
Some time ago I had a glimps of what your and debate-partners wrote about,
<br />
if not in its desirable understanding. This 1st part of your reply to
<br />
Mark? - I read it 2-3 times and have no idea what you are talking about.
<br />
It is a phenomenon which grew lately widening the gap of my mental tuning
<br />
into what you are discussing. I confess: I did not follow some of the recent
<br />
threads, because there were so many posts and I simply could not find the
<br />
time (physical and mental endurance) to even read them. (My mailbox is
<br />
time-consuming in opening replying and even deleting posts.
<br />
<br />Please, give up on me, the 'gap' is too big as far as your theory vs. me is
<br />
concerned. I will 'talk into certain topics' carefully from my point of
<br />
view, not as an argument with YOUR theoretical positions.
<br />
In those explanations you suggested I find more and more features to look
<br />
up - and if I did so, they were not explanatory to me, rather full of
<br />
further concepts I could not come to grips with.
<br />
When I was religious (50-60 years ago) I would have said that your 'numbers'
<br />
are God. You wrote: WE are god, which I condone better.
<br />
I am not satisfied if
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;the numbers - or: the buttler DID IT&quot;
<br />
If you know this slogan). I cannot step out from my own mental capabilities
<br />
into a more capable medium, I rather confess and live with the limitations I
<br />
have.
<br />
I don't let my fantasy loose, because it is restricted by the present level
<br />
of knowledge-base (epistemy) and we really cannot foresee the further
<br />
occurrences (in science/thought as well).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who would have thought about 'comp' in 1930AD?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or even thought about the Multiverse - in 1390AD?
<br />

<br />
Sorry for such pessimistic letter, I don't want to burden you with trying to
<br />
&quot;make me understand&quot;.  I keep looking at the list and if something looks
<br />
like I can add a thought to, I will, but there are topics I must give up on.
<br />
I apologize if I don't and get carried away.
<br />
<br />Maybe this letter is contributing to your view about acceptability of your
<br />
ideas and necessary augmentation in your arguments (- as you explained once)
<br />
how and why some of your audience does not go 'with you'. You may be right
<br />
to be some 200 years ahead of the current 'academic thinking' level.
<br />
<br />Have a good time and sorry for this long letter
<br />
<br />John
