<br />This is a good point, and in fact we could sharpen the situation as
<br />
follows.
<br />
<br />Suppose multiverse theory is bunk and none of Tegmark's four levels work.
<br />
The universe isn't infinite in size; there is no inflation; the MWI is
<br />
false; and all that stuff about Platonic existence is so much hot air.
<br />
There is, in fact, only one universe.
<br />
<br />However, that universe isn't ours.  It's a specific version of Conway's
<br />
2D Life universe, large but finite in size, with periodic edge conditions.
<br />
<br />Against all odds, life has evolved in Life and produced Self
<br />
Aware Subsystems, i.e. observers.  These beings have developed a
<br />
civilization and built computers.  See the link I supplied earlier,
<br />
<a href="http://rendell.server.org.uk/gol/tm.htm">http://rendell.server.org.uk/gol/tm.htm</a> for a sample of such a computer.
<br />
<br />On their computers they run simulations of other universes, and one
<br />
of the universes they have simulated is our own.  Due to a triumph
<br />
of advanced mathematics, they have invented a set of physical laws of
<br />
tremendous complexity compared to their own, and these laws allow for
<br />
atoms, chemistry, biology and life of a form very different from theirs.
<br />
They follow our universe's evolution from Big Bang to Heat Death with
<br />
fascination.
<br />
<br />Unbeknown to us, this is the basis for our existence.  We are a simulation
<br />
being run in a 2D CA universe with Conway's Life rules.
<br />
<br />Now, is this story inconceivable?  Logically contradictory?  I don't
<br />
see how.  The idea that only one &quot;real&quot; universe might exist, but that it
<br />
could create any number of &quot;simulated&quot; ones, is pretty common.  Of course
<br />
it's more common to suppose that it's our universe which is the &quot;real&quot;
<br />
one, but that's just parochialism.
<br />
<br />And what does it say about the physical properties which are necessary
<br />
for computation?  We have energy; Life has &quot;blinkiness&quot; (the degree to
<br />
which cells are blinking on and off within a structure); neither property
<br />
has a good analog in the other universe.  Does the &quot;real&quot; universe win,
<br />
in terms of deciding what properties are really needed for computation?
<br />
I don't think so, because we could reverse the roles of the two universes
<br />
and it wouldn't make any fundamental difference.
