<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;(that Mathspace doesn't require resources) seriously, ME does not. This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;seems a direct contradiction!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     Perhaps Kory has a paper on-line that lays out his thesis of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;&quot;Instantiationism&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No, I wish had the energy to write such an online paper. :) Anyway, please
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; note that my own position is not &quot;Instantiationism&quot;. This was the word I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; used to describe the position that I *don't* accept - i.e., the idea that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computations need to somehow be physically instantiated in order for them
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (or more importantly, the SASs within them) to be &quot;real&quot; or &quot;conscious&quot;.
</em><br />
If
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I had to come up with a name for my position, I might call it
</em><br />
&quot;Mathematical
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Physicalism&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not arguing for the necessity of physical instatiation, in the
<br />
sense of a &quot;prior&quot;. I am claiming that the notion of computation itself,
<br />
however one wants to represent it, implicitly requires some form of
<br />
implementation, even if such is merely &quot;possible&quot; if one is going to try to
<br />
build a theoretical model of the world we experience, a world where we can
<br />
not predict to arbitrary accurasy &quot;what is going to happen next&quot;.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea I have is that the computations that render our worlds of
<br />
experience are implemented by the unitary evolution of quantum mechanical
<br />
systems and that these computations are not reducible to Turing Machines.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice that this idea involves a form of realism for quantum
<br />
wavefunctions similar to that proposed by Bohm and others.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have to confess that I'm not sure I'm following your argument. Are you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; referring to the tension between the static view of Mathspace, in which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is no concept of &quot;resources&quot; and computational structures exist &quot;all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at once&quot;, and the dynamic, 1st-person view that we have as creatures,
</em><br />
where
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time exists and resources are limited? I'm willing to admit that there's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tension there, but it seems to me that the tension exists for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Instantiationist as well as the Mathematical Physicalist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, that &quot;tension&quot; is part of what I am trying to address. There is a
<br />
similar situation involved in the &quot;problem of Time&quot;. One solution has been
<br />
proposed by Julian Barbour with his idea of a &quot;time capsule&quot;. I hope that
<br />
you get a chance to read his book &quot;The End of Time&quot; which discusses this
<br />
idea.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have serious problems with Barbour's proposal and have found that it
<br />
is the same problem that I trying to point out as existing in the various
<br />
computalionalist theories. His &quot;best matching&quot; scheme involves the same kind
<br />
of computational intractibility that disallows it to be taken as
<br />
&quot;preexisting&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; All I can do is trundle out the same old thought experiments that we're
</em><br />
all
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; familiar with. Imagine a 2D CA in which the state of each cell is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; determined by the state of its neighbors one tick in the &quot;future&quot; as well
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as one tick in the &quot;past&quot;. Such CA cannot be computed &quot;one tick of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; clock at a time&quot; like a regular CA. Instead you'd have to consider the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whole structure as a 3D block of bits (one of the dimensions representing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time) and somehow &quot;accrete&quot; the patterns within it. Or you could do a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brute-force search through every possible block of bits, discarding all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; those that don't follow the rules. Some of the universes that you're left
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with may exhibit &quot;thermodynamic entropy&quot; and &quot;temporality&quot; - we can
</em><br />
imagine
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a particular block universe that contains patterns which represent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observers moving around, interacting with their environment, etc. - and
</em><br />
yet
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from our perspective the whole structure is entirely static.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Your 3D CA will only work IF and only IF the computational content is
<br />
Turing Machine emulable and this requires that the TM is specifiable with
<br />
integers (enumerable). This, to me, explains why Comp proponents only seen
<br />
to want the Intergers to exist and will go to great and clever lengths to
<br />
&quot;explain&quot; why only they are needed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that there is a large class of physical systems that are
<br />
not &quot;computable&quot; by TMs, i.e., they are &quot;intractable&quot;. Did you read the
<br />
Wolfram quote that I included in one of my posts? Please read the entire
<br />
article found here:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/articles/physics/85-undecidability/2/text.html">http://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/articles/physics/85-undecidability/2/text.html</a>
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another way of thinking of this is to concider the Laplacean notion
<br />
where given the specification of the &quot;initial conditions&quot; and/or &quot;final
<br />
conditions&quot; of the universe that all of the kinematics and dynamics of the
<br />
universe would be laid out. The modern incarnation of this is the so-called
<br />
4D cube model of the universe. Again, these ideas only work for those who
<br />
are willing to completely ignore the facts of computational complexity and
<br />
the Heisenberg Uncertainty principle.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; There certainly seems to be a kind of mystery when we think about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;temporality&quot; within this static structure. We can &quot;follow along with our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; finger&quot; and &quot;watch&quot; some creature - some pattern of bits in the block
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe - struggling valiantly against some obstacle in its environment.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yet clearly our act of following along with our finger is not suddenly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; making that creature conscious. The computations have already been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; performed - the entire block universe has already been physically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instantiated. All we're doing now is observing it, like looking at the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; frames of a film. So at what point in time was that creature actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious? Did it happen &quot;all at once&quot; when our computation &quot;found&quot; that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; block universe? These are deep and murky questions, and I don't see how
</em><br />
the
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; idea of &quot;physical instantiation&quot; makes them go away. Indeed, it's
</em><br />
precisely
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; these &quot;block universe&quot; scenarios that suggest that it *does* make sense to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; view our universe as existing &quot;all at once&quot; out there in Mathspace, even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; though I'm in here perceiving it in this temporal fashion.

<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crux of my claim is that it is not possible that &quot;the computations
<br />
have already been performed&quot;. The complexity of the required computations
<br />
are such that at best we may take the computations to be &quot;ongoing&quot;. Time,
<br />
when, can be considered as the 1st person aspect of this computation...
