<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; ever increasing rate, there comes a point in finite time when the

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; expansion rate reaches a level that causes the entire universe to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; appear dark and at absolute zero in temperature in reference to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; its matter relative to itself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; If the acceleration persists, which is may or not be the case, that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; surely a possibility, depending on some other features of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; concordance model being verified or not. But we are still not sure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that the acceleration is forever...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That's both an astonishing and maybe just a little bit of a scary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thought. Is there some hint of any kind that the acceleration of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe might have a limiting factor?
</em><br />
<br />Well the argument is that, because the onset of acceleration may
<br />
be more or less dated we may speculate that it will start decreasing
<br />
at some point in the future. Of couse not all &quot;scenarios&quot; allow for
<br />
this. The &quot;eternal inflation&quot; point of view is quite to the contrary...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; In other words, the redshift at all points within the universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; have shifted to a level of absolute zero observable energy at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; future time because the universe is then expanding (at every
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; within itself) at or beyond a rate that would allow energy to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; find
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; anything in the universe that it could be relative to.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I don't quite understand this last sentence.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Assume that at some distant time the inflation rate of space/time has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exceeded the speed of light. At that moment, and forever thereafter,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no particle within that inflation region could interact with another -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - because the distance between particles is increasing faster than a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particle can transverse any distance at the speed of light or below.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That leads to the conclusion that the affected particle is then no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; longer relative to anything but itself. As far as that affected
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particle is concerned it IS the entire universe and nothing else
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exists. This of course is an illusion, from the larger viewpoint of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the meta universe. But I argue that when the particle becomes in that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way relative only to itself then it has in fact melded with the meta
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe, meaning that its energy has in fact returned to the meta
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe from which it was spawned during the big bang.
</em><br />
<br />OK. I get your point. That &quot;supersolipsistic&quot; situation is rendered
<br />
somewhat unlikely by the fact that galaxies seem to be structuraly
<br />
stable (the dark matter issue), in other words, they do not seem to
<br />
berak apart with the accelerated expansion. The chances of every
<br />
particle becoming its own disconnected universe are also made
<br />
unlikely by what we know of microphysics. Gravitational collapse
<br />
is the way out of of space-time problems altogether.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;But it may be worth
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; pointing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; out that dark energy is uniformely and isotropically distributed so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is? That would infer a homogeneous distribution of energy that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does not appear to hold true with any other observation of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe. If the big bang had resulted in an observable universe that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is uniform in structure or composition throughout then one might
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; expect the same of dark energy, but this does not appear to be the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; case. I would argue that when/if we are able to measure (as opposed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to just infer) dark energy then we will find it to be distributed in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; much the same way as is energy that we can now measure.
</em><br />
<br />Well we can and have measured the dark energy distribution via
<br />
the luminosity distance of Type Ia supernovae and the CMB
<br />
background observations (recently WMAP) and it is smooth,
<br />
uniform and &quot;tensional&quot; (=feels like  a negative pressure).
<br />
This is not an inference: it is as direct evidence as you can get
<br />
in the cosmological domain!
<br />
<br />Dark Energy, if indeed originated in the Big Bang, could
<br />
have had a very different distribution than and that is part
<br />
of the problem: we don't know why it resulted in such a
<br />
small cosmological term if it is indeed the combined energy
<br />
of all the vacua of the interactions we know about...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; it seems to be something akin to the largest scales of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter/energy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; distribution, for example, inertial mass distibution (dark and lit)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; better still, curvature or torsion. There are several models of DE
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; proposed along these lines...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps. As you say, it's too early to know. But our closed universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has of late been attributed to have a shape that is NOT a smooth
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; spheroid. Amazingly, it appears to be composed of interlocking shapes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that are not that of a sphere, but because the universe is closed the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aggregate appearance is theat of a non smooth spheroid. Maybe this is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not so amazing, since no perfect sphere seems to exist in nature.
</em><br />
<br />You are talking topology, not geometry. As far as the later is concerned,
<br />
<br />the shape is spherical, no doubt. There could be distant connected
<br />
pieces but the evidence so far is not conclusive of that...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; In that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; situation a particle would never be able to travel from any point
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; to any point B, although it might try to do so for as long as it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; existed.  Eventually the particle could no longer exist, because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; itself would loose coherency as its integral parts moved away
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; each other as a consequence of the space it occupies continuing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; inflate, and thereby move its parts away from each other until
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; nuclear forces could no longer maintain the attraction that keeps
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; particle (of any type whatsoever) from totally disintegrating.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Well, I can't quite make out what you are saying here! I don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the &quot;integrity of particles&quot; is threteaned by universal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; acceleration.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps not if indeed a particle, once the inflation rate has reached
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a rate relative to a particle so that the particle can no longer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; itneract with any other particle, then the particle has indeed melded
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with an thereby returned its energy to the meta universe from which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it originated to begin with.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But if it does not, then ALL points in space relative to that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particle, including at all points within and exterior to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particle, keep increasing in expansion rate. In that case the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distance between bound quarks (for example) keeps distancing, and at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some point they suddenly become unbound because of a nuclear force
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being unable to influence a binding force over that much of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distance. The particle completely disintegrates.
</em><br />
<br />I addressed this point you keep making above. This is really not
<br />
worth worrying about. Collapse is a much more likely end for
<br />
a particle than supreme loneliness...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; That the Universe has causaly disconnected regions, as it stands,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; undeliable but Dark Matter seems to define the largest regions that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; are able to be structured if that is what you are talking about.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No, it's just that at this current stage of expansion rate we are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only able to observe the expansion over cosmic distances. In time, if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one lived long enough, it would be observable at quantum distance.
</em><br />
<br />It isn't quite like that! If anything QM shows you that distant particles
<br />
<br />interact in some manner or better, exhibit  non-local correlations beyond
<br />
<br />their time-like separation, so even between disconnected pices of the
<br />
Metaverse (Level 1 as the list lingo goes) there are residual bonds that
<br />
do not care about universal expansion...
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The local inhomogeneities, such as you and I, do not betray the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; high degree of homegeneity the Universe displays at the Megaparsec
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; scale. The cosmological term may cease to be constant at some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scale,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that is true, and it would be most interesting to know which one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; it is to early in the game for that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is too early! But I argue that a high degree of homegeneity does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not equate to homegenity. Our universe could not have planets, stars,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and other items such as people if it were homogeneous.
</em><br />
<br />I qualified it: at the Magaparsec scale...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; A lot of the approaches to DE assume a cosmological term varying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; with some cosmic scalar field (quintessence) or some clever
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; equation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of state (quartessence).  These address time variation rather than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; spacial variation because that is where the weirdness remains...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A varying comological term probably does exist in reality, although I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; might argue that the term is an effect rather than an affect. I think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such a term would represent an exponential inflation rate factor (an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observation at a point in space at a specific point in time).
</em><br />
<br />It does indeed represent an &quot;inflation rate&quot;. There are several ways to
<br />
argue that the Cosmological Term must be a varying field of some
<br />
sort but they remain unconvincing.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I am afraid I cannot offer much comment on what you say here. I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; presumme you are expounding your own ideas but each one of your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; paragraphs contains assumptions that are not quite consistent with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; each other, beyond what is believe known. I have specail trouble
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; your insistence on a &quot;metauniverse of absolute temperature zero&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; your language of energy exchange between each universe and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; metauniverse!!! Not my thermodynamics there!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm merely refering to a universe that has reached ultimate and total
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; heat death, when I refer to a meta universe. A universe that is at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 100% equilibrium throughout all of its points. I am not sure that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there can be only one meta universe, but it seems to me that a meta
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe by that definition must be a singularity of nature. Perhaps
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the only real singularity that ever has, does, or will exist.
</em><br />
<br />Maybe! The worries that the Universe will reach a heat bath state
<br />
left people very worried 2 centuries ago. I think that all the dark
<br />
stuff,
<br />
ominous as it sounds is kinda reassuring that such end is quite
<br />
unlikely. But, if you want to be worried, I am sure you can find
<br />
plenty of reasons, still.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is no real energy exchange from the viewpoint of the meta
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe, for it is at average and over infinite time at equilibrium.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is only due to quantum effects (however unlikely they are, they do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; still have an eternity to occur within) that the creation of virtual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particles within the meta universe can lead to the (temporary)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; formation of a universe similar to ours. No matter if the resultant
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe is open, flat, or closed ... by one way or the other those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; virtual particles are returned to the meta universe; those methods
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being via black holes and/or the expansion of a universe at an ever
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; increasing rate (they are both really one and the same thing from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; viewpoint of the meta universe). What we, bound in our universe,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perceive as energy is but an illusion from the viewpoint of the MU.
</em><br />
<br />Wow! I would not know about any of that...
