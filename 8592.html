<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What I will say is of course obvious from third-person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hind-sight, but it helps me to guard against delusion to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point out the limitedness of email list dialogue when it comes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to accomplishing anything &quot;significant&quot;.  I think that the significance
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is in becoming better at expressing ourselves.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Especially on a delicate subject.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So, Bruno, I've been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bewildered for a while at why you are going to all this trouble to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; help lowly list participants like me in learning the rudiments of modal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logic.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Two bad news:
<br />
1) People on this list are one century in advance compared to what the 
<br />
average scientist can talk about in this time of overspecialisation and 
<br />
ivory towers.
<br />
2) I am probably *two* centuries in advance :)   Look, I am asking to 
<br />
people to listen to the machines, but people does not yet listen to 
<br />
people.
<br />
At least the &quot;lowly list participants&quot; seems to share some genuine 
<br />
interest in deep and hard fundamental questions.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, I know English, and I could perhaps help with basic English
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; usage.  But when it comes to insider questions like &quot;machine 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; psychology&quot;,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aren't there English-speaking philosophers out there that already know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what you're trying to get at?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Those who can grasp enough see me as an outsider competitor, the others 
<br />
are not serious.
<br />
Very few people knows really simultaneously quantum mechanics, 
<br />
mathematical logic, and &quot;philosophy of mind&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You seem to be implying that there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are not.  This is surprising.  What is this &quot;path which can hardly be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; avoided&quot; you talk about?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Listening to the machines.  Listening to what a vast class of machines 
<br />
can already correctly prove and correctly guess about themselves.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The word &quot;theology&quot; is made from the root &quot;theo&quot;, God, and this in my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; country is loaded with the historical baggage of puritanical (&lt;-hint 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to what my country is) &quot;whatever went wrong when I was growing up&quot;.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We use theology/religion as the scapegoat for &quot;whatever went wrong 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; when I was growing up&quot;.  Some readers' blood pressure is already 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; starting to rise.  So we put on our &quot;scientist&quot; hat so we can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;objectively&quot; step aside from &quot;whatever went wrong when I was growing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; up&quot; that I don't want to deal with any more, as purely subjective, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lumping it all into the &quot;religious&quot; pot, or at least the &quot;ignore&quot; pot, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; until it comes out on our medical bill.  Yes, some of us out of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessity deal with some of it through the psychological label (or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even &quot;mystical&quot; in a therapeutic sense), until we reach our personal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; saturation point, and then lump the rest of it into the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;religious&quot;/&quot;ignore&quot; pot.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I will think of that. I think the problem is not with theology, but 
<br />
with religious institutions. But then OK, I guess this should be better 
<br />
taken into account.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So I would say that both &quot;theology&quot; and &quot;psychology&quot; will not do if 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you are talking to the general audience.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Gosh! I thought it would work *only* with some general audience. In 
<br />
academia I already know that most scientist are allergic to word like 
<br />
&quot;theology&quot; (but in my poor country, also in front of word like mind, 
<br />
person, thought, consciousness, and actually even &quot;quantum&quot; sometimes).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Just to toss something out there, how about &quot;machine introspection&quot;?) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Of course, depending on who your audience is, even the words 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;machine&quot; and &quot;physics&quot; are problematic.  The term &quot;physics&quot; is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particularly problematic because it is interpreted in the reductionist 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense, which may or may know include the mind.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Apparently many words are problematic here. Mathematicians should know 
<br />
the choice of word does not &quot;really&quot; matter. But most understand this 
<br />
only in their very specialised field.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now here is where I will ask some questions, and then it will be clear 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that I am missing the point because I am still an outsider when it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comes to this self-referential self-enlightened machine stuff.
</em><br />
<br /><br />We all are, really.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why are you afraid of &quot;eliminating the person&quot;?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Look at history. All philosophies which eliminates the person lead to 
<br />
politics which eliminates the person, either in some bloody way of in 
<br />
some bureaucratic way ...
<br />
But the &quot;scientific&quot;  reason not to eliminate the person, is that it 
<br />
would be a &quot;scientific&quot;  error, as the machines can already explain by 
<br />
using the logic of self-reference and the definition of the knower by 
<br />
Theaetetus.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I know you define personal identity through logic (&quot;double-diagonal&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stuff etc.)  But it sounds like you say, contrary to the reductionist 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; view, that there is something essential to the person that cannot be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; completely described from the bottom-up, at least that there is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something to a person that is &quot;forever incomplete&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes, as Judson Webb(*)  already understood clearly, Godel's theorem is 
<br />
a vaccine against almost all form of reductionism.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Again, this is something contrary to the prevailing reductionist view, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; strengthened by simplistic popular desire, and a desire by some on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this list, to have a COMPLETE explanation for everything.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Sorry for them, but this is as impossible as finding a period in the 
<br />
decimal expansion of the square root of two. The lobian machines are 
<br />
already a bit more wise than that ...
<br />
<br />Thanks to you and Stathis for your kind answers I will meditate upon.
<br />
The question is really &quot;how to call the logic G* \ G&quot;? (The logic of 
<br />
what is true about machines but that machines cannot prove, but can 
<br />
still guess).  Mmhhh....
<br />
<br />Wish you the best,
<br />
<br />Bruno
