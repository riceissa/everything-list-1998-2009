<br /><br />I have not the time to explain the use I have made of the 1/3 person
<br />
distinction in the approach I develop to tackle the mind body problem.
<br />
It occurs with the comp hypothesis in the cognitive sciences,
<br />
that is the thesis that we are
<br />
machine (roughly speaking). Then we are, like amoeba, duplicable.
<br />
We can imagine being &quot;cut&quot; at some place and &quot;pasted&quot; in some other place.
<br />
But then we can duplicated and pasted in two place at once. It is there
<br />
that the 1 person views are qualitatively different from the 3 person views.
<br />
Let me quote
<br />
myself from <a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/CC&amp;Q.pdf">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/CC&amp;Q.pdf</a>
<br />
(Note that comp entails a form of comp-suicide, and quantum-suicide
<br />
could be a particular of it).
<br />
<br /><br />&lt;&lt;The first person discourse is defined by the result of experience/experiment
<br />
which are written
<br />
in a diary which belongs to the experimenter. It is important that he keeps
<br />
his diary with him during the self-duplication experiment so that the diary
<br />
is duplicated too in the experiment.
<br />
The third person discourse is the discourse made by an external observer.
<br />
Suppose a candidate goes through a
<br />
self-duplication experiment, and that he believes in computationalism. He
<br />
is scanned and annihilated at Brussels and reconstituted at both Washington
<br />
and Moscow. Let us ask him the following question: where will you
<br />
be after the experiment is done. He can answer: I will be in Washington
<br />
and Moscow. Right, with that question, he can indeed use a third person
<br />
discourse about himself. Let us ask him more cautiously the following question:
<br />
where will you feel yourself, i.e. from your first person subjective point
<br />
of view, after the experiment? More precisely: what will you note in your
<br />
diary after the experiment is completed? In that case, if we assume both
<br />
the computationalist hypothesis and if we assume that the experimenter has
<br />
some minimal introspection abilities it is easy to understand he must answer
<br />
&#x2018;I will feel myself in Washington or Moscow&#x2019;. The fact is that he will not
<br />
write in his diary something like &#x2018;I feel myself being both in Washington and
<br />
Moscow&#x2019;. In particular he will have a personal knowledge of Moscow (resp.
<br />
Washington) and only an intellectual, 3-person knowledge, of the existence
<br />
of his doppelganger in Washington (resp. Moscow). And he can predict that
<br />
very fact&#x2014;that he will feel himself at one place&#x2014;although he is unable to
<br />
predict which one, and this shows that computationalism entails a strong
<br />
first person indeterminacy, and this happens in the context of a strong third
<br />
person determinism.&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />Hoping that helps. That distinction is akin to the distinction between 
<br />
subjective and
<br />
objective in Everett's &quot;relative state/many-world&quot; papers. I will  probably 
<br />
say a little
<br />
more in my discussion with George asap (on the everything-list).
<br />
<br />Bruno
