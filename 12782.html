<br />
Jason,
<br />
<br />I am not against a wiki for the list, but I think it could lead to some 
<br />
difficulties. I have already asked more than one time what are people's 
<br />
main assumptions, without much success (only Hal Finney answered). For 
<br />
my part I am just explaining results I got and published a long time 
<br />
ago (and it is just a sort miracle which made me defends those result 
<br />
as a thesis in France in 1998). I'm a bit annoyed for this sometimes.
<br />
Concerning the acronyms I am using (comp, UD, UDA, Movie-graph, AUDA G, 
<br />
G*, ...) I refer to my papers available through my URL. I could make a 
<br />
list if you want, but if you put them in a wiki, I will insist, for a 
<br />
change, that correct references are joined.
<br />
<br />My work has always consisted in two things:
<br />
1) an informal (but rigorous (rigor and formality have no 
<br />
relationships)) argument showing that the computationalist hypothesis 
<br />
in the cognitive science makes physics a branch of number 
<br />
theory/computer science. See UDA in my papers or in the archive. I have 
<br />
already explained this a couple of time. Physics appears to emerge from 
<br />
a (n-person) computations statistic.
<br />
2) a &quot;formalisation&quot; of the argument (called AUDA (Arithmetical UDA) in 
<br />
arithmetic. It adds nothing to the proof, except that it makes it 
<br />
constructive and it shows a precise way how to extract physics from 
<br />
comp, making comp Popper falsifiable. Here I don't succeed to explain 
<br />
this to the list because it needs more involvement in mathematics.
<br />
<br />Since my PhD, one open problem has been solved by Eric Vandenbussh 
<br />
(hand manuscript, I will put it on my web page), and I have made two 
<br />
extensions of my work.
<br />
a) a possible relation between the S4GRZ1, Z1* and X1* (modal logic of 
<br />
the &quot;material&quot; hypostases) and a notion of arithmetical braiding (and 
<br />
thus possibly quantum computing, cf Kauffman; see my url). I have 
<br />
submit an abstract for a conference, but unfortunately I have 
<br />
discovered since an error and I am stuck in the proof.
<br />
b) that the lobian interview (another name for AUDA) leads to a 
<br />
thorough purely arithmetical interpretation of Plotinus' &quot;theology&quot;. It 
<br />
appears that &quot;Plotinus' theology&quot; can be seen as the best popular 
<br />
version of the self-observing lobian machine discourse, including 
<br />
physics (The &quot;two Matters&quot; of Enned 4 II. I have submit a paper 
<br />
recently.
<br />
<br />I am grateful for the kindness and patience of the people in this list. 
<br />
There are not many person interested in such subject, which of course 
<br />
is a difficult interdisciplinary subject, it helps me a lot. But to be 
<br />
honest, the only notion I could (but not yet have) borrowed from the 
<br />
list discussion is Bostrom Self-Sampling Assumption wording, and his 
<br />
notion of Observer Moment. Indeed (n-person-points of view of the true 
<br />
Sigma1 sentences can provide n-person points of view observer moment; 
<br />
see below)
<br />
Schmidhuber left the list after denying any sense in the first and 
<br />
third person notion (he is not open on the mind-body problem). I don't 
<br />
remember Tegmark having participate in the list, except indirectly 
<br />
through a post of James Higgo quoting a personal conversation where 
<br />
Tegmark explains why he does not infer quantum immortality from quantum 
<br />
suicide. Tegmark is a bit fuzzy on what is an observer.
<br />
<br />Personally I believe that the mailing list would be formidably enhanced 
<br />
if we could use a simple pen for simple drawing. Just a pen. I mostly 
<br />
reason with simple images. And this is even more true about the quantum 
<br />
topological target which can be seen as an intermediate step between 
<br />
mind/matter and numbers.
<br />

<br />
<br />I will be busy newt week: here is an unfinished post I wrote. I send it 
<br />
in case it helps a bit.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; like answering &quot;who are you?&quot; by I am me&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm satisfied with this summary. The physical implementation problem 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a problem when considering abstract machines.
</em><br />
<br /><br />So let us sum up (assuming comp once and for all at the start).   (comp 
<br />
= &quot;Yes Doctor&quot; + Church Thesis (Arithmetical realism as I use it is 
<br />
implicit in Church thesis)
<br />
<br />1) UDA+movie-graph entails that the physical science has to be a 
<br />
sub-branch  of computer-science/number theory.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically: physics = invariant for a notion of (1-person-plural) 
<br />
self-observation. 1-person plural notions refer to multiplication of 
<br />
couple or entangled computational histories.
<br />
<br />OK?
<br />
<br />2) This entails also that a self-observing universal machine, which 
<br />
exists by Church Thesis, has to discover physics &quot;in her head&quot;. This 
<br />
provides a strategy: interview a &quot;sufficiently platonist&quot; universal 
<br />
machine about herself.
<br />
<br />3) This gives a sequence of theorems, actually:  Godel, Löb, Solovay, 
<br />
Boolos Goldlblatt, Visser ... (ref in my thesis). Such theorems (and 
<br />
others) can be summarized by saying that the universal machines 
<br />
discover what Plotinus discovered when looking inward, mainly all those 
<br />
&quot;person points of view&quot; (hypostasis). Physics is arithmetic as seen 
<br />
from one of those points of view; it is the one corresponding to a 
<br />
first person plural indeterminacy.
<br />
This is made possible by the existence of the gap between truth and 
<br />
provability.
<br />
The following, where p alone means &quot;p (an arithmetical proposition like 
<br />
1+1=2)  is true&quot;: describes the definition of the main hypostases (Bp 
<br />
means the the machine proves p, Dp abbreviates ~B~p, where &quot;~&quot; denotes 
<br />
negation, and should be read &quot;p is consistent for me&quot; (or I cannot 
<br />
prove ~p):
<br />
<br />1) p                (unameable, Plotinus' ONE)
<br />
2) Bp             (G, G*)              (nameable, Plotinus' Intellect)
<br />
3) Bp &amp; p       (S4Grz = S4Grz*   (unameable, Plotinus All soul)
<br />
<br />4) Bp &amp; Dp             (Z, Z*;  nameable, Plotinus' intelligible matter)
<br />
5) Bp &amp; Dp &amp; p     (X, X*; unameable, Plotinus' sensible matter)
<br />
<br />Which makes a total of ... 8 hypostases!  Why 8?
<br />
Because, not only the gap between truth and provability does entail, 
<br />
from the machine point of view, the distinction between the logic 
<br />
obeyed by the 5 hypostases, but it doubles each hypostasis, making thus 
<br />
10 hypostases (the truth and the provable points of view about them). 
<br />
But neither the ONE nor the Soul are duplicated by the G, 
<br />
G*-distinction: thus 8 hypostases.
<br />
<br /><br />4) then add the arithmetical version of comp (actually something weaker 
<br />
than comp):   p -&gt; Bp. Add it to G. The formula &quot;p -&gt; Bp&quot; can be shown 
<br />
to characterize the Sigma1 true sentences (= DU accessible states). 
<br />
This changes all the hypostases. It is the acomp-hypostases (with acomp 
<br />
the arithmetical translation of comp):
<br />
<br />1) p                (quasi nameable now (could be a problem), Plotinus' 
<br />
ONE (in a more pythagorean version)
<br />
2) Bp             (G1, G1*)              (nameable, Plotinus' comp 
<br />
Intellect)
<br />
3) Bp &amp; p       (S4Grz 1 =  S4Grz1*   (unameable, Plotinus comp All 
<br />
soul)
<br />
<br />4) Bp &amp; Dp             (Z1, Z1*;  nameable, Plotinus'  comp 
<br />
intelligible matter)
<br />
5) Bp &amp; Dp &amp; p     (X1, X1*; unameable, Plotinus'  comp sensible matter)
<br />
<br />My (modest) result: S4Grz1, Z1*, X1* gives rise to an arithmetical 
<br />
quantization. The quantization of p is given by BDp (with B and D 
<br />
interpreted in each of those three hypostases: it seems that the 
<br />
arithmetical bottom is completely symmetrical.
<br />
<br />5) Major defect considering the reasonable target: quantum mechanics, 
<br />
or quantum computation (we have to find (by UDA) a reverse of Deutsch 
<br />
justification of bits from qubits). No arithmetical tensor, no natural 
<br />
coupling of true sigma_1 sentences, no braids (yet), nor Temperley Lieb 
<br />
algebra. But I would propose to
<br />
<br />I will send to the list some tutorial book references which can help. I 
<br />
propose we work out better the &quot;physical&quot; target. I will send a post on 
<br />
quantum computation, and on the Deutsch Friedman Kitaev thesis (the 
<br />
corresponding &quot;Church thesis&quot; for quantum computation). Meanwhile I 
<br />
would recommend the reading of Louis Kauffman's paper (ref in my URL) 
<br />
on knots and quantum information. This is just a suggestion, but, it 
<br />
could helps to explain or realise that the notion of computation and of 
<br />
quantum computation are far richer than people usually think. Knots 
<br />
provides combinatorial and discrete models of &quot;physical universe&quot; quite 
<br />
interesting per se, also.
<br />
<br />If all this is too technical, perhaps we could create a 
<br />
&quot;technical-everything-list&quot; for those ready to do more math. This is a 
<br />
suggestion, and it could provide a motivation for Jason's Wiki.  I 
<br />
don't want insist too much on technical issue if people are not 
<br />
interested, and I remain interested in informal discussion. But, and 
<br />
this is a proof we do have make progress, More and more often I feel 
<br />
obliged to mention the technical AUDA to make clear informal talk.
