<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Recalling your interest in Chalmers: I was re-reading &quot;Facing Up to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the Problem of Consciousness&quot; recently, and I  realised - I think for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the first time - that his own &quot;double-aspect theory of information&quot;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; effectively a reformulation, in less 'professionally-embarrassing'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; lingo, of eastern metaphysics!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Indeed, Chalmers' double-aspect theory of information seemed like a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; good starting point when I first read it 18 months or so ago, but I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; guess the question is where do you go from there?  Chalmers did a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; great job of articulating the mind-body problem, and I think in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; defending his initial position, but he doesn't seem to have made much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; progress in the 14 or so years since then.  BUT, then...I guess that's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the &quot;hard&quot; part for you.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Though, just in the last month, I think I've kind of shifted gears
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; here.  Why should consciousness be an aspect of information (or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anything else)?  Why not consider information an aspect of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In an earlier thread, Brent mentioned Hume, and in response you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; referenced Kant, BUT I'm not very familiar with either.  But just in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the last week I've discovered that Kant has already given some thought
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to this topic, and kindly summarized his views in &quot;A Critique of Pure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Reason&quot;!  Who knew???  So now I'm interested in reading up on Kant,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and particularly G. E. Schulze's subsequent response in Aenesidemus.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; SO...if you've already been down this path, then I'd be interested to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hear your thoughts.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Though, obviously since A Critique of Pure reason was written in 1781,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and yet we're still here discussing it almost 230 years later, it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; didn't offer any conclusive answers...but still...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course even before Hume and Kant, we have Leibniz in Monadology  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (1714):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Moreover, it must be confessed that perception and that which depends
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; upon it are inexplicable on mechanical grounds, that is to say, by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; means of figures and motions. And supposing there were a machine, so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constructed as to think, feel, and have perception, it might be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conceived as increased in size, while keeping the same proportions, so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that one might go into it as into a mill. That being so, we should, on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; examining its interior, find only parts which work one upon another,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and never anything by which to explain a perception.  Thus it is in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simple substance, and not in a compound or in a machine, that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perception must be sought for.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; BUT, I think my general criticism is that we seem to be mistaking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; descriptions of what we are conscious of, with an explanation of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness itself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So, for instance, if Bruno is correct in his mathematical theory of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the origins of consciousness...what does that mean, really?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ultimately, how is it different than saying &quot;consciousness exists
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; uncaused, but by pure chance there are these interesting patterns that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can be seen in this record of our past observations.&quot;
</em><br />
<br />Chance is also a sort of filling-gap explanations.
<br />
Assuming mechanism, chance cannot work. It cannot explain  
<br />
regularities. It cannot explain why we remain in stable realities.
<br />
Be it matter or consciousness we may try theories, instead of  
<br />
postulating an absence of explanation at the start.
<br />
Some theories can then explain why some phenomenological gaps have to  
<br />
exist, due to our embedding in reality/realities.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; SO...I dunno.  Bruno made the dreaded accusation of solipsism, but I'm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not sure how you avoid ending up there (at least in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; epistemological sense of there being a limit to what can be known),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; regardless of which direction you go.  You can take the long way, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you can take the short way, but all roads do seem to ultimately lead
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to some variety of solipsism.  The only question is what kind of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scenery will you get along the way.  Hmmmm.
</em><br />
<br /><br />All babies are solipsist. We start from solipsism. Solipsism is  
<br />
correct, from the first person point of view. But science begins when  
<br />
we start betting in a third or perhaps a zero-person view, a  
<br />
transcendental reality, be it a universe, a god, a way (tao). We need  
<br />
this if only to be able to accept other minds, other consciousness,  
<br />
other people. Then we can make theories.
<br />
Now, all universal machine does have that solipsist part, and we can  
<br />
explain why, and what exists beyond.
<br />
<br />A lot of what you say makes sense, but more as a description of  
<br />
important data, than as an attempt toward an explanation.
<br />
Once you accept that something else (third person) can have a first  
<br />
person view, be it a machine, an animal, a human, an extraterrestrial  
<br />
entity or a god, you have to accept that solipsism, although an  
<br />
accurate feature of consciousness, is inaccurate as a fundamental  
<br />
explanation. We can believe in something greater than ourself.  
<br />
Somehow, the belief in &quot;matter&quot; is an intermediate between the  
<br />
correct, but third person pointless solipsism, and the many incorrect,  
<br />
but corrigible, pointers toward the real or truth, which is what we  
<br />
are searching.
