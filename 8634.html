<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thanks for your vote of confidence Kim, but sadly I am not attempting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to write a &quot;laypersons&quot; guide to the subject. Stephen Hawking did that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for cosmology in &quot;Brief History of Time&quot;, which in my opinion is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; heroic failure. It is very well written, and avoids the use of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; terminology
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (eg maths) unfamiliar with laypeople, but - sadly as a consequence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fails to educate anyone.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Well - if it's any consolation, I find &quot;Theory of Nothing&quot; way, way  
<br />
easier to grasp than BHoT which I read hungrily when it first  
<br />
appeared. A heroic failure indeed; I don't even find it very well  
<br />
written. I was unable to locate anyone at the time who could  
<br />
understand it either so gave up trying. Many authors have tackled the  
<br />
same subject matter since with a much higher degree of readability  
<br />
and explanatory power.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Rather I'm trying put things together at a level that people on this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; list might understand, its a sort of least common denominator of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; various disciplines involved - computer science, physics, maths,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; biology, cognitive science and dare I say philosophy. I picked for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reference the sort of mathematical/scientific understanding I had
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; achieved in year 11/12 of high school. This is not to say that your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; average year 11/12 student will be able to manage this, but I'm hoping
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that most of my intended audience can manage that level of logical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thought, that is, that anyone interested in the topic can, with some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; effort perhaps, understand the material. Sad to say, I doubt that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; general public will ever get it.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Of course - you simply cannot and should not try to simplify it  
<br />
beyond a certain point. Otherwise it comes across as a bunch of hocus- 
<br />
pocus. That's what I like about it - you have struck the hoped-for  
<br />
balance between technical exposition and verbal summing-up (at least  
<br />
for me).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps this subject can get the Hawking BHoT treatment in due course,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but we're probably at least a decade or two away from that.
</em><br />
<br /><br />If, as DD argues, quantum computation should be available in about a  
<br />
decade, should we not try to accelerate the pace of public education  
<br />
in this field so that the intellectual terrain is prepared a little  
<br />
in advance, so to speak? Unless people generally have some grasp of  
<br />
multiverse theory, q comp is going to appear like magic. We don't  
<br />
want people turning this thing into a religion, do we?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; On your music point, have you read &quot;Goedel, Escher, Bach&quot; by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hofstadter? I've just finished reading it, and wondered why I didn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; read this gem 2 decades ago. It is full of musical references, so you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will appreciate it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />I mentioned this one to you a while back; I'm ready to re-read it now  
<br />
that I understand better the impact of Goedel's Incompleteness  
<br />
theorems (thanks mainly to the exploration of these by the very fine  
<br />
writers on this list). One thing is for sure, Hofstadter does  
<br />
approach my notion of a &quot;musical object&quot;  spinning in its own space.  
<br />
I simply ask - where is this space? Probably in my head. Without  
<br />
necessarily talking about triangle land and blue mists of probability  
<br />
over Platonia a la Barbour, I have always had the firmest impression  
<br />
that musical statements are solid objects in some sense. That alone  
<br />
prompts me to seek some discussion on this point. Is music a  
<br />
description of a thing or is it the thing itself? Certainly no  
<br />
musician is able to answer that point unaided speaking from the  
<br />
standpoint of the &quot;laws&quot; of music alone - whence my bringing the  
<br />
notion to the rather broader field of discussion that this list allows.
<br />
<br />Probably this is simply too wayward a notion; I'm happy to be taken  
<br />
apart and criticised by other thinkers (I already have been, roundly)  
<br />
but I reject out of hand the supercilious verbal sneers about  
<br />
&quot;pseudomathematical nonsense&quot;.
<br />
<br />cheers, Russ
