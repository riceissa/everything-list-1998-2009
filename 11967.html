<br />
This discussion is a hybrid of a number of very famous thought
<br />
experiments. Unlike those thought experiments, however, this experiment is
<br />
aimed purely and only at scientists. The intent is to demonstrate clearly
<br />
and definitively the nature of subjective experience (phenomenal
<br />
consciousness) and its primal role in a scientist's ability to function as
<br />
a scientist.
<br />
<br />Imagine a room. Its walls and celing and floor are matt black. There are
<br />
no doors or windows. All over the walls are digital displays which
<br />
announce numbers in warm, friendly colours. Up against all four walls and
<br />
up to international standard control desk height (roughly 750mm) is a
<br />
sloping console. Covering the console around all four walls  are
<br />
pushbuttons. The number of displays is equal to the number of sensory
<br />
nerves entering a typical human brain from the peripheral nervous systems
<br />
including all sensory input. The number of pushbuttons is equal to the
<br />
entire set of effector nerves emanating from a typical brain. This total
<br />
number of displays and pushbuttons is in the millions.
<br />
<br />There is a comfortable chair upon which is seated the room's sole
<br />
occupant, Marvin the human. Marvin is normal except for never having been
<br />
outside the room and having never otherwise acquired any knowledge of
<br />
anything other than that of the room and its contents. He knows absolutely
<br />
nothing of any sort of external world or any other people. He has no clue
<br />
about the external world except for what he can surmise from the displays
<br />
and buttons.
<br />
<br />Marvin, like all healthy humans, has an experiential life which is the
<br />
collection of private phenomenal scenes delivered by his brain material.
<br />
These are operating normally except that Marvin has been deprived of all
<br />
the phenomenal content (experiences) that he ever could have received had
<br />
he been allowed outside the room. He has had a lifetime of experiences,
<br />
but all of them have been confined to depicting the room.
<br />
<br />Marvin is a scientist. He studies the science of not-room. His life
<br />
consists of experiments which involve the pressing of buttons and the
<br />
recording of patterns in the displays. Over time an enormous volume of
<br />
data begins to show patterns for which Marvin constructs models. The
<br />
models are generalisations of the behaviour of the displays after buttons
<br />
are pushed in a certain way. He tests and refines the models and has
<br />
developed a form of symbolic representation of the behaviour of the
<br />
displays. Certain features on the display occur regularly enough that
<br />
names have been given to notional not-room phenomena. One is called the
<br />
tronelec. The mathematics of not-room includes a lot of rules about the
<br />
behaviour of tronelecs. In time Marvin realises that his exploration of
<br />
not-room can be done according to routine rules and he sets about a
<br />
systematic, exhaustive assay of the entire range of possible
<br />
button/display relationships.
<br />
<br />Everything is going nicely but then one day a well known pattern does not
<br />
occur the way it used to. After a while the old pattern resumes. The whole
<br />
mathematics of not-room is undermined. It takes a long time for Marvin to
<br />
construct a new model that accounts for the novel behaviour. A new entity
<br />
called gytravi is needed. Then things settle down and routine systematic
<br />
exploration resumes.
<br />
<br />In time a massive collection of not-room entities and behavioural rules is
<br />
constructed and begins to repeat itself. So much so that Marvin, after
<br />
checking and rechecking, finds that the model seems to have stabilised.
<br />
<br />At this point we stop to survey the situation.
<br />
<br />The first thing to note is that the room is an empirically verified
<br />
physiologically accurate representation of the sensory circumstances of a
<br />
human brain. Nervous activity effect/affect is replicated by
<br />
buttons/displays and all signals are standardised. There are no
<br />
experiential qualities (perceptual sensation qualities) associated with
<br />
this nervous activity. This is a physiologically verified, well
<br />
established empirical fact. Indeed the room is a little too kind - If you
<br />
discarded all the buttons and displays, then that is a more
<br />
physiologically accurate circumstance .
<br />
<br />The main point is that this collection of totally sensationless signals is
<br />
exactly what is available to a human brain and through which all sense
<br />
measurement arrives.  Consider the room without a Marvin in it. Based on
<br />
what evidence is there any reason to even conceptualise the existence of
<br />
an external world? Nothing in that room gives any indication of it. There
<br />
is no a-priori knowledge of not-room. No possible way to interpret any of
<br />
the signals. All there is is correlated behaviour - the behaviour of
<br />
displays correlated with other displays and buttons, none of which have
<br />
any other discernable impact. The room is quintessentially a zombie in the
<br />
sense it has no experiential life at all despite being wired as
<br />
extravagently as a complete human.
<br />
<br />Marvin thinks of himself as a scientist. Exactly what is he a scientist
<br />
of? His science is, he thinks, the science of 'not-room'. But is it? All
<br />
he has is a very sophisticated model of display/button correlations. His
<br />
science is not about 'not-room' at all! His science is the science of room
<br />
display/buttons. He has absolutely no justification to any claim about
<br />
anything going on anywhere else, although that is how Marvin thinks of it.
<br />
His science is very very predictive of button/display behaviour. As to the
<br />
reality of the model he has developed? He has no way of contextualising
<br />
any of the abstractions he has created with the actual state of affairs in
<br />
'not-room'.
<br />
<br />Absolutely anything could be out there driving the displays and Marvin
<br />
will never know. Indeed worse than that, there may be an infinite number
<br />
of different ways that not-room could present the same display values and
<br />
Marvin would never know. The display data is fundamentally, intrinsically
<br />
ambiguous. Even if the displays and buttons were nicely grouped and
<br />
labeled all that would happen is that there would be expectations of
<br />
related behaviours in a group, which Marvin does not have to name himself.
<br />
It could even be named 'sight', 'sound' and so on and Marvin may
<br />
understand what that might mean, but it delivers no claim to any
<br />
definitive or unambiguous knowledge of not-room.
<br />
<br />And that, fundamentally, is the real nub of the matter.
<br />
<br />What is outside the room? It doesn't really matter. It could be an
<br />
elaborate multistory building with a ratsnest of electrical
<br />
interconnections done with a computer. It could be a control room in the
<br />
head of a giant robot. It could be literally wired up to a human body with
<br />
no brain. It could be a spaceship. None of that matters except in the
<br />
details. Marvin can never know because he has no experience available to
<br />
even imagine it.
<br />
<br />To finish off the room scenario we now take Marvin out of the room. In his
<br />
place we leave a machine that is based on his systematic scientific
<br />
behaviour. It runs with clockwork and pneumatics from punched cards. None
<br />
of the displays are needed, none of the buttons are needed - they are all
<br />
directly connected to the new machine. The massively complex model marvin
<br />
has constructed, which has nothing whatever to do with 'not-room' except
<br />
in the most indirect of abstracted ways, goes on being verified and
<br />
occasionally amended using more rules for amending the model, also devised
<br />
by Marvin. The model can never say anything about any changes in
<br />
'not-room'. All it can sense is novel (unexpected according to the model)
<br />
behaviour in the sensing displays, which is an entirely different thing.
<br />
<br />The main message to take from this is that this bizarre concoction is the
<br />
necessary circumstance that would exist in a human if it weren't for what
<br />
phenomenal consciousness provides a human scientist.
