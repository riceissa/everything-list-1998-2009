<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From Bruno Marchal, Sat Jan 27:
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let us suppose I am duplicated. I am annihilated at Brussels and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recontituted at both Washington and Moscow.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; By comp I survive. I cannot predict with certainty where I will feel
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; myself (1-person point of view) after the experiment. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So there is an uncertainty on the domain of reconstitution. OK ?
</em><br />
<br />Why repeat this over and over? This is the very reason why one has to
<br />
look at possible probability distributions over possible futures to
<br />
quantify the uncertainty.
<br />
<br />If the distribution is computable or at least describable then you
<br />
get results such as in <a href="http://rapa.idsia.ch/~juergen/toesv2">http://rapa.idsia.ch/~juergen/toesv2</a> 
<br />
Otherwise you cannot even describe it. Case closed.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now let us run the UD. And let us call S your current computational 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; state.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let us first suppose we run the UD for n steps, where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; n is a finite very big number (to fix our mind).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; From the invariance lemma it follows that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the domain of uncertainty is given
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by the set of all the virtual reconstitutions of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your state S which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has occured in that running. Let us call that set S_n
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now suppose we let the UD never being stopped. Then,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thanks to the invariance lemma, the uncertainty is given by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the union of all the S_n, n positive integer.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is an easy exercise to show that we will not succeed to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quantify the uncertainty by putting equiprobable weight on all the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; equivalent state S. This entails white noise.
</em><br />
<br />In case you just mean there is no way of assigning equal
<br />
nonvanishing probability to infinitely many objects - sure. 
<br />
<a href="http://rapa.idsia.ch/~juergen/toesv2/node44.html">http://rapa.idsia.ch/~juergen/toesv2/node44.html</a>
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; We must put the weight on the (relative) computationnal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; histories going through S.
</em><br />
<br />Sure. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And the set of all infinite computational histories has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the cardinality of the continuum.
</em><br />
<br />This is THE major error you keep making. It is the set of all infinite
<br />
histories which has the cardinality of the continuum.  But most of them
<br />
are not computable. So they cannot be _computational_ histories, which
<br />
are countable - the set of all infinite _computational_ histories does
<br />
NOT have the cardinality of the continuum.
<br />
<br />You cannot generalize from countably many, constructively enumerable 
<br />
elements in the union of all your S_n above to a non-constructive
<br />
continuum. If your claims depend on the continuum stuff then I can safely
<br />
ignore them in the future. I am just hoping for you that this is not
<br />
the basis of your entire PhD thesis (what did the referees have
<br />
to say about this?).
<br />
<br />The problem is right here. You are misunderstanding the difference
<br />
between the things &quot;computable in the limit&quot; and the elements of the
<br />
continuum.  In case you want to reply please just focus on this issue
<br />
but do not repost the stuff about Washington and Moscow etc.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; (It contains the ``stupid&quot; dovetailing on the reals 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; described above!).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You must not confuse the 3-person point of view
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concerning the actual running of a UD, with the first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person point of view, which is defined on states independently
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of any time for reaching the states by the UD. That is why the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; union of the S_n is taken on all the natural (N), and that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is why we must take the uncountable set of all the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; infinite histories for the domain of the ``probability or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; credibility (whatever) distribution&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />Computation is incompatible with wild ideas such as uncountable
<br />
time, no matter who's the observer. Any possible future of an observer
<br />
within a computer-generated universe (your 1st person, I believe) must be
<br />
among the rather few computable ones. This is true from the point of
<br />
views of both outside and inside observers. Computability is objective
<br />
- there is nothing that is computable inside some computable universe
<br />
but not outside of it. You cannot switch from countable to incountable
<br />
by stepping inside.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am not actually saying that the UD build a non computable 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; object or enumerate an uncountable set, I am merely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; saying that with comp the UD makes sets of non computable 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; object playing a role in the distribution of possible 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; histories *from* the first person point of view of the machines.
</em><br />
<br />Playing a role? This is so vague.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree that I say something shocking. At each instant
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am not multiplied by 10^100 like in deWitt's view of Everett
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; formulation of QM, I show that with comp we are multiplied
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a priori by 2^aleph_0, at each instant ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree it is weird. But is it weirder than Feynman Integral.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For me Feynman Integral is still weirder ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm afraid you don't take the difference
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between first and third person into account, or am I wrong ?
</em><br />
<br />It is not shocking or weird at all. It is at best unclear or just plain
<br />
wrong. Clearly, your 2^aleph_0 has nothing to do with the concept of
<br />
computation. To repeat, the difference between first and third person
<br />
does not make a difference between countable and uncountable, or between
<br />
computable or noncomputable.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Remember also that, in fine, I use arithmetical realism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (the UD does not need to be runned).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is not constructive. I am not pretending having
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prove that self-aware machine face the continuum, I am 
</em><br />
<br />This is so vague - what do you mean by &quot;in fine&quot; and by &quot;face the
<br />
continuum&quot;? Your posts are full of unclear expressions like this.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; merely proving that if we are machine, and if arithmetical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; truth (the continuum of models of arithmetical theories)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exists independently of me, then self-aware machine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will be in front of that continuum when trying to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quantify their own (comp) undeterminacy.
</em><br />
<br />So what you are claiming actually depends on noncomputable stuff, which
<br />
does not exist from any constructive or computational point of view.
<br />
<br />Your expression &quot;comp&quot; has mislead me. I strongly recommend to rename
<br />
this, since your &quot;comp&quot; has nothing to do with computation. I also
<br />
recommend replacing other misleading computation-oriented expressions such
<br />
as &quot;dovetailer.&quot;  Use &quot;arithmetical realism&quot; or whatever; please do not
<br />
misuse terminology with a well-defined meaning in computability theory.
<br />
<br />Constructivists can ignore your claims as there is no compelling
<br />
reason to assume the &quot;existence&quot; of something like the continuum.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am at a billion miles isolating the right measure (if it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exists) but the interview of the sound UTM gives an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; original and pure (not empiricaly influenced) way to begin
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with.  Finding a semantics for the Z logics should clear
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the way. 
</em><br />
<br />Why not just assume the measure is constructively describable? This
<br />
apparently harmless assumption by itself has major consequences:
<br />
<a href="http://rapa.idsia.ch/~juergen/toesv2/node22.html">http://rapa.idsia.ch/~juergen/toesv2/node22.html</a>
<br />
On the other hand, if we cannot even describe our 
<br />
measure then we must shut up.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Here is the best you can achieve with a dovetailer. You can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;extract representations of all the countably many computable reals.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;How? Systematically enumerate all possible input strings, viewing them as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;starts of programs to be executed in dovetail fashion. This excludes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;many strings that cannot be input programs because one of their prefixes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;already is a self-delimiting program that will never request additional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;bits.  Some input strings, however, are valid, finite, possibly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;nonhalting programs (such as the algorithm computing the decimal expansion
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;of 1/3). They generate possibly infinite objects (such as 0.33333...).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Make a list containing all current programs or program prefixes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Update the list whenever one of its elements requests a new bit. This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;will eventually give you finite representations of each computable real.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I doubt that. The set of computable real is not recursively enumerable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But OK in the limit. It is recursive in the halting set ...
</em><br />
<br />Doubt what? I did not say anything about recursive enumerability.  
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; As Gilles Levy pointed out the efficiency of the UD is not relevant, for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the sharing space-time emerges from the statistics of the whole set
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of finite and infinite computationnal histories, from the first person 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point of view or first person plural point of view in the case of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bifurcation of deep computational histories shared by many. 
</em><br />
<br />Of course efficiency is essential as soon as it leads to countable
<br />
vs uncountable time. Countable time is within the constructive realm,
<br />
uncountable time is not.
<br />
<br />Where are the &quot;statistics&quot; you are talking about? You never define 
<br />
a probability distribution on the possible futures. No distribution,
<br />
no statistics. 
<br />
<br />On the other hand, the constraints imposed by the assumption of constructively 
<br />
describable distributions do yield nontrivial consequences: 
<br />
<a href="http://rapa.idsia.ch/~juergen/toesv2/node2.html">http://rapa.idsia.ch/~juergen/toesv2/node2.html</a>
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Once more: The concepts of dovetailing and continuum are incompatible!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes. In a trivial sense from a third person point of view. But about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the question &quot;in which computational history am I&quot;, well, if I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a machine, then a priori I can belong to 2^aleph_0 histories.
</em><br />
<br />things such as 2^aleph_0 are completely beyond computation and
<br />
constructivism and machines. Ok, the flaw in your line of reasoning
<br />
has become clear to me. I hope your PhD thesis does not stand or fall
<br />
with this, and that I won't have to post anything else on this.
