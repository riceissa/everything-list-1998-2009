<br />I understand that you are trying to challenge this notion of &quot;subjective
<br />
probability&quot; with copies.  I agree that it is problematic.  IMO it is
<br />
different to make a copy than to flip a coin -  different operationally,
<br />
and different philosophically.
<br />
<br />What you need to do is to back down from subjective probabilities and
<br />
just ask it like this: which do you like better, a universe where there
<br />
is one of you who has a 50-50 chance of being tortured; or a universe
<br />
where there are a whole lot of you and one of them will be tortured?
<br />
Try not to think about which one &quot;you&quot; will be.  You will be all of them.
<br />
Think instead about the longer term: which universe will best serve your
<br />
needs and desires?
<br />
<br />There is an inherent inconsistency in this kind of thought experiment
<br />
if it implicitly assumes that copying technology is cheap, easy and
<br />
widely available, and that copies have good lives.  If that were the
<br />
case, everyone would use it until there were so many copies that these
<br />
properties would no longer be true.
<br />
<br />It is important in such experiments to set up the social background in
<br />
which the copies will exist.  What will their lives be like, good or
<br />
bad?  If copies have good lives, then copying is normally unavailable.
<br />
In that case, the chance to make copies in this experiment may be a
<br />
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.  That might well make you be willing to
<br />
accept torture of a person you view as a future self, in exchange for
<br />
the opportunity to so greatly increase your measure.
<br />
<br />OTOH if copying is common and most people don't do it because the future
<br />
copies will be penniless and starve to death, then making copies in this
<br />
experiment is of little value and you would not accept the greater chance
<br />
of torture.
<br />
<br />This analysis is all based on the assumption that copies increase measure,
<br />
and that in such a world, observers will be trained that increasing
<br />
measure is good, just as our genes quickly learned that lesson in a
<br />
world where they can be copied.
