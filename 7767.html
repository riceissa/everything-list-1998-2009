<br />The Objectivity of Science
<br />
<br />Seven Warning Signs of Bogus Skepticism
<br />
<br /><br />by Rochus Boerner
<br />
<br />The progress of science depends on a finely tuned balance between 
<br />
open-mindedness and skepticism. Be too open minded, and you'll accept wrong 
<br />
claims. Be too skeptical, and you'll reject genuine new discoveries. Proper 
<br />
skepticism must be careful not to throw the baby out with the bathwater.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, much of what comes out of the &quot;skeptical&quot; community these 
<br />
days is not proper skepticism, but all-out, fundamentalist disbelief. Such 
<br />
skepticism can be called pseudo-skepticism, pathological skepticism or bogus 
<br />
skepticism.
<br />
<br />Here are the warning signs of bogus skepticism.
<br />
<br />1. The Skeptic has reached her skeptical opinion not after careful research 
<br />
and examination of the claim, but simply based on media reports and other 
<br />
forms of second-hand knowledge.
<br />
<br />Example: Pathological cold fusion skeptic Robert L. Park revealed in his 
<br />
March 1st 2002 What's New column that Science was going to publish an 
<br />
article on Sonofusion, and that even though he had not seen the paper, 
<br />
talked to the researchers or conducted any personal research in the area, he 
<br />
already knew that the Sonofusion discovery would turn out to be &quot;a repeat of 
<br />
the cold fusion fiasco&quot;. Park used every bit of influence he had in a 
<br />
behind-the-scenes attempt to kill the paper. Luckily, the Science editor 
<br />
didn't cave and decided to publish.
<br />
<br />2. Making uncontrolled criticisms. A criticism is uncontrolled if the same 
<br />
criticism could equally be applied to accepted science.
<br />
<br />For example, Park makes such a criticism in his book Voodoo Science (p.199). 
<br />
In the context of a discussion of an obviously pseudoscientific Good Morning 
<br />
America report on anomalous phenomena (debunkery by association: as if TV 
<br />
shows were the principal outlet for reporting the results of psi research!), 
<br />
Park writes
<br />
<br />Why, you may wonder, all this business of random machines? Jahn has studied 
<br />
random number generators, water fountains in which the subject tries to urge 
<br />
drops to greater heights, all sorts of machines. But it is not clear that 
<br />
any of these machines are truly random. Indeed, it is generally believed 
<br />
that there are no truly random machines. It may be, therefore, that the lack 
<br />
of randomness only begins to show up after many trials. Besides, if the mind 
<br />
can influence inanimate objects, why not simply measure the static force the 
<br />
mind can exert? Modern ultramicrobalances can routinely measure a force of 
<br />
much less than a billionth of an ounce. Why not just use your psychokinetic 
<br />
powers to deflect a microbalance? It's sensitive, simple, even quantitative, 
<br />
with no need for any dubious statistical analysis.
<br />
<br />Where does Park's assessment that effects that are only indirectly detected, 
<br />
by statistical analysis, are suspect, leave conventional science? Deprived 
<br />
of one of its most powerful tools of analysis. The cherished 1992 COBE 
<br />
discovery of minute fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background 
<br />
radiation would have to be thrown out, since it was entirely statistical in 
<br />
nature, and therefore by Park's argument, 'dubious'. The most celebrated 
<br />
discoveries of particle physics, such as the 1995 discovery of the top 
<br />
quark, or the results of neutrino detection experiments, or the synthesis of 
<br />
superheavy, extremely short-lived elements, would have to be thrown out, 
<br />
since they, too, are indirect and statistical in nature. Modern medicine 
<br />
would have to be invalidated as well because it relies on statistical 
<br />
analysis (of double- blind trials) to prove the efficacy of drugs.
<br />
<br />For comparison: the American Institute of Physics's Bulletin of Physics 
<br />
News, #216, March 3, 1995 gives the odds against chance for the top quark 
<br />
discovery as a million to one. A 1987 meta-analysis performed by Dean Radin 
<br />
and Roger Nelson of RNG (random number generator) experiments between 1959 
<br />
and 1987 , on the other hand, shows the existence of an anomalous deviation 
<br />
from chance with odds against chance exceeding one trillion to one (see 
<br />
Radin, The Conscious Universe, p. 140).
<br />
<br />Park's argument is the quintessential uncontrolled criticism: accepted 
<br />
scientific methods that constitute the backbone of modern science suddenly 
<br />
become questionable when they are used on phenomena that don't fit his 
<br />
ideological predilections.
<br />
<br />3. The Pseudoskeptical Catch-22: &quot;unconventional claims have to be proved 
<br />
before they can be investigated!&quot; This way, of course, they will never be 
<br />
investigated or proved.
<br />
<br />Parapsychology has been significantly hampered by this pseudoskeptical 
<br />
attitude. Pseudoskeptics complain that effect sizes are not bigger; but at 
<br />
the same time, they scream bloody murder if any grant-making agency even so 
<br />
much considers doing something about it. Radin writes in The Conscious 
<br />
Universe:
<br />
<br />The tactics of the extreme skeptics have been more than merely annoying. The 
<br />
professional skeptic's aggressive public labeling of parapsychology as a 
<br />
&quot;pseudoscience&quot;, implying fraud or incompetence on the part of the 
<br />
researchers, has been instrumental in preventing this research from taking 
<br />
place at all.
<br />
<br />A similar situation exists in the new energy field. Pseudoskeptics like 
<br />
Robert L. Park are not content just dismissing things like cold fusion; they 
<br />
put massive pressure on policy makers and government to obstruct efforts to 
<br />
prove them wrong. Park's successful lobbying of the US patent office to 
<br />
withdraw Randall Mill's Black Light patent (which had already been 
<br />
approved!) comes to mind as an example.
<br />
<br />4. Evidence of refutal is anecdotal or otherwise scientifically worthless. 
<br />
Pseudoskeptics tend to accept conventional &quot;explanations&quot; for unconventional 
<br />
phenomena very easily, no matter how weak, contrived or far-fetched. A good 
<br />
historical example is the rejection of the crop circle phenomenon.
<br />
<br />Doug Bower and David Chorley claimed in 1991 that they had created all of 
<br />
the British crop circles since 1978 (all 2000 of them). This was an 
<br />
extraordinary claim of the highest order. Two old men claimed that for over 
<br />
a decade, they have been creating geometrical designs in crops whose 
<br />
complexity defies easy geometrical construction, but they were never able to 
<br />
demonstrate that they can do what they claim they could do. Any true skeptic 
<br />
would have rejected Bower's and Chorley's claim, since &quot;extraordinary claims 
<br />
require extraordinary evidence&quot;. Yet, the organized skeptics endorsed the 
<br />
claims enthusiastically and denounced the whole crop circle phenomenon a 
<br />
proven hoax.
<br />
<br />5. The Skeptic rejects a discovery or invention merely because it has been 
<br />
believed for a long time that such a thing as the claimed discovery or 
<br />
invention is impossible.
<br />
<br />This is the sole basis for the pseudoskeptical claim that, for example, a 
<br />
perpetuum mobile of the second kind is impossible. Park, for example, writes 
<br />
the following ignorant tirade in his 9/24/1999 What's New Column:
<br />
<br />PERPETUUM MOBILE: BETTING AGAINST THE LAWS OF THERMODYNAMICS.
<br />
<br />Most free energy scams invoke outlandish new physics: cold fusion, hydrinos, 
<br />
zero-point energy, gravity shields, antimatter. But there are also 
<br />
throwbacks to the 19th Century that directly challenge the laws of 
<br />
thermodynamics. Physics Today carried a full-page ad for Entropy Systems, 
<br />
Inc. describing a heat engine that runs off ambient heat. It's hardly a new 
<br />
idea. Two years ago Better World Technologies was touting the &quot;Fisher 
<br />
engine&quot; that violated the Second Law (WN 18 Jul 97). But it wasn't new then 
<br />
either--it was the &quot;zero motor,&quot; invented by John Gamgee in 1880. It didn't 
<br />
work then either, but Gamgee sold it to the U.S. Navy anyway.
<br />
<br />Park's sole argument appears to be that We Have Always Believed The Second 
<br />
Law Is Correct, So It Has To Be. Physicists who actually investigate this 
<br />
question without preconceived notions of what is possible or impossible have 
<br />
reached very different conclusions. D.P. Sheehan, A.R. Putnam and J.H. 
<br />
Wrighty of the University of San Diego write in a recent paper titled A 
<br />
Solid-State Maxwell Demon:
<br />
<br />Over the last ten years, an unprecedented number of challenges have been 
<br />
leveled against the absolute status of the second law of thermodynamics. 
<br />
During this period, roughly 40 papers have appeared in the general 
<br />
literature [e.g., 1- 20], representing more than a dozen distinct 
<br />
challenges; the publication rate is increasing. Recently, for the first 
<br />
time, a major scientic press has commissioned a monograph on the the subject 
<br />
and a first international conference has been convened to examine these 
<br />
challenges. (..) The genealogy of the Maxwell demon thus split into those 
<br />
that relied on sentient processes (e.g., intelligent active measurement, 
<br />
calculation, or microscopic manipulation), and those that did not. The 
<br />
former line has largely died out owing to advances in information theory 
<br />
[26], but the latter survived and now poses the most serious threat to the 
<br />
absolute status of the second law.
<br />
<br />Future historians of science may well put the second &quot;law&quot; in the same 
<br />
category as &quot;heavier-than-air flying machines are impossible&quot;. An expression 
<br />
of contemporary scientific prejudice and lack of technological 
<br />
sophistication, not an eternal law of nature.
<br />
<br />6. The Skeptic claims that the claimed effect contradicts the &quot;laws of 
<br />
nature&quot; (and therefore has to be wrong, since the Skeptic and the scientific 
<br />
community he presumes to represent have of course already complete knowledge 
<br />
of the laws of nature).
<br />
<br />For example, in a personal note published on James Randi's Website, Robert 
<br />
Park makes the following statement about the &quot;Motionless Electromagnetic 
<br />
Generator&quot;, a claimed free energy device:
<br />
<br />I've been following the MEG claim since Patent 6,362,718 was issued in the 
<br />
spring (What's New 4 Apr 02). The claim, of course, is preposterous. It is a 
<br />
clear violation of the conservation of energy.
<br />
<br />But Park is only demolishing a straw man. The first law of thermodynamics 
<br />
states that the energy of a closed system is conserved. But the inventors of 
<br />
the MEG claim that their device takes energy from the zero-point field of 
<br />
the vacuum, thereby conserving the energy of the total system (which in this 
<br />
case would be the MEG and the surrounding vacuum). Whether it can actually 
<br />
do that is an open question. But the existence of the Casimir force proves 
<br />
that in principle such extraction of energy from the vacuum is possible 
<br />
(even though the energy gained from the Casimir force between two plates is 
<br />
negligible). Therefore, one cannot dismiss claims for free energy devices 
<br />
such as the MEG on a priori grounds of energy conservation. Since Park is a 
<br />
physicists, he could not possibly be unaware of this. By stating that the 
<br />
claimed invention contradicts the law of energy conservation, he 
<br />
intentionally misrepresents the claims of the MEG inventors. They do not 
<br />
claim to have found a way around the first law; they merely claim to have 
<br />
accessed a source of energy not previously accessible to human technology.
<br />
<br />7. The Skeptic believes in scientific mob rule. &quot;In Science, the Majority 
<br />
Consensus is Always Right&quot;.
<br />
<br />The unfortunate reality is that there is a complex sociology of science. 
<br />
Scientific truth is frequently not determined by right or wrong, but by ego, 
<br />
prestige, authority of claimants, conflicts of interests and economic 
<br />
agendas. Scientists who propose research that threatens the viability of 
<br />
basic theories on which authorities in the field have built their careers, 
<br />
and governments and corporations have bet lots of money will find themselves 
<br />
out of a job very soon. The list of of great scientists who became 
<br />
scientific outcasts after they published research that contradicts 
<br />
establishment dogma is long, and includes such names as Peter Duesberg, 
<br />
Brian Josephson, Jacques Benveniste, and of course Professors Pons and 
<br />
Fleischmann
