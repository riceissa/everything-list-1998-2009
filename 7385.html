Stathis writes
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This brings up an interesting conundrum that I raised three or four torture 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiments ago. Given 10 instantiations of a person having an unpleasant 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience E ... for example 10 sentient programs running in parallel, is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it better, if we aim to reduce suffering, to (a) terminate 9 of the 10
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; programs and leave one still running and experiencing E, or (b) stop 5 of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the 10 programs from experiencing E, but leave them running,
</em><br />
<br />Ah ha! And having what sort of experience?  It's crucial: I shall
<br />
assume that they are having very mildly positive experiences, e.g.,
<br />
that their lives are barely worth living in this condition.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and leave the other 5 programs continuing to experience E?
</em><br />
<br />I will say that it is better to terminate 9 of the 10,
<br />
because we are given that the experience E is horrible:
<br />
therefore the total benefit to the person is calculated
<br />
as follows:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5*(-1000) + 5*(2) &lt; 1*(-1000)
<br />
<br />where, say, E is worth -1000 to you, and the so-so day
<br />
worth 2. This uses the additivity of benefit. It also
<br />
accords with common sense, in that if you had to sign
<br />
up to go through in sequence the experiences of the 10
<br />
(five tortures and five so-so days), or instead sign up
<br />
to go through just 1 torture, you'd sign up for the latter.
<br />
Especially if you were forced to have a run-through of
<br />
each ahead of time!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you do the total suffering equation assuming that each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instantiation is separate, (a) is better.
</em><br />
<br />And that is the answer I arrived at.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I would argue that if you are one of the suffering victims,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (a) does you no good at all: subjectively, you will continue to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suffer, since the one remaining program that is running will 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; serve as continuation for any of the 9 terminated ones.
</em><br />
<br />Here is the dreadful &quot;closest continuer&quot; method of Nozick and
<br />
others. I claim it gives the wrong answer. Look, the &quot;continuation&quot;
<br />
happens anyway, whether you die here or not!  Especially if the
<br />
events are outside each other's light cones, how can what happens
<br />
here possibly affect what happens there?  Just because you, say,
<br />
are *not* terminated here does not mean that you don't &quot;continue&quot;
<br />
there just as much.
<br />
<br />What happens in box P far, far away from box Q does not affect what
<br />
happens in box Q. If you are in pain in box P, then it doesn't
<br />
matter to you in P what goes on in Q. Your benefit seems to me to
<br />
be just the sum of the two, much as if you experienced them as a
<br />
single copy, but had memory erasure between the experiences.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In fact, there is no way for someone inside the simulated system
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to know that any of the instantiations had been terminated, as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; long as at least one keeps running. 
</em><br />
<br />Well, even if they are ALL terminated, the subject does not know.
<br />
Knowing is an activity, and so you don't know if suddenly you all
<br />
die.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; On the other hand, with (b) there is subjectively a 50% probability that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your suffering will end.
</em><br />
<br />People who use probability when discussing duplicates seem to talk
<br />
as though an executing process had a magical serial number generated
<br />
by God. When the subject dies, it's as if the serial number is
<br />
instantaneously transferred to *one* other of the possible systems
<br />
that could support him, but not to the others. But there are no souls.
<br />
There are no serial numbers. You become all the others equally, and
<br />
with 100% probability for each. You even become them if &quot;you&quot; do
<br />
not die.
<br />
<br />What will happen if you choose A is that you will experience E through
<br />
one bad session. If you choose B, you will experience E through five
<br />
bad sessions, and E' through five so-so sessions. Given that E' is of
<br />
no particular value either positive or negative, A is the better choice.
<br />
(This is just using different language to do the same calculation as above.)
<br />
