MGA 2
<br />
<br /><br />The second step of the MGA, consists in making a change to MGA 1 so  
<br />
that we don't have to introduce that unreasonable amount of cosmic  
<br />
luck, or of apparent randomness. It shows the &quot;lucky&quot; aspect of the  
<br />
coming information is not relevant. Jason thought on this sequel.
<br />
<br /><br />Let us consider again Alice, which, as you know as an artificial  
<br />
brain, made of logic gates.
<br />
Now Alice is sleeping, and doing a dream---like Carroll's original  
<br />
Alice.
<br />
<br />Today we know that a REM dream is a conscious experience, or better an  
<br />
experience of consciousness, thanks to the work of Hearne Laberge,  
<br />
Dement, etc.
<br />
Malcolm's theory of dream, where dream are not conscious, has been  
<br />
properly refuted by Hearne and Laberge experiences. (All reference can  
<br />
be found in the bibliography of my &quot;long thesis&quot;. Ask me if you have  
<br />
problem to find them.
<br />
<br />I am using a dream experience instead of an experience of awakeness  
<br />
for having less technical problems and being shorter on the relevant  
<br />
points. I let you do the change as an exercise if you want. If you  
<br />
have understood UDA up to the sixth step, such change are easy to do.  
<br />
To convince Brent Meeker, you will have to put the environment,  
<br />
actually its digital functional part in the &quot;generalized brain&quot;,  
<br />
making the general setting much longer to describe. (If the part of  
<br />
the environment needed for consciousness to proceed is not Turing  
<br />
emulable, then you already negate MEC of course).
<br />
<br />The dream will facilitate the experience. It is known that in a REM  
<br />
dream we are paralyzed (no outputs), we are cut out from the  
<br />
environment: (no inputs, well not completely because you would not  
<br />
hear the awakening clock, but let us not care about this, or do the  
<br />
exercise above), ... and we are hallucinating: the dream is a natural  
<br />
sort of video game. It shows that the brain is at least a &quot;natural&quot;  
<br />
virtual reality generator. OK?
<br />
<br />Alice has already an artificial digital brain. This consists in a  
<br />
boolean tridimensional  graph with nodes being NOR gates, and vertex  
<br />
being wires. For the MEC+MAT believer, the dream is produced by the  
<br />
physical activity of the &quot;circular digital information processing&quot;  
<br />
done by that boolean graph.
<br />
<br />With MEC, obviously all what matter is that the boolean graph  
<br />
processes the right computation, and we don't have to take into  
<br />
account the precise  position of the gates in space. They are not  
<br />
relevant for the computation (if things like that were relevant we  
<br />
would already have said &quot;no&quot; to the doctor. So we can topologically  
<br />
deform Alice boolean graph brain and project it on a plane so that no  
<br />
gates overlap. Some wires will cross, but (exercise) the crossing of  
<br />
the wires function can itself be implemented with NOR gates. (A  
<br />
solution of that problem, posed by Dewdney, has been given in the  
<br />
Scientific American Journal (and is displayed in &quot;Conscience et  
<br />
Mécanisme&quot; with the reference).
<br />
<br />So Alice's brain can be made into a plane boolean graph.
<br />
<br />Also, a MEC+MAT believer should not insist on the electrical nature   
<br />
of the communication by wires, nor on the electrical nature of the  
<br />
processing of the information by the gates, so that we can use optical  
<br />
information instead. Laser beams play the role of the wires, and some  
<br />
destructive interference can be used for the NOR. The details are not  
<br />
relevant, given that I am not presenting a realist experiment (below,  
<br />
or later, if people harass me with too much engineering question,  I  
<br />
will propose a completely different representation of the same (with  
<br />
respect to the relevance of the reasoning) situation, by using the  
<br />
even less realist Ned Block Chinese People Computer: it can be used  
<br />
for making clear no magic is used in what follows, with the price that  
<br />
its overall implementation is very unrealist, given that the neurons  
<br />
are the chinese willingly playing that role.
<br />
<br />So, now, we put Alice's brain, which has become a two dimensional  
<br />
optical boolean graph, in between two planes of transparent solid  
<br />
material, glass, and we add a sort of &quot;clever&quot; fluid cristal together  
<br />
with the graph,in between the glass plates. The fluid cristal is  
<br />
supposed to have the following peculiar property (which certainly is  
<br />
hard to implement concretely but which is possible in principle). Each  
<br />
time a beam of light trigs a line between two nodes, it trigs a laser  
<br />
beam in the &quot;good&quot; direction between the two optical gates, with the  
<br />
correct frequency-color (to keep right the functioning of the NOR).
<br />
<br />This works well, and we can let that brain work  from time t1 to t2,  
<br />
where Alice dreams specifically, for fixing the matter, that she is in  
<br />
front of a mushroom, talking with a caterpillar who sits on the  
<br />
Muschroom (all right?). We have beforehand save the instantaneous  
<br />
state corresponding to the begining of that dream, so as to be able to  
<br />
repeat that precise graph activity.
<br />
<br />Each time we allow the graph doing the computation corresponding to  
<br />
the dream (which exists by MEC), the believer in MAT, who believes in  
<br />
the physical supervenience thesis, has to admit Alice is conscious, in  
<br />
the sense of having the experience of consciousness of her (non lucid)  
<br />
dream: she feels herself talking with a caterpillar for example.
<br />
<br /><br />Now we film that active graph, with a high resolution camera.
<br />
<br />As you have most probably already guess, that film constitutes our  
<br />
home made &quot;lucky cosmic explosion&quot; generator, corresponding to Alice's  
<br />
dream experience.
<br />
<br />So let us suppose that poor Alice got, again, a not very good optical  
<br />
plane graph, so that some (1 to many to all, again) NOR gates break  
<br />
down, in that precise computation corresponding to her dream  
<br />
experience. And let us project, in real time, with the correct  
<br />
scaling, the movie we have made, on the graph, playing its role of a  
<br />
repeatable lucky rays generator.
<br />
<br />If Alice remains conscious in MGA 1, through MEC and MAT, Alice  
<br />
remains conscious in this setting too, all right?
<br />
<br />In the ALL gates broken case, we have really, *only a movie* of  
<br />
Alice's brain activity. Does consciousness arise from the projection  
<br />
of that movie?
<br />
<br />Should a believer in MEC+MAT believes that?
<br />
<br /><br />Bruno
