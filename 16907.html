Hi Marty,

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Just tell me if you agree.     I agree and can't understand how I  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could have been so careless.
</em><br />
<br />So you have to introspect a little bit.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Do you remember the empty set? Can you compute:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; {1, 2} UNION { } = ?  1,2
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK, but don't forget the accolades.    Are accolades brackets?
</em><br />
<br />Due to Dirac, in Quantum Mechanics, I tend to believe that brackets  
<br />
are &quot;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&quot;. parentheses are &quot;(&quot; and &quot;)&quot;. I call &quot;{&quot; and &quot;}&quot;  
<br />
accolades, but perhaps they are called bracket. The terms are not  
<br />
important as far as we understand each other. How would you call &quot;[&quot;  
<br />
and &quot;]&quot; ?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You are too quick here, you forget to type the 1.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; {1} UNION { } =  {1 }             Yes, I mistook the {1} for the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; number of the question...not part of the equation. I tend to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; overlook the fine points.
</em><br />
<br />It is good that you are aware of that facts. It is what matter. It is  
<br />
what will make it possible to develop the familiarity with the  
<br />
important fine points which can arise from time to time.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Now, an important distinction which will follow us through ...  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; forever.  I suggest you read attentively the next two paragraphs  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; two times before breakfast, every day for one week. :), Really take  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; all your time. It concerns the notion of operation, and relation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; INTERSECTION and UNION, are operations on sets, like addition (+,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; or PLUS) and multiplication (*, or TIMES) are operation on numbers.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; This means, typically, that, if x and y denote numbers, then x + y,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and x * y, will denote, or are equal to, numbers. For example 3 + 04  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is equal to 7.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Similarly, if x and y denotes, or are equal, to sets, then x  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; INTERSECTION y denotes, or is equal to, some set. For example {1,2}  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; INTERSECTION {2, 7} is equal to some set, actually the set {2}.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; OK?......No!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Why 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  not the sets {1,2,7} if INTERSECTION means BOTH?
</em><br />
<br />Ah, but the word &quot;both&quot; alone is ambiguous. You could say that the  
<br />
UNION of two sets is the merging of BOTH set, and the intersection is  
<br />
the given of the elements which are in both set. So the union of {1,  
<br />
2} and {2, 7} is {1, 2, 7}, which indeed merges BOTH sets. But for  
<br />
computing the intersection, you must ask yourself, does this *element*  
<br />
belongs to BOTH set? So, for the intersection of {1, 2} and {2, 7},  
<br />
you have to ask yourself the following question: does 01 belong to both  
<br />
set? well, the answer is NO. the 1 belongs to the first set but not to  
<br />
the second, and so 1 does not belong to the intersection. Does 02  
<br />
belongs to both sets? The answer is yes. 2 belongs to {1, 2} and 2  
<br />
belongs to {2, 7}. Does 07 belongs to both sets, the answer is no, 7  
<br />
belongs to the second set, but does not belong  to the first set, so 7  
<br />
is not in the intersection.
<br />
Tell me if you are OK with this.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm back!  I give you two last exercises to ponder about, just  in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; case of insomnia. Again, take your time. I hope Kim follows, and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does not look at the solution !
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1°) In the two relational formula below, one is true, the other is  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; false. Which one are what?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a)    { } INCLUDED-IN { }True
</em><br />
<br /><br />Very good. All elements of { } are among the elements of { }. This is  
<br />
sometimes said to be &quot;trivially&quot; true, because { } has no elements at  
<br />
all.
<br />
This is an example of an important &quot;fine point&quot;.  Examples:
<br />
<br />To verify if the set {1, 2, 3} is included in {34, 56, 7, 2, 100, 1,  
<br />
45, 3, 4}, you have to check THREE things: does 1 belongs to the  
<br />
second set, does 2 belongs to the second set, does 3 belongs to the  
<br />
second set.
<br />
<br />To verify if the set {1, 2} is included in {34, 56, 7, 2, 100, 1, 45,  
<br />
3, 4}, you have to check TWO things: does 1 belongs to the second set,  
<br />
does 2 belongs to the second set.
<br />
<br />To verify if {1} is included in {34, 56, 7, 2, 100, 1, 45, 3, 4}, you  
<br />
have to check ONE things: does 1 belongs to the second set.
<br />
<br />To verify if { } is included in {34, 56, 7, 2, 100, 1, 45, 3, 4}, you  
<br />
have to verify ZERO thing! So it is automatically true. That is why  
<br />
logicians say it is trivially true.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;From this you should understand that the empty set, { }, is included  
<br />
to any set.
<br />
<br />So { } is included in all the sets:  { }, {1}, {1, 2}, ... {0, 1,  
<br />
2, ...}, ....
<br />
<br />In particular, as you said correctly, { } is included in { }. Put in  
<br />
another way, ({ } INCLUDED-IN { }) = true.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; b)    { } BELONGS-TO { } True
</em><br />
<br />NOT correct. Remember that the empty set is empty, so nothing belongs  
<br />
to it. All formula like (x belongs to { }) will be false. You can  
<br />
conceive a set as an empty box { }, in which you can fill elements. So  
<br />
the set {a, b} is the empty set in which you put the elements a, and  
<br />
then, the element b. The accolades &quot;{&quot; and &quot;}&quot; represents the box  
<br />
itself, and what is in between the accolades represents the elements  
<br />
of the set. You could have guessed the solution because I was helping  
<br />
you when saying that one of the proposition is true and the other is  
<br />
false, and this means that, like many beginners, you read the  
<br />
enunciation of the problem too much quickly. That is why I suggest you  
<br />
take your time, and read often, at different time, the enunciation of  
<br />
the problems, and actually all explanations as well.
<br />
<br />The moral is:
<br />
<br />&quot;x belongs to { }&quot;     is never true, or is always false, whatever x  
<br />
represents.
<br />
&quot;{ } included in x&quot;    is always true, or never false, whatever x  
<br />
represents.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2°) And I give you a slightly longer exercise. Can you give me all  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the subsets of the set {1, 2} ?. That is, can you give me all the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sets which are included in the set {1, 2} ? In case of doubt, reread  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the definitions, reread the examples, and never panic! I give you a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hint: the set {1, 2} has four subsets. Can you find them?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;                                                                          {1 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; } {2} {1,2} {2,1}     why not {3} ?
</em><br />
<br />Not too bad. 3/4 correct:
<br />
<br />{1} is included in {1, 2}.  Indeed.
<br />
{2} is included in {1, 2}. Indeed.
<br />
{1, 2} is included in {1, 2}. Indeed.
<br />
<br />{2, 1} is included in {1, 2}. Indeed, that is true, but you have to  
<br />
remember what you have already agree on: the set {1, 2} is equal to  
<br />
the set {2, 1}, so this is not a new solution. It is the preceding one  
<br />
in disguised!
<br />
<br />Why not {3}? {3} is not included in {1, 2} just because 3 does not  
<br />
belong to {1, 2}. Reread the definition of inclusion. A is included in  
<br />
B if all the elements of A belongs to B. OK?
<br />
<br />So you have found three subsets, among the four. Reading today's  
<br />
explanations I think you could find the missing subset. I let you  
<br />
search a little bit.
<br />
<br />So just one exercise: what is the missing subset?
<br />
<br />I apologize if all of this is a bit boring, but soon enough it will be  
<br />
highly rewarding. You will see.
<br />
<br />Bruno
