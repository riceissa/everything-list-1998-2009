hal.domain.name.hidden asks:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Would you say, then, that it is *impossible* to *falsely* attribute
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness to an entity?  That the question of whether something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is conscious, being purely subjective, is not something that you can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be mistaken about?
</em><br />
<br />I'd take a utilitarian stance. Yes, myriad interpretations of
<br />
consciousness always exist, in a mathematical sense, but why bother to
<br />
try to see them unless they confer some advantage? (Also, most require
<br />
more transformational mapping than our puny brains can muster.)
<br />
<br />Interpretations of consciousness do confer advantage when dealing with
<br />
Turing test passers (lookup tables included) because the psychological
<br />
interpretation carries predictive power (playing chess, the Table
<br />
will probably choose to take my queen if I expose her, because it
<br />
wants to win the game).  There's no advantage to not seeing the table
<br />
as conscious and volitional.
<br />
<br />But with Putnam's rock, why bother?  (Well, maybe if you're
<br />
long-stranded on a deserted island, and need someone to talk to?)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; We sometimes find ourselves tempted to treat seemingly mindless and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even inanimate objects as conscious.  Some people talk to their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; plants and feel that the plants respond.  Others persuade their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; vehicles to cooperate by offering encouraging words.  Primitive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; societies believed that nature in its various manifestations was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious, and would talk to the crops and clouds, entreating them
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to grow, often with success.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In your view, would you say that these attitudes are equally as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; valid as treating other human beings as conscious?  If it is all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subjective, how can we draw a line between conscious and unconscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entities?  It seems important to do so, otherwise there a danger
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that we might say there is no moral difference between kicking a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rock and kicking a puppy.
</em><br />
<br />Utilitarianism: the effect on the rest of my life.  The puppy will
<br />
probably be warped by the experience and may grow up crippled,
<br />
neurotic or vicious.  I'd rather have happy dogs around.  The rock
<br />
won't be much changed, from my point of view, so it doesn't much
<br />
matter.
<br />
<br />The most effective interpretation I have of human behavior (and of
<br />
humanlike lookup tables) is the psychological one.  Evolving in social
<br />
groups perfected that interpretation, and I'm usually best off using
<br />
it.  That interpretation may also be effective in dealing with nature:
<br />
be nice (if cautious) to plants and animals and they will more likely
<br />
to cooperate, just like people.
<br />
<br />But, to the consternation of some, science increasingly offers a
<br />
sometimes more effective mechanical interpretation of nature,
<br />
including humans.  (To the extent that the mechanistic view leads to
<br />
social problems, it is still less effective. But maybe social science
<br />
will someday achieve the performance in Asimov's &quot;Foundation&quot;.)
<br />
<br /><br />We'll probably change our mode of existence before too long: in Robot
<br />
I suggest we may recode ourselves into more and more subtle physical
<br />
implementations to squeeze more and more mind power into given amounts
<br />
of matter.  Gradually, to outside observers like our present selves,
<br />
we fade away into uninterpretable thermal noise.  Maybe we can exist
<br />
as thermal vibrations in a rock. I'm pretty sure we could deal with a
<br />
kick easily.
