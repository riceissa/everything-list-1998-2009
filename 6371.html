This is a wonderfully clear explanation of Bruno's UDA. Perhaps Bruno could 
<br />
confirm that it is what he intended.
<br />
<br />As for the observer - or more fundamentally, the observer-moment - I think 
<br />
you can get away without explicitly defining it. All you need is two 
<br />
assumptions:
<br />
<br />Firstly, you have to assume that observer-moments exist. I think it is 
<br />
pretty clear that this is the case; you know it and I know it. You may not 
<br />
know how to explain it, define it, or even describe it, but you definitely 
<br />
know that observer-moments exist if you are a conscious being.
<br />
<br />Secondly, you have to assume that this mysterious consciousness thing is 
<br />
&quot;Turing emulable&quot;. It is not nearly as obvious that this second assumption 
<br />
is true, and biological chauvinists may continue to deny it no matter what 
<br />
progress AI research may make. At some point, as Bruno says, you may have to 
<br />
take &quot;comp&quot; on faith; for example, say &quot;yes doctor&quot; to the offer of a 
<br />
durable new electronic brain when yours is starting to break down.
<br />
<br />It should now be clear that if both of the above assumptions are true, then 
<br />
the UD should generate all the observer-moments as per Bruno and Brian. The 
<br />
&quot;observer&quot; is then a derivative entity, made up of certain subsets of 
<br />
observer-moments. You know what an observer-moment is through direct 
<br />
experience, but you have nowhere been forced to explicitly define it. If you 
<br />
want to say that consciousness is something utterly mysterious forever, you 
<br />
can say this, and the UDA still holds.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In reply to Lee Corbin on the Fabric of Reality List
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;----------------------------------------------------
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Lee,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;You gave us some wonderful examples of totally ridiculous Turing Machines
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that are nevertheless possible (I would at this point ask somebody to take
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;away Charles' keyboard). You have noted that these TMs are improbable; we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would not expect them to be instantiated in any great measure throughout 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;multiverse. They are similar to Harry Potter universes in this respect.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Surely, though, the fact that they are improbable is not a blow against
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Bruno! His argument is concerned with measure and you are playing right 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that. Let me try to explain...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;To make this easier, let's forget about physical reality for a while. Let's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consider the Universal Dovetailer (UD). For those not in the know, the UD 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a TM that systematically lists and executes all possible TMs. Because there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are an infinite number of TMs, the UD cannot wait until all the TMs are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;listed before it executes them. It also cannot allow any one TM to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;monopolise the runtime, lest that TM never halts. So it must execute a step
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of one TM, then a step of another TM and so on, and it must do this while
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;continuing to list the TMs. The first TMs off the list will be the simple
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ones - those with the shortest bitstrings and these are the first to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;kicked off. Complex TMs with very long specifications will not be kicked 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;off
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;until much later. At any point in time in which they are still running,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;these complex TMs will have received less runtime than any simpler TM that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is still running. This is important, as we shall see.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;As we have discussed, some (an infinite subset) of the TMs will support
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observers when they are executed. The observers and their worlds unroll as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computational histories.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;What does an observer observe?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It is important to see that the computational histories of different TMs 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be identical up to a point and then diverge. So different TMs can produce
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the same observer history up to a point. The observer moment, then, is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;simultaneously&quot; generated by many different TMs. You can't pluck one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;history and say you are in that history. You are part of many identical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;histories that are about to diverge. And you can't pluck one TM and say 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that is the TM that is instantiating you. Your history is generated by many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;different TMs. These are very important points. And, I think, the source of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;much confusion over Bruno's work.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;What an observer observes depends on all the computational histories their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;current moment is in and how the histories branch. The question also 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;depends
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;on what we mean by observer, but let's put that aside for now because I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;don't yet understand this part. Note that observer time has no relation to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;dovetailer time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Obviously, the computational history of a TM that consistently supports an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observer can't be random. It must perform the computations necessary for an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observer. Now the history might become random after the n-th step, at which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;point the observer no longer exists. Or the observer might morph into a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;completely different observer that has no memory of its former existence (I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would argue that the observer is now a new observer). Or fluffy white bunny
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;rabbits might appear. The TM's executing these histories first run an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observer and then do something strange. Presumably this makes the TM more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;complex because the strangeness requires extra bits to specify. These TMs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;therefore get less runtime than the &quot;unmodified&quot; TM.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;OK, suppose you're in a set of identical computational histories that are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;unfolding on many different TMs. Some of those histories are about to go
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;strange. For your existence as an observer to continue, they must go 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;strange
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in such a way that they still support you as an observer. Given what I have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;said, do you think you are likely to branch into a strange world or to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;continue on in your normal world, whatever that may be? The measure of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computational history of the world where you continue on as normal is much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;larger than the measure of the computational history of the strange branch
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;because the strange TMs receive less runtime (remember, many different TMs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;instantiate you).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So, if you were an observer on the dovetailer, your computational history
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;branches in such a way that some branches are much more probable than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;others. The world the observer observes will likely not be totally stupid.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This is how you play into Bruno's hands!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Writing the above has made me realize that I may have not been accurate in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;some of my earlier statements about Bruno's work. Apologies to Bruno. All I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;need now is to be convinced that we can give a satisfactory definition of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observer. Oh, and that we are most likely to observe QM.
