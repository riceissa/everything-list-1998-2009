<br />Here is a similar situation.
<br />
<br />I had a medical procedure performed using something called &quot;conscious 
<br />
sedation.&quot;  In this technique, a drug was administered (Versed in my 
<br />
case) which allowed me to retain consciousness and even engage my doctor 
<br />
in conversation.  Yet no long term memories were &quot;laid down.&quot;
<br />
<br />This temporary anterograde amnesia is the same experience as above, 
<br />
except I wasn't paralyzed and was free to report any experienced pain to 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;my doctor.
<br />
<br />In my case, this was a (supposedly) mildly painful procedure, yet I in 
<br />
fact have a puzzling gap in my continuity of memory and have no 
<br />
recollection of any pain (or of anything else) during that time period. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;For all I know, I was in agony and had to be in full restraints to 
<br />
allow things to proceed--without anyone telling me what happened, I have 
<br />
no way to know.
<br />
<br />Today I'd do this again without hesitation.  I wish my dentist were 
<br />
licensed to do this so the next time I have to have a root canal I can 
<br />
have no memory of it afterwards.
<br />
<br />(As an aside, Versed is quick to act but slow to recover.  It's very 
<br />
difficult to describe the 1st person experience here but I have memories 
<br />
of something I can only call &quot;gradual awareness&quot; that got better over a 
<br />
period of a couple hours, yet the nursing staff said I was talking to 
<br />
them on and off during this whole period.  Weird.)
<br />
