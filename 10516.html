</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thanks for taking the trouble to express your thoughts at such length.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I won't say too much now, as I have to leave shortly to meet a long
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lost relative - from Hungary! However, I just want to make sure it's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; clear, both for you and the list, that:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Comp is false&quot;. Let's see where *that* leads.....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; isn't intended as a definitive claim that comp *is* false.
</em><br />
<br />To be honest I have not yet seen where you postulates comp wrong in 
<br />
your long anti-roadmap post.
<br />
Recall that I take comp as YD + CT + AR (Yes Doctor + Church Thesis + 
<br />
Arithmetical Realism).
<br />
So, strictly speaking comp can be false in seven ways:
<br />
<br />YD CT AR
<br />
1     1     1    comp is true
<br />
1     1     0    comp is false 1
<br />
1     0     1             &quot; &quot;            2
<br />
1     0     0             &quot; &quot;            3
<br />
0     1     1             &quot; &quot;            4
<br />
0     1     0             &quot; &quot;            5
<br />
0     0     1             &quot; &quot;            6
<br />
0     0     0             &quot; &quot;            7
<br />
<br />1. AR is false, but CT is true, and YD is true. This would mean there 
<br />
is a program which stops or does not stop according to my knowledge of 
<br />
it. It is beyond my imagination, even if, as a logician I know that I 
<br />
have to postulate AR. Of course the UD would loose all its purpose.
<br />
2. CT is false. This would mean there exist a way to explain in a 
<br />
finite time how to compute a function from N to N, such that no 
<br />
computer can be programmed to compute it. Possible but unlikely.
<br />
3) YD is true, but CT is false and AR is false. This means the doctor 
<br />
is helped by Gods or Goddesses.
<br />
4) YD is false (and CT and AR are true). This means I am an actual 
<br />
infinite object.
<br />
5) 6) 7): combination of above.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Rather, *if*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it is false, in what ways specifically, and what are the alternatives?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Can they be stated as clearly and explicitly as Bruno is trying to do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for his approach ('to see where it leads')? Hence the 'anti-roadmap',
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or perhaps better - 'another roadmap', or some ideas for one.
</em><br />
<br />It is certainly interesting. But comp is a very weak statement, so 
<br />
non-comp is very strong. It needs some actual infinite to be 
<br />
&quot;implemented&quot;. Judson Webb range &quot;comp&quot; in the &quot;finitist doctrines&quot; 
<br />
(but not in the ultra-finitist doctrine).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Most of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the thoughts in it were originally expressed in some earlier postings
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on 'The Fabric of Reality' list, which Bruno was kind enough to copy to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this list.  Anyway, it's intended as a point of departure (for me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certainly) and I look forward to some strenuous critiques.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One misgiving I have, now that I've finally grasped (I think) that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comp 'theology' entails 'faith' in the number realm, ...
</em><br />
<br /><br />I prefer to reserve &quot;faith&quot; for the resurection &quot;promised but not 
<br />
guarantied&quot; by the (honest) doctor.
<br />
I need infinitely less faith to believe that each number has a 
<br />
successor than to believe the sun will rise tomorrow. AR is very weak. 
<br />
Sometimes I regret to have been explicit on AR, because it looks like 
<br />
everyone believe in it, except when we write it explicitly. People put 
<br />
many things in it, which are not there. Not believing in AR also 
<br />
entails that there is a finite polynomial (on the integers) such that 
<br />
two different people can find different integer values when applying 
<br />
the polynomial on the same number, and despite those people agree on 
<br />
the meaning of + and * and zero and &quot;+1&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; ... is that by this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; token it seeks to provide a TOE (Bruno, am I wrong about this?)
</em><br />
<br />You are right. By the UDA it is not a matter of choice.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; That
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is, beginning with an assertion of 'faith' in UDA + the number realm,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we seek to axiomatise and 'prove' a complete theory of our origins.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno is a very modest person, but I worry about the 'modesty' of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; goal.
</em><br />
<br />Modesty is not incompatible with ambitious goal. You can decide to 
<br />
climb the everest Mountain, and recognize you have climb only two 
<br />
meters high :)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course, it's highly probable that I just misunderstand this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point. However, I'm having trouble with my faith in numbers,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; monseigneur.
</em><br />
<br />We cannot build a theory without accepting some intuitive truth, and 
<br />
some third person presentation of those truth. AR false means that the 
<br />
simple y = sin(x) real function could intersect the real axes on some 
<br />
non integer abscisse. Do you really believe that? Quantum mechanics 
<br />
relies completely on AR. If AR is false, QM is inconsistent (and almost 
<br />
all math).
<br />
So, either you put in AR something which is not there (like peter D 
<br />
Jones who want me doing &quot;Aristotle error&quot; on the numbers (like if I was 
<br />
reifying some concreteness about them), or you should have a powerful 
<br />
argument against AR, but then you should elaborate.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; My own intuition begins from my own indexical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-assertion, my necessity, generalised to an inclusive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-asserting necessity extending outwards indefinitely.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Here I have a pedagogical, if not diplomatical, problem. What you say 
<br />
is exactly what the lobian *first person* will feel.  I hope you will 
<br />
see this eventually.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't look
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for a way to 'get behind' this, and to this extent I don't seek a TOE,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because I can't believe that 'everything' (despite the name of this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; list) is theoretically assimilable.
</em><br />
<br /><br />It is not. Here is the funny thing: the third person &quot;ultimate reality&quot; 
<br />
with comp seems to be not so great: it is just the natural numbers, 
<br />
including their relations in term of addition and multiplication.
<br />
This is enough to give rise to first person plenitude(s) which are way 
<br />
bigger than &quot;just the numbers&quot;. Indeed the first person plenitude 
<br />
escapes *all* theories. (Even provably so, and that is why comp gives a 
<br />
sort of vaccine against almost all &quot;normative&quot; psychology or theology. 
<br />
Accepting comp is like accepting we cannot control everything. Comp, 
<br />
well understanded, should be appreciate by those who likes freedom, and 
<br />
be feared by those willing to control too much.
<br />
It looks paradoxical, but it is only &quot;counter-intuitive. It is akin to 
<br />
&quot;Skolem paradox&quot; in &quot;model theory&quot;. Some little structure can have 
<br />
giant substructures.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This may well be blindness more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than modesty, however.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Having said this, of course in a spirit of learning I'm trying to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand and adopt *as if* true the comp assumptions, and continue to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; put my best efforts into getting my head around Bruno's roadmap as it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emerges. I have a lot of experience of changing my mind (and maybe I'll
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; get a better one!)
</em><br />
<br /><br />I certainly appreciate your good will,
<br />
<br />Bruno
