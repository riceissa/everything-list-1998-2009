Subject: Re: Thanks for the papers etc.

<br />
<br />Thanks, James Higgo, for the message below. Things do get complicated when
<br />
you try to take account of peculiar worlds which continue onwards. I'd
<br />
have thought, however, that the same argument could be run with respect to
<br />
each of those worlds:  any observers in them would be very likely to be
<br />
near annihilation, for the reasons I gave (exponential explosion until
<br />
annihilation in any branch): the fact that you don't experience the very
<br />
last moment of your lifetime is irrelevant, since it can still be the case
<br />
that you should expect that most of the branches leading forward from you
<br />
at the present moment will end in annihilation soon, and that should
<br />
influence your expectation-of-continued-life; any fact that there will be
<br />
peculiar branches which don't, and which then themselves explode
<br />
exponentially, should not lead you to expect to see a branch which does
<br />
not end soon. The point centers on what is meant by &quot;expecting&quot; this or
<br />
that. Take the simpler case of throwing two dice and &quot;expecting&quot; not to
<br />
see double-six. Against the background of Everettism, what this means is
<br />
that the range of the future branches which include double-six is only one
<br />
thirty-sixth of the total. Well, suppose you are assured that those
<br />
person-versions who throw anything other than double-six will be shot
<br />
immediately they have seen double-six landing on the table, whereas all
<br />
those who do throw double-six will continue onwards, and that while they
<br />
continue onwards they will divide up into more and more person-versions,
<br />
exponentially. It can follow from this that most of (or the greatest
<br />
range of, if we are dealing with infinite numbers) the person-versions
<br />
who will ever have had histories running through the moment of the tossing
<br />
of the dice will be person-versions in whose histories double-six appears.
<br />
None the less, the fact is that one is trying to estimate &quot;the probability
<br />
OF SEEING double-six&quot;, i.e. the range of the double-six branches in the
<br />
branches IMMEDIATELY AHEAD of one's present moment, and not the
<br />
probability of HAVING SEEN having seen double-six in the cases of branches
<br />
existing, say, ten hours in the future. So one ought to expect not to see
<br />
double-six (whereas your argument suggests the opposite conclusion).
<br />
Note, however, that (as I think I said in my original email to you and
<br />
others) I regret not having used the simpler argument that a believer in
<br />
Everettism-with-continued-exponential-increase-in-number-of-branches
<br />
(which is, N.B., NOT Deutsch's version of Everettism, which is immune to
<br />
my argument as it has differentiations rather than increases in total
<br />
numbers) ought to believe that, e.g., it is really June 5 1999, instead of
<br />
being June 4 as his watch or the newspaper which he thought came this
<br />
morning tells him, so long as there is the slightest chance that the watch
<br />
is wrongly set or the newspaper in fact the one delivered yesterday, the
<br />
reason for this being that on June 5 there would be vastly more versions
<br />
of himself doing the observing/ wondering what day it was.   ...Will now
<br />
sign off without trying to clean up the arguments above, since (as I've
<br />
stressed to Nick Bostrom) I'm trying to get back into philosophy of
<br />
religion instead of spending the remainder of my life thinking about this
<br />
rich and complex subject. I'm pleased, though, that it has captured the
<br />
interest of you and of so many others.  All the best:  John Leslie

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Many thanks for sending me your papers. I read 'a difficulty'..
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; for MWI with interest. The doomsday argument has been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; much discussed on the everything-list discussion group
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; largely due to the influence of Nick Bostrom, who runs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; anthropic-Principle.com.  It's an intriguing idea but Standard
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Life are still willing to bet ?1 million to ?1 that it is flawed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But let's say that the overwhelming likelihood is that we are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; milliseconds from annihilation. Like the vacuum collapse, this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; only adds strength to Deutsch-style-MWI-plus-assumption-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that-we-only-experience-universes-in-which-we-exist (or QTI
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; for short). See <a href="http://www.higgo.com/qti">http://www.higgo.com/qti</a>.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; From this moment on, 99.99...% of subsequent branches are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; dead ends, due to a vacuum collapse, or perhaps simply
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; because there are no causal relationships: the branch will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; lead to a world of random disorder. But we don't experience
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the worlds we don't exist in, and we are still left with an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; infinite number of worlds ahead of us. This process continues
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ad infinitum.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The contributor base of the everything-list  is currently in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; thrall of these ideas despite Jacques Mallah's valient lone
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; efforts to dissuade us. Any fresh ideas would be very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; welcome.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
