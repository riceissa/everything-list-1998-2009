<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I am not sure that numbers are real in the sense that &quot;I am real&quot;,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; unless you are talking of the third person &quot;I&quot;. Then &quot;you&quot; are as real
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; as your (unknown) Godel-number.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; In general, when people use the word &quot;I&quot; they refer to their first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; person, or to first person plural feature of their &quot;physical&quot; body. It
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is a unexpected (by me) discovery that quanta belongs to that sharable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; first person view (making the comp-QM a bit more psychological than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; some Many-Worlder would perhaps appreciate. So that Fuch-Pauli could 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; right ... (if you know the work of Fuchs).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What I meant was something looser, a tautology perhaps.  That is,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whatever we postulate as giving rise to our personal 'reality' must
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thereby be 'real' in just this sense: it 'underpins' that reality.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I don't understand how you could go automatically from a postulate to 
<br />
something real. That can happens, but here the comp hyp puts non 
<br />
trivial restrictions: when that happens, we cannot be sure it happens.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recall your various debates with Peter on this issue, and whatever
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; else was at issue, I just felt that at least implicitly this must be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entailed by the 'realism' part of AR.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />AR is just the common idea that the elementary arithmetic taught in 
<br />
high school is not crackpot.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; OK, but not only (there are also the relations between numbers, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; relation between the relations between the numbers, etc.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You are more precise (and correct!)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; OK. (Technically it is not obvious how to define in arithmetic such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; self-relation: the basic tool is given by the recursion or fixed point
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; theorems).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My basic notion of self-relative existence equates I think to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Plotinus' One as you describe it in the Sienna paper.  I postulate it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to stand for 'existence' independent of other causality.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />Note that (with comp) there is no need to postulate any form of 
<br />
primitive causality (beyond the material implication and the modus 
<br />
ponens deduction rule). All notion of causality, from the physical laws 
<br />
to the human responsibility, are captured by higher order logical 
<br />
modalities.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I see the big
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One as 'self-differentiating' through spontaneous symmetry breaking,
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Again I think you have a right intuition, although that &quot;symmetry 
<br />
breaking&quot; is or should be a fourth hypostase phenomenon (not a 
<br />
zeroth-one).
<br />
The One differentiates ? I can be ok with the image or analogy, but 
<br />
strictly speaking the One is static, even more static, in some sense, 
<br />
than the Second (the &quot;Divine Intellect&quot; (G*). The One is just above or 
<br />
beside time or space categories.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; as the basis for all subsequent categorisation whatsoever, except the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; original - and unique - ontic category of self-relative existence.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I hope you make yourself precise enough because you enjoy to be made 
<br />
even more precise! There is no notion of self at the zero person point 
<br />
of view. Self appears with self-referential machines. Those belongs to 
<br />
the &quot;Nous&quot;, the Intellect, the second hypostase.
<br />
(This could be seen as a detail ...)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This entails that all such subsequent categorisation is in some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fundamental sense epistemic: i.e. how the One 'gets to know' itself.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Exact (assuming comp, etc.)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So I agree with Plotinus that the One can't be said to 'know' anything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; without such differentiation.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />All right. But I would say that the differentiated One is already the 
<br />
Intellect. I can keep your nomenclature for a while.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I am not sure how could grandma have a feeling about that, except if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; grandma get Church Thesis and the UDA.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, I'm working on the technicalities.  But the 'feeling' comes from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what I've said above.  If all categories of 'process' or 'structure'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are epistemic - i.e. forms of self-relative 'coming to know' -
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Well the passage from a &quot;intellect self&quot; to a knower is the (subtle) 
<br />
passage from the intellect to the soul (from the second hypostase (or 
<br />
third person!) to the third hypostase (the unameable first person, the 
<br />
Brouwer-Post-Bergsonian &quot;builder&quot; of time).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entails that everything arises as an interpretation from a 'point of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; view'.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />You are quick but OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So what is revealed in any given context and - at least as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; importantly - what is obscured, must then be characteristic of that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; specific point of view, in no sense 'absolute reality' (whatever that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could mean).
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />There is an absolute common part, even if they are appreciated 
<br />
differently according to the hypostasis/point-of-view. I would say.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The point is just that physics appears as a sort of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; sum on your lobian ignorance.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think this is what I mean by 'obscured'.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Hmmm.... The fact is that any sound universal machine which introspects 
<br />
itself/herself(?) enough will discover eventually that this 
<br />
self-ignorance is productive, creative in some sense. It can be 
<br />
considered as bright, white, flashing. It is big, and looking twice it 
<br />
is soon even much bigger ... and structured ...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; As I said this is a point where I would like to disagree with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; lobian machine. The fact is that even the lobian machine warns us on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the possibility of zombie. Certainly the current artificial cops on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; road are zombie. Tomorrow we will be able to build artificial skin for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; androids capable of making us believe they are normal humans citizens,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ... We should distinguish &quot;local zombie&quot; which are capable to fail you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; during some finite time, and &quot;theoretical global zombie&quot; which are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; capable to fail you, in principle, for ever (like Torgny try to make 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; us
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; believe he belongs too: nobody can prove him wrong).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You're right, we must distinguish zombies.  The kind I have in mind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are the kind that Torgny proposes, where 'everything is the same' as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for a human, except that 'there's nothing it is like' to be such a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person.  My key point is that this must become incoherent in the face
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of self-relativity.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I am afraid that IF you were right here, this would mean that you are 
<br />
either an unsound machine, or that you are not a machine at all.
<br />
The assertion of inexistence of absolute zombie à-la Torgny belongs 
<br />
(most probably) to G* minus G, I mean to the true but unprovable 
<br />
sentences of the machine. I don't see how we could contradict 
<br />
effectively Torgny's self-zombie proposition. It does not mean that it 
<br />
is not interesting to try or search for consequence of such 
<br />
propositions, and Torgny's game(?) is fun (in our context).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; My reasoning is that a claim for the 'existence'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of something like Torgny's B-Universe is implicitly a claim for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-relative existence: i.e. independent of other causality, like the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One.  When Torgny proposed the Game of Life as an example of 'another
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe', I pointed out that GoL clearly doesn't possess independent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence: it's just a part of the A-Universe.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />If you accept, with Torgny, the idea that the &quot;1+1=2&quot; statement (and 
<br />
all consequence of Robinson arithmetic ,sorry John Mikes!) has a truth 
<br />
value not depending on you, then the many Gols follows at once.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  If one is to postulate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a universe suitable for the thought experiment, one must in effect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; propose 'another One' - i.e. an independently self-relative
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'B-Universe'.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Of course, &quot;another One&quot; is by itself contradictory, for a machine. In 
<br />
a sense, there are as many Ones than there is machine, but they share 
<br />
almost all relevant structure, once the machine is &quot;rich enough&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It follows that, given the other assumptions of 'sameness',
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conversations with machines in such a B-Universe must then proceed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exactly as they do in the A-Universe, because they depend on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-relation in the same ways.  Now, it may seem that - beyond all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relativity - the question still remains of the 'absolute' quality of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'what it's like' to be 'One' in the context of such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-individuation.  I leave it for you to judge whether - if a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine can report just as we do on what it's like to be itself, with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exactly the same self-relative justification - it can then remain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; coherent to claim that 'it's not like anything' to be that machine.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I miss the line (sorry).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Before a long time (despite Kurzweyl) we just can do it, even at a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; high
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; level. A brain is *very* complex, for any theory. In the future people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; will just bet on the available theory through some Pascal wag.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It is possible that there is some &quot;zombie&quot; gap, and that the first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; person having an artificial brain will not be conscious ... (I doubt
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; this, but apparently the lobian machine say so .... according to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; definition I gave).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, I agree.  And if the machine can justifiably and honestly pass
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all examinations of 'what it's like' to be itself, I would be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reluctant to accuse it of zombiehood, based on my own criteria above.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; How we would judge its 'justification' and 'honesty' is an interesting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; question.  For example, if a machine was a Huge Lookup Table, it might
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be able to pass the test, but neither honestly nor justifiably, in my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; terms.
</em><br />
<br /><br />This is unfortunately a difficult point. Except for &quot;relative 
<br />
probabilistic matter&quot; it does not really matter which algorithm is 
<br />
used, or even if an algorithm is used. What matter, in UD* for example, 
<br />
is the set of possible execution of possible algorithms.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Are you considering neural processing as a behavior?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Are you considering that some platonic and static relations between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; numbers can be seen as behavior?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm saying essentially that 1-personal self-relation is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'characteristically' temporal.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have no other justification than an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inability to imagine how else it could be differentiated: 'dynamic'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-relation seems to be the defining characteristic of 'qualitative'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence.  This seems to be at the heart of 'what it's like' to exist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1-personally: we 'sense' self-relation as 'action'.  So 'neural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; processing' - i.e. as an aspect of the 'physical brain' perceived
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1-personally - can be behaviour in this sense.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Hmmm.... Dangerous move. I would not say that &quot;I&quot; am acting when my 
<br />
brain operates. This could lead to 1-3 person confusion, imo.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Platonic and static
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relations between numbers are 0-personal, and - self-relative to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One - this is perhaps structural or eternal.  This is why I (and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perhaps Plotinus) don't believe that the One 'knows' anything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distinctly from the knowers and knowledge created by its own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-differentiation: there has to be emergence at the 1-personal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; level for an 'act of knowing' to unfold 'in time'.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Recall that the nameable lobian master always insist on  &quot;I will say a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; stupidity or I could say a stupidity&quot;       (is that english?)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If I meet the Buddha on the road.....

<br /><br />That's the spirit :)
