There is no possible formalisation of Arithmetical Truth.
<br />
This is a consequence of Godel's Theorem.&quot;
<br />
<br />Strong disagreement.  You should have said: Only a very tiny part of the
<br />
possible mathematical structures can be formalised or axiomatized in a
<br />
purely finitistic way.  There is no possible FINITE formalisation of
<br />
Arithmetical Truth which is both complete and consistent.  A full
<br />
formalization of number theory is denumerably transfinite.
<br />
<br />Being able to go to explicitly transfinite fomalizations and transfinite
<br />
computations should be possible...and probably much sooner than anyone
<br />
would guess.
<br />
<br />As I mentioned in a previous post, by manipulating space-time as a
<br />
&quot;building material,&quot; it may be possible in the not very far future to
<br />
create regions of Malament-Hogarth space-time that can function as
<br />
computing engines.  These would be devices with an explicitly
<br />
transfinite computing capacity, giving the results of such computation
<br />
in a finite (short) time, as explained by Earman and Norton in their
<br />
paper, `Forever Is a Day: Supertasks in Pitowsky and Malament-Hogarth
<br />
Spacetimes',
<br />
Philosophy of Science, 60, pp. 22-42, 1993.  
<br />
<br />As a trivial and totally
<br />
impractical (from a computing standpoint) illustration of a
<br />
Malament-Hogarth spacetime, consider this commentary by Jon Pérez
<br />
Laraudogoitia:
<br />
<br />&quot;An example of such a spacetime is an electrically charged black hole
<br />
(the Reissner-Nordstrom spacetime). A well known property of black holes
<br />
is that, in the view of those who remain outside, unfortunates who fall
<br />
in appear to freeze in time as they approach the event horizon of the
<br />
black hole. Indeed those who remain outside could spend an infinite
<br />
lifetime with the unfortunate who fell in frozen near the event horizon.
<br />
If we just redescribe this process from the point of view of the
<br />
observer who does fall in to the black hole, we discover that we have a
<br />
bifurcated supertask. The observer falling in perceives no slowing down
<br />
of time in his own processes. He sees himself reaching the event horizon
<br />
quite quickly. But if he looks back at those who remain behind, he sees
<br />
their processes sped up indefinitely. By the time he reaches the event
<br />
horizon, those who remain outside will have completed infinite proper
<br />
time on their world-lines.&quot;
<br />
<br />Obviously, nobody is going to go down a black hole and be torn apart by
<br />
tidal forces to do a computation, but the illustration makes the point
<br />
that such space-times, relying ONLY on classical general relativity, can
<br />
actually &quot;do' a denumerably transfinite computation in what for an
<br />
appropriately placed observer is a finite time.  I will refer to
<br />
Lucian Wischik's 1997 paper &quot;Non-finite computation in Malament-Hogarth
<br />
spacetimes,&quot; available from <a href="http://www.wischik.com/lu/researcher.html">http://www.wischik.com/lu/researcher.html</a>,
<br />
which gives more of the theory on this.
