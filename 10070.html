Le 27-juil.-06, à 03:21, David Nyman a écrit :
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Mmmmhh.... This sounds a little bit too much idealist for me. Numbers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; exist with some logic-mathematical priority, and then self-intimacy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; should emerge from many complex relations among numbers. Also, the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; universes (both with comp and/or the quantum) contains some complex
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; giant universes without any self-awareness in it (like a &quot;parallele
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; world with different constant so that the complexity of histories are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; bounded.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As is regrettably normal in this area, we are having (as you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suspected) terminological difficulties.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Thanks for you kind attempt to be clearer. I'm afraid we are not just 
<br />
having terminological difficulties, but then this what make a 
<br />
conversation or a discussion interesting. I cc it to the everything 
<br />
list because your theory is close to the one advocated sometimes by 
<br />
George Levy, who seems to like the idea that &quot;reality&quot; is ultimately 
<br />
first person, which does not really work once we assume comp.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I don't think I'm helping the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; situation by using different formulations to try to convey the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaning, since none of them are altogether satisfactory (as you will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; see from the dialogue with Peter Jones).  I think I will abandon
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'self-intimacy' in this context and substitute 'first person', with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the following restricted sense:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1. I claim, motivated by conceptual economy, that 'first person' is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the fundamental ontological situation.  That is: the context or field
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of everything that exists is inherently a first person context or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; field.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Even if that was the case, do you agree that the &quot;scientific discourse&quot; 
<br />
has to be a third person discourse?
<br />
&nbsp;From this some scientist infer that we cannot even talk on the first 
<br />
person issue in a scientific manner: they are just making a common 
<br />
category error. Nothing prevent us of choosing some definition of first 
<br />
person, and then communicating about it in a first person way.
<br />
Now, of course two scientists wanting to communicate have to agree on 
<br />
some common third person describable base.
<br />
With respect to this my &quot;axioms&quot; are
<br />
1) There exists a level of description of myself (whatever really 
<br />
describes me) such that I can survive--or &quot;experience no 
<br />
changes&quot;---when a digital functional substitution is made at that 
<br />
level. I sum up this by &quot;yes doctor&quot;. The &quot;comp practitioners&quot; says 
<br />
&quot;yes&quot; to his/her doctor when this one proposes an artificial digital 
<br />
brain/body.
<br />
2) Church thesis (all universal machine compute the same functions from 
<br />
N to N). I need it just to make the expression &quot;digital&quot; clear enough.
<br />
3) Arithmetical realism: it means that proposition like &quot;5 is divisible 
<br />
by 4&quot; is true or false independently of me. Of course 5 is a name for 
<br />
the number of vertical stroke in &quot;|||||&quot;, and 4 is a name for the 
<br />
number of stroke in &quot;||||&quot;.
<br />
<br />perhaps we will agree, because the first person (and the first person 
<br />
plural) plays a major role in the building of the physical world. But 
<br />
numbers are more fundamental. I will (try to) explain you in this post 
<br />
or in another one, how the first person (with her qualia, feeling, 
<br />
suffering, joy, and all that) emerges necessarily and unavoidably from 
<br />
number theoretical relations once we take the comp hyp sufficiently 
<br />
seriously).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2. I have referred to first person as 'a global feature of reality',
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but IMO it's not logically coherent to describe it as a 'property', as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it isn't something superadded to an already existing situation.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I totally agree. this is a key point. And this is what is cute with the 
<br />
comp hyp (and some of my results there): although I give a completely 
<br />
transparent third person definition of the notion of first person, it 
<br />
will appear that machines cannot even give a name to &quot;its&quot; first 
<br />
person. The reason is a generalization of Tarski theorem which shows 
<br />
that no correct machine can even name its own &quot;truth predicate&quot;. 
<br />
Strictly speaking &quot;truth&quot; is not even a predicate for the machine, nor 
<br />
is the &quot;first person&quot; attached to the machine nameable by the machine.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  It's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; really an equivalence to 'existence'.  That is: whatever exists, is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; already potentially 'somebody'. Reality is inherently first personal.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That's why find ourselves here (or anywhere else in MW of course).
</em><br />
<br /><br />This does not really make sense for me. Nevertheless, if you are 
<br />
patient enough to follow some reasoning I propose (see my url), it 
<br />
should even be clear why first persons can believe what you say, but 
<br />
comp makes it wrong at some level.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3. Structure arises through whatever processes within the first person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; field (this is the subject matter of QM, MW and comp, not to speak of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; chemistry, biology, psychology, sociology, etc.).  Some of this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure differentiates 'mini first persons', bounded within
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'perceiver/ perception dyads'.  This is what putatively gives rise to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'phenomenal consciousness' - structures with the 'efficacy' to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; differentiate the experiential field into a characteristicly dense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; informational coherence.  The structure within the 'perceiver'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; component of such dyadic structures is not directly perceptible to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perceiver.  What is outside this component is perceptible in terms of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a model that is energetically/ informationally connected to, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; co-varies with, 'external' structure.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree. the situation is like this. You seem to think that 
<br />
&quot;3-realities&quot; are build by first persons. I believe in the 3-reality of 
<br />
numbers, and the persons emerges from that. To sum it up a little bit 
<br />
poetically: God creates the natural numbers, and then God cannot 
<br />
prevent the dreaming of natural numbers, and realities (including 
<br />
physics as first person plural realities).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4. All such structure has 'third person' status for the perceiver
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (i.e. 'not self', though apparently paradoxically, as the perceiver's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'model of the world', it exists within his personal experiential
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; field), but this is a function of point-of-view.  You are third person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from my point-of-view, and vice versa, but such mutual relativity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; clearly shouldn't alter our fundamental first person status, or that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of everything else.  This is a bit like Kant's 'ding an sich', I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suppose.  I'm saying that the 'ding' is personal, and the 'big ding'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is differentiated into many 'mini-dings'.  'Third person' is the view
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from a 'mini ding'.  But, when contemplating the whole, there is no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; place else to stand.  The whole is wholly first personal.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Which whole? The apparently material one? Then OK. But not the deepest 
<br />
one, which is just given by arithmetic, with comp.
<br />
At first sight you could make this move: postulate that numbers 
<br />
themselves are construction of some first person. But with comp numbers 
<br />
have to be primitive if only to define the notion of (mathematical) 
<br />
machine which are needed to define the notions of person point of view.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; All right. It is a common point between Plato, Plotinus and comp: the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;ultimate reality/ONE&quot; is distinct from the realities which exist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; relatively to the observers' possible states. It exist but cannot be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; even just named or described from inside. Aristotelian are forced to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; give it a name. That is a fatal error assuming comp.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; However I consider this an egregiously
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; unecessary hypothesis that therefore must succumb to Occam.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; You will be lead to dualism, which has some trouble with Occam too. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (Or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I miss something ...)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is precisely dualism that I'm rejecting.  What I'm saying is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if we accept what is manifest - that we find ourselves here as first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; persons, 'intimate' with ourselves - the most economical hypothesis is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the context within which we arise is intrinsically personal.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Not necessarily and comp provides a counter-example. It leads (but does 
<br />
not assume) to a form of Pythagorism: all there is are numbers together 
<br />
with their additive and multiplicative structure. This is very 
<br />
economical in the sense that if you don't postulate this, it can be 
<br />
shown you cannot recover it (cf the failure of Hilbertian logicism). 
<br />
Then the many persons and their many worlds arise from those number 
<br />
theoretical relations from internal consistent views. (and this in a 
<br />
testable and partially tested way).
<br />
You see my position the comp axioms leads to a form of what 
<br />
philosophers of mind call &quot;neutral monism&quot;.
<br />
<br />&lt;snip: I largely agree modulo the proviso above&gt;
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I must make a clearer distinction between a cyborg and a zombie.  A
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; zombie, in the terms I have always understood it, is stipulated to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be an exact duplicate of a human which, notwithstanding this, is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'unconscious'.  The zombie was dreamed up to illustrate the 'problem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of other minds' or 'how do I know you are conscious?'  Chalmers uses
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; him to illustrate the 'hard problem' - because I can 'conceive' of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; zombie having the exact same physical/ mental architecture as me, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nevertheless it not being 'like anything' to be the zombie, ...
</em><br />
<br /><br />All right ...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; this ergo
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shows that consciousness is 'something extra' - a dualistic 'spirit'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; haunting the 'zombie' world.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Not necessarily. But as monist we have to justify the appearance of 
<br />
dualism.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I claim that consciousness' isn't 'something extra'.  Everything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exists within a first person context, and hence no zombie can survive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instantiation in reality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  If he has the same structure as we do, he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has the same experience.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK. (Same structure at the correct substitution level or below is 
<br />
enough with comp).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  The 'conceivability' of the zombie IMO
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arises from the all-too-easy conceptual error of forgetting that, to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'exist' a third-person description must refer to a structure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instantiated in the universal first person context - i.e. be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'grounded' in personal reality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So, hopefully, now it is clearer that the cyborg as a real 'physical'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure is as inherently first person as we are, ready and waiting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to be a 'somebody'.  But the next question is - what is the content of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; his first person field?  What I have claimed is that if his 'mind' is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a virtual computational one, executed by a syntactical process, then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the structures this gives rise to do not display the constructive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; invariances necessary for phenomenal consciousness - any more than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ours do when deeply asleep or dead.
</em><br />
<br /><br />This I don't understand. You seem again to privilege a physical level 
<br />
which makes no sense ... at this stage.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; OK   (as far as you are not taking 'comfort' as a  'truth criterium').
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As if!
</em><br />
<br /><br />Careful with wishful thinking.
<br />
