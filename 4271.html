<em class="quotelev1">&gt; years, though perhaps not 50 years.
</em><br />
<br />Well, clearly neither of us has a rigorous way of making an exact
<br />
prediction.
<br />
<br />But my main point stands regardless of whether it's 10, 50 or even 100
<br />
years.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have no idea. True, it may come up with all sorts of weird theories.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But, absent new experimental evidence, will these new theories actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tell us anything new?
</em><br />
<br />I suspect there is a lot of &quot;new evidence&quot; to be found thru reinterpretation
<br />
of the raw data observed using current experimental apparatus, including
<br />
observations not categorized as &quot;events&quot; but rather as &quot;noise.&quot;
<br />
<br />And I suspect that an AI with a different conceptual framework would be able
<br />
to milk a lot more information out of variants of the basic apparatus we use
<br />
now, without moving to thousand-mile-long accelerators.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Needless to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; say, given that today's best AI programs and computers are having a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very hard time even doing &quot;naive physics,&quot; a la ThingLab and its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; descendants, I'm not expecting progress very quickly. And ThingLab is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more than 20 years old now, so expecting massive breakthroughs in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; next 10-20 years seems overly optimistic.)
</em><br />
<br />Given the exponential rate of advance we're seeing in many kinds of
<br />
technology, there is certainly a clear potential for progress in this area
<br />
to be tremendous during the next 10-20 years.  But, of course, history shows
<br />
that there's no easy way to predict in advance which aspects of technology
<br />
are going to exponentially advance at a given time, and which will stagnate.
<br />
AI has stagnated lately whereas, e.g., computer hardware and brain scanning
<br />
have exponentially increased.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; More importantly, would an AI version of classical physics, complete
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with incomprehensible (to us) phase spaces and n-categories and so on,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; including constructs with no known analogs in our current universe of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discourse, would this version give any predictions which differ from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our own? In short, would the AI's version of physics give us any new
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics?
</em><br />
<br />Well, that depends perhaps on what you mean by &quot;new physics,&quot; I think.
<br />
<br />Right now our physics is basically stumped by  most complex systems.  We
<br />
resort to
<br />
<br />-- computer simulations
<br />
-- crude &quot;phenomenological&quot; models
<br />
<br />I suspect that an AI could come up with a real &quot;science of complex systems&quot;,
<br />
identifying &quot;probably approximately correct&quot; patterns describing the
<br />
behavior of complex systems.
<br />
<br />These complex-systems patterns would be consistent with, but qualitatively
<br />
different from, the predictions made by human physics.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Probably so. But at any given point in time the best we can do is to do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the best that we can. We of course cannot just wait for the machines...
</em><br />
<br />No, but we can try to create them -- my current endeavor ;)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Whether there &quot;are&quot; branes and strings and spins and suchlike at the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Planck scale is unknown to me, but physicists seem to be making
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; progress in acting as if such things have some meaning.
</em><br />
<br />The amount of progress being made by theories about branes and strings is
<br />
highly debatable, actually.
<br />
<br />Not all physicists consider this stuff &quot;real physics&quot;, and I feel there is
<br />
some justification to their skepticism.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;But the fact that reality is so weird is not, in my opinion,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an argument of any kind that we should not try to make some sense of it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with the best arsenal of tools and concepts we can gather.
</em><br />
<br />Certainly, I think trying to make sense of the microworld is a noble &amp;
<br />
intriguing pursuit, or else I wouldn't be on this list!!
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Will mathematics be central to this new physics?  Maybe.  But not our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; mathematics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I disagree fairly strongly on this point. I think our mathematics is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what is most lasting, albeit the mathematical ideas change names and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; new ideas become more important.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And I expect the mathematics the AIs develop, or that alien cultures
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; may already have, will look like a &quot;coordinate transformation&quot; on our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; space of mathematical basis vectors. Their categories may be slightly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different, but the underlying structure will be similar.
</em><br />
<br />I really doubt it.
<br />
<br />I spent a long time trying to make existing math concepts say something
<br />
sensible about complex systems.
<br />
<br />I failed.
<br />
<br />This is not just my personal failure either -- many other smart folks have
<br />
tried and failed as well...
<br />
<br />I think a fundamentally new mathematical direction will be needed to make a
<br />
mathematics that can truly handle complexity, in the  micro or macroworld.
<br />
<br />String theory, for instance, merely creates unmanageable complexity, it
<br />
doesn't provide a conceptual framework for dealing with it...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Anyway, this was part of why I decided to start thinking about AI
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; rather
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; than fundamental physics ;-&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; AI remains interesting, but I think new views of physics will be coming
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from AIs long after other important things come out of AI. Just my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; opinion.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (For example, some friends of mine are doing interesting work on using
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; systems of several million machine agents to data mine large amounts of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; financial data. It seems likely that this kind of work on machine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; learning, pattern extraction, support vector machines, and a plethora
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of other &quot;AI tools&quot; will have major effects on the world of economics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and forecasting. And on creating financial derivatives (synthetics)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which are alien to human thinkers/investors.)
</em><br />
<br />Yeah, financial forecasting with AI does not require Artificial General
<br />
Intelligence (AGI) in any sense, it is a classic domain-specific narrow-AI
<br />
application.
<br />
<br />Whereas, coming up with new physics will require a significant degree of
<br />
general intelligence, I believe.
<br />
<br />In this sense, physics theorizing is certainly a much harder problem than
<br />
financial prediction-- it's hard to argue with that!!
<br />
<br />I tend not to even consider that kind of narrow-AI work &quot;AI&quot; -- I just think
<br />
of it as computer science.  But I have to remind myself periodically that
<br />
the mainstream of academia does consider this AI, and considers AGI work to
<br />
be a foolish and faraway dream...
