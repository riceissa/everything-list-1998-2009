<br />
Lee,
<br />
<br />There are some things that can be known by examination of an object, and 
<br />
there are other things that can only be known by being the object. When the 
<br />
object is a human brain, this latter class of things is consciousness. (When 
<br />
the object is something else, this latter class of thing is... well, how 
<br />
would I know?) I think that the distinction between these two types of 
<br />
knowledge is surprising, and I would never have noticed it had I not been 
<br />
conscious myself. I also think that there is a sense in which this special 
<br />
first person knowledge can be called fundamental, because by definition it 
<br />
cannot be derived from any other fact about the universe.
<br />
<br />The response of those who think that consciousness is nothing special to the 
<br />
above is that it is not surprising that there is a difference between a 
<br />
description of an object and the object itself, and that what I have called 
<br />
&quot;knowledge&quot; in reference to conscious experiences is not really knowledge, 
<br />
but part of the package that comes with being a thing. I can't really argue 
<br />
against this; as I said, it is just a different way of looking at the same 
<br />
facts.
<br />
<br />Much has been written about particular formulations of the mind/body problem 
<br />
(or, if you prefer, &quot;problem&quot;). For example, Douglas Hofstadter's commentary 
<br />
on Thomas Nagel's famous essay, &quot;What Is It Like to Be a Bat?&quot; (which I 
<br />
looked up at your suggestion) makes the point that the logic of the titular 
<br />
question itself is muddled: if Nagel were a bat, he would not be Nagel, and 
<br />
he would therefore not be Nagel asking the question. If Nagel were actually 
<br />
asking what it would be like for him to stay Nagel and experience being a 
<br />
bat, perhaps by having his brain stimulated in a batty way, then that is (a) 
<br />
a different question, and (b) in theory possible, and not the intractable 
<br />
problem originally advertised. This is fair enough, so I shall try to avoid 
<br />
talking about qualia in the way Nagel does. However, I can't get rid of the 
<br />
idea that there is something special and fundamental about first person 
<br />
experience.

<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Stathis writes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I did not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mean that there is no explanation possible for consciousness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is likely that in the course of time the neuronal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mechanisms behind the phenomenon will be worked out and it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will be possible to build intelligent, conscious machines.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Imagine that advanced aliens have already achieved this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; through surreptitious study of humans over a number of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decades. Their models of human brain function are so good
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that by running an emulation of one or more humans and their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; environment they can predict their behaviour better than the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; humans can themselves.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Well put.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;An interesting point to add is that since human behavior
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is almost surely not compressible, the *only* way that they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;can learn what a human is going to do is to, in effect, run
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;one (the mocked up one in their lab). As you say, they run
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;an *emulation*.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But this could mean that they had *no* special insight into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consciousness,  because by adjusting the teleporter, Scotty
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;can &quot;find out&quot; things too just by making a physical copy of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the Captain, and, for example, finding out what he'd say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;about giving the engineers a raise.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But you have described Martian science very well. Here is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;what I think that they are capable of that *is* important:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;they could tell (or announce) with very high accuracy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;whether a species was conscious, and to what extent, in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;its natural environment, and do all this just from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;creature's DNA (and perhaps a little info on the inter-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;uterine environment).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Here is an analogy: in a cold hut in the Scottish highlands
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in 1440, two bright, but shivering, people are debating the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;nature of warmth. Says one: &quot;Brrr. Some day the scientists
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;will be so advanced that the can objectively measure hotness,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and you and I will more closely agree.&quot;  And he turned out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to be right, as we know now.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now, I think you will agree (although
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jonathan Colvin may not) that despite this excellent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; understanding of the processes giving rise to human conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; experience, the aliens may still have absolutely no idea what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the experience is actually like.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Yes, but what does that mean?  What does it mean for, say,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you to know what it's like when I play 1. e4 in a game of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;chess?  I can tell you that it's probably nothing at all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;like when *you* play 1. e4.  But it's strickly a function of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;how similar our chess careers have been, whether we both
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have the same opinion of the Alapin counter to the Sicilian,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and so forth.  So in effect, it really comes down to how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;much you are already me when you play 1. e4.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Somebody here said it much better than I: they said that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you have to almost be someone to in order to know what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it's like to be them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Jonathan then says
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; No, I'd agree that they have no idea what the experience is like. But 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; is no more remarkable than the fact that allthough we may have an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;excellent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; understanding of photons, we can not travel at the speed of light, or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; although we may have an excellent understanding of trees, yet we can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; photosynthesize. Neither of these &quot;problems&quot; seem particularly hard.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I totally agree.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; We are thus at an impasse, agreeing on all the facts but differing in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; appraisal of the facts.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Maybe. But since you (Stathis) write so well, could you summarize
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;what your adversaries seem to be saying and what you say? I'm less
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sure (than you) that no progress can be made.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;thanks,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Lee
