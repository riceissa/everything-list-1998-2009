Hi everythingers,
<br />
<br />I was telling you (in my last post of yesterday 24/06/99):
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I would still like to mention that Hal Finney (if I remember correctly) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;has pointed toward a similar  argument in the discussion. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I don't remember where. I will look for it in the archive.
</em><br />
<br />I found it by searching &quot;counterfactual&quot; in the body of the posts in the 
<br />
archive.
<br />
It is the &quot;causality and consciousness&quot; post by Hal (15 Jan 1999). More 
<br />
precisely:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/index.html?mID=304">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/index.html?mID=304</a>
<br />
<br />Here is an interesting excerp:
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt; Hal:
<br />
<br />It is not enough, in this view, to reproduce an instance of information
<br />
processing in a non-causal way.  For example, we could monitor each
<br />
neuron in the brain and record its firing pattern, then play back those
<br />
patterns in another brain which has had its neural connections all
<br />
severed.  Each neuron would have its own &quot;recorded tape&quot; for when it
<br />
was supposed to fire, based on the measurements made in the brain which
<br />
was thinking.  In the playback brain, the neurons all fire with exactly
<br />
the same patterns as in the conscious brain.  Is it conscious?
<br />
<br />(My solution is, as I said earlier, that the question isn't meaningful,
<br />
because it is at best another iteration of an already-produced 
<br />
calculation,
<br />
and it doesn't matter if a conscious calculation is instantiated multiple
<br />
times.)
<br />
<br />According to the consciousness-as-causality view, this playback is not
<br />
conscious, even though the patterns are all the same.  There is no causal
<br />
relationship among the neural firings as their was in the real brain.
<br />
Without causality, there is no consciousness.
<br />
<br />If we accept that consciousness is a real phenomenon deserving of
<br />
explanation, this view would require that causality is also a real,
<br />
fundamental, physical phenomenon.  But if the only way causality can be
<br />
defined is as a relationship that spans multiple universes, it would
<br />
follow that consciousness also must fundamentally involve multiple
<br />
universes.
<br />
<br />This is not necessarily as absurd as it may seem at first.  Our
<br />
consciousness seems to inherently be an active process.  The sense we
<br />
have of being conscious is intricately bound up with the sensation of
<br />
the passage of time.  Yet time &quot;passing&quot; is really a matter of the
<br />
increase of entropy, which can also be related to universe splitting
<br />
in either a many-worlds or all-universes model.  So it is already clear
<br />
that our perceptions do partake of some aspects of the multiple worlds.
<br />
If we could somehow bring counterfactuals into this, then we might be
<br />
closer to a coherent theory of consciousness.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">                                              &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<br />I will make a detailed comment about that ASAP. I agree with Hal but not 
<br />
on the point
<br />
&quot;it doesn't matter if a conscious calculation is instantiated multiple
<br />
times&quot;, where it seems I am closer to Jacques M Mallah.
<br />
<br />===========
<br />
<br />I give you all the posts in which &quot;counterfactual&quot; appears in the body. 
<br />
I believe that the notion of counterfactuality is fundamental in the 
<br />
Everything Approach,
<br />
not only for discussion on causality and consciousness, but also for the 
<br />
explanation
<br />
of the appearance of physical laws, etc.
