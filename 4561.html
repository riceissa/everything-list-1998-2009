<br />I will respond in part; however, your message is too long to be the

basis for a practical discussion.  There are too many different

ideas where we would not agree on the assumptions.  I will just focus

on the first part.

<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I notice that he does not mention universes wherein unconventional

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (for our everyday purposes) forms of logic, information, or probability

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; his mathematical structure. But would variations in suitable logical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure - different numbers of truth values, for instance - be most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; likely to be found only across Level IV?
</em><br />
<br />Yes, since level 4 includes all possible mathematical structures, that
<br />
would include ones with non-standard logic.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; More generally, _wouldn't variations in the suitable form of mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logic, information, &amp; probability &amp; uncertainty, more plausibly reflect

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something pertaining to quantum coherence, decoherence, etc., which are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at the basis for the idea of Level III, than anything pertaining to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ideas for the other Levels?_ (Not that I know a great deal about quantum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; coherence!) But Level III seems like the place for such variations,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if anywhere. No?
</em><br />
<br />Level 3 refers to our own universe's quantum physics as expressed in the
<br />
many-worlds interpretation.  All of the level 3 worlds should share the
<br />
same concepts of logic, information and probability.  Now, it's possible
<br />
that other level 4 worlds, which might have a different form of logic
<br />
or probability, might themselves have level 3 parallelism within them.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Tegmark does discuss how different lightcone structures (reflecting

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; variation across Level II) would affect one's capacity for inference, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inferential processes in an intelligent system are a different thing than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the subjects of mathematical theories of logic, information, probability,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &amp; uncertainty. I mean that differences of lightcone structure would affect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intelligent (including inferential &amp; other philosophically interesting)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; processes as they would affect cybernetic, stochastic, &amp; sensitive

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dynamic processes. But these differences would not necessarily reflect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different forms of *mathematical* logic, information, or probability or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (more generally) uncertainty.
</em><br />
<br />I'm not sure what you're getting at here, but let me make one point.
<br />
It's not clear that you can say that our universe is based on a particular
<br />
form of mathematical logic.  Does our universe in any sense rely on or
<br />
embody the principle that we can't have P and not-P?  I don't see it.
<br />
Our universe is based on atoms and quarks and fields.  When we say
<br />
that P and not-P can't both be true, the logic is in our heads, not in
<br />
the universe.
<br />
<br />The sense in which our universe is a mathematical structure is something
<br />
like the following.  Imagine that we develop a complete theory of
<br />
physics; we know all of the particles, all of the forces, all of the
<br />
laws.  Everything fits together, there are no exceptions or unknowns.
<br />
And further let us suppose that we discover the exact initial conditions
<br />
of the universe (Tegmark hypothesizes that the universe is initially
<br />
in a state of perfect simplicity).  Then these laws of physics define
<br />
a mathematical structure which is essentially identical (isomorphic)
<br />
to our physical universe.
<br />
<br />I don't see that these laws would be particularly likely to embody a rule
<br />
that says p and ~p is impossible.  Newton's laws don't have any such rule.
<br />
They just say Force = Mass times Acceleration.  Einstein's equations
<br />
don't have such a rule; they say that particles follow geodesic paths
<br />
and that the shape of space is determined by the stress energy tensor.
<br />
Quantum mechanics doesn't have such a rule; it says that the time
<br />
evolution of the system is based on the exponential function applied to i
<br />
times the Hamiltonian.  The point is, these are the kinds of mathematical
<br />
statements which have been the basis for physical laws in the past, and it
<br />
may be that in its final form, physics will be expressed in similar ways.
<br />
The equations won't necessarily build on mathematical logic at all.
<br />
<br />For another view of the Level 4 multiverse, I recommend Juergen
<br />
Schmidhuber's description of it as the output of a super-computer that
<br />
runs all possible computer programs.  He has a new page up at
<br />
<a href="http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/computeruniverse.html">http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/computeruniverse.html</a>, with the introductory
<br />
paper at <a href="http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/everything/html.html">http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/everything/html.html</a>.  This is
<br />
compatible with Tegmark's view if we assume that to every mathematical
<br />
structure there corresponds a computer program, and vice versa.
<br />
<br />Sorry I wasn't able to respond more substantively to the later portions
<br />
of your message.  You might want to re-write some parts and describe
<br />
your ideas in new messages.
