I think one of the essential difference between Jacques' point of view and 
<br />
some of the rest of us (James?, Bruno?, Russell?, Gilles? and myself) is that 
<br />
Jacques does not accept the principle of identity of indistinguishable and we 
<br />
do. This principle, I think, was first enounciated by Leibniz. Depending if 
<br />
it is accepted or not, it leads to very different conclusions regarding how 
<br />
consciousness is affected by the branching of the wave function. Other issues 
<br />
involve absolutism or relativism of measure and the linkage between worlds 
<br />
and consciousness. I will explore this issues in the following questions 
<br />
which may be the basis for further discussion.
<br />
<br />First Question. The principle of identity of indistinguishable applied to the 
<br />
wave function.
<br />
Is it possible for two (local) portions of the universal wave function 
<br />
originating from different (local) pasts, to &quot;merge&quot; that is to become 
<br />
identical. The output merged &quot;measure&quot; of this process would then be the sum 
<br />
of the two input &quot;measures.&quot; 
<br />
So if the first input portion is X and the second input portion is Y then the 
<br />
resulting wave would be X+Y. (This question ignores the Self Sampling issues)
<br />
I assume that &quot;measure&quot; is in some way related (or identical) to the 
<br />
probability = Square(|X +Y|) of the wave function. 
<br />
<br />Second Question. Is there really branching?
<br />
I am not sure if the branching and merging processes are at all possible in 
<br />
the first place or just an artifact of the way we look at the wave function. 
<br />
If the wave function is mapped in Wheeler's phase space, then, assuming 
<br />
purely deterministic laws, is it true to say that two trajectories in this 
<br />
space could never cross (or merge except in the limit)? and for the same 
<br />
reasons, could never branch? (I think this question is related to the 
<br />
Lyapunov stability theorem) How is this absence of branching and merging 
<br />
reconciled with the branching (and merging) that we take for granted in the 
<br />
MWI?
<br />
<br />Third Question. The principle of identity of indistinguishable applied to 
<br />
consciousness.
<br />
Assuming that it is possible for two (local) portions of the wave function to 
<br />
&quot;merge,&quot; then, is it true to say that two different consciousness 
<br />
independently expressed by these two portions, become one and same at the 
<br />
merging point? 
<br />
<br />Fourth Question. Absolutism vs Relativity of measure.
<br />
Is &quot;measure&quot; an absolute quantity, invariant with the observer, such as the 
<br />
distance between two points along a geodesic in space-time? Or is measure a 
<br />
relative quantity that depends on the observer, such as length, time, or 
<br />
velocity? 
<br />
I think that Jacques believes in the absolute version of measure and some of 
<br />
the rest of us, in the relative version. This question raises a hornet's nest 
<br />
because, and depending on the answer, it leads to different conclusions 
<br />
regarding Quantum Suicide (QS). 
<br />
<br />Fifth Question. Measuring Your Own Measure.
<br />
Can an observer observe or measure his own &quot;measure?&quot; How could one set up an 
<br />
experiment to make such a measurement? Would that experiment involve 
<br />
estimating how unlikely our world is? In other words if our world is found to 
<br />
be very improbable then our measure would be low, otherwise our measure would 
<br />
be high. The problem here is that if we assume the Plenitude to be an 
<br />
infinite set of possibilities, then any world would have a probability of 
<br />
zero. Absolutists would be satisfied with playing around with infinitesimal 
<br />
probabilities and would fight tooth and nail for maximizing those 
<br />
infinitesimals at all cost thus shunning QS as a &quot;crackpot idea&quot;. Relativists 
<br />
would in a sense &quot;RENORMALIZE&quot; their own probability of existence by using 
<br />
the conditional probability GIVEN the existence of the self. Thus, accoding 
<br />
to them, the probability that they exist given that they exist is one. The 
<br />
Relative Self Sampling Assumption (RSSA) is the conditional probability given 
<br />
the self,  and the Absolute Self Sampling Assumption (ASSA) is the plain 
<br />
probability.
<br />
<br />Sixth Question. Linkage between worlds and consciousness.
<br />
I am here venturing in an area in which I know very little. However, I think 
<br />
it relates to the controversy betweenby David Lewis,&quot;On the Plurality of 
<br />
Worlds,&quot; and Saul Kripke, a colleague of Lewis at Princeton University, who 
<br />
is the champion of ersatz modal realism. Is a particular consciousness linked 
<br />
to a single world,  or is it kind of  &quot;spread out&quot; like a quantum cloud over 
<br />
a multiplicity of worlds, for example like an electron is spread out in a 
<br />
probabilistic wave? (In fact maybe the quantum wave IS THE CONSCIOUSNESS 
<br />
WAVE). In other words, does consciousness have extension across worlds? 
<br />
Related to this question is the issue of how much difference is required 
<br />
between two consciousness for them to cease to be identical. In other words 
<br />
what is the TOLERANCE required by Leibniz principle of identity of 
<br />
indistinguishable. How can we define this tolerance? Is this difference 
<br />
physical or psychological? Is this tolerance defined by Planck's constant? Or 
<br />
is it defined by a &quot;Turing type&quot; test in which the difference is significant 
<br />
to an individual ONLY IF HE PERCEIVES IT TO BE SIGNIFICANT? Who is the 
<br />
observer for the &quot;Turing type&quot; test? The Self? Others?
<br />
<br />Again, as in previous issues, I think that some of us have championed the one 
<br />
consciousness - one world system and others have supported the one 
<br />
consciousness - multi-world system. And each point of view leads to radically 
<br />
different conclusions regarding QS. 
<br />
<br /><br />I have raised many questions, I think enough work to keep busy far into the 
<br />
next millenium. Forgive me if I attributed to you beliefs that you do not 
<br />
have. In the absence of a firm index of ideas with champions and challengers 
<br />
I find it difficult to know exactly what you are thinking.
<br />
<br />George Levy
