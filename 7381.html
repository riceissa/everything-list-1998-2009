<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suddenly disintegrated and were replaced a microsecond later with an exact

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; copy?
</em><br />
<br />To understand my point of view you need to stop thinking in pure
<br />
physicalist terms. Imagine that your consciousness is fundamental.
<br />
You are defined by your experiences, not by the pattern of matter that
<br />
your body is composed of. Your experiences seem to obey a given
<br />
set of restrictions, such as those that we identify as laws of physics.
<br />
Apart from the fact that you have experiences, be agnostic to any
<br />
other proposition, including the one that there is a physical objective
<br />
world. Note that I didn't say &quot;deny any proposition&quot;.
<br />
<br />The best analogy is to imagine that you are in a game, as the example
<br />
I used before. The game feeds experiences into your brain, if you like.
<br />
These experiences obey certain rules that were defined by the
<br />
programmer. In the case of the thought experiment described before,
<br />
where you press the button to create a copy, your next experience will
<br />
be whatever the programmer decided it would be. He could have made
<br />
the program in such a way that you would experience one of the two
<br />
with 50% probability, or he could have made the program such that
<br />
you always experience being in the same place. The only way to
<br />
know is to try it. I believe that in this particular case I will always
<br />
experience to be the same, but of course that is just my intuition.
<br />
<br />Now imagine that other people are playing the game , and they watch
<br />
you doing the experiment. They can never know whether you are now
<br />
experiencing to be the copy or still the original, since that information
<br />
is not available within the game.
<br />
<br />Of course, that is a dualist view of the world, which takes consciousness
<br />
as something fundamental. If you don't believe that consciousness plays
<br />
any fundamental role in the universe, then to be consistent you should
<br />
say that there is no meaning to attach a probability to what is your next
<br />
experience at all, since the question is meaningless from a physicalist
<br />
perspective. Lee Corbin, for example, has a consistent set of beliefs
<br />
about this (even though I don't agree with him).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; How would this in any way be different if you didn't disintegrate, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; passed from one moment to the next as per usual? My view is that, as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter of fact, we do die every moment only to be replaced by a copy, since
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to be &quot;one and the same&quot; at different times is physically impossible; at the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very least, the atoms comprising our body have different spacetime
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; coordinates. Suppose that this were actually scientifically confirmed: every
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; microsecond, every human being disintegrates and is replaced within a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; femtosecond by an exact copy, and this has been occurring for as long as the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; human species has been around, and will continue to occur. If you still felt
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the light of this knowledge that copies are not the same as the original
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in some important but ineffable sense, would you go about your life any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; differently, or even worry about it, given that the creation/destruction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cycle is far shorter than the time it would take to even form a worry in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your mind?
</em><br />
<br />Surely not.
<br />
<br />As I tried to argue before, there is a huge difference between making a
<br />
copy without in any way affecting the original, and continuously changing
<br />
the original. In the former case, there are two asymmetrical copies. One is
<br />
a continuous evolution of the original, while the other has been created
<br />
moments ago from raw materials. The copy will have a discontinuity
<br />
of experience. There is no a priori reason to assign a 50/50 probability in
<br />
this case.
<br />
<br />In fact, consider the following problems;
<br />
1. You are scanned to be copied, but no copy is made. Your data
<br />
is saved in a hard drive, and it could be used to create copies of you
<br />
in any time during the next millions of years. If you believe MWI, if it
<br />
can be used, it will. So the measure of being a copy could be much
<br />
larger than the measure of being the original, and simply because you
<br />
were scanned you have a negligible probability to experience to be in
<br />
the same place anymore. Of course, this invokes the problem of
<br />
how to measure the &quot;thickness&quot; of each copy's world, which I didn't
<br />
see any satisfactory answer yet.
<br />
<br />2. When you are scanned, how fast does the scan need to be to
<br />
count as a copy? The scan cannot be instantaneous. The final copy
<br />
will then be a rough smeared-out description of my body during a
<br />
certain interval of time. Will I experience to be the copy (if that is
<br />
possible) soon after the scan is started or soon after it is finished?
<br />
What if the scan is made long enough to take more than a moment
<br />
of thought so that I can experience the slow process of being copied?
<br />
At which point will I stop experiencing this process and start experincing
<br />
to be the copy?
<br />
<br />3. Of course, the copy is never perfectly identical to the original. How
<br />
is the probability of experiencing the copy affected if the experimenters
<br />
gradually change some details of the copy? What if they make the copy
<br />
with the same brain but with a different body? Or almost the same body
<br />
but a slight different wiring of the brain? Since you can continuously
<br />
modify your body into that of anyone else, would you say then that there
<br />
is a small nonzero probability for you to suddenly experience to be
<br />
someone else?
<br />
<br />In light of these problems, my intuition says that I cannot experience to
<br />
be my copies. So you can scan me as much as you like, I won't leave the
<br />
place.
<br />
<br />Eric.
