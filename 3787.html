<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mmmh ... Years ago I found a reference on &quot;Categoros&quot; (?) a programming

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pure lisp or like (axiomatic) recursion theory. I have study the Hyland

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; topos

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which manage to have models both linked to recursion theory and sort of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lambda
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; calculus, but eventually I leave it because those models are not well 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fitting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the problems I am working on.
</em><br />
<br />I think you are well ahead of me on this stuff (which is _good_, as it's 
<br />
nice to have people around to ask questions of). I know in handwaving 
<br />
ways that the lambda calculus is closely related to cartesian closed 
<br />
categories...I have a book by Lambek and Scott I've looked through, but 
<br />
I need more basics first.
<br />
<br />By the way, I started my real programming with Lisp, on a nice Symbolics 
<br />
Lisp Machine. A lot of folks talk about the (true) point that any 
<br />
recursively-complete language is sufficient to perform anything that can 
<br />
be computed, with just constant factors between implementations, but I 
<br />
strongly believe that the &quot;conceptual gap&quot; (or semantic gap) between 
<br />
ideas and implementations is best bridged with rich languages, possibly 
<br />
domain-specific languages. And that a lot of &quot;knowledge&quot; (about a 
<br />
domain) ought to be accessible through languages. For example, C++, 
<br />
Lisp, and Mathematica may all be in some sense equivalent, but the 
<br />
usefulness varies tremendously. I have Mathematica, for example, and I 
<br />
like the way it includes vast libraries of functions which reify or 
<br />
encapsulate knowledge and give us &quot;mathematical objects&quot; to manipulate. 
<br />
The tensor packs available for it are a good example, giving structures 
<br />
like &quot;Ricci&quot; and &quot;Riemann&quot; to manipulate directly and efficiently.
<br />
<br />A good class library is the same thing, of course, in an object-oriented 
<br />
language like Smalltalk or Java. (Apparently a big part of the successes 
<br />
of both Perl and Visual Basic--gag!--is in the extensive function or 
<br />
subroutine libraries.)
<br />
<br />It's intriguing to think of more abstract structures, such as the 
<br />
categories of algebra, topology, algebraic topology, etc., being 
<br />
implemented in the same way.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; My current &quot;hobby&quot; is Knot Theory. Curiously some &quot;quantum categories&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seem to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appear in knot theory ... Louis Kauffman wrote quite readable papers on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My interest in knots stems from my reading of Kitaev Papers on anyonic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quantum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computing (see also Freedman about his &quot;modular functor&quot;).
</em><br />
<br />I saw a streaming video talk given by the topologist Michael Freedman at 
<br />
MSRI. URL for his talk &quot;Anyons in Mathematics, Computer Science, and 
<br />
Physics&quot; is:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.msri.org/publications/ln/msri/2000/subfactors/freedman/1/">http://www.msri.org/publications/ln/msri/2000/subfactors/freedman/1/</a>
<br />
<br />Some interesting stuff on quantum computation and the braid category, 
<br />
but inasmuch as I know even less about knots than about category theory, 
<br />
I can't say much about his work.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I mean in the sense that the history of modern science seems to me to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; be a succession of &quot;throwing out the &quot;centered&quot; object,&quot; throwing out 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; a world centered around the Sun, or centered around God, or centered 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; around even Newtonian physics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;throwing out the &quot;centered&quot; object&quot; (or &quot;subject&quot; perhaps?) is quite in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the spirit of this list.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Have you read Everett?
</em><br />
<br />Hugh Everett, I assume you mean. Yes, indeed. I have the book edited by 
<br />
Bryce DeWitt and Neill Graham, &quot;The Many-Worlds Interpretation of 
<br />
Quantum Mechanics,&quot; 1973. I think this is how many in the physics 
<br />
community encountered MWI, through DeWitt's late 60s, early 70s 
<br />
re-analysis.
<br />
<br />Ironically, my general relativity instructor at UC Santa Barbara was Jim 
<br />
Hartle, known then (1973) for his work on photon black holes and such, 
<br />
and later famous for collaborations with Gell-Mann on &quot;consistent 
<br />
histories&quot; and 'wave function of the universe&quot; and with Hawking.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Quite important. He just embeds the physicist in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical world. My own work is a (radical) generalisation of that idea
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the sense that I embed the &quot;arithmetician&quot; in the arithmetical world,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; making it a first order citizen.
</em><br />
<br />Sounds intriguing. I'm currently less-focused on the role of human (or 
<br />
machine) observers.
<br />
<br />Isham makes an excellent point about time-varying sets, echoed by 
<br />
Smolin. In a nutshell, while the logic of a quantum universe (or 
<br />
cosmological universe, perhaps) may follow a Heyting logic where &quot;the 
<br />
cat is neither alive nor dead,&quot; once _any_ observation or measurement, 
<br />
whether a machine or a written note or a memory or whatever, then the 
<br />
logic is Boolean, as we &quot;are used to.&quot;
<br />
<br />Now obviously we're all familiar with this as the basic &quot;measurement 
<br />
collapses the wave function&quot; model, so there is at first glance nothing 
<br />
new here (you skeptics out there are right to be skeptical). However, 
<br />
the topos-theoretical point of view, in which topos logic (Heyting) is 
<br />
used instead of Boolean logic, seems to me to make the &quot;interpretation&quot; 
<br />
problem (Copenhagen vs. MWI vs. Cramer vs. ...) largely go away.
<br />
<br />The &quot;naive realism&quot; view is that whether we can see the cat or not, it 
<br />
&quot;must&quot; be &quot;really&quot; either alive or dead. The Heyting/Isham/Smolin/etc. 
<br />
point of view is that speculating about whether the cat is alive or dead 
<br />
is as meaningless as speculating about what the &quot;actual number of cats 
<br />
living at this moment in Andromeda&quot; is, given that that place is outside 
<br />
our light cone (our causal past) and that the earliest we could even 
<br />
conceivably answer that question is two million years from now.
<br />
<br />Smolin covers this territory convincingly, for me, in his &quot;Three Roads 
<br />
to Quantum Gravity.&quot;
<br />
<br />In fact, the elimination of the absolute view is refreshing.
<br />
<br />Take, for example, the very model of past and future light cones. We are 
<br />
familiar with the conventional world line of, say, me or you. Our world 
<br />
line moves from out past to our future in this Minkowski (or some 
<br />
variant) space-time. This is the point of view of the &quot;outside, 
<br />
omniscient, sees all events and objects in all parts of space-time&quot; 
<br />
point of view. The God viewpoint.
<br />
<br />This very point of view encourages (some) people to think in 
<br />
deterministic terms. &quot;The future&quot; and all that (emphasis on &quot;the&quot;). One 
<br />
thing reading a lot of science fiction has done for me is to disabuse me 
<br />
of any notion of &quot;the&quot; future. Instead, sheafs of possible futures. 
<br />
Locally determistic, and past-deterministic (pace the point about 
<br />
Heyting--&gt;Boolean), but various possible worlds of various futures are 
<br />
unknowable to observers in the real universe.
<br />
<br />(Smolin makes the case that the universe is everything there is, that it 
<br />
is pointless to speak of external observers who can see the entire 
<br />
structure of space-time. The links between this viewpoint and other 
<br />
areas are fascinating.)
<br />
<br />We are finite beings in an effectively finite, though very large and of 
<br />
effectively unlimited potential complexity, universe. The logic of 
<br />
time-varying sets (essentially topos logic) is the natural way to 
<br />
describe such systems. Locally, and in most everyday situations, Boolean 
<br />
logic works very well in physical situations (all honest observers will 
<br />
agree on any observation)...just as Euclidean geometry works very well 
<br />
in most situations, just as other theories work very well in most 
<br />
situations.
<br />
<br />I'm amazed at how well humans can understand reality.
<br />
<br />As I said, lots of people are way ahead of me in understanding the math. 
<br />
Seeing how once obscure parts of mathematics turn out to be very useful 
<br />
for Theories of Everything, I'm more convinced than ever that 
<br />
essentially all branches of mathematics are somehow &quot;built in&quot; to the 
<br />
structure of reality.
<br />
<br />(And this is one reason I'm skeptical of models that reality is just a 
<br />
cellular automaton running local rulesets on some computer. I have a 
<br />
hard time conceiving of how so much interesting mathematics would exist 
<br />
with simple local CA rules. But I could be wrong. :-) )
