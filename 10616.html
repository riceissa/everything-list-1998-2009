<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would say that only non-physical system implement counterfactuals.
</em><br />
<br />A counterfactual is somethingthat could have happened, but didn't.
<br />
A static, immaterial systems can only handle counterfactuals by
<br />
turning them into factuals -- everything that can happen does
<br />
happen. It can fully capture the *conditional* structure of a
<br />
programme,
<br />
(unlike a &quot;recording&quot;) at the expense of not being a process.
<br />
<br />A programme is not the same thing as a process.
<br />
<br />Computationalism refers to real, physical processes running on material
<br />
computers. Proponents of the argument need to show that the causality
<br />
and dynamism are inessential (that there is no relevant difference
<br />
between process and programme) before you can have consciousness
<br />
implemented Platonically.
<br />
<br />To exist Platonically is to exist eternally and necessarily. There is
<br />
no time or changein Plato's heave. Therefore, to &quot;gain entry&quot;, a
<br />
computational mind will have to be translated from a running process
<br />
into something static and acausal.
<br />
<br />One route is to replace the process with a programme. After all, the
<br />
programme does specify all the possible counterfactual behaviour, and
<br />
it is basically a string of 1's and 0's, and therefore a suitabale
<br />
occupant of Plato's heaven. But a specification of counterfactual
<br />
behaviour is not actual counterfactual behaviour. The information is
<br />
the same, but they are not the same thing.
<br />
<br />No-one would believe that a brain-scan, however detailed, is conscious,
<br />
so not computationalist, however ardent, is required to believe that a
<br />
progamme on a disk, gathering dust on a shelf, is sentient, however
<br />
good a piece of AI code it may be!
<br />
<br />Another route is &quot;record&quot; the actual behaviour, under some
<br />
circumstances of a process, into a stream of data (ultimately, a string
<br />
of numbers, and therefore soemthing already in Plato's heaven). This
<br />
route loses the conditonal structure, the counterfactuals that are
<br />
vital to computer programmes and therefore to computationalism.
<br />
<br />Computer programmes contain conditional (if-then) statements. A given
<br />
run of the programme will in general not explore every branch. yet the
<br />
unexplored branches are part of the programme. A branch of an if-then
<br />
statement that is not executed on a particular run of a programme will
<br />
constitute a counterfactual, a situation that could have happened but
<br />
didn't. Without counterfactuals you cannot tell which programme
<br />
(algorithm) a process is implementing because two algorithms could have
<br />
the same execution path but different unexecuted branches.
<br />
<br />Since a &quot;recording&quot; is not computation as such, the computationalist
<br />
need not attribute mentality to it -- it need not have a mind of its
<br />
own, any more than the characters in a movie.
<br />
<br />(Another way of looking at this is via the Turing Test; a mere
<br />
recording would never pass a TT since it has no
<br />
condiitonal/counterfactual behaviour and therfore cannot answer
<br />
unexpected questions).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; That counterfactuality is the essence of (immaterial) comp. Although
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; here Russell has a point: the quantum multiverse seems to handle
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; counterfactual.
</em><br />
<br />Multiverse theories seek to turn the 3rd-person &quot;X could have happened
<br />
but didn't&quot;
<br />
into the 1st-person &quot;X could have been observed by me, but wasn't&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Now if comp is correct, I cannot distinguish a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;genuine&quot; quantum multiverse from any of its emulation in Platonia,
</em><br />
<br />A quantum multiverse is sitll only a tiny corner of Platonia.
<br />
<br />Physical many-world theories have resources to keep counterfactuals
<br />
unobserved that immaterial MW-theories lack (including the simple
<br />
of one that many mathematical possibilities do not
<br />
exist physically).
<br />
<br />For instance, even if their are two informationally identical me's
<br />
in different branches of a phsycial universe, it is not
<br />
inevitable that any sharing or corss-over of
<br />
consicousness would occur, because in  a phsyical
<br />
universe, cosnciousness would have something other
<br />
than informational structures to supervene on.
<br />
<br />Thus me might
<br />
well be able to tell that we are in a quantum multiverse rather than
<br />
Platonia, on the basis that we just do not observe enough weirdness.
<br />
<br />Too broad: If I am just a mathematical structure, I should have a much
<br />
wider range of experience than I do. There is a mathemtical structure
<br />
corresponding to myself with all my experiences up to time T. There is
<br />
a vast array of mathematical structures corresponding to other versions
<br />
of me with having a huge range of experiences -- ordinary ones, like
<br />
continuing to type, extraordinary ones like seeing my computer sudenly
<br />
turn into bowl of petunias. All these versions of me share the memories
<br />
of the &quot;me&quot; who is writing this, so they all identify themselves as me.
<br />
Remember, that for mathematical monism it is only necessary that a
<br />
possible experience has a mathematical description. This is known as
<br />
the White Rabbit problem. If we think in terms of multiverse theories,
<br />
we would say that there is one &quot;me&quot; in this universe and other &quot;me's&quot;
<br />
in other universes,a nd they are kept out of contact with each other.
<br />
The question is whether a purely mathematical scheme has enough
<br />
resources to impose isolation or otherwise remove the White Rabbit
<br />
problem.
<br />
<br />Too narrow: there are a number of prima-facie phenomena which a purely
<br />
mathematical approach struggles to deal with.
<br />
<br />space
<br />
time
<br />
consciousness
<br />
causality
<br />
necessity/contingency
<br />
Why space ? It is tempting to think that if a number of, or some other
<br />
mathematical entity, occurs in a set with other numbers, that is, as it
<br />
were, a &quot;space&quot; which is disconnected from other sets, so that a set
<br />
forms a natural model of an *isolated* universe withing a multiverse, a
<br />
universe which does not suffer from the White Rabbit problem. However,
<br />
maths per se does not work that way. The number &quot;2&quot; that appears in the
<br />
set of even numbers is exactly the same number &quot;2&quot; that appears in the
<br />
list of numbers less than 10. It does not acquire any further
<br />
characteristics from its context.
<br />
The time issue should be obvious. Mathematics is tradionally held to
<br />
deal with timeless, eternal truths. This is reflected in the metpahor
<br />
of mathematical truth being discovered not found (which, in line with
<br />
my criticism of Platonism, should not be taken to seriously). It could
<br />
be objected that physics can model time mathematically; it can be
<br />
objected right back that it does so by spatialising time, by turning it
<br />
into just another dimension, in which nothing really changes, and
<br />
nothing passes. Some even go so far as to insist that this model is
<br />
what time &quot;really&quot; is, which is surely a case of mistaking the map for
<br />
the territory.
<br />
<br />Consciousness is a problem for all forms of materialism and physicalism
<br />
to some extent, but it is possible to discern where the problem is
<br />
particularly acute. There is no great problem with the idea that matter
<br />
considered as a bare substrate can have mental properities. Any
<br />
inability to have mental properties would itself be a property and
<br />
therefore be inconsistent with the bareness of a bare substrate. The
<br />
&quot;subjectivity&quot; of conscious states, often treated as &quot;inherent&quot; boils
<br />
down to a problem of communicating one's qualia -- how one feels, how
<br />
things seem. Thus it is not truly inherent but depends on the means of
<br />
communication being used. Feelings and seemings can be more readily
<br />
communicated in artistic, poetic language, and least readily in
<br />
scientific, technical language. Since the harder, more technical a
<br />
science is, the more mathematical it is, the communication problem is
<br />
at its most acute in a purely mathematical langauge. Thus the problem
<br />
with physicalism is not its posit of matter (as a bare substrate) but
<br />
its other posit, that all properties are physical. Since physics is
<br />
mathematical, that amounts to the claim that all properties are
<br />
mathematical (or at least mathematically describable). In making the
<br />
transition from a physicalist world-view to a mathematical one, the
<br />
concept of a material substrate is abandoned (although it was never a
<br />
problem for consciousness) and the posit of mathematical properties
<br />
becomes, which is a problem for consciousness becomes extreme.
<br />
<br />The interesting thing is that these two problems can be used to solve
<br />
each other to some extent. if we allow extra-mathemtical properties
<br />
into our universe, we can use them to solve the White Rabbit problem.
<br />
There are two ways of doing this: We can claim either:-
<br />
<br />White Rabbit universes don't exist at all
<br />
White Rabbit universes are causally separated from us (or remote in
<br />
space)
<br />
The first is basically a reversion to a single-universe theory (1).
<br />
Mathematical monists sometimes complain that they can't see what role
<br />
matter plays. One way of seeing its role is as a solution to the WR
<br />
problem. For the non-Platonist, most mathematical entitites have a
<br />
&quot;merely abstract&quot; existence. Only a subset truly, conceretely, exist.
<br />
There is an extra factor that the priveleged few have. What is it ?
<br />
Materiality. For the physicalist, matter is the token of existence.
<br />
Maerial things, exist, immaterial ones don't.
<br />
The second moves on from a Mathematical Multiverse to a physical one
<br />
(3). The interesting thing about the second variety of
<br />
non-just-mathematical monism is that as well as addressing the White
<br />
Rabbit problem, it removes some further contingency. If the matter,
<br />
physical laws, and so on, are logically possible, then the general
<br />
approach of arguing for a universe/multiverse on the grounds of
<br />
removing contingency must embrace them -- otherwise it would be a
<br />
contingent fact that the universe/multiverse consists of nothing but
<br />
mathematics.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the physical laws must take that into account.
</em><br />
<br />All forms of physics handle counterfactuals.
<br />
<br />Or do you mean it handles them in the sense of making them real  -- as
<br />
Deutsch insists.
<br />
<br /><br />Multiverse theories claim that all possible worlds exist; but
<br />
&quot;possible&quot; has more than one meaning, so there is more than one
<br />
multiverse theory. Logical possibility simply means that something is
<br />
not self-contradictory. Physical possibility means something is not
<br />
contradictory to the laws of physics. &quot;Five-sided square&quot; is
<br />
self-contradictory. &quot;Water runnig uphill&quot; is not, but it is physically
<br />
impossoble.
<br />
<br />'And, as I argued in FoR, the reality of universes in which we chose
<br />
differently makes sense of (some) formally 'counter- factual'
<br />
statements that don't make sense in single- universe physics, which can
<br />
only help in making sense of free will.
<br />
We are forced to conclude that, in spacetime physics [i.e. without a
<br />
multiverse], conditional statements whose premise is false (&quot;if Faraday
<br />
had died in 1830 ...&quot;) have no meaning. '[Fabric of Reality, D Deutsch,
<br />
p. 275]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Suppose we agree. What is Deutsch himself to make of the
<br />
counterfactuals we need to discuss the consequences of the laws of
<br />
physics themselves, such as: &quot;If charge were not conserved, the world
<br />
would be a very different place&quot;? The multiverse is no help, for by
<br />
definition, it contains no worlds in which the laws are different.
<br />
Deutsch's view thus implies that these essential claims about how
<br />
things would have been had the laws of nature been different &quot;have no
<br />
meaning&quot;. The moral is that if we want to give truth conditions for
<br />
counterfactuals in terms of possible worlds, we need the set of all
<br />
ogically possible worlds, not the set of physically possible worlds.
<br />
Indeed, Deutsch's whole multiverse probably counts as a single possible
<br />
world in David Lewis's account, to which Deutsch later compares his own
<br />
view: &quot;The fruitfulness of the multiverse theory in contributing to the
<br />
solution of long-standing philosophical problems is so great that it
<br />
would be worth adopting even if there were no physical evidence for it
<br />
at all. Indeed, the philosopher David Lewis, in his book On The
<br />
Plurality of Worlds, has postulated the existence of a multiverse for
<br />
philosophical reasons alone.&quot; [pp. 339,40], my italics. Note that it is
<br />
doubtful whether the italicised counterfactual is itself meaningful, on
<br />
Deutsch's view! In fact, what Lewis postulates is not a multiverse
<br />
theory, in Deutsch's sense.
<br />
from:-
<br />
<a href="http://www.usyd.edu.au/time/price/preprints/DeutschReview-bjps.html">http://www.usyd.edu.au/time/price/preprints/DeutschReview-bjps.html</a>
<br />
Under David's interpretation, conditional statements whose antecedents
<br />
are false in all physically possible universes, such &quot;as there is a
<br />
perpetual motion machine...&quot; are meaningless.
<br />
<br />So are positive statements about things that don't exist in any
<br />
physical universe, eg &quot;there is a perpetual motion machine&quot;
<br />
<br />So are negative statements about things that don't exist in any
<br />
physical universe, &quot;there is no perpetual motion machine&quot;. But, of
<br />
course, we would regard the last as meaningful and true.
<br />
<br />There is in fact a whole bunch of reasons for thinking that statements
<br />
don't require real-world referents to be meaningful. We judge the
<br />
meanings of statements by their semantic and syntactic makeup. we don't
<br />
judge them by peeping into the universe next door. We can make sense of
<br />
&quot;there is life on other planets&quot; without knowing whether there is in
<br />
fact life on other planets. If we couldn't make (linguistic,
<br />
comceptual) sense of &quot;there is life on other planets&quot;, we wouldn't know
<br />
how to go about verifying its truth.
<br />
<br />The kind of linguistic/semantic meaning I have been talking about is
<br />
called &quot;sense&quot;, as opposed to reference, the real-world object a
<br />
statement is about, if it is about one. The distinction originated with
<br />
the Frege
<br />
<br />David's contention seems to be based on the idea that &quot;all meaning is
<br />
reference&quot;. However it is arbitrary at best. It suggests statements
<br />
like &quot;if MWI is false..&quot; are meaningless unless there is a world where
<br />
MWI is in fact false. But how can that be if there is in fact, more
<br />
than one world ?
