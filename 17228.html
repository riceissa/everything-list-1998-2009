I owe Bruno and Brent a response also...it's in the works!

</em><br />
<br />Exactly.  This is a good way of putting it.  In this case our choices
<br />
would be 'owned' by the physical universe as whole.  Not just the bits
<br />
of matter that had some causal influence on the choice, but also the
<br />
physical laws by which that causal influence was transmitted.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Illusions, it should be recalled, are not incorrect

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perceptions; the perceptions are correct, even if the object of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perception is other than we imagine.  And here it is precisely the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ownership self-evidently present to us that requires explanation.
</em><br />
<br />I agree with this also.  I think.  The feeling of free will is a type
<br />
of qualia.  There's something that it's like to be in pain.  There's
<br />
something that it's like to make a decision.
<br />
<br />BUT I don't think this &quot;free will&quot; issue is a particularly crucial
<br />
point.  I could say more about it, but it seems like a tangent.  Not
<br />
entirely unrelated, but not central either.  So I'll move on.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; My contention is that any causal schema
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; must have these features even to begin to account for our presence in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the context of what we observe.
</em><br />
<br />Causality.  Causality.  Causalty.  Hmmm.
<br />
<br />So really I am arguing against causal explanations.  I think this the
<br />
core of my current argument.  The feeling that something is happening
<br />
*NOW* is just another example of qualia I think.  The certainty of
<br />
feeling that *that* caused *this*...more qualia.
<br />
<br />Causality doesn't get you anywhere, because it doesn't start cleanly.
<br />
This is why I keep bringing up &quot;uncaused&quot; beginnings.  If *this*
<br />
happened because of *that*, then why did *that* happen?  You can't get
<br />
to the start of it in a way that makes sense.
<br />
<br />If you have the starting conditions (which are uncaused) and the laws
<br />
that govern the evolution of the system (also uncaused), then the rest
<br />
is basically a given, right?  A mere formality.  Anything that follows
<br />
was implicit within the starting conditions and the governing laws.
<br />
<br />Every step in the evolution of the system can be seen as existing
<br />
simultaneously with it's beginning.  And as such the entire system
<br />
JUST EXISTS.  Uncaused.  Acausal.  Fundamental.
<br />
<br />If you exist within such a system, your entire experience exists as a
<br />
result of the starting conditions and governing laws, and exists
<br />
simultaneously with the system's beginning and all it's subsequent
<br />
states.  Again, there is no answer to any question of &quot;why&quot; in
<br />
reference to the system.  The system just is the way it is.  It's
<br />
starting conditions are axiomatic, it's governing rules are
<br />
inferential, it's results are tautological.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The reason this isn't more widely understood rests of course
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on the prestige of science, the authority of which has reached the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point where we're apparently willing to take seriously the absurdity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the universe is a sterile pointless farago that could as well
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; play out in the absence of all experience.
</em><br />
<br />I agree.  A lot of inconvenient questions seem to have gotten swept
<br />
under the rug.
<br />
<br />So as I've mentioned, it seems to me that science's role is to
<br />
construct theoretical models that accurately match what we have
<br />
observed.  That's it.  Nothing more, nothing less.  But obviously
<br />
they've had great success with this, thus their authority.  But, as I
<br />
mentioned above, it is what it is.  Things will play out the way they
<br />
play out.  Tautology.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; BTW Rex, your recent presence on the list has been welcome and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thought-provoking.
</em><br />
<br />Ah!  Thanks, glad to hear it!
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It would be interesting to know a little about the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; background you bring to your thinking.
</em><br />
<br />Well, I have a BS in computer systems engineering, and 02 years of
<br />
graduate school in the same, though I never quite got around to
<br />
finishing my thesis, so no MSCSEG degree to show for my efforts.  And
<br />
I've been a computer programmer for 15 years, in various
<br />
areas...mainly cartography, communications, business accounting
<br />
software, web development, and gaming.
<br />
<br />So not to go into too much detail, but probably the key moments in the
<br />
development of my philosophical world view were:
<br />
<br />1)  Realizing that deterministic classical physics meant no
<br />
libertarian free will when I was 21 years old or so, about 2 minutes
<br />
before a professor wrote on the chalk board in big letters &quot;NO FREE
<br />
WILL&quot;.  For those 2 minutes though, I was really thunderstruck.  I
<br />
thought &quot;Holy crap, this is incredible!  Am I the first person to
<br />
realize this???&quot;   So I spent the next 09 years or so trying to come to
<br />
grips with the implications of that, which was hard, because I really
<br />
wanted to take full credit for all the great things I'd done.  But,
<br />
then as my 30th birthday came and went, I decided maybe I didn't have
<br />
that many great things to take credit for after all, so screw free
<br />
will.  Who needs it anyway.
<br />
<br />2)  My introduction to functionalism and computationalism and some of
<br />
the related issues like the strange implications of multiple
<br />
realizeability via Hans Moravec's book &quot;Robot: Mere Machine to
<br />
Transcendent Mind&quot; in the late 1990s.  This gave me something to think
<br />
about in my spare time for several years.
<br />
<br />3)  AND, most recently, about 18 months ago, when I finally got around
<br />
to reading David Chalmers' paper &quot;Facing Up to the Problem of
<br />
Consciousness&quot;.  I'd heard a little about the &quot;hard problem&quot; of
<br />
consciousness prior to that, and I was familiar with the basic issues,
<br />
but I didn't fully understand until that moment.  It wasn't quite the
<br />
shock that my free will &quot;discovery&quot; had been, but it was still a
<br />
moment of revelation, where one second I didn't see the problem at
<br />
all, and the next second I couldn't believe that I had failed to see
<br />
it for so long.
<br />
<br />Since then I've put a lot more time into trying to understand what it
<br />
all means.  And I'm leaning towards concluding that it doesn't &quot;mean&quot;
<br />
anything.  It just is.  Which is a strange conclusion to come to after
<br />
18 months of pretty intense thought...
