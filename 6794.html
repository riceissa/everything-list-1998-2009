As an exercise I've been trying to pinpoint exactly what is wrong with 
<br />
Plaga's paper. For anyone who doubts that it *is* wrong, note that it 
<br />
proposed 10 years ago an experiment which he said was feasible with what 
<br />
was then state-of-the-art equipment. This technology has now massively 
<br />
advanced.  The experiment would guarantee a Nobel prize for anyone who 
<br />
performed it successfully. In that time the paper has been cited in the 
<br />
published literature only 3 times, and never by an experimental physicist. 
<br />
And this is not because the paper was unnoticed by the community at the 
<br />
time, e.g. it was publicised by John Baez, whose writings are widely read.
<br />
<br />On careful reading, the paper is just littered with confusions and errors. 
<br />
I guess this explains why no-one bothered to publish a rebuttal; this 
<br />
falls in the class of &quot;not even wrong&quot;.  Probably the root problem is a 
<br />
confusion about the true nature of decoherence. Decoherence is often 
<br />
presented using the maths of density matrices, so I better explain 
<br />
this briefly:
<br />
<br />Density matrices allow you to handle the case when you don't know the 
<br />
exact quantum state. The procedure is to divide your description into a 
<br />
measurable &quot;system&quot; and a complex, not-measurable-in-detail &quot;environment&quot;. 
<br />
One can then define the density matrix of the combined system, and &quot;trace 
<br />
out&quot; the uncertain state of the environment, giving a density matrix for 
<br />
the system alone in the absence of information about the environment. A 
<br />
test to see if the system has been decohered by its interaction with the 
<br />
environment is that the off-diagonal terms in the system-only density 
<br />
matrix go to zero. Plaga clearly accepts the usual position that 
<br />
irreversible branching in MWI occurs when decoherence is (FAPP) total.
<br />
<br />If you follow this through in Plaga's example, you do indeed find that the 
<br />
density matrix for the states of his trapped ion, |A1&gt; and |A2&gt;, is 
<br />
diagonal, confirming the obvious that once a macroscopic measurement has 
<br />
taken place, we have total decoherence.  But what Plaga does in his Eq 8 
<br />
is to reverse the roles of system and environment (he actually does the 
<br />
algebra wrong but the numerical answer is unaffected). Because at this 
<br />
stage the ion knows nothing about the rest of the lab, he gets a density 
<br />
matrix *for the lab* with large off-diagonal terms, corresponding to a 
<br />
&quot;pure&quot; state:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;(|W1&gt; + |W2&gt;) / sqrt(2).
<br />
<br />So far, so correct (after all, in MWI the state is *always* pure).
<br />
<br />But he now concludes that decoherence has not yet occurred. *WRONG*. The 
<br />
condition &quot;off-diagonal terms go to zero&quot; is just a sufficient condition 
<br />
for decoherence. It is only necessary if the &quot;system&quot; itself is so simple 
<br />
that it could not decohere without the help of the environment. But Plaga 
<br />
is treating the complex, macroscopic lab as the &quot;system&quot; and that 
<br />
certainly can decohere without the help one more ion. The more basic 
<br />
definition is that decoherence has occured once the states are permanently 
<br />
orthogonal, so you cannot demonstrate quantum interference. Plaga 
<br />
correctly states that |W1&gt; and |W2&gt; *are* permanently orthogonal, but does 
<br />
not realise that this means that decoherence *is* complete, contrary to 
<br />
what he says.  Another way to put this is that the observer &quot;Silvia&quot; 
<br />
doesn't need the density matrix in Eq. (8) because she knows for sure 
<br />
already whether she detected the original photon or not, hence whether she 
<br />
is in branch |W1&gt; or |W2&gt;.
<br />
<br />Given this, the rest of Plaga's argument is just irrelevant. But he should 
<br />
have noticed that his process blatantly violates the linearity of time 
<br />
evolution, which is one of the fundamental assumptions of MWI QM. This is 
<br />
manifest in his Eq. 6 which associates an excited ion with the |P2&gt; term 
<br />
in which no excitation took place (if you start with a photon in state 
<br />
|P2&gt;, when the photon is guaranteed not to be detected, the ion is never 
<br />
excited). Hence Eq 6 is not a linear superposition of the two possible 
<br />
histories. Hence, if we saw what he predicted, we would actually 
<br />
*disprove* MWI QM, not confirm it as he thinks.
