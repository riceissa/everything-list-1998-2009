<br />Jacques, I'm so glad that you decided to respond to me directly
<br />
at last!  First let me say this:  Fuck you, you pathetic piece 
<br />
of shit!  I wrote two posts directly to you in the recent past,
<br />
hoping to engage you in a meaningful discussion of QTI:  see
<br />
<a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/index.html?mID=706">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/index.html?mID=706</a> and
<br />
<a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/index.html?mID=754">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/index.html?mID=754</a>.  In that
<br />
last post I even invited you to &quot;show me why I am stupid&quot;.  But
<br />
only when I decided to write something a little bit personal did
<br />
you decide to respond in a scornful, derisive manner.  Why is 
<br />
that?
<br />
<br />I won't respond to the technical issues, &quot;the facts&quot; that you 
<br />
listed in your post, because I would just be repeating the stuff
<br />
I wrote in the above two posts.  I still wish you'd respond to
<br />
them.
<br />
<br />It's interesting, isn't it, how people can disagree so 
<br />
fundamentally sometimes?  I sympathize with what you expressed
<br />
about your frustration in trying to convince someone of what
<br />
seems to be obvious to you.  I've experienced that myself. 
<br />
Now, I'd like to think that I'm a fairly good thinker.  And I
<br />
think that you are, about some things, having read lots of
<br />
your posts from the past.  I particularly liked your 
<br />
explications on the pointlessness of the &quot;free will&quot; debate,
<br />
and I agree with them wholeheartedly.
<br />
<br />So let me give you some advice, because I'm still seething
<br />
here -- when you feel that frustration coming up again, just
<br />
stuff it.  Either ignore the post altogether, which is 
<br />
something that I do quite often, or respond thoughtfully and 
<br />
respectfully.  I do, personally, believe that there is a 
<br />
thing called truth out there, and I know that you'd like to
<br />
know it as much as I would.  If we disagree, it must be
<br />
because either we're starting from different premises, or
<br />
one of our logical reasoning is flawed, or perhaps one of
<br />
us is biased in our thinking in a way that we are unaware of.
<br />
But I'm not stupid, and I don't believe you are either.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I suspect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I will unsubscribe from this newsgroup before long.  I'm a scientist, not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a suicide counselor.
</em><br />
<br />I didn't ask for any counseling.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;         Much like many others on this list, you have no understanding of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; issues that are really simple.  But then the human capacity for stupidity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; never ceases to amaze me.  For example, I am currently in an email debate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with someone who claims to have a counterexample to Bell's theorem - a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non-MWI, local hidden variables model to explain Bell correlations.  The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only problem: the way he takes expectation values, with a funny
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probability distribution, the average value of a certain quantity is 1
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even though the probability that this quantity will be nonzero is zero.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         To me this is the very definition of reductio ad absurdum, but he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thinks it is just an insult to call his beliefs absurd!  This guy is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; kidding, he is an employed engineer and I still can't get my mind around
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the fact that he is so incredibly stupid.  IT ... IS ... JUST ... NOT ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; POSSIBLE!  But, it is true.  %*^~$%(&amp;!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         But this is not atypical of my experiences on the internet of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; trying to convince crackpots of their errors.  Be it magnetism,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, or quantum suicide, these people just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; won't understand what I tell them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         So, I really don't expect to convince you either.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         But consider this:  Is the branch in which you win the lottery not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; already occupied?  How will it profit this lottery winner if you, finding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; yourself in another branch, kill yourself?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         Your belief that you will magically leap into the body of this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; winner, at the same date and time as you die, is absurd.  You guys take
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one true fact - that the effective probability of finding yourself to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that winning guy, given that you find the date and time to be such and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such, and that your name is such and such, etc. - is nearly one.  But you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't understand what it means and you sure as hell don't use it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correctly, and the result is this monstrous quantum cult of death.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         The facts are, and I've said this a million times by now:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; -       There is only one reason to commit suicide and it is the same as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; without QM: if your life is so bad that you would rather not exist, commit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suicide; otherwise don't.  For indeed, in those branches you would cease
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to exist, while the branches with the lottery winner would gain nothing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; -       the effective probability of finding yourself to be that guy,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; given that your name is such and such, is still very small.  If you did
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; follow though, most of the the observers with that name would find
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; themselves prior to that date.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; -       The effective probability of having that name, given that you are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an observer after that date, would be greatly reduced by the suicide.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; -       Your total measure would be reduced, so there would be less
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observers with that name in the ensemble, and the total number of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observers would be less.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; -       There is only one reason to commit suicide and it is the same as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; without QM: if your life is so bad that you would rather not exist, commit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suicide; otherwise don't.  For indeed, in those branches you would cease
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to exist, while the branches with the lottery winner would gain nothing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Now I actually care too much about somebody else -- my wife.  I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; couldn't kill myself now, knowing how much it would hurt her.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; So now I take my lumps as they come.  That sounds like maturity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         No, it sounds like you now have too much to lose.  A condition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which may not last.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
