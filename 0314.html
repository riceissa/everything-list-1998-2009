<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; we should be able to vary smoothly between one and two conscious entities.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Another solution to this puzzle is the idea that the measure of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious experience is related to the measure of the state information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that produces that experience. Given this assumption, when you double the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computer's processing element widths, you double the system's contribution
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the universal a priori distribution and therefore double the measures
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the conscious experiences related to the system. And the same thing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happens when you double the number of computers instead.
</em><br />
<br />That's an interesting possibility, which I will have to give more
<br />
thought to.  The idea that bigger computers would actually produce
<br />
a larger measure for conscious systems that it implements is counter
<br />
intuitive but not completely impossible.
<br />
<br />I see a few difficulties with the proposal, though.  We already face
<br />
the difficulty of identifying when a system instantiates a computation.
<br />
Now we would have the additional difficulty of identifying what aspects
<br />
of the system contribute to the measure.  Presumably non-functional
<br />
elements would not increase the measure (?).  Is it enough to make the
<br />
wires thicker, or do the processing elements themselves also have to
<br />
be larger?  Would expanding the size of the computer without increasing
<br />
the size of the parts be enough?  How about moving just one part a long
<br />
ways away?
<br />
<br />It would seem that in general the solution to these problems is to find
<br />
the shortest description of the computer, and then make the measure be
<br />
proportional to that.  As long as you can determine whether a given
<br />
computer instantiates the intelligent program, you can see whether a
<br />
given description of sub-parts of the computer would also instantiate
<br />
that program, and in that way eliminate redundant elements.  So if I tried
<br />
to define &quot;my computer&quot; as my PC plus the entire earth, giving it a huge
<br />
measure for the AI program it is running, this method would catch that by
<br />
finding that the same program is instantiated even if we exclude the earth
<br />
and count only the PC.  But we can't exclude more than that or we don't
<br />
find that the program is instantiated.  In this case we are able to draw
<br />
a boundary around the computer and eliminate the unnecessary elements.
<br />
<br />However it seems that for the double-thick computer, you could describe
<br />
a subset of the computer which is only half as wide, which would also
<br />
instantiate the computation, hence the additional width did not make
<br />
a contribution, which is not the desired result.  So I'm not sure this
<br />
method is going to work in general.
<br />
<br />I wonder if this proposal would also produce the effect that natural
<br />
selection would &quot;seem&quot; to favor larger and more complicated brains?
<br />
If those systems have larger &quot;measure&quot;, and we are perceiving the world
<br />
from such systems, then it would give the appearance of a boost in
<br />
probability for making big brains, independent of any survival advantage
<br />
that such brains offered.  Does that seem right?  Could this actually
<br />
be an explanation for the evolution of intelligence?  (Or is it just
<br />
a restatement of the anthropic principle, that intelligence must have
<br />
evolved for us to be asking these questions?)
