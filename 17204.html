<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the sake of the argument.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So, while the contents of my experience...the things that I'm

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious OF are complex and structured, my conscious experience of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; these things is singular and indivisible.
</em><br />
<br />I can be OK with this.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As such, I feel that it is reasonable to say that conscious experience
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; itself is uncaused and fundamental.
</em><br />
<br />This has no meaning for me. It is like saying &quot;don't ask&quot;.
<br />
Also, what do your theory say about accepting or not an artificial  
<br />
brain?
<br />
<br />More generally, how do you see the relation between brain and  
<br />
conscience?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Given that conscious experience is uncaused, it can't be explained in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; terms of other things, like quarks and electromagnetism or numbers and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arithmetic.
</em><br />
<br />But quarck and electromanetism have been unified, and can be explain  
<br />
from more primitive things (group theory, invariance, etc.).
<br />
<br />Natural numbers are the rare object which we cannot derive from  
<br />
anything simpler. And natural numbers + addition and multiplication  
<br />
can explain why it has to be like that. This is indeed an argument for  
<br />
accepting numbers, or theories as rich as numbers,  as giving the  
<br />
simplest primitive elements.
<br />
<br />And since Skolem, Gödel, etc. we know that arithmetical truth is  
<br />
*big*. Bigger that what any machine can really explore, but machine  
<br />
can dream about it, and get genuine big picture of it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Uncaused things can't be explained.  They just are.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So what causes the complexity and structure of the things that I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious of?  Nothing.  That's just the way my experience is.
</em><br />
<br />? I can't accept this, because I am interested in the how and why of  
<br />
complexity of things and happenings.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No explanation can be given for uncaused fundamental events or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entities.
</em><br />
<br />But what are your assumptions about those entities? You theory does  
<br />
look like what the guardian G* tells to the &quot;enlightened machine&quot; G:  
<br />
you will not prove your consistency. But the machine can prove that IF  
<br />
she is consistent, then G* is right about that. So, on one level, I  
<br />
understand why you say so, and at another level I explain why you say  
<br />
so.
<br />
<br />&quot;understanding&quot; is a complex notion. Theories are not build to  
<br />
understand, but to get a coherent (hopefully correct) picture.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And further, no meaningful explanation can be given for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; events or entities that are themselves *wholly* caused by uncaused
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; events.  These things just are.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So let's say a closed system of entities comes into being uncaused.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Any properties that the individual components of this system have are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; also uncaused, and the ways that the components interact are uncaused
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as well.  This system is a universe unto itself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So I am saying that no matter how this system evolves, no aspect of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the system can ever be given a meaningful explanation.
</em><br />
<br />You put something which cannot be explained in the hat.
<br />
You get something which cannot be explained in the hat.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaningless of it's initial state means that all subsequent states are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; equally meaningless in an absolute sense.  All that we can do is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; describe what the system does.  But description is not explanation.
</em><br />
<br />OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Further, even if the system seems predictable, there is no reason to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think that it will continue in it's predicitablity.  And neither is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there any reason to think that it won't continue it's predictable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pattern.  The system follows it's own &quot;uncaused&quot; rules, which we may
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be able to guess at, but which we cannot know, due to the system's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fundamentally uncaused nature.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think this is more obvious if you look at the system as a &quot;block
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe&quot;, where time is treated as a sort of spatial dimension, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so all states of the system exist simultaneously, like my previous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; example of the block of granite.  Why does state B follow state A?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why is slice B adjacent to slice A?  Because that's just the way this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; uncaused system is.
</em><br />
<br />It is big amorphous blob. Weird theory. I don't see the relation with  
<br />
the universe, nor even with consciousness.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Looking for meaning in the system is like looking for hidden messages
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in randomly generated character strings.  You may find them, but the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; messages can not have any real meaning, no matter how meaningful they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; look.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; In the conclusion I don't understand the last sentence, which seems  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; me a proposition for abandoning theorizing in that field.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, the search for a theoretical model that is fully consistent what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what we consciously observed is still a reasonable goal in terms of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; challenging intellectual endeavor.  And if that's what your future
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious experiences hold for you, then that's what you will do (no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; free will here).
</em><br />
<br /><br />Free will is an oxymoron. &quot;Free&quot; will makes sense for numbers.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Machines are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; more fundamental than consciousness?  Or machines are just a way of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; representing conscious experience?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Machines/numbers cannot represent conscious experiences.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You are correct, I misspoke.  I should have said &quot;machines are just a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way of representing the CONTENTS of conscious experience.&quot;
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK. relatively to other universal numbers.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Comp can make the conscious experience much more fundamental than the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Aristotelian materialist usually think, yet consciousness is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; arithmetically &quot;caused&quot;. It is an attribute of universal machine (in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; an even weaker sense than usual) related to their ideal self-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; consistency. It generates the belief in a reality, and the infinities
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of corrections which ensue.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To me this has as much of an &quot;explanatory gap&quot; as materialism.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Except that comp explains where the gap originates from. Better, it  
<br />
gives it a geometry and its relation with the appearances, making the  
<br />
theory testable.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Consciousness is caused by arithmetical relationships?  Why would this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Any rational agent (be it a god or a machine) can understand that once  
<br />
we accept a material physical artificial digital brain, then it has to  
<br />
be like that. This is in part due to the fact that if the brain act  
<br />
digitally, its functioning is entirely equivalent with relation  
<br />
between numbers. It is part of computer science. (This is eaxctly what  
<br />
I explain now in the seventh thread).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why would arithmetical relationships result in conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Because arithmetical relationship described the theology and the  
<br />
science of self-observing machine. No machine can know as such its own  
<br />
theology, but machine can get the theological science about simpler  
<br />
machine, and then lift its logic on themselves (so they can remain  
<br />
consistent in the process), and escape locally the incompleteness.
<br />
<br />I am not saying that truth is like that, but that if you say yes to a  
<br />
doctor and survive the graft, then it has to be like that.
<br />
<br />Bruno
