Dear Norman,

<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Gentlemen,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thank you for many illuminating replies to the &quot;Why does anything exist?&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; question.  Three are shown below.  It's clear that some hold that there is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an identity between physical and mathematical existence (although Patrick
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Leahy may disagree).  If so, we can phrase the big WHY as &quot;Why do numbers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exist?&quot;   (Answer:  Because such existence is a logical necessity.)
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This &quot;identity&quot;, does it how at all levels of Existence? I would argue 
<br />
that it does not and this is the reason that I am suggesting that we look at 
<br />
Vaughan Pratt's ideas based on Chu spaces as a way to comprehend the 
<br />
&quot;stratifications&quot; of Existence. The duality we find there is easy to 
<br />
understand once we get past our prejudices. Consider the duality that exist 
<br />
between Cantor sets and complete atomic Boolean algebras...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~pt/ASD/manifesto.html">http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~pt/ASD/manifesto.html</a>
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider the Cantor hierarchy and the way that &quot;nameability&quot; seems to 
<br />
become more and more difficult as we climb higher and higher. In the limit 
<br />
of the hierarchy, the limit at which physical implementability and 
<br />
mathematical representability are not longer distinguishable, Nothingness 
<br />
and Everything are One. Every transformation is a perfect homomorphism, even 
<br />
an automorphism. This is perfect symmetry. But we must not forget that 
<br />
Existence must be Complete and thus it follows that all modes of Existence 
<br />
also must exist, thus we have the example of the Cantor Hierarchy.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.phschool.com/science/science_news/articles/infinite_wisdom.html">http://www.phschool.com/science/science_news/articles/infinite_wisdom.html</a>
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The question (at least as I mean it) can also be phrased as &quot;Why is there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something instead of nothing?&quot;  Or perhaps I am really asking &quot;What is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; First Cause?&quot;
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First Causes are self-contradicting.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why this question has no answer is because there is no point 
<br />
at which the question can be posed such that an answer obtains that is 
<br />
provably True. This is the proof that Bruno's work shows us. The very asking 
<br />
of the question is like trying to predict what one will do, given some 
<br />
Newcombian choice, and then having to wrestle with the implications of the 
<br />
answer.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the notion of a &quot;first cause&quot;, in itself, is fraught with 
<br />
tacit assumptions. Consider the possibility that there is no such a thing as 
<br />
a &quot;first cause&quot; just as there is no such thing as a privileged frame of 
<br />
reference. We are assuming that there is a &quot;foundation&quot; that is manifested 
<br />
by the &quot;axiom of regularity&quot;:
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/axiom-of-regularity?method=5">http://www.answers.com/topic/axiom-of-regularity?method=5</a>
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Every non-empty set S contains an element a which is disjoint from S.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exactly how can Existence obey this axiom without being inconsistent? 
<br />
Before we run away screaming in Horror at this thought, consider the 
<br />
implications of Norman's statement here:
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think the big WHY must be an unanswerable question from a scientific
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; standpoint, and that Leahy must be correct when he says &quot;. . .  there is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just no answer to the big WHY.&quot;  Stephen Paul King says it, maybe more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rigorously, when he says, &quot;Existence, itself, can not be said to require 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explanation for such would be a requirement that there is a necessitate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prior to which Existence is dependent upon.&quot;
</em><br />

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I find this a very odd question to be asked on this list. To me, one of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; main attractions of the &quot;everything&quot; thesis is that it provides the only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible answer to this question. Viz: as Jonathan pointed out, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; objects are logical necessities, and the thesis (at least in Tegmark's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; formulation) is that physical existence is identical to mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence.  Despite this attractive feature, I'm fairly sure the thesis is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wrong (so that there is just no answer to the big WHY?), but that's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; another
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; story.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You can look at my URL for argument that physical existence emerges from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical existence. I have no clues that physical existence could just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be equated to mathematical existence unless you attach consciousness to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; individuated bodies, but how?  I can argue that without accepting natural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; numbers you cannot justify them. So any theory which does not assumes the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; natural numbers cannot be a theory of everything. Once you accept the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence of natural numbers it is possible to explain how the belief in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; both math and physics arises. And with the explicit assumption of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Descartes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mechanism, in a digital form (the computationalist hypothesis), I think 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explanation is unique. Also, it is possible to explain why we cannot 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where our belief in natural numbers come from.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />[SPK]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bruno, the only problem that I have with your thesis is that you do not 
<br />
seem to understand that physical existence and mathematical existence have 
<br />
equal ontological status, one is not prior to the other and both emerge from 
<br />
the Existence that is Nothingness, necessitating each other. This is just 
<br />
the beginning.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Onward!
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Stephen
