<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I know your work is mathematics, not philosophy. Thank goodness! I can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; see
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; how your formalism can tell you 'about' a universe. I can see how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inspection of the mathematics tells a story about the view from within 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; without. Hypostatses and all that. I can see how the whole picture is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constructed of platonic objects interacting according to their innate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rules.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is the term 'empirically falsifiable' I have trouble with. For that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have any meaning at all it must happen in our universe, not the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of your formalism.


</em><br />
Let us say that &quot;my formalism&quot; (actually the Universal Machine talk) is 
<br />
given by the 8 hypostases. Then, just recall that the UDA+Movie Graph 
<br />
explains why the appearance of the physical world is described by some 
<br />
of those hypostases (person point of view, pov).





<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A belief in its falsifiability of a formalism that does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not map to anything we can find in our universe is problematic.


</em><br />
The &quot;intelligible matter hypo&quot; *must* map the observations. If not, the 
<br />
comp formalism remains coherent, but would be falsified.



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In the platonic realm of your formalism arithmetical propositions of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; form  (A v ~A) happen to be identical to our empirical laws:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;It is an unconditional truth about the natural world that either (A is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; true about the natural world) or (A is not true about the natural 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world)&quot;


</em><br />
Physics does not appear at that level.





<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (we do the science dance by making sure A is good enough so that the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; NOT
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; clause never happens and voila, A is an an empirical 'fact')
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Call me thick but I don't understand how this correspondence between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; platonic statements and our empirical method makes comp falsifiable in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe. You need to map the platonic formalism to that which drives 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality and then say something useful we can test.You need to make a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; claim
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that is critically dependent on 'comp' being true.


</em><br />
If comp is true the propositional logic of the certain observable obeys 
<br />
the logic of the &quot;intelligible matter&quot; hypostases, which are perfectly 
<br />
well defined and comparable to the empirical quantum logic, for 
<br />
example.
<br />
We can already prove that comp makes that logic non boolean.


<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would suggest that claim be about the existence or otherwise of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; phenomenal consciousness PC would be the best bet.


</em><br />
You have not yet convince me that PC can be tested.



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is another more subtle psychological issue in that a belief that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comp is empirically testable in principle does not entail that acting 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if it were true is valid.


</em><br />
You are right. The contrary is true. We should act as if we were 
<br />
doubting that comp is true. (Actually comp is special in that regard: 
<br />
if true we have to doubt it).
<br />
Note the &quot;funny situation&quot;: in 2445 Mister Alfred accepts an artificial 
<br />
digital brain (betting on comp). He lives happily (apparently) until 
<br />
2620 where at least comp is tested in the sense I describe above, and 
<br />
is refuted (say).
<br />
Should we conclude that M. Alfred, from 2445q,  is a zombie ?




<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sometimes I think that is what is going on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; around here.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Do you have any suggested areas where comp might be tested and have any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ideas what the test might entail?


</em><br />
Naive comp predicts that all cup of coffee will turn into white rabbits 
<br />
or weirder in less than two seconds. Let us look at this cup of coffee 
<br />
right now. After more than two seconds I see it has not changed into a 
<br />
white rabbit. Naive comp has been refuted.
<br />
Now, computer science gives precise reason to expect that the comp 
<br />
prediction are more difficult to do, but UDA shows (or should show) 
<br />
that the whole of physics is derivable from comp (that is all the 
<br />
&quot;empirical&quot; physical laws---the rest is geography). So testing comp 
<br />
needs doing two things:
<br />
- deriving physics from arithmetic in the way comp predict this must be 
<br />
done (that is from the pov hypostases)
<br />
- comparing with observations.

<br />
The interest of comp is that it explains 8 povs, but only some of them 
<br />
are empirically testable, but then the other appears to be indirectly 
<br />
testable because all the povs are related.

<br />
To sump up quickly: Comp entails the following mystical propositions: 
<br />
the whole truth is in your head. But I have shown that this entails 
<br />
that the whole truth is in the &quot;head&quot; of any universal machine. I 
<br />
explain how to look inside the head of a universal machine and how to 
<br />
distinguish (in that head) the physical truth (quanta) from other sort 
<br />
of truth (like qualia). Then you can test comp by comparing the 
<br />
structure of the quanta you will find in the universal machine &quot;head&quot;, 
<br />
and those you see around you in the &quot;physical universe&quot;.

<br />
It is not at all different from the usual work by physicists, despite 
<br />
it makes machine's physics(*) a branch of number theory. We can compare 
<br />
that &quot;machine's physics&quot; with usual empirical physics and test that 
<br />
machine's physics.

<br />
(*) &quot;machine's physics&quot; really means here the &quot;physics extracted by an 
<br />
ideally self-observing machine&quot;.


<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; ... I am more interested in proving scientists aren't/can't be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; zombies....that it seems to also challenge computationalism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; in a certain sense... this is a byproduct I can't help,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; not the central issue.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I can have a lot of sympathy for an argument showing that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; science cannot be done without consciousness (I personaly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; do believe this!). But if the byproduct is that machine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; cannot be conscious, then I think it will make your argument
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; far less interesting, and, by Church thesis, necessarily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; non effective (if it was a machine would be able to produce
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; it). Actually, the acomp hypostases can already been used
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to explain why machines will develop argument why their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; own consciousness are special and cannot be attached to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; any describable machine in a provable way (and they will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; be 1-correct!!!). It is the diabolical (somehow godelian)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; prediction of comp: machines will not believe in comp,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; just bet on it in some circumstance.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Conscious machines will happen. And it will be very very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interesting...With any luck it'll be me who does it. It's my mission. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; PhD.


</em><br />
I guess you are joking :)
<br />
But I wish you success in the PhD.




<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What I contend is that abstract computation alone will not do it. Part 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the machine physics, apart from being able to shuffle charge around in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; accordance to the symbols, is to ALSO attach the physics of experience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Is this what COMP is pointing to?).


</em><br />
Yes thanks to the fact that all hypostases come in couple (like G, G*;  
<br />
Z, Z*, X1 X1*, etc.) which gives the sharable and the non sharable 
<br />
truth. This gives room for consciousness, qualia, PC, ...





<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then the machines will have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; phenomenal consciousuness and as a result be a whole bunch more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; adaptable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and smart. And get seats on planes.


</em><br />
Recall that if digital machine have no PC, then it means you have to 
<br />
attach PC to something not turing emulable. Some mathematics can help 
<br />
to study those non turing emulable entity, but there is not yet any 
<br />
evidence such a thing exists in&quot;nature&quot;.



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; At that time (a few years.. 10 max?) I'll be able to test comp for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; real in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; teeny weeny scientists. My prediction is comp is false in our universe,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but true in the platonic realm where existence and computation of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; abstractions are identities.


</em><br />
In that case platonia owns myriad of zombies.




<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is not our universe, IMO, where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'existence' is 'computation of/by &lt;blah&gt;' and the 'blah' is not nice 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; neat
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical ideals. Depicting it with platonic ideals is very useful 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; informative...but that's as far as it goes.



</em><br />
After Godel we know that Platonia is full of typhons, tempest, dusts, 
<br />
ten thousand living things, war, etc.



<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The distinction between computability and provability is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; fundamental for the AUDA. Alas, you are not the only one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; who miss the distinction, but explanation of this has to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; be a bit more technical. I have already attempted some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; explanation, but it is perhaps too hard to convey in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; non technical list. I don't know, presently.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is something I am working on. Any light you can shed on it I'd 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; greatly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appreciate.


</em><br />
Very shortly: all attempt to defined the class of all &quot;intuitively&quot; 
<br />
computable functions has given the same class of functions, and this 
<br />
despite very different motivations (lambda conversion, rational quantum 
<br />
mechanics, turing machine, billiard balls, game of life, etc.).
<br />
There is a notion of universal machine with respect to computation. 
<br />
Universal dovetailing makes sense.

<br />
For provability, no two theories have the same theorems in general. 
<br />
There exist transfinite chain of more and more powerful theories, etc. 
<br />
There is no universal machine with respect to proof. Universal 
<br />
dovetailing does not make sense.



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have no clue what the quotes re angels and G etc are about.


</em><br />
Normal. Those things does not make sense if you have not get a good 
<br />
understanding of the difference between provability and computability.



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; once you can accept 'wild-type' naturally occuring primitive &quot;objects&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; available (as opposed to idealised platonic realm primitives like 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; integers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with nice neat relationships) then their inter-relatedness is a formal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; system in the same way that platonic realm objects are.


</em><br />
But I don't have a clue what is a wild-type primitive objects.
<br />
So I am not motivate in assuming that that exists (why would I assume 
<br />
the existence of objects I have never see, nor comprehend in any way).



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; An actual instance
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of them is axioms.

</em><br />
Like in the analogy:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;initial condition = axioms
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;differential equation = inference rule
<br />
?



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'Computation' and theorem proving from this axiom set
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is what the universe literally is...at least that is how I like to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of it.

</em><br />
With computation, this can make sense (through the Universal 
<br />
Dovetailer).
<br />
But &quot;axiom set&quot; are more of the type &quot;machine&quot; or &quot;theory&quot;  or 
<br />
&quot;observer&quot; than &quot;universe&quot; (both in math and physics). There is no 
<br />
universal dovetailing for proofs. (Only for proofs by this or that 
<br />
machine).



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's just very very messy. In local descriptions from within we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scientists can map it into the idealised form - very useful to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things,


</em><br />
After Godel we know that platonia's messiness is beyond anything (we, 
<br />
or machine) can ever imagine.



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but not saying anything about what the universe is made of.

</em><br />
Hmmmm. The UDA shows that the &quot;universe&quot; is not made of things.


<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; idealised realm helps us make conceptual sense.. but no more.


</em><br />
OK, but then comp is false (quite possible).
<br />
Or my reasoning is false (In that case it would be kind to give me a 
<br />
clue where in the uda)


<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think of it like lab mice and lab flies. You make them (phenotype 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and then you get nice neat behaviour (idealised), which you then can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; use
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to contrast with the 'wild-type', which is out of your control, messy 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mysterious (which is why you're doing it in the first place!).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maybe that's a poor analogy. :-)


</em><br />
I think so, because even just *arithmetical* platonia is full of 
<br />
totally uncontrollable wild beasts. It is the fall of logicism and of 
<br />
the Hilbert program. The machine which observes itself &quot;honestly&quot; can 
<br />
discover its own unpredictibility and wildness (and free will, and 
<br />
qualia, and the interfering dreams (physics), taxes, death, etc.). The 
<br />
machine which observes itself enough can guess that she does not know 
<br />
who she is.
