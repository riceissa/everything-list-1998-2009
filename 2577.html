<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;         Umm, let me break this down into chucks and try to see if we are understanding

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; each other. My notion of a &quot;previous time&quot; was couched within a notion that is similar
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to J. A. Wheeler's notion of a &quot;Surprise 20 Questions Game&quot; and I did not state so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explicitly. I am playing with the idea that time is a &quot;first person&quot; attribute and thus
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is not to be considered as &quot;objective&quot; nor absolute (as in the Newtonian sense). I think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that our ideas are similar but we may have semantic differences here. ;-)
</em><br />
<br />OK but I am not familiar with Wheeler's game.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; In addition, the conscious points are multiply connected and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; connections are a function of the points themselves. In other words each point could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; have several priors and several successors.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     I would agree, but I would argue that we could cause some confusion if we are not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; careful.  We have to distinguish the a priori possible (or probable) experiences from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the a posteriori experiences themselves.
</em><br />
<br />I don't think I follow you. There is no such a thing as &quot;probable.&quot; All connections are
<br />
actualized albeit in different degrees according to their RELATIVE measures. We now get into
<br />
the discussion of measure which has been endlessly debated before. Suffice to say that I
<br />
think that while measure can be relatively different between two transitions, there is NO
<br />
WAY to establish an ABSOLUTE value for measure because of the infinity of the plenitude.
<br />
(i.e., Loosely speaking,  if each transition has infinite measure, the only way to compare
<br />
two transitions is to take the limit of their ratios.)  Hence, relatively to the observer,
<br />
his own measure can always be assumed to be one. This remains true as long as the number of,
<br />
or magnitude of the adversities in his environment remains of a lower cardinality than his
<br />
own measure. When the adversities are too severe then his consciousness stops from
<br />
propagating (being linked) to those very adverse states. It's kind of a Cosmological
<br />
Principle.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am exploring the idea that communication
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between observers plays an important role in restricting and/or distinguishing the two.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I hope that you understand this difference between a priori and a posteriori that I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; writing about. ;-)
</em><br />
<br />I don't understand. In the constext of Markov chain, all the information is contained in the
<br />
current states.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; [GL]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The structure is &quot;web-like.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Yes, I agree. I have been exploring this idea with several people for some time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; using the notions of Leibniz and Spinoza. Let me recap. Are you saying that conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; points (I can them them &quot;monads&quot; ala Leibniz) has a &quot;web-like structure?&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />Kind of. They are connected by a web-like set of allowed logical transitions.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; [GL]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (The universe does not just splits with each Quantum event, it can also merge)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Umm, here I have a problem! You say that the universe splits and merges;
</em><br />
<br />Sorry! In an effort to communicate, I was employing terms used in the popular literature
<br />
about the MWI. I should NOT have said that the universe &quot;splits.&quot; It's not the universe that
<br />
splits and merge. It's our conscious flow through the interconnections between the OM or
<br />
conscious points. Schoedinger equation really describes the spread of our consciousness
<br />
through the web.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; best to view each points as a set of states independent of past information (i.e.,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; first order Markov chain). To make sense, a transition needs only satisfy the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; current states. The &quot;past&quot; states are irrelevant or ambiguous.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     We could think of the splitting and merging as local topological properties of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multiply connected manifold and I think that such a thought would be in line with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; idea of first order Markov chains, but I am not sure now you are thinking about how the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; points are related (via transitions). It is obvious that &quot;past states&quot; refer to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information that is encoded within the current state and that is what I meant by my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; statement. I think that we agree that the &quot;past&quot; is not something that is &quot;out there&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; outside of the experience of the present moment. ;-)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />I agree with this.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     I am interested in your thoughts of Pratt et al's ideas. ;-)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />Sorry. Pardon my ignorance. I don't know who Pratt is. Would he be by any chance one of the
<br />
two guys who make airplane engines. ;-)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;[SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Ok, would we agree that the anthropic principle (weak?) is true in the sense that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any observer will have first person perspectives (experiences) that have a probability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of 1 if and only if such are consistent with its existence. Also, if you are going to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; say that consciousness is a static phenomenon then could you explain how the appearance
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of change comes about?
</em><br />
<br />In the same way a derivative describes movement while being itself static.The logical links
<br />
would have to contain directionality information.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Have you by chance read Julian Barbour's book The End of Time?
</em><br />
<br />Sorry, I didn't have a chance.
<br />
