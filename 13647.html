<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Accepting broadly your summary up to this point...............

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MP:  But I have to *challenge you to clarify* whether what I write
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; next really ties in completely with what you are thinking.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; DN:  My seconds will call on you!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MP:  Consciousness is something we know personally, and through
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discussion with others we come to believe that their experience
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is very similar.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; DN:  OK, but If you push me, I would say that we 'emerge' into a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; personal world, and through behavioural exchange with it, come to act 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consistently as if this constitutes an 'external' environment including 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a community of similar worlds. For a nascent individual, such a personal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world is initially 'bootstrapped' out of the environment, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; incrementally comes to incorporate communally-established recognition 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and explanatory consistencies that can also be extrapolated to a embrace 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a wider context beyond merely 'personal' worlds.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
MP2: Yes! Well put.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; MP:  This can be summarised as 'The mind is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what the brain does', at least insofar as 'consciousness' is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concerned, and the brain does it all in order to make the body's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; muscles move in the right way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; DN:  I would say that 'minds' and 'brains' are - in some as yet 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not-fully-explicated way - parallel accounts of a seamless causal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; network embracing individuals and their environment.  Depending on how 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this is schematised, it may or may not be possible to fully correlate 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; top-down-personal and bottom-up-physical accounts.  Nonetheless, ISTM 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more natural to ascribe intentionality to the individual in terms of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; environment, rather than 'the brain getting the body's muscles to move' 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - i.e. &quot;I move my hand&quot; runs in parallel with a physical account 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; involving the biology and physics of brain and body, but both ultimately 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; supervene on a common 'primitive' explanatory base.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
MP2: OK, my 'the brain makes muscles move' is basically a
<br />
bulwark against 'panpsychism' or any other forms of
<br />
mystery-making. The term I like is 'identity theory' but like
<br />
most labels it usually seems to provoke unproductive
<br />
digressions. The main reason for the word 'challenge' above is
<br />
due to the way you were using the word 'sensing' for physical
<br />
and chemical interactions.
<br />
I would use 'connection' with effects: action and reaction which
<br />
include attraction and repulsion. So I would say effects' rather
<br />
than aff'ect [ie stress is on first syllable] but here, as with
<br />
everything to do with affect and emotion, common English usage
<br />
is not helpful [similarly to the way 'love' in English
<br />
translations of the New Testament is used to translate at least
<br />
four more precise words of the original Greek].
<br />
<br />NB: I don't use the word 'supervene'. To me it always gives the
<br />
impression that something like a coat of paint is being referred
<br />
to. 'Identity' does for me.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; MP:  The answer is that the brain is structured so that behaviours - 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; potentially a million or more human behaviours of all sorts - can be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *stored* within the brain. This storage, using the word in a wide sense, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is actually changes to the fine structures within the brain [synapses, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dendrite location, tags on DNA, etc] which result in [relatively] 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discrete, repeatable patterns of neuronal network activity occurring 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which function as sequences of muscle activation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ...........&lt;snip&gt;.........
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Behaviours, once learned, become habitual i.e. they are evoked by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appropriate circumstances and proceed in the manner learned unless 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; varied by on-going review and adjustment. Where the habitual behavioural 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; response is completely appropriate, we are barely conscious of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; activity; we only pay attention to novelties and challenges - be they in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the distant environment, our close surroundings, or internal to our own 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bodies and minds.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; DN:  Your account reads quite cogently, and we may well agree to discuss 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the issues in this way, but crucially ISTM that our accounts are always 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; oriented towards particular explanatory outcomes - which is why one size 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doesn't fit all.  So let's see if this shoe fits............
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
MP2: Well, as someone for whom 'standard' means if the collar 
<br />
fits then the cuffs button round my finger tips ...
<br />
one size will never 'fit all' but diversity is good in company 
<br />
with toleration and healthy scepticism.
<br />
I am always keen to point out that we humans are always beset 
<br />
with a paradox, which _can_ be seen as a kind of duality. What 
<br />
it amounts to is that we live in a real world, but we live by 
<br />
means of a description. That is to say, all our knowledge _of_ 
<br />
the world is embodied in qualia which are _about_ the world. 
<br />
They are our brains' method of accounting for things. Naive 
<br />
realism is how we are when we 'mistake' qualia for the world 
<br />
they represent. But they exist, and that is a key point. So is 
<br />
the fact that, even if the world 'behind' the appearances is not 
<br />
actually the world _of_ the appearances, many millions of years 
<br />
worth of natural selection pretty much guarantees that for all 
<br />
normal purposes what we see perceive is a very good accounting 
<br />
of what is there. The fun really starts when we de-construct the 
<br />
ways in which we see other people and social groups.
<br />
<br />I am not sure if my formulation actually ties in with Colin 
<br />
Hales's schema, but it agrees on many key points.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; MP:  I have put this description in terms of 'behaviours' because I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; am practising how to deal with the jibes and stonewalling of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; someone who countenance only 'behavioural analysis'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; descriptions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; DN:  Ahah....  I confess I've had a little peek at your dialogues with a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certain individual on another forum, and I think I discern your purpose 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and your problem.  All I can say is that we conduct the dialogue a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; little less fractiously on this list.   For what it's worth, I probably 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wouldn't expend much more effort on someone with so entrenched a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; position and so vitriolic a vocabulary. &lt;&lt;snip&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<br />MP2: Yes, I believe that person's approach to communication has 
<br />
in fact wasted all manner of good opportunities to sort out the 
<br />
agreements and congruence between behavioural analysis so-called 
<br />
and the descriptions arising from other methods of study. I am 
<br />
trying to formulate a summary of how I see behavioural analysis 
<br />
descriptions fitting in with 'representational' descriptions of 
<br />
brain and mind. One major hurdle is how to engage with the 
<br />
behaviourist view that pretty much all behaviour is just a 
<br />
response to the external environment.
<br />
<br />I am trying to show how the stimuli from the external 
<br />
environment come to be internalised in the form of patterns of 
<br />
brain activity which become surrogates for the original stimuli. 
<br />
This works in several different ways and in different 
<br />
directions. For example the behaviour of others becomes part of 
<br />
the structure of one's world. An example of this would be where 
<br />
in a military organisation the complete obedience of 
<br />
subordinates becomes an integral feature of an officer's world. 
<br />
Raw behaviourist language cannot easily and effectively describe 
<br />
all that is going on because in effect the officers' environment 
<br />
is made up of subordinates' behaviours. There is at least one 
<br />
behaviourist out there who cannot cope with the fact that his 
<br />
theories have no way of describing WHERE part of the officers' 
<br />
world - which is clearly visible - actually IS. I have a 
<br />
descriptive scheme outlined on some of the pages of my little 
<br />
website which deals with it quite succinctly, but that is 
<br />
another story.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     David,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     We have reached some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     understanding in the 'asifism' thread, and I would summarise
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     that, tilted towards the context of this line of this thread,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     more or less as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     follows.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Existence -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     *       The irreducible primitive is existence per se;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     *       that we can know about this implies differentiation in and of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     that which exists;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     *       that we can recognise both invariance and changes and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     participate in what goes on implies _connection_.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     I am sure there must be mathematical/logical formalism which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     could render that with exquisite clarity, but I don't know how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     to do it. Plain-English is what I have to settle for [and aspire
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     to :-]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     There are a couple of issues that won't go away though: our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     experience is always paradoxical, and we will always have to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     struggle to communicate about it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Paradox or illusion -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     I think people use the word 'illusion' about our subjective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     experience of being here now because they don't want to see it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     as paradoxical. However AFAICS, the recursive self-referencing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     entailed in being aware of being here now guarantees that what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     we are aware of at any given moment, i.e. what we can attend to,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     can never be the totality of what is going on in our brains. In
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     terms of mind, some of it - indeed probably the majority - is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     unconscious. We normally are not aware of this. [Duh, that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     what unconscious means Mark!] But sometimes we can become aware
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     [acutely!]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     of having _just been_ operating unconsciously and this is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     salutary, once the sickening embarrassment subsides anyway :-0
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     For those of us who have become familiar with this issue it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     no hardship but there are many who resist the idea. The least
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     mortifying example that is _easy to see in oneself_ is what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     happens when we look for something and then find it: before we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     find it the thing is 'not there' for us, except that we might
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     believe that it is really. Then we find it; the thing just pops
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     into view! As mundane as mould on cheese, but bloody marvellous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     as soon as you start thinking about how it all works!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     But I have to *challenge you to clarify* whether what I write
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     next really ties in completely with what you are thinking.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     I'll try it in point form for brevity's sake.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Behaviour and consciousness -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     *       Consciousness is something we know personally, and through
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     discussion with others we come to believe that their experience
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     is very similar.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     *       Good scientific evidence and moderately sceptical common sense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     tell us is this experience is _intimately and exclusively_ bound
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     up with the activity of our brains. Ie the experience - the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     conscious awareness of the moment as well as the simultaneous or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     preliminary non-conscious activity - is basically what the brain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     does, give or take a whole range of hormonal controls of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     rest of the organism. This can be summarised as 'The mind is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     what the brain does', at least insofar as 'consciousness' is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     concerned, and the brain does it all in order to make the body's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     muscles move in the right way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     *       People's misunderstanding about how we are conscious seems to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     centre around how mere meat could 'have' this experience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     *       The answer is that the brain is structured so that behaviours
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     - potentially a million or more human behaviours of all sorts -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     can be *stored* within the brain. This storage, using the word
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     in a wide sense, is actually changes to the fine structures
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     within the brain [synapses, dendrite location, tags on DNA, etc]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     which result in [relatively] discrete, repeatable patterns of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     neuronal network activity occurring which function as sequences
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     of muscle activation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     *       For practical purposes behaviours usually involve muscles
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     moving body parts appropriately. [If muscles don't move, nobody
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     else can be sure if anything is going on]. However, within the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     human brain, learning also entails the formation of neuronal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     network activity patterns which become surrogates for or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     alternatives to overtly visible behaviours. Likewise the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     completely internal detection of such surrogate activities
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     becomes a kind of surrogate for perception of one's own overt
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     behaviours or for perception of external world activities which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     would result from one's own actions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     *       Useful and effective response and adaptation to the world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     requires the review of appropriateness of one's overt behaviour
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     and to be able to adjust or completely change one's behaviours
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     both at very short notice and over arbitrarily long periods
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     depending on the duration of the effects of one's actions. This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     entails responding to one's own behaviours over whatever time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     scale is necessary.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     *       Behaviours, once learned, become habitual i.e. they are evoked
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     by appropriate circumstances and proceed in the manner learned
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     unless varied by on-going review and adjustment. Where the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     habitual behavioural response is completely appropriate, we are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     barely conscious of the activity; we only pay attention to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     novelties and challenges - be they in the distant environment,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     our close surroundings, or internal to our own bodies and minds.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Who? -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     *       The concept of responding to one's own responses being the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     basis of consciousness causes some to complain that this implies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     some kind of infinite regress of observers. What actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     happens is that internal brain behaviours [discrete network
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     activations] occur as surrogates for all the relevant
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     environmental features of interest, including one's own body and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     the storyline we are following. Where surrogates for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     environmental features are linked in with surrogates for 'self'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     [body and storyline] and with network activations that stand for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     relationships between those features of environment and self,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     THAT, moment by moment, is something which exists. So there is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     'something it is LIKE something to be' and that is what it is.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     The registration of novelty and the responses to it, reviewed in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     ceaseless recursive cycles, gives us the basis of subjective time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     I have put this description in terms of 'behaviours' because I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     am practising how to deal with the jibes and stonewalling of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     someone who countenance only 'behavioural analysis'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     descriptions. I am happier recognising that most internal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     behaviours can be called 'representations' - it is much more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     succinct.
