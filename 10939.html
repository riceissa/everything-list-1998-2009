<br />
I am sorry that I have not been able to keep up with the list lately.
<br />
I can only peek in occasionally.
<br />
<br />My interpretation of the question of computationalism vs supervenience
<br />
can be put succinctly.  Computationalism says that consciousness depends
<br />
both on actual behavior and on counterfactuals.  Therefore, it depends
<br />
both on what happens and on what doesn't happen.  Supervenience says
<br />
that consciousness depends only on physical behavior; hence it depends
<br />
only on what happens.
<br />
<br />Since computationalism says that consciousness depends on what doesn't
<br />
happen, while supervenience says that it depends only on what happens,
<br />
the two doctrines are inconsistent.
<br />
<br />To marry them would require altering computationalism so that it no
<br />
longer depended on counterfactuals, which then requires us to say that
<br />
all systems implement all calculations.
<br />
<br /><br />As far as this latter question, the framework I adopted and adapted from
<br />
Wei Dai, which I call UD+ASSA, suggests that there is a sense in which
<br />
it is true, but it is not significant or meaningful.
<br />
<br />The UDASSA framework seeks to calculate the measure of a conscious
<br />
experience.  We start by thinking of a conscious experience as something
<br />
that can be described as an abstract information pattern.  Any physical
<br />
system which instantiates that information pattern can be said to
<br />
contribute to the measure of that conscious experience.
<br />
<br />The Universal Distribution defines the measure of an information pattern
<br />
as the fraction of all programs that output that pattern.  Equivalently,
<br />
the measure is the sum of 1/2^L_n, where L_n is the length in bits of
<br />
the nth program that outputs the pattern.  Short programs have higher
<br />
measure than long ones; hence to a good approximation the measure depends
<br />
on the length of the shortest program that outputs it.
<br />
<br />If we consider all programs, some of them instantiate or simulate
<br />
&quot;physical&quot; universes.  They have their own laws of physics and initial
<br />
conditions.  Some are complex, some simple.  In those universes we
<br />
may find physical systems which we would naively view as instantiating
<br />
particular computations, even conscious computations.  We would like to
<br />
say that such universes add to the measure of those computations.
<br />
<br />In the UDASSA framework, this is handled by imagining a two part program.
<br />
The first part creates and runs the universe; the second part scans the
<br />
output of the first part and outputs the abstract information pattern
<br />
that represents the conscious experience.  The size of this two part
<br />
program is the sum of the size of its parts.  Only if both parts are
<br />
small will the contribution to the measure of the experience be large.
<br />
<br />As has been discussed here, in principle you can find a mapping from
<br />
any physical system to any computation.  This threatens to lead to the
<br />
conclusion that every consciousness is instantiated by every physical
<br />
system.  Traditionally, computationalism opposed that conclusion by
<br />
insisting on support for counterfactuals.  But the UDASSA framework
<br />
handles it in a different way.
<br />
<br />In the UDASSA framework, a mapping from, say, a solid rock to an abstract
<br />
information pattern representing a moment of human consciousness would
<br />
be a very large program.  In truth, this mapping program wouldn't even
<br />
need to use the rock.  It could output the human information pattern just
<br />
as easily without the help of information from the rock.  The mapping
<br />
program will need to include all of the information and programming
<br />
needed to generate the human consciousness information pattern essentially
<br />
from scratch.  That's going to be a very large program.
<br />
<br />In contrast, a mapping program that goes from a human brain to an abstract
<br />
information pattern representing a moment of human consciousness can
<br />
be quite compact.  It would use the physical information from the human
<br />
brain state and translate that to whatever form was used to abstractly
<br />
specify the computational state.  While this might be modestly complex,
<br />
it would be far, far simpler than the nearly-astronomical complexity
<br />
needed to output a human brain experience from a rock.
<br />
<br />The result is that physical systems which have plausible &quot;naive&quot;
<br />
interpretations as implementing certain computations will contribute
<br />
significantly to the measure of such computations; while physical systems
<br />
where we would need a contrived and complex mapping will contribute
<br />
negligibly to such measure.
<br />
<br />This provides a reason, within this framework, to neglect the possible
<br />
existence of conscious entities created by non-conscious computations.
<br />
Any mapping which could specify such an entity will be enormous and will
<br />
not contribute meaningfully to the measure of such entities.
