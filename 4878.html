Greetings, Brent. Thanks for joining the conversation!

<br />I think that's the same viewpoint that Joao is putting forth? Then 
<br />
the counter to my argument is that their can be no inflation within 
<br />
regions of the universe where the force of gravity is above a 
<br />
threshold value? That is a strong counter argument. 
<br />
<br />I am not convinced that any value of gravity can stop inflation. Slow 
<br />
it locally, yes, and even slow it dramatically. I can not argue 
<br />
against that unless dark energy suddenly came into being everywhere 
<br />
and all at once when the universe was  something around 5 billion 
<br />
years old. But I think it was there all along and from the  moment of 
<br />
creation of the universe. It's just a matter of how it gets expressed 
<br />
when mitigating circumstances are specified. 
<br />
<br />Instead I again think of the balloon model. Place one dot on the 
<br />
surface of a balloon that is being inflated. Place another dot 90 
<br />
degrees away from it, also on the surface. As the balloon continues 
<br />
to inflate, the dots move away from each other. Although very 
<br />
primitive in description, this pretty much mirrors what seems to 
<br />
actually be happening to our universe. For simplicity of argument, 
<br />
I'm ignoring the dimensional movement of the individual dots relative 
<br />
to each other and which is not accounted for by inflation. However, I 
<br />
will consider the two individual dots, for the sake of argument,  
<br />
relative to what is happening to the balloon. 
<br />
<br />As the balloon inflates the dots move away from each other. So do the 
<br />
subatomic components of an individual dot. But the dots are moving 
<br />
away from each other at a very much faster rate than are the 
<br />
subatomic components of an individual dot moving away from each 
<br />
other. It is, as you pointed out, a phenomenon that is relative to 
<br />
volume. There is more volume involved between the 2 dots than there 
<br />
is between the components that make up one dot. It is easy to measure 
<br />
the apparent inflation velocity of the 2 dots relative to each other 
<br />
due to the huge amount of volume involved. But the volume difference 
<br />
is so great between the 2 dots as compared to the components that 
<br />
make up just one dot that we simply have not observed the  
<br />
drastically slowed but still occurring inflation being experienced 
<br />
within 1 dot. 
<br />
<br />Someone better than I am will have to do the calculations! But I am 
<br />
suggesting, based upon what I think is logic, that the amount of 
<br />
inflation occurring within one &#x201c;dot&#x201d; in the universe, relative to the 
<br />
amount of inflation assumed to be current for the entire universe, is 
<br />
going to result in a number that looks very familiar at the quantum  
<br />
level. And I&#x2019;m suggesting that the value for it changes over time 
<br />
because it is dependant upon how much inflation has occurred. And, I 
<br />
suggest that this changing value is what describes the inflationary 
<br />
rate of the universe as it continues to speed up. At some finite time 
<br />
in the future it will make itself obvious at the quantum level.  But 
<br />
for now entire galaxies are just too small in of themselves to fall 
<br />
apart, much less atomic particles! Not enough space/time volume 
<br />
involved! But given a distant yet finite time, in each case there 
<br />
will be, rather suddenly, enough volume involved. But it won't happen 
<br />
everywhere at the same time.
