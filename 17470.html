2009/8/24 Stathis Papaioannou &lt;stathisp.domain.name.hidden&gt;:
<br />
<br />I mentioned, in reply to you, that my own argument was essentially
<br />
equivalent to a broadly 'eastern' metaphysics.  I append below my own
<br />
summary of this perspective, in a somewhat compressed and 'neutral'
<br />
form that is, I think, agnostic to amplification in comp or non-comp
<br />
terms.  I daresay it will be somewhat less than transparent, but any
<br />
request for clarification will be met by urgent head-scratching and at
<br />
least the possibility of further elucidation.
<br />
<br />&quot;Monism analysed dualistically&quot;
<br />
<br />The following is an analysis of the 'quasi-dualistic' interaction
<br />
between 'mind' and 'matter' in terms of a notion of primitive,
<br />
monistic self-encounter:
<br />
<br />1) Such self-encounter is comprehensible as the self-relativisation of
<br />
a continuum that is hypothesised as: unique, contingently-existing,
<br />
self-accessible and ontologically-primitive.  It is postulated as &quot;all
<br />
that exists&quot;, in that any other sense of 'existence' whatsoever - e.g.
<br />
mental, material, mathematical - is deemed to parasitise on it in
<br />
terms of one or other, characteristically differentiated, internal
<br />
state of affairs.  It is thus postulated as a maximally parsimonious
<br />
sense of existence-for-self, any diminution of which would entail
<br />
'zombification': i.e. the exclusion of any possibility of knowledge.
<br />
<br />2) Within this universal context, self-encounter is postulated to
<br />
manifest as the mutual exchange, between reciprocally-relativised
<br />
differentiables, of a) perception; b) intention; and c) action; the
<br />
latter as the second-order derivative of a) and b) in the context of
<br />
'observation' (see below).
<br />
<br />3) The relations of perception, intention and action are available
<br />
immediately in context, with perception and intention functionally
<br />
polarised to the 'subjective' pole, and action to the 'objective'
<br />
pole.  The relation of action thus consists in 'observed' second-order
<br />
relations within a context now organised as relatively-differentiated
<br />
'content'.  'Functionally-polarised' should be understood in terms of
<br />
the emergence of 'subject' and 'object' as 'roles' played in the
<br />
overall gestalt of differentiated content-in-context.
<br />
<br />4) Of the foregoing relational categories, the second-order action
<br />
derivative is uniquely transferable between (purely
<br />
horizonally-defined) contexts, and hence can function as information,
<br />
pattern, or signal.  In this abstracted form, it is context-free, and
<br />
consequently undecipherable until reinstated in some context capable
<br />
of rendering it available for re-interpretation in terms of immediate
<br />
perception and intention.
<br />
<br />5) The functionally-polarised 'play of attention' between subject and
<br />
object poles constitutes the 'interaction' between the quasi-dualistic
<br />
ontic and epistemic domains, or between 'mind' and 'matter'.  Note the
<br />
reversal of the usual western categorisation - one *subsists* in terms
<br />
of mind (ontic) but one *observes* in terms of matter (epistemic).
<br />
<br />I think that the foregoing represents the essential elements of - for
<br />
example - the Vedantic perspective, or that of Plotinus, the Greek
<br />
philosopher perhaps most influenced by eastern thought.  It is
<br />
noteworthy, IMO, for taking seriously the mind-body distinction,
<br />
planting it firmly in a monistic context, but one which is internally
<br />
interpretable in quasi-dualistic terms.  It presupposes a qualitative
<br />
notion of instantiation which is locally accessible and yet
<br />
intrinsically non-transferable out-of-context.  Furthermore, it both
<br />
reverses and collapses the western dichotomy of consciousness as
<br />
epistemic and material as ontic, by grounding both as aspects of a
<br />
single category.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Having said all this, it is interesting to reconsider your formulation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;the brain did its thing without us understanding it, creating its own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; context&quot;.  What is it about *being* the brain that causes this context
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to be self-referentially available, but hides it beyond possibility of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; recovery from 'observation'?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Whether it can be hidden beyond the *possibility* of recovery is an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interesting question. Certainly it would be very difficult to figure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; out what an alien brain is thinking about from observation, like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cracking a very difficult code, but could it be made so that it's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; impossible to figure out? We would be able to figure out something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about an alien code, such as a written language, by observing various
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; regularities, but we would be unable to figure out the actual meaning
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of words unless we had some extra-language information; that is, we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could figure out the syntax, but not the semantics. Similarly with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain, we might be able to figure out certain patterns and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; regularities, but without further information obtained by connecting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I/O devices or perhaps by obtaining the instruction manuals, we would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have no idea what the brain activity means, let alone what it feels
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like from the brain's point of view. But would it be possible for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain's activity to be deliberately obscured such that not even the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; syntax can be guessed at, the equivalent of encryption using a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one-time pad?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
