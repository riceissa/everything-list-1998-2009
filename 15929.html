Hi,
<br />
THis is my third post in this group. The other three were about four
<br />
years ago, when this list was allocated in eskimo.org. Here an then I
<br />
knew Bruno and some others. In the meantime,  I remained deeply
<br />
interested in life, the universe and everythng, and this is literal,
<br />
because I remained convinced that life, and the phenomenon that
<br />
generates it, Evolution with Natural Selection, is the key to
<br />
understand the concrete nature of the mathematical universe in which
<br />
we live.  For this reason I have been learning about evolution, and
<br />
deeply related phenomena such are the real nature of enthropy and
<br />
computation.
<br />
<br />Now I thing that I have my puzzle starting to be completed. It is not
<br />
all of my own. I just mix pieces, but I think that no one has
<br />
formulated it before in clear terms by mixing these pieces togeter.
<br />
Let me share something I wrote not much time ago. Sorry for the
<br />
extension:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://ilevolucionista.blogspot.com/2008/09/entrophy-arrow-of-time-and-life.html">http://ilevolucionista.blogspot.com/2008/09/entrophy-arrow-of-time-and-life.html</a>
<br />
<br />The Arrow of time is, at last, a common subjective experience
<br />
experimented by living beings. According with the laws of physics,
<br />
time is just a dimension.. or not even that . The solutions of the
<br />
equations of General Relativity are cuasy arbitrary four dimensional
<br />
manifolds.where time is just a local dimension. That is, can be
<br />
approximately suppossed that in a certain point, the time  could be
<br />
considered as a dimension, but the direction of this dimension can
<br />
change from point to point. Superstring theory suggest even more
<br />
bizarre 11-dimensional, geometrical figures. No intuition about the
<br />
arrow of time or any other subjective experience can be extracted from
<br />
phisical theories.
<br />
<br />The only natural law that lthat links with subjective experience is
<br />
the anthropic principle applied to life in general. Life imposes
<br />
strong restrictions in the particular form that our Universe (or
<br />
portion of Universe) has in the infinite sea of optional solutions of
<br />
General Relativity and String Theory. These restrictions also applies
<br />
to the initial conditions. of this universe. The observed increase of
<br />
entropy with time in our visible universe means that it started with a
<br />
very improbable configuration. But this reasoning is circular: If we
<br />
try to elucidate what really is the arrow of time, we can not use
<br />
concepts that presupose a certain direction of the arrow of time !!
<br />
<br />The quesition, reformulated in strict physical terms is as such: In
<br />
the four or eleven-dimensional manifold described by the equations of
<br />
relativty or the superstring theory respectively, why our lifes
<br />
follows a line from less to more probable configurations of matter,
<br />
that is, from less to more entrophy, that is, from less microstates to
<br />
more microstates for each observable state?. Why ?
<br />
<br />This last view in terms of micro-states is the key for the
<br />
explanation: causes are in the side of less microstates. Effects are
<br />
in the side of more microstates, because there are less causes than
<br />
effects. In the other side, life is all about prediction of the
<br />
future. An organism can not make use of the environment for its own
<br />
ends if he can not predict what will follow at the chemical,
<br />
biological, instinctive or rational levels. Computationally, it is
<br />
much more easy to simulate the evolution of a system where entrophy
<br />
increse than in the opposite direction. The precision demanded for a
<br />
reverse simulation is much higuer: The calculus of the fragmentation
<br />
of a glass is not very difficult. Essentially, the results are not
<br />
very different using a precission or another. But a reverse simuation
<br />
from a broken glass never will reach the re-composition of the glass,
<br />
no matter how precise the measure of the real position of the pieces
<br />
from a real case were introduced in the simulation.
<br />
<br />But the fact is that in our univese, glasses do recompose themselves,
<br />
the flame of the candles do recombines liberating oxygen and make grow
<br />
the candle, objects lighter than water sink. Why? because these events
<br />
exist in our space time; Just go in the reverse time dimension in our
<br />
space-time manifold  to see them. The laws of physics permits them.
<br />
They are just reversible chemical reactions, reversible object
<br />
collisions at the particle or macroscopic level.
<br />
<br />In terms of our perception of time, the outcomes we see happens just
<br />
because they are cuasi-infinitely probable and the reverse
<br />
counterparts, cuasi infinitely improbalbe. But, that is also an
<br />
illlusion of the arrow of time, because , In terms of time-agnostic
<br />
spacetime manifold reasoning, our life vector in space-time go along
<br />
the increase of entrophy, not the other way around. That is: the
<br />
outcomes of probability laws are a consequience of our trajectory in
<br />
space time. Why our life follow this direction?. The reason is
<br />
computational, as I said before.
<br />
<br />The essence of life is to identify risks and opportunities, that is,
<br />
to identify causes to react accordingly in order to achive efffects
<br />
that permit survival and reproduction, while maintaining the internal
<br />
disorder controlled. This happens at all levels of life. From the
<br />
chemical to the neuronal level, the living beings look at the present
<br />
to predict the effects in the phisical direction of entropy increase.
<br />
life can not operate in other but in such direction, because this is
<br />
the computable direction.
<br />
<br />Computation is done at all levels. chemically a cell computes by
<br />
generating proteins triggered by an stimulus, these proteins will aid
<br />
the cell to cope with what will come nest, either engulf food in the
<br />
protoplasma and diggest it or to expell toxins to scape from a
<br />
predator. For this reason life chooses the esasy path in the universe-
<br />
manifold: because computationally it is easier.
