Hi, Bardia.  Welcome, although I haven't participated much here myself
<br />
lately.  I've been too busy following my heart, although these
<br />
discussions also do touch on something down deep for me.  I'll comment
<br />
briefly off the top of my head, but hopefully from my heart.
<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am new to this discussion forum and have not studied all of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discourses and have a few questions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) have you guys contemplated the various recorded creation myths of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the world and do you think that in any way has relevancy to the quest?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br /><br />I am &quot;a theist&quot; (two words ;) although not the type that people
<br />
usually think of nowadays.  More of a mystico-theistic mathematician,
<br />
and yet I come up with the same math as everyone else!  How does that
<br />
happen?  LOL. I've talked some in the past on here about how
<br />
theological intuitions might relate to these topics.  Maybe you can
<br />
search for those posts.
<br />
<br />&quot;Quest&quot; is a good word.  I think a good question to ask everyone here
<br />
would be &quot;Why are you here?&quot;  That question was asked in the movie
<br />
&quot;Wanted&quot;, the answer was &quot;I don't know who I am.&quot;  I think that answer
<br />
touches on a key aspect of why we search for the truth, the ultimate
<br />
truth whatever that might mean and be.  The fact that the mind/body
<br />
problem still remains at the core of this quest for the truth about
<br />
everything, after all these centuries, millenia, is telling.  Are we
<br />
any closer because of science?  I doubt it.  But if science hasn't
<br />
helped, that isn't all bad (unless we deny it), because the good news
<br />
is that we are no further away.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) I see that at least one person has studied ancient thought
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Plotinus) and consequently the theory of emanation. Can a theory of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; primary etherealized matter, a first matter of the universe, which may
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or may not be the stuff of dreams or mind (as some view it), be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; blended with a type of big bang theory. Some take the cyclical theory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the ancients and blend it with big bang theory. Theories root
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaning is &quot;to view&quot;... what do you guy's think of this mental view
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and do you believe that something like it could be possible to:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A primary &quot;spiritual big bang&quot; or expansion, or emanation...... of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rarefied, subtle, etherealized, sublimated form of matter..... in some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way, perhaps an aspect of it, condensing or materializing and then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perhaps compacting and contracting into a multiplicity of intermediary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; points that enact or give rise to the process we call the physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;big bangs&quot; of the empricical universe or multiverses. Something like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that, perhaps some one can articulate that possibility much more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; elaborately and reasonably.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br /><br />I like the idea of emanation.  From the Source/One out to us all and
<br />
we in turn relate back (see below on love).  Ignoring all the
<br />
fundamental religious dogma/insistence on how/when the initial
<br />
emanation took place (e.g. 6000 years ago), Genesis does paint of
<br />
picture of existence springing from a formless void.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3) What do you guy's believe the place of this power, force, energy,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; feeling, experience of love has. If you look at your lives and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; literary inheritance, you may see that some people at some times, have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; had extraordinary experiences of universal love, of a love for there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; total experience, of all the nature and animals and humans and things
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they perceive, or a feeling of vast and expansive love for humanity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and life which they call peak experiences and the highlights of there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; life, the most important and greatest moments. What place does love
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have in the movement of any theoretical system or supersystem. What do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we say about love?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let us not forget to draw a deep line between belief and knowledge.
</em><br />
<br /><br />First, so where do you draw the line between belief and knowledge?  It
<br />
deepens on what you mean by knowledge.  May I suggest that the modern
<br />
view, which sprang out of part of the Greek view, is not the only form
<br />
of knowledge that may be helpful in finding truth?  Knowledge which
<br />
has a definition based on utility doesn't really get us very far on
<br />
our quest.  One illustration that knowledge doesn't have to have such
<br />
a narrow view as the scientific view is that to the ancient Hebrews
<br />
the word &quot;to know&quot; was used also to refer to what we call &quot;making
<br />
love&quot;, which goes to your question.  And the believers in a personal
<br />
God believe that God is love, which is more than a sentimental quote
<br />
from a Hallmark card if you really think about the implications to
<br />
everything.
<br />
<br />You say:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yet one writer tackles this question by asserting: &quot;Consciousness implies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; limitations and qualifications; something to be conscious of, and someone to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be conscious of it. But Absolute Consciousness contains the cognizer, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thing cognized and the cognition, all three in itself and all three *one.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *Presumably, from the writers standpoint, whatever she is talking about, if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anything, is arrived at or realized through some form of &quot;meditation&quot; as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something to be experienced. Cannot verify having no basis in such an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; alleged and possibly possible experience
</em><br />
<br /><br />When we are seeking the &quot;truth&quot; about everything are we not in some
<br />
way acting on an urge to fully know who we are, so we can fully live
<br />
who we are?  And we have this intuition that this is possible.  We
<br />
feel somehow separated from who we are, or were meant to be.  We have
<br />
an intuition that if we really knew fully, then we would not be caught
<br />
in this sense of otherness, but we would &quot;live abundantly&quot; (as someone
<br />
famous once said).  We would be in a love relationship with the
<br />
Absolute Consciousness.  Interesting the &quot;all three in itself and all
<br />
three one&quot;, the Cognizer, the Cognized and the Cognition, reminds me
<br />
of the three Persons of the Trinity, respectively. ;)
<br />
<br />Tom
