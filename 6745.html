<br />RM: Obviously it will be difficult to quantify the term &quot;lucky,&quot; but some 
<br />
people do win regularly at roulette.  Some also win the lottery, a very 
<br />
*lucky* few more than once.  Then there was the kite-maker who was in 
<br />
Hiroshima during the bombing who then drove home to tell his wife about 
<br />
it---in Nagasaki (unlucky). One can always cite &quot;perfectly ordinary and 
<br />
expected random fluctuations,&quot; for just about any event.  Reliance on 
<br />
&quot;perfectly ordinary and expected random fluctuations&quot; is fine if you 
<br />
establish your criteria for significance---the statistician Fisher set it 
<br />
at 1 in 20 (p&lt;0.05---and if we're doing multiple correlations, then we use 
<br />
the Bonferroni adjustment &lt;&lt;<a href="http://home.clara.net/sisa/bonhlp.htm">http://home.clara.net/sisa/bonhlp.htm</a>&gt;&gt;.  So, I 
<br />
guess this is a good place to ask: what is your criteria for significance 
<br />
for the type of experiment I suggest?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;LC: If there were, don't you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;think that it would pay the casinos to find these people and keep
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;them from playing?
</em><br />
<br />RM:  Objection. Calls for speculation. I don't operate a casino, so I 
<br />
really don't know what business decisions they may make.  In fact, I'm fine 
<br />
NOT knowing what business decisions they make.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;LC: And why haven't the psychics been all over
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this?
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;RM:  More speculation.  Please define &quot;psychic.&quot;  If you're including the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;engineers like Robert Jahn (formerly) with the PEAR lab, I suspect he--and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;others there have looked into it.  If you're including Madame Leanne down 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;on Chartres Street in New Orleans, then, no--I don't think she cares one 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;way or the other.  She's probably more interested in black cats, incense, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;money and that sort of thing.  If you're including Rupert Sheldrake in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this category, then I'd probably have to ask you *why* you've included 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;him.  *Psychic* covers a lot of territory.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;As for the term &quot;all over&quot; (sorry, I got this from my editors) you'll 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probably have to explain yourself on this one too.  The inference seems to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;suggest that all the psychics--including Madame Leanne, Jahn, Sheldrake, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;et al--are banding together, marching down some street, banner held high 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with----*something* written on it.  Maybe: &quot;Luck is real and demonstrable 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;at the p&lt;0.0005 level.&quot;  I don't recall seeing anything of the sort, so, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;by those critera, I guess I shouldn't try that experiment, eh?  Gee.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;LC: Besides, there are plenty of scientists who'd lust *jove*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to prove this.
</em><br />
RM (embarking on an extended rant that only *appears* to be off the 
<br />
subject, but actually addresses the criteria many scientists use in 
<br />
choosing what to investigate):
<br />
<br />Yes.  But *only* if some agency blurts out funding for it.  Why did Texas 
<br />
A&amp;M scientists spend months studying how to turn lead into gold?  Because 
<br />
someone *paid* them to do it.  Actually, there's a much better smoking 
<br />
gun:  The investigation of the WTC Surge Clouds.
<br />
<br />Remember the 9-11 dust clouds that roared up the street at 35 mph?   They 
<br />
choked everyone in sight with a mix of pH10.0 (Drano strength) Portland 
<br />
cement, mercury, tiny bits of Am241 (from hundreds of smoke detectors at 1 
<br />
uCi each)-
<br />
<br />Now, as a scientist, I'm sure you are aware that NIOSH and OSHA set 
<br />
standards for exposure that are given in milligrams per cubic meter.  There 
<br />
is even such a standard for particulate---including respirable particulate 
<br />
(such as was in the aforementioned dust cloud.)  Now, for the past four 
<br />
years there have been hundreds of academic &quot;exposure experts&quot; slogging away 
<br />
at this exposure issue, but I cannot recall reading where anyone (EPA, 
<br />
NIOSH, anyone at Rutgers) ever published what the density of that dust 
<br />
cloud was in milligrams per cubic meter.  Maybe they did, and IF they did, 
<br />
three cheers for them!   But I don't think it's ever been done by any of 
<br />
these smart guys.
<br />
<br />If there are &quot;plenty&quot; of scientists working on the WTC dust cloud 
<br />
exposures, and they still haven't told us what the density of that dust 
<br />
cloud was, at, say, Church street in NYC on that bad day, then how can we 
<br />
expect these same guys to even consider exploring something as mundane as 
<br />
what I suggested in an earlier post?
<br />
<br />Sorry to all for the long-winded reply.  Anyone here care to try their hand 
<br />
at guessing what the average density of the WTC surge clouds were?   Be the 
<br />
first on the Net with an answer. ---Unless, of course, you can find it in 
<br />
the documents--which, IF you can---you'd be. . .well, *lucky.*  And I, of 
<br />
course, will humbly eat parbroiled crow and apologize to those hard-working 
<br />
environmental scientists over at the EPA and NIOSH and OSHA---and even 
<br />
those guys at Rutgers.
<br />
<br />Bottom line:  Many scientists fail to study things not because it's worth 
<br />
studying, but because no one drops a wad of $1000 bills on their desk 
<br />
beforehand---and agrees to build a new Faculty Lounge over the old tritium 
<br />
&quot;storage&quot; pit behind the maintenance shed.
