<em class="quotelev1">&gt; SP: 'using the term &quot;comp&quot; as short for &quot;computationalism&quot; as something 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; picked up from Bruno. On the face of it, computationalism seems quite 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sensible: the best theory of consciousness and the most promising 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; candidate for producing artificial intelligence/consciousness'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is what I thought 'comp' meant. My approach to this is to adhere, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as much as possible, to plain and simple English. Not being a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'mathematician' I stick with my type of sceptical method. To me this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does not seem deeply problematic although is does of course limit the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scope of conversations I can participate in. As far as I can see, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno's grand scheme depends on 'assume', like the economists do. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Unfortunately that which is assumed remains, I believe, unprovable. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Furthermore there are deep, common sense, problems which undermine all 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; these theories of universal emulation possibilities, never mind those 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; potentially lethal :-) teleporting/fax holidays and cryogenic time shifts.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The biggest hurdle is the requirement for infinite computing ability. 
</em><br />
<br />Remember that Bruno is a logician.  When he writes &quot;infinite&quot; he really means infinite - not &quot;really, really big&quot; as physicists do.  Almost all numbers are bigger than 10^120, which is the biggest number that appears in physics (and it's wrong).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is simply the recognition that all measurements are approximations 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so the teleporter/fax machine could only ever send an approximate copy 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of me to whatever destination duty or holiday dreamings might lead me. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Still, it is probable that I, as subjective experiencer, would not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; notice most anomalies, particularly if trying to fill in the temporal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; gaps caused by Bruno's gratuitous delays in reading me back out of his 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; archive :-)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This limitation hits all the 'Matrix' type scenarios as well: the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emulation system would require essentially infinite computing capacity 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to reproduce any useful world that a real person inhabits. If on the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other hand the Matrix is only concerned to make A world, its virtual 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality inhabitants might be sustained [I am admitting this as a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possibility] until they started engaging in real science. As I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand things the denizens of a Matrix type world would start to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; find real anomalies in their 'reality' unless the matrix machine could 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; operate at a fineness of resolution unattainable by any experimental 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; method the matrixians could devise. There would be much less, or even no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem at all if they were all believers in 'Intelligent Design' of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; course. [I can put that very rudely as: the problem is not 'If our mind 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; were simple enough to understand then we would be too dumb to understand 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it' but rather 'If Intelligent Design were really true then we have been 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; designed to be so dumb that it really doesn't matter!']
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Re &quot;Platonic objects&quot; - I think this is illusory. The numbers that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; people write down and think about are words in the language/s of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logico-mathematics. They do what they do because they are defined as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such but they do not exist apart from the systems which generate and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; record them - by which I mean brains, blackboards and computers, etc... 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The regularities, and exciting facts people discover about them are just 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that, regularities and exciting facts about languages. I don't mean that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in any derogatory sense. We live largely BY MEANS OF our languages and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certainly our cultural lives as human beings would be impossible without 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; language in the general and inclusive senses. But the universe is not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; made out of languages, it just exists - for the moment at least.
</em><br />
<br />I incline to this view.  I agree that the Platonic objects of mathematics are inventions or language - but so are our models based on material particles.  An electron is almost (but maybe not quite) as abstract an invention as the number two.  
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [NB: it just occurs to me that certain G/goddists will say that the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe is made out of the mind of G/god/s which could perhaps be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; included as a or THE language of existence. To be 'perfect' however, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this would need to be allowed to have infinite recursion, i.e. ''made 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; out of(made out of(made out of(made out of ... -&gt; inf ... ))). As far as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I can see however this would amount to an assertion of many layered 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; uncertainty and/or a Heraclitan in-falling in the direction of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; smallwards due to the necessity of each layer of divinity maintaining 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; omniscience, omnipotence, and so for, over and under its 'turf'. As this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has the minimalist effect of underpinning either standard model QM, etc. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or something like the Process Physics advocated by Colin Hales and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; friends [which I find attractive], all is well with the world. :-]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But, seriously, all this stuff about 'supervening' and so forth is all 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; based on the Cartesian assumption that mind-stuff has no physical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; extension. Well the Inquisition is no longer the authority or power base 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that it was and empirical science has moved on. I think the onus is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; falling ever more heavily on those who deny the identity of mind and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain to explain WHY they still do so. The 'distinction' between 1st and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3rd person view points is simply raw fact. 
</em><br />
<br />I think of it as a failure of communication.  My brain must communicate with your brain through the medium of language, which is inadequate to convey qualia.  But maybe if we could directly &quot;wire&quot; our brains together you could feel my qualia.
