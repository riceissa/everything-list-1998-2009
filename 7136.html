<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hi everyone (in this world and all relevantly similar ones :-),
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Welcome to the list Brian. Thanks for the link to Alexander R  Pruss' 
<br />
web page, which seems quite interesting (and which I will comment a 
<br />
little bit too, here or in a next post).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I like the solution to the Induction / Dragon / Exploding Cow problem 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that I see in work by Malcolm, Standish, Tegmark, and Schmidhuber.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />It is equivalent to the &quot;white rabbit problem&quot; we talk indeed about, 
<br />
all along this list, and which is *almost* &quot;solved&quot; in my phd thesis 
<br />
(to be short). May I attract  your attention to it by referring you to 
<br />
my web page? <a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/</a>
<br />
<br />It is a good occasion to sum up the main differences and the main 
<br />
similarities between Standish, Schmidhuber, Lewis, Tegmark, Levy,  
<br />
Ruhl, Mitra, Mazer, Finney, ... and my own. All approach are indeed 
<br />
form of modal realism, and this is indeed what the everything-list is 
<br />
all about.
<br />
<br />Now I want to be short and I apology in advance for some 
<br />
oversimplification, and please, any of you, don't hesitate to correct 
<br />
me.
<br />
<br />To simplify the comparison I think it could be useful to compare them 
<br />
from their ontology and their epistemology, and the way they tackle the 
<br />
&quot;Dragon&quot; problem.
<br />
<br />Finney, for example, (a pillar of the list) borrows Bostrom's notion of 
<br />
&quot;observer-moment&quot; (OM). He argues they are fundamental, and its &quot;modal 
<br />
realism&quot; consists to accept or postulate *all observer-moments*
<br />
Then he borrows a computationalist hypothesis from Schmidhuber, and 
<br />
associates to each OM a finite binary strings.
<br />
Then he tackles the dragon problem by attaching to those binary 
<br />
string/OM their Kolmogorov complexity from which he infers a absolute 
<br />
measure. Little strings will have higher measure, and this should make 
<br />
the dragon disappearing through Bostrom Self-sampling assumption SSA, 
<br />
taken in some absolute version of it: ASSA.
<br />
My critics: OM are described by Bostrom as first person subjective 
<br />
construct, and it is not clear how they can or should be related to the 
<br />
strings, in such a way that we can make personal prediction. The dragon 
<br />
disappear, but then in one second I will be a bacteria!
<br />
<br />Schmidhuber postulates a &quot;big programmer&quot; which runs all programs. He 
<br />
postulates some universe and he postulates the possible universes are 
<br />
computational objects. Then he try to find some prior explaining the 
<br />
importance of short programs at the origin of one universe capable of 
<br />
sustaining self-aware structure like us.
<br />
My critics: there are simply no notion of first person available. 
<br />
Worst, Schmidhuber is obliged to postulate some totally unknown 
<br />
physical reality. So the epistemology is empty and the ontology is 
<br />
unknowable, though, according guessable (this is quite close to 
<br />
traditional physicalism).
<br />
<br />Tegmark, in his first paper, suggest the existence of ALL Mathematical 
<br />
Structures. This is ontologically much interesting than Schmidhuber 
<br />
frame, imo. Unfortunately it is too big, and Tegmark seems not to know 
<br />
the failure of all mathematician to capture all of mathematics 
<br />
mathematically. I have discussed elsewhere in the list, at lenght, some 
<br />
cardinality problem related to Tegmarkian approaches. In Tegmark there 
<br />
is an embryo of distinction between first and third person point of 
<br />
view, but it is either vague, or locally clear only under the 
<br />
assumption of QM, but then it is exactly the (very interesting) 
<br />
difference between the subjective and objective knowledge already 
<br />
introduced in Everett basic papers. The mind body problem is still 
<br />
under the rug.
<br />
<br />Both Tegmark ande Schmidhuber assumes unclear relaltion between 
<br />
observer and universe, which in general presuppose Aristotle theory of 
<br />
&quot;substance&quot;.
<br />
<br />In that regard, epistemologically, Malcolm has the same physicalist 
<br />
attitude. He describes quite clearly three sort of *physical* 
<br />
&quot;theories&quot;, having in their intended model (in logician's sense) either 
<br />
one universe toward having all logically possible universe, and he 
<br />
defends, quite convincingly (imo) that last sort of theories. But he 
<br />
discusses to quicky the relation between universe and information so 
<br />
that I cannot really say more.
<br />
Main critics: the approach relies to much on some aristotelian notion 
<br />
of universe, and the 1-3 distinction is not really tackled.
<br />
<br />Standish is not yet enough clear about its assumptions, but seems to 
<br />
get a pretty derivation of schroedinger equation, which is an 
<br />
improvement. He does assume time, with the topology of the reals, which 
<br />
is my main critics. The 1-3 distinction is present and used in an 
<br />
anthropic way, but I have not yet understood it precisely.
<br />
<br />George Levy is completely aware of the 1-3 distinction, and makes the 
<br />
1-person at the origin of a purely first person &quot;plenitude&quot;. Well, so 
<br />
much that it is not clear for me if the plenitude is really suited for 
<br />
being described in a 3-person theory, and this explains some its 
<br />
silence in the list.
<br />
<br />Note that some people, like Wei Dai, the list's master, but also late 
<br />
James Higgo, have oscillate between approaches. Notably on the Absolute 
<br />
versus Relative SSA. This is a key distinction. Saibal Mitra defends 
<br />
the absolute version and Jesse Mazer a relative one. Mazer is quite 
<br />
aware of the 1-3 distinction and of the necessity of having a theory of 
<br />
consciousness to solve the dragon problem (which is what I have 
<br />
developed).
<br />
<br />Sorry for being short, and probably unfair, and unclear, but I must go 
<br />
now. In a nutshell my approach is quite different. I take seriously the 
<br />
1-3 distinction and I propose a proof that if we take the hypothesis 
<br />
that &quot;we&quot; (or I) are digitalizable entities, then ontologically there 
<br />
is no primitive physical universe (no big 3-everything), and 
<br />
epistemologically the appearance of physics must be recovered from, let 
<br />
us say, the gap between computer science and computer's computer 
<br />
science. that gap is well described by the mdoal logic of 
<br />
self-reference (Solovay), which makes it possible to translate the 
<br />
proof in the language of (any) sufficiently rich (I say &quot;Lobian) 
<br />
machine. From this I can infer that the logic of physical proposition 
<br />
obeys some precise modal logic of Lewis-Stalnaker counterfactuals, and 
<br />
to show they agreed until now with quantum logics. Weakness: highly 
<br />
technical (the &quot;dragon problem&quot; is transformed in an arithmetical 
<br />
renormalization theory) and to much  counter-intuitive for the average 
<br />
aristotelian naturalist. But note it is quite &quot;natural&quot; (pun!) for the 
<br />
Pythagoreans, the Platonist, and some neoplatonist like Plotinus.
<br />
<br />I will add comments later and I will try to be more precise, and also 
<br />
to comment your conversation with Alexander Pruss. About Lewis I love 
<br />
its &quot;counterfactuals&quot;. In the last edition he corrects some of its 
<br />
argument against seeing worlds as &quot;maximal consistent extensions&quot; like 
<br />
in my thesis, and then thanks to a paper by Hardegree (ref in my 
<br />
thesis) this makes quite close my approach with his.
<br />
<br />Actually I think it would be quite useful if, like we have done 
<br />
&quot;joining post&quot;, each of us could summarize its own approach in a 
<br />
reasonably short post. The present post was just for showing you the 
<br />
richness of the our hunting-dragon in the everything (modal) landscape.
<br />
<br />If only pointing to David Lewis could motivate the people here to 
<br />
invest a little more in ... (modal) logic ;)
<br />
