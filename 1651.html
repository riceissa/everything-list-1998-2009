<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) There is solipsism, sometimes called &quot;subjective idealism&quot;. It is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (as James Higgo said) the doctrine that I am dreaming, that I am the only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; builder of reality, and all other people are just zombie.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is a ridiculous doctrine, although it can be used to illustrate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some philophical point, like the concept of zombie.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is a ridiculous doctrine, because a doctrine is something you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; communicate, and why should someone try to communicate things to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; zombie. So solipsisme (like some strong form of positivism) is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-defeating.
</em><br />
<br />I don't agree that this is a ridiculous doctrine, or that a believer in
<br />
solipsism should not communicate.
<br />
<br />A solipsist may communicate with others, even if he believes they are
<br />
not conscious, in order to get information and ideas.  In his model of
<br />
the world, certain information comes to him only through interaction
<br />
with the outside.  If he is to work out his ideas in fullness, he can
<br />
best do so by interacting with the outside world.  This may involve
<br />
bouncing ideas off of other people, and even trying to persuade them,
<br />
in order to test the quality of his ideas.
<br />
<br />It is like a believer in more conventional philosophies who finds it
<br />
useful to write his ideas down on paper (or on a computer), in order to
<br />
clarify them and look for problems and new approaches.  He doesn't think
<br />
the paper or computer is conscious, but this method of interacting with
<br />
the outside world can still be productive.
<br />
<br />The real problem with solipsism, IMO, is that it fails to predict or
<br />
explain why the world is the way it is.  Fine, I'm dreaming.  Why?
<br />
Why am I dreaming that I live in a lawful universe?  And why do I have
<br />
dreams within the dream, and those dreams are not of a lawful universe?
<br />
None of this is explained.
<br />
<br />Contrast this with other approaches to philosophy, such as the all-
<br />
universes models we have been discussing.  These approaches have the
<br />
potential to truly explain why the universe is lawful, and why we see
<br />
things in roughly the way they are.  It might even turn out that our
<br />
very universe is, by some measures, the most probable one to exist.
<br />
<br />We don't know for sure that things will work out this way, but at
<br />
least the potential is there.  This makes it a very productive avenue
<br />
to explore.  It is hard to see how solipsism could begin to provide this
<br />
kind of explanation.
