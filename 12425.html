<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 1. The implementation problem: everything can implement a computation 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; if you look at it the right way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Normally this is of no consequence - mapping the vibration of atoms in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a rock to a word processing program would be at least as difficult as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; building a conventional computer and writing the software for it - but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; if computations can be conscious, then the conscious computations are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; hiding all around us.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here I disagree. This has never been proved, except that in quantum 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; field theory a case can be developed for justifying that the quantum 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; vacuum quantum-simulates the whole quantum multiverse. But this has 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nothing to do with comp. It is true with any realistic non collapse 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interpretation of Quantum Mechanics. Actually it less a problem for a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computationalist because this is equivalent to some homogeneous 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; addition of universal dovetailer &quot;everywhere&quot; (if that exists, which is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not even the case). There is no reason this would change any relative 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and internal measure. But with my argument, anything physical, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; including the vacuum, is emergent from the dreams, so there is no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Putnam-Chalmers-Mallah problem for comp. I explained this to Jacques 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mallah some years ago.
</em><br />
<br />(BTW, John Searle can be added to the list of people who discussed this question).
<br />
<br />I wonder if we are talking about the same thing, because it doesn't seem to me that 
<br />
an empirical proof is needed to show that any physical process could be seen as 
<br />
implementing any computation. For example, it is no problem if the physical process 
<br />
under consideration lacks a sufficient number of distinct states, because the one 
<br />
state can be reused to perform as many computations in parallel as you want, in the 
<br />
same way as a certain value in a given computer processor register will be the same 
<br />
in the course of countless possible computations. Of course this is completely useless 
<br />
as far as practical computation goes because to keep track of random 1's and 0's 
<br />
which, looked at the right way, are implementing a word processing program, you 
<br />
need to write the program and implement it on a conventional computer to keep track 
<br />
of everything. It is like saying that a page covered in ink contains any given text: true 
<br />
in a trivial sense, useless as far as helping you write a letter goes. However, what if 
<br />
computation can give rise to consciousness? This would be like saying, what if a particular 
<br />
page of text were conscious? You would still need to remove all the unnecessary ink in 
<br />
order to read and perhaps interact with the text, but if you just left it alone it would 
<br />
still be conscious, dreaming away on the black page. One argument against this idea is 
<br />
that it is not enough to leave the computation (or the text) hidden in randomness, because 
<br />
it is only through interaction with the environment that consciousness manifests and only 
<br />
conventional brains and computers can interact with the environment. But this excludes the 
<br />
possibility that the conscious entity is dreaming or interacting with a virtual reality, isolated 
<br />
from the substrate of its implementation due to the impenetrable randomness.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 2. The Maudlin/Marchal argument showing that even if you specify that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a computer must handle counterfactuals in order to avoid the &quot;trivial&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; conclusion (1), you end up concluding that physical processes are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; irrelevant to consciousness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You (BM) think that (1) is absurd but (2) is OK; Maudlin thinks that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (1) and (2) are both absurd, and that therefore computationalism is a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; flawed theory. You would like to keep computationalism but drop the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; computers, i.e. the supervenience thesis. I am not certain which I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; would rather drop: computationalism or the idea of disembodied 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; consciousness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am quite willing to drop comp, once I get a real flaw. Now I have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; almost never take seriously the supervenience thesis, if only because 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it leads to an insoluble problem (more or less the one called 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;mind-body&quot; problem in the literature). Also, one of my motivation 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; since the beginning is to get an explanation for the appearance of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter. Physicists have developed, through Aristotelian philosophy, a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; methodology for progressing without addressing that question. It has 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; been a powerful methodological idea, but it is flawful for those who 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ask themselves what is the nature of matter. I am worried how much it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has been easy for physicist to accept pure non sense like wave collapse 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or Bohr unrealistic attitude. It works for building ships and bombs, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not for getting a better understanding of what happen.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; It is quite possible, for example, that there is something special 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; about the structure of the brain which leads to consciousness, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; a &gt; digital computer will not be able to copy this, even if it copies 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; 3rd &gt; person observable behaviour. Against that idea is the question 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; of why &gt; we didn't evolve to be zombies, but maybe we would have if 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; nature had &gt; electronic circuits to play with.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; You are saying that zombie are possible if comp is false. I can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; agree. Actually I believe that comp entails the existence of a notion 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; of local zombie (which can make you believe that they are conscious 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; during a time).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; If I had to guess between comp and not-comp I don't think I could 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; do &gt; better than flipping a coin.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Comp is my working hypothesis, and I tend to consider that arguing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; for or against comp is a bit of a waste of time (especially given 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; that comp is undecidable for machines).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Still I am astonished that you would flip a coin on that matter. Comp 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; is just the statement that &quot;I&quot; am turing emulable at some level. Even 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; if we have to emulate the quantum state of the entire galaxy (some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;generalized brain&quot;) comp remain true unless we have both:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; - my brain = the &quot;complete physical&quot; description of the galaxy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; - the &quot;object&quot; galaxy is not turing emulable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It is possible to drop computationalism and keep a form of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; functionalism, without introducing magical effects or even any new 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; physics. For example, it is possible that consciousness is a property 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of actual neuronal activity, and although you might be able to emulate 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; this activity using a digital computer, even to the point where you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; can build a substitute brain that behaves just like the biological 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; equivalent, it won't be conscious.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; In order to build a proper replacement brain you would have to copy 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the actual physical structure of the neurons, not just emulate them. I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; am not sure that I believe this theory but it is theoretically 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; possible.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes of course. But there is nothing new here. Even comp itself forces 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; us (the machine) to find non-comp plausible. I mean comp can be false. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My main technical point is that comp is even falsifiable, given that it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; gives the laws of physics. The UDA does not only show that physics 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emerges from numbers, it show exactly how physics emerges from numbers. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The comp-physics is entirely determined by the relations between 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; numbers. I thought in my youth that comp would be refuted. Now that I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have make progress (in my thesis) on the comp-physics, I am less sure. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Indeed, where the logic of physics should occur through the relation 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between numbers, I get non trivial arithmetical quantum logics.
