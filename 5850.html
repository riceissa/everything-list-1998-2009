<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sometimes there is ambiguity about how to count worlds, for example in

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the many worlds interpretation of QM.  There are many examples of QM

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;theory should fail.
</em><br />
<br />I'm not sure what examples you have in mind here, but this is actually the 
<br />
general point I was trying to make: probability theory doesn't seem to work 
<br />
the same way in a many worlds cosmology, due to complications such as 
<br />
observers multiplying and then not being able to access the entire 
<br />
probability space after the event of interest.
<br />
<br />Consider these three examples:
<br />
<br />(A) In a single world cosmology, I claim that using my magic powers, I have 
<br />
bestowed on you, and you alone, the ability to pick the winning numbers in 
<br />
this week's lottery. If you then buy a lottery ticket and win the first 
<br />
prize, I think it would be reasonable to concede that there was probably 
<br />
some substance to my claim (if not magic powers, then at least an effective 
<br />
way of cheating).
<br />
<br />(B) In a single world cosmology, I announce that using my magic powers, I 
<br />
have bestowed on some lucky gambler the ability to pick the winning numbers 
<br />
in this week's lottery. Now, someone does in fact win the first prize this 
<br />
week, but that is not surprising, because there is almost always at least 
<br />
one winner each week. I cannot reasonably claim to have helped the winner 
<br />
unless I had somehow tagged him or otherwise uniquely identified him before 
<br />
the lottery was drawn, as in (A).
<br />
<br />(C) In a many worlds cosmology, I seek you out as in (A) and make the same 
<br />
claim about bestowing on you the ability to pick the winning numbers in this 
<br />
week's lottery. You buy a ticket, and win first prize. Should you thank me 
<br />
for helping you win, as in (A)? In general, no; this situation is actually 
<br />
more closely analogous to (B) than to (A). For it is certain that at least 
<br />
one future version of you will win, just as it is very likely that at least 
<br />
one person will win in the single world example. I can only claim that I 
<br />
helped you win if I somehow identified which version in which world is going 
<br />
to win before the lottery is drawn, and that is impossible.
