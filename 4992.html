</em><br />
<br />But as I said earlier, the power set of a countable set would include plenty 
<br />
of sets that could not be defined using any sort of finite description, and 
<br />
I'm skeptical about the &quot;existence&quot; of such objects in a Platonic sense. 
<br />
Perhaps what I'm talking about would be a form of &quot;mathematical 
<br />
constructivism&quot;, although I don't know how &quot;constructible&quot; is usually 
<br />
defined, and whether it would allow for noncomputable numbers that can still 
<br />
be defined in terms of some finite program of an oracle-machine whose 
<br />
&quot;level&quot; can itself be finitely defined (see my post at 
<br />
<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/everything-list.domain.name.hidden/msg04809.html">http://www.mail-archive.com/everything-list.domain.name.hidden/msg04809.html</a> for 
<br />
what I mean by different 'levels' of oracle-machines, I'm not sure if my 
<br />
terminology is correct here although I've seen similar ideas expressed 
<br />
before).
<br />
<br />On second thought though, if I am only willing to admit mathematical objects 
<br />
with finite descriptions, then I should probably not even distinguish 
<br />
between countable and uncountable sets, since the collection of all possible 
<br />
finite descriptions must be countable. But there is another sense in which 
<br />
it makes sense to distinguish two different types of infinity here. To prove 
<br />
that a set is countable, one must find a function mapping the positive 
<br />
integers to the members of the set, with every member corresponding to one 
<br />
integer. But if only mathematical objects with finite descriptions are 
<br />
permitted, this should go for functions mapping integers to mathematical 
<br />
objects as well; and it's relatively easy to see that no 
<br />
finitely-describable function would include *every* object with a finite 
<br />
description (but no meaningless descriptions which don't pick out 
<br />
mathematical objects at all), using a diagonal argument. Suppose we just 
<br />
want to come up with an exhaustive list of all the finitely-describable 
<br />
reals, and we have some candidate function which maps every positive integer 
<br />
to a real with a well-defined finite description ('well-defined' meaning 
<br />
that there is no ambiguity about what number the description picks out--'a 
<br />
number bigger than 4' would not be a well-defined description, for example, 
<br />
since it doesn't pick out a unique real). If the function F is itself 
<br />
clearly defined, so there is no ambiguity about what real a given integer is 
<br />
mapped to, then a description like &quot;the real number formed by changing the 
<br />
nth digit of the binary expansion of the real number that maps to integer n 
<br />
under function F&quot; should itself be a well-defined finite description which 
<br />
picks out a real number that differs from every number on the list by at 
<br />
least one digit.
<br />
<br />So, although the set of all well-defined finite descriptions must clearly be 
<br />
&quot;countable&quot; in the traditional sense where arbitrary mappings are allowed, 
<br />
it is not countable if only finite-describable mappings are allowed, 
<br />
although it can easily be shown to be smaller than another countable set, 
<br />
namely the set of all finite descriptions without regard for whether they 
<br />
are &quot;well-defined&quot; or not (just list all strings of english symbols in 
<br />
lexical order, although most of these will be completely meaningless like 
<br />
&quot;xhh{we2lkjk4j5j&quot;, and will thus not pick out any particular real number). 
<br />
The basic problem here is that the notion of what it means for a description 
<br />
to be &quot;well-defined&quot; can never be stated in terms of a formal rule--this is 
<br />
reminiscent of the fact that no formal rules can encompass our understanding 
<br />
of arithmetic, that no matter what axioms we use there will always be 
<br />
theorems that we can prove to be true in ordinary-language proofs which 
<br />
cannot be proved true or false by the axiomatic system. These 
<br />
ordinary-language proofs will nevertheless be seen as quite rigorous by any 
<br />
mathematicians who are Platonists about arithmetic--I believe Godel used 
<br />
such a proof to show that the Godel statement G for the axioms of Peano 
<br />
arithmetic (or any other axiomatization of arithmetic) must in fact be a 
<br />
true theorem even though it's not provable using the axioms, as long as we 
<br />
interpret the symbols to refer to our mental model of arithmetic (see the 
<br />
discussion about Platonic 'models' in math at 
<br />

<br />
more on this).
