<br />Earlier (at <a href="http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians/2612.html">http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians/2612.html</a>) I 
<br />
argued that preference between the two choices is subjective (i.e. depends 
<br />
on your utility function). I now realize this implies that the 
<br />
self-sampling assumption (or SSA, the idea that you should reason as if 
<br />
you were a random sample from the set of all observers, see 
<br />
<a href="http://www.anthropic-principle.com/index.html">http://www.anthropic-principle.com/index.html</a> for more details) cannot be 
<br />
applied universally, because it implies that only choosing the two 
<br />
identical experiences is rational.
<br />
<br />Here's a demonstration of this. Suppose you've agreed to participate in 
<br />
the following experiment. First you're copied. The original will observe 
<br />
while the copy (named A1) is told the following. A1 will be copied into 
<br />
A2, B1 and B2. All four will be run on seperate and identical computers. 
<br />
A1 and A2 will be shown a number equal to the millionth bit in the binary 
<br />
expansion of PI. B1 and B2 will both be shown a number equal to 1 minus 
<br />
that bit. All four will be asked to guess the millionth bit of PI. (Assume 
<br />
you have no idea what the millionth bit is.) If A1 guesses correctly, it 
<br />
will experience a very pleasant experience (call this experience E1). Same 
<br />
applies for B1 and B2, each of whom will also have E1 if he guesses 
<br />
correctly. If A2 guesses correctly however, he will experience a slightly 
<br />
less pleasant experience E2. If anyone guesses incorrectly, he's halted 
<br />
immediately. In any event all four copies are halted at the end of the 
<br />
experiment. (The setup can be changed so that the four runs are done 
<br />
sequentially instead of in parallel. I don't think that affects my 
<br />
argument at all.)
<br />
<br />Now put yourself in the position of A1 before he's been further copied, 
<br />
trying to devise a strategy for guessing the millionth bit of PI. Let's 
<br />
call that bit X and the number you'll be shown Y, and consider the two 
<br />
strategies A) guess Y, and B) guess 1-Y. It should be obvious at this 
<br />
point that if you prefer to have two identical very pleasant experiences 
<br />
you'll select strategy B, and if you prefer to have one very pleasant 
<br />
experience and one slightly less pleasant experience you'll select 
<br />
strategy A. However according to the SSA only strategy B is rational.
<br />
<br />Here's how I would analyze the situation given the SSA. After being shown 
<br />
Y, there's 1/4 probability that I'm A1, 1/4 probability that I'm A2, 1/4 
<br />
probability that I'm B1, and 1/4 probability that I'm B2. So if I guess Y, 
<br />
there's 1/4 probability that I cause a copy of me to experience E1 and 1/4 
<br />
probability that I cause a copy of me to experience E2, therefore my 
<br />
expected utility is U(A) = 1/4*U(E1) + 1/4*U(E2). If I guess 1-Y instead, 
<br />
there's 1/4 probability that I cause a copy of me to experience E1 and 
<br />
another 1/4 probability that I cause a copy of me to experience E1, so my 
<br />
expected utility is U(B) = 1/2*U(E1). Since U(E1) &gt; U(E2), U(B) &gt; U(A).
<br />
<br />Here's my proposed non-SSA way of analyzing the situation. After being 
<br />
shown Y, I consider myself to be A1, A2, B1, and B2 &quot;simultaneously&quot;. If I 
<br />
guess 1-Y, there's probability of 1 that I cause two copies of me to 
<br />
experience E1 (call this {E1,E1}). If I guess Y, there's probability of 1 
<br />
that I cause one copy of me to experience E1 and one copy of me to 
<br />
experience E2 (call this {E1,E2}). Now which strategy I should choose 
<br />
depends on whether U({E1,E1}) &gt; U({E1,E2}), which can be independent of 
<br />
whether U(E1) &gt; U(E2).
<br />
<br />So my position is that rather than being a principle of correct reasoning, 
<br />
the status of the SSA should be reduced to that of an approximation useful 
<br />
when one's utility function is close to satisfying certain constraints 
<br />
(for example U({E1,E2})=U(E1)+U(E2) for all E1, E2). More general 
<br />
principle(s) need to be worked out that subsumes the SSA as a special 
<br />
case.
