<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physicists' library of fundamental 'particles'. At this point I'd say that the Life 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rules had been discovered but perhaps not deduced.
</em><br />
<br />I guess that such a thing might be possible.  But then, if the life game
<br />
can emulate a TM in any portion of it, mightn't it be possible that any
<br />
computable laws of physics are emulable by it, if you allow larger and
<br />
larger members to be built up?  Later in this post you distinguish
<br />
between those members that are the result of a TM inside a life field,
<br />
and those that &quot;you get 'for free' by running Life sim on a large
<br />
enough random field.&quot;  But perhaps its not so simple to draw the line.
<br />
<br />Anyway, though I say that, I suspect that to the simplist, and most
<br />
probable (if those are the same set) of SAS's that develop &quot;for free&quot;
<br />
on a random field, the rules of life would be discernable.  Some
<br />
general characteristics of their universe probably would be -- that
<br />
they are in two dimensions, for example.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So if we further assume that our universe is *not* a game of life,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and if the AUH is true, then by the SSA I would conclude that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; probability of any SAS finding itself to be in a game of life is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; probably zero.  That is, the set of SAS's inside a game of life is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of measure zero relative to the set of SAS's inside universes like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ours.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; How do you deduce that the prob of being in a game of Life is 0? I under-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stand all the stuff about measure (I'm a mathematician) but where do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you get the Life-like universes vanishing?
</em><br />
<br />I said probably zero - I didn't claim to deduce anything.  I'm just
<br />
speculating.  See below.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; And here I make a desperate, arm-waving leap, from the idea that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I am a random sample, to the conclusion that SAS's &quot;like me&quot; are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the most numerous.  Whatever &quot;like me&quot; might mean, I think it's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; fair to guess that it wouldn't include SAS's inside a game of life,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; unless you're talking about the ones generated within the UD.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No I mean the one's you get 'for free' by running Life sim on a large
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; enough random field. (Take digits of pi if you don't like 'random').
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree: your leap is a desparate, arm-waving leap. My SAS within a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Life simulation could be justified in making the same leap, surely. Even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; though he/she/it would be by your argument totally wrong.
</em><br />
<br />Well, that's a very interesting point, and I believe it shows that 
<br />
we can only, each of us, deduce things from the SSA from a first
<br />
person perspective.  We can't take anyone's word for what they've
<br />
deduced from the SSA.  So we shouldn't, for example, take the word
<br />
of a scientist who's just performed the QS experiment and survived
<br />
despite thousand-to-one odds, that QS really works.  *He* would have
<br />
a strong reason for believing it, but I would have no additional
<br />
incentive to believe it.
<br />
<br />So, I think, yes, if my argument is correct, it doesn't matter 
<br />
that a life-SAS would deduce the same thing.  I would be correct 
<br />
and (s)he would be wrong.  That is, I still do believe that 
<br />
different sorts of SAS's have different measure.  Taking Hal's
<br />
approach and doing away with infinite sets, spoze that there are
<br />
a total of one billion SAS's in all the universes everywhere, and
<br />
that ten of them are green, but the rest are blue.  Any one of 
<br />
them would be justified in assuming that most SAS's are of the 
<br />
same color, but the green ones who made that assumption would be 
<br />
wrong.
<br />
<br />So if the set of life-SAS's is not isomorphic to the set of (3+1 
<br />
dim. pseudo-Riemannian manifold quantum field)-SAS's, then we'd
<br />
have no a priori reason to assume that the measures of these sets
<br />
are the same.   If the measures are different, then one is larger
<br />
than the other.  My money will be on our set having the larger
<br />
measure.  If the measures 
<br />
are transfinite but of different orders, then I conclude that the
<br />
probability of finding oneself to be a life-SAS is zero.
