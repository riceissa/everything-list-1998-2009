<br />
Some time back Lee Corbin posed the question of which was more
<br />
fundamental: observer-moments or universes?  I would say, with more
<br />
thought, that observer-moments are more fundamental in terms of explaining
<br />
the subjective appearance of what we see, and what we can expect.
<br />
An observer-moment is really all we have as our primary experience of
<br />
the world.  The world around us may be fake; we may be in the Matrix or
<br />
a brain in a vat.  Even our memories may be fake.  But the fact that we
<br />
are having particular experiences at a particular moment cannot be faked.
<br />
<br />But the universe is fundamental, in my view, in terms of the ontology,
<br />
the physical reality of the world.  Universes create and contain observers
<br />
who experience observer-moments.  This is the Schmidhuber/Tegmark model.
<br />
(I think Bruno Marchal may invert this relationship.)
<br />
<br />In terms of measure, Schmidhuber (and possibly Tegmark) provides a means
<br />
to estimate the measure of a universe.  Consider the fraction of all bit
<br />
strings that create that universe as its measure.  In practice this is
<br />
roughly 1/2^n where n is the size of the shortest program that outputs
<br />
that universe.  The Tegmark model may allow for similar reasoning,
<br />
applied to mathematical structures rather than computer programs.
<br />
<br />Now, how to get from universe measure to observer-moment (OM) measure?
<br />
This is what I want to write about.
<br />
<br />First, the measure of an OM should be the sum of contributions from
<br />
each of the universes that instantiate that OM.  Generally there are
<br />
many possible universes that may create or contain a particular OM.
<br />
Some are variants of our own, where things are different that we have
<br />
not yet observed.  For example, a universe which is like ours except
<br />
for some minor change in a galaxy billions of light years away could
<br />
contain a copy of us experiencing the same OMs.  Even bigger changes
<br />
may not matter; for example if you flip a coin but haven't yet looked
<br />
at the result, this may not change your OM.  Then there are even more
<br />
drastic universes, like The Matrix where we are living in a simulation
<br />
created in some kind of future or alien world.
<br />
<br />Perhaps the most extreme case is a &quot;universe&quot; which only creates that OM.
<br />
Think of it as a universe which only exists for a brief moment and
<br />
which only contains a brain, or a computer or some such system, which
<br />
contains the state associated with that OM.  This is the &quot;brain in a
<br />
vat&quot; model taken to the most extreme, where there isn't anything else,
<br />
and there isn't even a vat, there is just a brain.  We would hope,
<br />
if our multiverse models are going to amount to anything, that such
<br />
universes would only contribute a small measure to each of our OMs.
<br />
Otherwise the AUH can't explain what we see.
<br />
<br />But all of these universes contribute to the measure of our OMs.
<br />
We are living in all of them.  The measure of the OM is the sum of the
<br />
contribution from each universe.
<br />
<br />However, and here is the key point, the contribution to an OM from a
<br />
universe cannot just be taken as equal to the measure of that universe.
<br />
Otherwise we reach some paradoxical conclusions.  For one thing,
<br />
a universe may instantiate a particular OM more than once.  What do
<br />
we do in that case?  For another, intuitively it might seem that the
<br />
contribution of a universe to an OM should depend to some extent on how
<br />
much of the universe's resources are devoted to that OM.  An enormous
<br />
universe which managed to instantiate a particular OM in some little
<br />
corner might be said to contribute less of its measure to that OM than
<br />
if a smaller universe instantiates the same OM.
<br />
<br />The most extreme case is a trivial universe (equivalently, a program,
<br />
in Schmidhuber terms) which simply counts.  It outputs 1, 2, 3, 4, ...
<br />
forever.  This is a small program and has large measure.  At some point
<br />
it will output a number corresponding to any given OM.  Should we count
<br />
the entire measure of this small program (one of the smallest programs
<br />
that can exist) to this OM?  If so, it will seem that for every OM we
<br />
should assume that we exist as part of such a counting program, which
<br />
is another variant on the brain-in-a-vat scenario.  This destroys the
<br />
AUH as a predictive model.
<br />
<br />Years ago Wei Dai on this list suggested a better approach.  He proposed
<br />
a formula for determining how much of a universe's measure contributes to
<br />
an OM that it instantiates.  It is very specific and also illustrates
<br />
some problems in the rather loose discussion so far.  For example,
<br />
what does it really mean to instantiate an OM?  How would we know if a
<br />
universe is really instantiating a particular OM?  Aren't there fuzzy
<br />
cases where a universe is only &quot;sort of&quot; instantiating one?  What about
<br />
the longstanding problem that you can look at the atomic vibrations in
<br />
a crystal, select a subset of them to pay attention to, and have that
<br />
pattern match the pattern of any given OM?  Does this mean that every
<br />
crystal instantiates every OM?  (Hans Moravec sometimes seems to say yes!)
<br />
<br />To apply Wei's method, first we need to get serious about what is an OM.
<br />
We need a formal model and description of a particular OM.  Consider, for
<br />
example, someone's brain when he is having a particular experience.  He is
<br />
eating chocolate ice cream while listening to Beethoven's 5th symphony,
<br />
on his 30th birthday.  Imagine that we could scan his brain with advanced
<br />
technology and record his neural activity.  Imagine further that with the
<br />
aid of an advanced brain model we are able to prune out the unnecessary
<br />
information and distill this to the essence of the experience.  We come
<br />
up with a pattern that represents that observer moment.  Any system which
<br />
instantiates that pattern genuinely creates an experience of that observer
<br />
moment.  This pattern is something that can be specified, recorded and
<br />
written down in some form.  It probably involves a huge volume of data.
<br />
<br />So, now that we have a handle on what a particular OM is, we can more
<br />
reasonably ask whether a universe instantiates it.  It comes down to
<br />
whether it produces and contains that particular pattern.  But this may
<br />
not be such an easy question.  It could be that the &quot;raw&quot; output format of
<br />
a universe program does not lend itself to seeing larger scale patterns.
<br />
For example, in our own universe, the raw output would probably be at
<br />
the level of the Planck scale, far, far smaller than an atomic nucleus.
<br />
At that level, even a single brain neuron would be the size of a galaxy.
<br />
And the time for enough neural firings to occur to make up a noticeable
<br />
conscious experience would be like the entire age of the universe.
<br />
It will take considerable interpretation of the raw output of our
<br />
universe's program to detect the faint traces of an observer moment.
<br />
<br />And as noted above, an over-aggressive attempt to hunt out observer
<br />
moments will find false positives, random patterns which, if we are
<br />
selective enough, happen to match what we are looking for.
<br />
<br />Wei proposed to solve both of these problems by introducing an
<br />
interpretation program.  It would be take as its input, the output of the
<br />
universe-creation program.  It would then output the observer moment in
<br />
whatever formal specification format we had decided on (the exact format
<br />
will not be significant).
<br />
<br />So how would this program work, in the case of our universe?  It would
<br />
have encoded in it the location in space and time of the brain which
<br />
was experiencing the OM.  It would know the size of the brain and the
<br />
spatial distribution of its neurons.  And it would know the faint traces
<br />
and changes at the Planck scale that would correspond to neural firings
<br />
or pauses.  Based on this information, which is encoded into the program,
<br />
it would run and output the results.  And that output would then match
<br />
the formal encoding of the OM.
<br />
<br />Now, Wei applies the same kind of reasoning that we do for the measure
<br />
of the Schmidhuber ensemble itself.  He proposes that the size of the
<br />
interpretation program should determine how much of the universe's measure
<br />
contributes to the OM.  If the interpretation program is relatively small,
<br />
that is evidence that the universe is making a strong contribution to
<br />
the OM.  But if the interpretation program is huge, then we would say
<br />
that little of the universe's measure should go into the OM.
<br />
<br />In the most extreme case, the interpretation program could just encode the
<br />
OM within itself, ignore the universe state and output that data pattern.
<br />
In effect that is what would have to be done in order to find an OM
<br />
within a crystal as described above.  You'd have to have the whole OM
<br />
state in the program since the crystal doesn't actually have any real
<br />
relationship to the OM.  But that would be an enormous interpretation
<br />
program, which would deliver only a trivial measure.
<br />
<br />For a universe like our own, the hope and expectation is that the
<br />
interpretation program will be relatively small.  Such a program takes
<br />
the entire universe as input and outputs a particular OM.  I did some
<br />
back of the envelope calculations and you will probably be amazed that
<br />
I estimate that such a program could be less than 1000 bits in size.
<br />
(This is assuming the universe is roughly as big as what is visible, and
<br />
neglecting the MWI.)  Compared to the information in an OM, which I can't
<br />
even guess but will surely be at least gigabytes, this is insignificant.
<br />
Therefore we do have strong grounds to say that the universe which
<br />
appears real is in fact making a major contribution to our OMs.
<br />
<br />To be specific, Wei's idea was to count the measure of a universe's
<br />
contribution to an OM as 1/2^(n+m), where n is the size of the program
<br />
that creates the universe, and m is the size of the interpretation
<br />
program that reads the output of the first program, and outputs the OM
<br />
specification from that.  In effect, you can think of the two programs
<br />
together as a single program which outputs the formal spec of the OM,
<br />
and ask what are the shortest ways to do that.  In this way you can
<br />
actually calculate the measure of an OM directly without even looking at
<br />
the intermediate step of calculating a universe.  But I prefer thinking of
<br />
the two step method as it gives us a handle on such concepts as whether
<br />
we are living in the Matrix or as a brain in a vat.
<br />
<br />Overall I think this is a very attractive formulation.  It's quantitative,
<br />
and it gives the intuitively right answer for many cases.  The counting
<br />
program contributes effectively no measure, because the only way we can
<br />
find an OM is by encoding the whole thing in the interpretation program.
<br />
And as another example, if there are multiple OMs instantiated by a
<br />
particular universe, that will allow the interpretation program to be
<br />
smaller because less information is needed to localize an OM.  It also
<br />
implies that small universes will devote more of their measure to OMs
<br />
that they instantiate than large ones, which basically makes sense.
<br />
<br />There are a few unintuitive consequences, though, such as that large
<br />
instantiations of OMs will have more measure than small ones, and likewise
<br />
slow ones will have more measure than fast ones.  This is because in each
<br />
case the interpretation program can be smaller if it is easier to find the
<br />
OM in the vastness of a universe, and the slower and bigger an OM is the
<br />
easier it is to find.  I am inclined to tentatively accept these results.
<br />
It does imply that the extreme future vision of some transhumanists,
<br />
to upload themselves to super-fast, super-small computers, may greatly
<br />
reduce their measure, which would mean that it would be like taking a
<br />
large chance of dying.
<br />
<br />There is one big problem with the approach, though, which I have not yet
<br />
solved.  I wrote above that a very short program could localize a given OM
<br />
within our universe.  It only takes ~300 bits to locate a brain (i.e. a
<br />
brain-sized piece of space)!  However this neglects the MWI.  If we take
<br />
as our universe-model a world governed by the MWI, it is exponentially
<br />
larger than what we see as the visible universe.  Every decoherence-time,
<br />
the universe splits.  That's like picoseconds, or nanoseconds at best.
<br />
The number of splittings since the universe was created is vast, and
<br />
the size of the universe is like 2 (or more!) to that power.
<br />
<br />Providing the information to localize a particular OM within the vastness
<br />
of a universe governed by the MWI appears to be truly intractable.
<br />
Granted, we don't necessarily have to narrow it down to an exact branch,
<br />
but unless there are tremendous amounts of de facto convergent evolution
<br />
after splits, it seems to me that the percentage of quantum space-time
<br />
occupied by a given OM is far smaller than the 1/2^1000 I would estimate
<br />
in a non-MWI universe.  It's more like 1/2^2^100.  At that rate the
<br />
interpretation program to find an OM would be much *bigger* than the one
<br />
that just hard-codes the OM itself.  In short, it would appear that an MWI
<br />
universe cannot contribute significant measure to an OM, under this model.
<br />
That's a serious problem.
<br />
<br />So there are a couple of possible solutions to this problem.  One is to
<br />
reject the MWI on these grounds.  That's not too attractive; this line of
<br />
argument is awfully speculative for such a conclusion.  Also, creating a
<br />
program for a non-MWI universe requires a random number generator, which
<br />
is an ugly kludge and implies that quantum randomness is algorithmic
<br />
rather than true, a bizarre result.  A more hopeful possibility is that
<br />
there will turn out to be structure in the MWI phase space that will
<br />
allow us to localize OM's much more easily than the brute force method
<br />
I assumed above.  I have only the barest speculations about how that
<br />
might work, to which I need to give more thought.
<br />
<br />But even with this problem, I think the overall formulation is the
<br />
best I have seen in terms of grappling with the reality of a multiverse
<br />
and addressing the issue of where we as observers fit into the greater
<br />
structure.  It provides a quantitative and approximable measure which
<br />
allows us to calculate, in principle, how much of our reality is as it
<br />
appears and how much is an illusion.  It answers questions like whether
<br />
copies contribute to measure.  And it provides some interesting and
<br />
surprising predictions about how various changes to the substrate
<br />
of intelligence (uploading to computers, etc.) may change measure.
<br />
In general I think Wei Dai's approach is the best foundation for
<br />
understanding the place of observers within the multiverse.
