</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;did not know anyone who was in the WTC.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I told you my relief, but I begin to doubt !
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you mean by that?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Recently, of course, I have been more concerned with the destruction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;caused in NYC by the advocates of suicide and believers in immortality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I understand your concern with NYC. I share with you the concern
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of those terrible and crual 11 sept. events.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now a pecularity of this war consists in figuring out who
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is the enemy, exactly.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It looks like you have solved that problem too. The enemy are the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;believers in immortality, the religious people !?!
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did mention that they were also &quot;advocates of suicide&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I am fearing amalgamations, like the amalgamations between Muslims and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;terrorists (to name one which has been done by some). But you are the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;champion: the enemy are all religious people. The war between atheism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and religion !?!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Perhaps I should tell you what are, according to G*, the canonical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;enemies&quot; of the sound universal machine.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bruno, you have an amazing ability to misunderstand what I say.  I used 
<br />
to think that the problem was that many of the posts on this list concern 
<br />
arcane philosophical and technical points, so that misunderstanding was 
<br />
understandable.  By now I know better.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could say &quot;Coke is better than Pepsi&quot;, and you would interpret that to 
<br />
mean that I don't know they are both colas.  Further, you would believe that 
<br />
the only way to illustrate the relationship between the two drinks is by 
<br />
analogy to G and G*.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The sound machine is maximaly humble, she is agnostic on both
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;her own consistency and her own inconsistency.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does that imply it is agnostic on any question?  One of these days, I'll 
<br />
have to check out what kind of analogy you are making between Godel's 
<br />
theorem and belief systems.  Right now I doubt there's much to it.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A couple more points.  When I say &quot;X is true&quot; you can assume I mean &quot;I 
<br />
believe X is very likely to be true, so my Bayesian probability of (not X) 
<br />
is so low it is best to neglect it.&quot;  If I say for example &quot;This is a chair&quot; 
<br />
that is what I mean.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, if humans have properties that are not shared by your &quot;consistent 
<br />
machine&quot; model, then it is not the humans' fault.  It is not their job to 
<br />
describe your model.  It means your model is faulty.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The universal sound machine is forever undecided about any of its possible 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ultimate worldview and, by doubting, never imposes its religion or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;worldview on different machines.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why not?  Even if I'm not sure of X, I might still want you to believe 
<br />
X.  Or, equivalently, I might want your Bayesian probability for X to be 
<br />
high even if mine is not.  (Not that I'm that sort though, but some people 
<br />
are.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Today I guess we have still the choice between a war between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;moderates and fanatics and a war between fanatics and fanatics.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's going to be a war between ordinary people vs. evil.  Personally I 
<br />
am not too concerned right now with the philosophical differences among the 
<br />
ordinary people, be they religious or  intelligent.  This will be serious, I 
<br />
fear.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;In the second case we loose the war at the start, isn't it?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Do you agree with this last statement? Or are you really, Mister the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Devil's Advocate, a fanatical atheist?
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm an atheist, and have no doubts of any significance about it.  I do 
<br />
believe that other people should be atheists too, and that on the whole 
<br />
religion is an evil.  Of the major religions I would say that Islam and 
<br />
Christianity are the worst, but the main factor is how seriously the 
<br />
believers take it and how radical they are in interpretation.  But again, 
<br />
for now I am putting disagreements among non-evil people on the back burner.
