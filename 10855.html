</em><br />
<br />No, it follows from the idea that anything can be a computation. I think this is trivially obvious, 
<br />
like saying any string of apparently random characters is a translation of any English sentence 
<br />
of similar or shorter length, and if you have the correct dictionary, you can find out what that 
<br />
English sentence is. This is analogous to finding an alien computer which, when power is applied, 
<br />
is set into motion like an inscrutable Rube Goldberg machine. If you get your hands on the 
<br />
computer manual, you might be able to decipher the machine's activity as calculating pi. Moreover, 
<br />
you might be able to reach inside and shift a few gears or discharge a few capacitors and make it 
<br />
calculate e instead, utilising the fact that the laws of physics determine that if the inputs change, 
<br />
the outputs will change (which, I trust you will agree, is the actual physical basis of the if-then 
<br />
statements). 
<br />
<br />Now, in human languages as in machine design, there are certain regularities to make things 
<br />
easier for user. It might be possible, albeit difficult, to decipher a foreign language or figure out 
<br />
what an alien computer is computing by looking for these regularities. However, it is not necessary 
<br />
that there be any pattern at all: the characters in the unknown language may change in meaning 
<br />
every time they appear in the string in accordance with a random number generator, a cryptographic 
<br />
method called a &quot;one-time pad&quot;. Similarly, the meaning of the physical states of the alien computer 
<br />
could change with each clock cycle according to some random number sequence, so that if you had 
<br />
the key you could figure out that the computer was calculating pi, but if you did not its activity would 
<br />
seem random. I don't think it would be reasonable to say that the computer is only calculating pi when 
<br />
you have the manual at hand ready to refer to, even though without the manual the computer is 
<br />
completely useless to you if you want to calculate the area of a circle, for example.
<br />
<br />Remember, even the apparently random computer handles counterfactuals, in that if a gear or a 
<br />
semiconductor junction were changed, the whole subsequent activity of the machine would change, 
<br />
and the manual would tell you how the computation had changed.
<br />
<br />You could dismiss the computations of random physical systems as trivial or useless, but what if you 
<br />
believe that some computations can be conscious? It would be no easier for us to observe or interact 
<br />
with these computations than it would be for us to observe or use the pi calculation, but by 
<br />
definition the conscious computations *themselves* would be self-aware.
<br />
<br />We might say in the above cases that the burden of the computation shifts from the physical activity 
<br />
of the computer to the information in the manual. The significance of this is that the manual is static, 
<br />
and need not even be instantiated if we don't care about interacting with the computer: it is a 
<br />
mathematical object residing in Platonia.
