Hi There,
<br />
<br />I've been an avid reader of this group for a long time, and I always
<br />
come here to try to think through the BIG questions... because I think
<br />
the everything theory is, really let's face it, about as big as things
<br />
get...
<br />
<br />that being said, I wanted to contribute something, albeit a
<br />
fragment:
<br />
<br />I was reading Plato's Parmenides tonight and started thinking about
<br />
monism and had an idea for a paper. It was essentially trying to
<br />
resurrect some kind of Parmenidian Monism in light of Quantum Physics
<br />
and its metaphysical relationship to existence, i.e. OUR existence, as
<br />
conscious, observing (yet also sometimes suffering and sick) beings...
<br />
please, if you like, read what I have come up with and give me your
<br />
thoughts. I think this idea of 'bit' is very easily importable into
<br />
any sort of UDA argument for the nature of reality, or even for any
<br />
everything theory in general.
<br />
<br />Dan
<br />
<br />A Way to Reconcile Parmenides' Monism with Contemporary Quantum
<br />
Physics (December 2008)
<br />
<br />The 'bit' of existence.
<br />
<br />The 'bit' of existence, the title of this writing, refers in many
<br />
simultaneous and synonymous ways in which a 'bit' can be.
<br />
Principally, the idea relies on the two strongest connonotations of
<br />
the word 'bit' today-- the notion used often in computer science of
<br />
the basic unit of information -- the bit-- and the other notion, used
<br />
in more folksy parlance, 'the bit...' as in the bit left over, the
<br />
small fragment of a whole that can never go away.  The first idea of
<br />
'bit' we will leave for later treatment. It is the second main
<br />
connotation of this word that I would like to look at first, for it is
<br />
I think in the key sense suggested by this use of the word, we can
<br />
reconcile Parmenides' metaphysical monism with empirical support,
<br />
based on a not at all unreasonable and yet also very stringent and
<br />
rigourous interpretation of quantum physics, one that must support
<br />
both the multiple worlds theory and the Copenhagen interpretation.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 'bit' of existence, as a fragment of existence, is also THE
<br />
fragment of existence... it is the only one that has any 'light' to
<br />
illuminate consciousness.  It is very similar to the picture of a
<br />
laser and a cd, or for those older readers (including me), a record
<br />
needle and a record.  THIS fragment of consciousness that is reading
<br />
this note right now is &quot;the bit of existence,&quot; meaning that they are
<br />
unique, singular, and utterly indestructible, because it is impossible
<br />
that the bit (fragment, part, single piece that is conscious of a
<br />
unified whole) could ever be squeezed out by any 'non-bit' or 'anti-
<br />
bit' (conceptual opposites conventionally, although I don't believe
<br />
they really exist, in support once again of Parmenides absolute
<br />
monism) or even 'nothing' (for nothing can only be what it is in
<br />
opposition to something, to being, to even 'a bit of existence') This
<br />
bit of existence is a fundamental fact of the universe, nay even
<br />
existence itself, for this universe is a function of the rules of
<br />
existence/non-existence, whatever they may be.
