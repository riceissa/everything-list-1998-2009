<br />It seems to me that this reasoning creates just as serious a problem  
<br />
for your perspective as it does for mine. Suppose we physically remove  
<br />
the defective component from the computer, but, with incredible luck,  
<br />
the surrounding components continue to act as though they were  
<br />
receiving the signals they would have received. Your experience of  
<br />
using Firefox remains the same, so (by your argument above) it  
<br />
shouldn't make sense to say that the computer isn't &quot;really&quot; running  
<br />
Firefox. But we can keep removing components until all that's left is  
<br />
a monitor that, with incredible luck due to thermal noise, is  
<br />
displaying the pixels that would have been displayed if your computer  
<br />
was actually functioning, doing things like displaying a mouse-pointer  
<br />
that (very improbably!) happens to move when you move your mouse, etc.
<br />
<br />This is, of course, just a recapitulation of the argument we've  
<br />
already been considering - the slide from Fully-Functional Alice to  
<br />
Lucky Alice to Empty-Headed Alice. I have an intuition that causality  
<br />
(or its logical equivalent in Platonia) is somehow important for  
<br />
consciousness. You argue that the the slide from Fully-Functional  
<br />
Alice to Lucky Alice (or Fully-Functional Firefox to Lucky Firefox)  
<br />
indicates that there's something wrong with this idea. However, you  
<br />
have an intuition that order is somehow important for consciousness.  
<br />
(Without trying to beg the question, I might use the term &quot;mere  
<br />
order&quot;, to indicate the fact that, for you, it doesn't matter whether  
<br />
the blinking bits in some hypothetical 2D array were generated by  
<br />
(say) a random process, it just matters that they display the  
<br />
requisite order.) But the slide from Lucky Alice to Empty-Headed Alice  
<br />
is just as problematic for that view as the slide from Fully- 
<br />
Functional Alice to Lucky Alice is for mine.
<br />
<br />My point isn't that your intuition must be incorrect. My point is that  
<br />
the above argument fails to show me why your &quot;mere order&quot; intuition is  
<br />
more correct than my &quot;real order&quot; intuition, since the argument is  
<br />
equally destructive to both intuitions. Instead of giving up your  
<br />
intuition, you make a move to Platonia. But in that new context, I  
<br />
think it still makes sense to ask if &quot;mere order&quot; (for instance, in  
<br />
the binary digits of PI) is enough for consciousness, and the Alice /  
<br />
Firefox thought experiments don't help me answer that question.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If by &quot;Unification&quot; you mean the idea that two identical brains with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; identical input will result in only one consciousness, I don't see how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this solves the conceptual problem of partial zombies. What would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happen if an identical part of both brains were replaced with a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non-concious but otherwise identically functioning equivalent?
</em><br />
<br />I was referring to the idea that my Conway's Life version of Bruno's  
<br />
MGA 2 may only present a problem for Duplicationists. If one believes  
<br />
that physically re-performing all of the Conway's Life computations  
<br />
would create a second experience of pain (assuming that there's a  
<br />
creature in there with that description), and if you *don't* believe  
<br />
that the act of playing the move back creates a second experience of  
<br />
pain, then you have a partial zombie problem. But it you accept  
<br />
Unification, the problem might go away (although I'm unsure of this).
<br />
<br />I still feel like I don't have a handle on how you feel the move to  
<br />
Platonia solves these problems. If we imagine the mathematical  
<br />
description of filling a 3D grid with the binary digits of PI,  
<br />
somewhere within it we will find some patterns of bits that look as  
<br />
though they're following the rules to Conway's Life. If we see  
<br />
creatures in there, would they be conscious? What about the areas in  
<br />
that grid where we find the equivalent of Empty-Headed Alice, where  
<br />
most of the cells seem to be &quot;following the rules&quot; of Conway's Life,  
<br />
but the section where a creature's &quot;visual cortex&quot; ought to be is just  
<br />
filled with zeros? In other words, why doesn't the &quot;partial zombie&quot;  
<br />
problem still exist for us in Platonia?
