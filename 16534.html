<br /><br /><br />OK. Although you could say: &quot;if your computer has to interact with  
<br />
another computer then ...&quot;. But OK. It is important, not for the rise  
<br />
of consciousness, but for its relative stability with respect to some  
<br />
notion of first person splral. It is important for having local measure.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But without this constraint you are free to interpret any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; activity as any computation.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I don't see why. Simple activity could correspond to simple  
<br />
computation (I can agree with this). But any complex computation will  
<br />
require some gobal connectness among the many simple activity.  
<br />
Especially the long and deep (in Bennett sense) computations.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You could pick three trees and, observing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the movement of birds on and off the trees, interpret this as  a logic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; gate. Three birds land on the first tree, and that's a &quot;zero&quot; input.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Two birds alight from the second tree, that's a &quot;zero&quot; input also.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Three birds land on the third tree, that's a &quot;one&quot; output. A minute
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; later, five birds alight from the first tree, one bird lands on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; second tree and two birds land on the third tree, which is interpreted
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as two &quot;one&quot; inputs giving a &quot;zero&quot; output. Looks like it might be a a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; NAND gate! Not very useful, of course, but is there any reason why my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interpretation is wrong, or why the birds flying around won't give
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rise to whatever consciousness is associated with the operation of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logic gate?
</em><br />
<br />Somehow you make my point, because I am willing to say that you are  
<br />
right, ONCE assuming the supervenience thesis. But your conclusion,  
<br />
that anything computation supervenes on any physical activity,  
<br />
including the empty one, is what I definitely consider as an  
<br />
absurdity, and is the reason why, keeping comp, I abandon the physical  
<br />
supervenience thesis, and eventually the very idea of primitive  
<br />
physical stuff.
<br />
A computation is just like they are defined in mathematical books on  
<br />
computation: it is a global logical relation capable of sustaining non  
<br />
trivial relations among abstract items.
<br />
<br />Consider Ned Block's Chinese People Computer. You can (logically, not  
<br />
ethically of course) program the people of China so that each chinese,  
<br />
just by doing very simple mails, participate into a giant computation  
<br />
emulating Einstein' brain, say. The consciousness of Einstein will  
<br />
rely on the global organization of the information handled by all  
<br />
chineses, not on the physical activity of such or such particular  
<br />
person. Of course, this line ends up accepting that from the point of  
<br />
view of Einstein it is just undecidable if he is a brain in a vat, a  
<br />
body in a hospital, or an abstract (but relatively rare and  
<br />
sophisticate) pattern in Platonia, and then the comp 01 person  
<br />
indeterminacy leads to a rich non trivial relative state  
<br />
interpretation of Arithmetic.
<br />
<br />I think that if you take a real forest with birds, here and there, you  
<br />
can interpret some behavior as NAND or NOR, but you will not succeed  
<br />
ever in finding the computation of factorial(5). Even the universal  
<br />
dovetailer has to wait (in its own step-time) billions of billions of  
<br />
&quot;steps&quot; before getting something as interesting as the factorial  
<br />
functions. For Einstein's brain the UD will already take a  
<br />
ridiculously long time (well beyond anything physically observable)  
<br />
before getting its simulation.
<br />
<br />Even if you decide to no more interact with the &quot;external world&quot;, you  
<br />
will not say yes to a doctor who propose you a rock in place of your  
<br />
brain. This is beacuse the probability, ven and especially from your  
<br />
first person point of view, that the many NAND (that the rock could  
<br />
perhaps emulates indeed) arrange themselves into a Papaioannou healthy  
<br />
mind's state is null? You could survive in some possible world, but  
<br />
not through the rock computational power. If ever you survive with the  
<br />
rock, the probability that you will be dumb or disable will be far  
<br />
greater.
<br />
<br />But you are right, those who believes in both comp and physical  
<br />
supervenience have to attach all consciousness to all physical  
<br />
activity, and then they does not need comp anymore and everything  
<br />
become trivial. You get a Kelly sort of physics which predict  
<br />
everything. I prefer to keep the mathematically coherent and sound  
<br />
comp, and forget physical supervenience. Even more so when you realize  
<br />
that the math for comp will explain the appearance of rocks and  
<br />
particles without assuming any metaphysical naturalism.
