<em class="quotelev1">&gt;set up a computer to simulate our universe.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;However, I prefer a model in which what we consider equally likely is

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not patterns of matter, but the laws of physics and initial conditions

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;which generate a given universe.  In this model, universes with simple
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;laws are far more likely than universes with complex ones.
</em><br />
<br />Why? If you consider each possible distinct Turing machine program to be 
<br />
equally likely, then as I said before, for any finite complexity bound there 
<br />
will be only a finite number of programs with less complexity than that, and 
<br />
an infinite number with greater complexity, so if each program had equal 
<br />
measure we should expect the laws of nature are always more complex than any 
<br />
possible finite rule we can think of. If you believe in putting a measure on 
<br />
&quot;universes&quot; in the first place (instead of a measure on first-person 
<br />
experiences, which I prefer), then for your idea to work the measure would 
<br />
need to be biased towards smaller program/rules, like the &quot;universal prior&quot; 
<br />
or the &quot;speed prior&quot; that have been discussed on this list by Juergen 
<br />
Schimdhuber and Russell Standish (I think you were around for these 
<br />
discussions, but if not see 
<br />
<a href="http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/computeruniverse.html">http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/computeruniverse.html</a> and 
<br />
<a href="http://parallel.hpc.unsw.edu.au/rks/docs/occam/occam.html">http://parallel.hpc.unsw.edu.au/rks/docs/occam/occam.html</a> for more details)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Therefore I'd suggest that when you consider the possibility that our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;universe is embedded in a larger structure, you can't just look at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the matter complexity of that structure.  Rather, you should look at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the physical-law complexity.  And it seems plausible to me that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physical laws of the outer universe don't necessarily have to be much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;more complex than our own.  In fact, it may be that we are capable of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;simulating our own universe (we don't know the laws of physics well enough
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to answer that question, IMO).
</em><br />
<br />If the &quot;everything that can exist does exist&quot; idea is true, then every 
<br />
possible universe is in a sense both an &quot;outer universe&quot; (an independent 
<br />
Platonic object) and an &quot;inner universe&quot; (a simulation in some other 
<br />
logically possible universe). If you want a measure on universes, it's 
<br />
possible that universes which have lots of simulated copies running in 
<br />
high-measure universes will themselves tend to have higher measure, perhaps 
<br />
you could bootstrap the global measure this way...but this would require an 
<br />
answer to the question I keep mentioning from the Chalmers paper, namely 
<br />
deciding what it means for one simulation to &quot;contain&quot; another. Without an 
<br />
answer to this, we can't really say that a computer running a simulation of 
<br />
a universe with particular laws and initial conditions is contributing more 
<br />
to the measure of that possible universe than the random motions of 
<br />
molecules in a rock are contributing to its measure, since both can be seen 
<br />
as isomorphic to the events of that universe with the right mapping.
