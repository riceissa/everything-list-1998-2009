<br />
I have read some stuff on Nick Bostrom's page
<br />
(<a href="http://nickbostrom.com/">http://nickbostrom.com/</a>) and while in general
<br />
I agree with his conclusions about 
<br />
observation-selection effects, there is one
<br />
example which I am not sure I understand.
<br />
<br />It is the one about cars in the next lane going
<br />
faster: 
<br />
(<a href="http://plus.maths.org/issue17/features/traffic/index.html">http://plus.maths.org/issue17/features/traffic/index.html</a>)
<br />
<br />I agree with the general conclusion:
<br />
&quot;when we randomly select a driver and ask her
<br />
whether she thinks the next lane is faster, more
<br />
often than not we will have selected a driver from
<br />
the lane which is in fact slower and more densely
<br />
packed.&quot;
<br />
<br />And in a sense I agree with:
<br />
&quot;If you are driving on the motorway and think of
<br />
your present observation as a random sample from
<br />
all the observations made by all the drivers, then
<br />
chances are that your observation will be made from
<br />
the viewpoint that most drivers have, which is the
<br />
viewpoint of the slow-moving lane.&quot;
<br />
<br />That is, IF I think of my present observation as a
<br />
random sample from all the observations, THEN chances
<br />
are that my observation is from the slow lane. But
<br />
I am not sure I agree that we can always think of
<br />
our observation as being from such a sample.
<br />
<br />For example: suppose I just arrived at a 2-lane
<br />
road. I took lane A. One of them is slower than the
<br />
other, in the sense that for the next couple of miles
<br />
after my initial positioWhere is the flaw?
<br />
n the average velocities of
<br />
the cars in lane S is lower than on lane F. But it is
<br />
not clear which (A or B) is faster from my point-of-view
<br />
(POV), so that, in trying to decide which lane to go,
<br />
I need to think of a statistical argument to decide
<br />
wether or not I should change lanes.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From Bostrom's argument, I should think of my observation
</em><br />
as being selected from a sample of the drivers on the
<br />
road, so that it is more likely that I am on the slower
<br />
road. Therefore, I should change to lane B.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From another perspective, I have just arrived at the
</em><br />
road and there was no particular reason for me to 
<br />
initially choose lane A or lane B, so that I could just
<br />
as well have started on the faster lane, and changing
<br />
would be undesirable. From this perspective, there
<br />
is no gain in changing lanes, on average.
<br />
<br />Extending the argument, suppose I drive for a couple
<br />
of miles, and get to another point where I want to decide
<br />
if I should change lanes. Since I had no reason to
<br />
change lanes a couple of miles ago, I still have no reason
<br />
to do so now. Unless, of course, I can clearly see that
<br />
the next lane is faster, but adding that assumption changes
<br />
the problem completely.
<br />
<br />Where is the flaw?
<br />
<br />Eric.
