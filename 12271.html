<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; If slavery could be scientifically shown to promote the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; well-being of the species as a whole does that mean we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; should have slavery? Does it mean that slavery is good?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Teaching that slavery is &quot;bad&quot; is similar to teaching that lying is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;bad&quot;.  In each case it's a narrow over-simplification of a more general
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; principle of what works. Children are taught simplified modes of moral
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reasoning to match their smaller context of understanding. At one end of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a moral scale are the moral instincts (experienced as pride, disgust,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; etc.) that are an even more condensed form of &quot;knowledge&quot; of what worked
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the environment of evolutionary adaptation. Further up the scale are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cultural--including religious--laws and even the patterns of our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; language that further codify and reinforce patterns of interaction that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; worked well enough and broadly enough to be taken as principles of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;right&quot; action. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Relatively few of us take the leap beyond the morality that was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inherited or given to us, to grasp the broader and more extensible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understanding of morality as patterns of behavior assessed as promoting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; increasingly shared values over increasing scope. Society discourages
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; individual thinking about what is and what is not moral; indeed, it is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; defining characteristic that moral principles subsume both narrow self
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interest and narrow situational awareness.  For this reason, one can not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assess the absolute morality of an action in isolation, but we can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; legitimately speak of the relative morality of a class of behavior
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; within context.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Just as lying can clearly be the right action within a specific context
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (imagine having one's home invaded and being unable, on moral grounds,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to lie to the invaders about where the children are hiding!), the moral
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; issue of slavery can be effectively understood only within a larger
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; context. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The practice of slavery (within a specific context) can be beneficial to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; society; numerous examples exist of slavery contributing to the economic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; good of a locale, and on a grander scale, the development of western
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; philosophy (including democracy!) as a result of freeing some from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; drudgery of manual labor and creating an environment conducive to deeper
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thought.  And as we seek to elucidate a general principle regarding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; slavery, we come face-to-face with other instances of this class of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem, including rights of women to vote, the moral standing of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sentient beings of various degrees of awareness (farm animals, the great
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; apes, artificial intelligences), and even the idea that all &quot;men&quot;, of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; disparate mental or emotional capability, are &quot;created equal&quot;?  Could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there be a principle constituting a coherent positive-sum stance toward
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; issues of moral interaction between agents of inherently different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; awareness and capabilities?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Are we as a society yet ready to adopt a higher level of social
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; decision-making, &quot;moral&quot; to the extent that it effectively promotes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; increasingly shared values over increasing scope, one that provides an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; increasingly clear vision of effective interaction between agents of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; diverse and varying capabilities, or are going to hold tightly to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; previous best model, one that comfortingly but childishly insists on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fiction of some form of strict equality between agents?  Are we mature
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; enough to see that just at the point in human progress where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; technological development (biotech, nanotech, AI) threatens to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; drastically disrupt that which we value, we are gaining the necessary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tools to organize at a higher level--effectively a higher level of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wisdom?
</em><br />
<br />Well, I think slavery is bad, even if it does help society - unless we were actually 
<br />
in danger of extiction without it or something. So yes, the moral rules must bend 
<br />
in the face of changing circumstances, but the point at which they bend will be 
<br />
different for each individual, and there is no objective way to define what this 
<br />
point would or should be.
<br />
<br />Slightly off topic, I don't see why we would design AI's to experience emotions 
<br />
such as resentment, anger, fear, pain etc. In fact, if we could reprogram our 
<br />
own minds at will, it would be a very different world. Suppose you were upset 
<br />
because you lost your job. You might decide to stay upset to the degree that it 
<br />
remains a motivating factor to look for other work, but not affect your sleep, 
<br />
ability to experience pleasure, etc. If you can't find work you might decide to 
<br />
downgrade your expectations, so that you are just as content having less money 
<br />
or a menial job, or just as content for the next six months but then have the 
<br />
motivation to look for interesting work kick in again, but without the confidence- 
<br />
and enthusiasm-sapping disappointment that comes from repeated failure to 
<br />
find work. Or any variation on the above you can imagine.
