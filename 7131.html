<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; OK but it can be misleading (especially in advanced stuff!). neither a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; program, nor a machine nor a body nor a brain can think. A person can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; think, and manifest eself (I follow Patrick for the pronouns) through 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; program, or a machine or a brain, ....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Actually, I think I was the one introducing these 3rd person neutral
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pronouns (e, er &amp; em). I picked up the habit from Michael Spivak
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (well known mathematician).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Doesn't this beg the question a bit as to what a &quot;person&quot; really is?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In loose everyday conversation, a person is a member of the species
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; homo sapiens. However, surely we don't want to rule out the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possibility of other conscious things before we even start. And also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as you mention below, there are odd corner cases - the sleeping human
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being etc.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I just identify the first person with the knower. Think about someone 
<br />
being &quot;cutted&quot; in Brussels and being pasted in thwo cities: A and B, 
<br />
and nowhere else. Each copy makes an experience, one in A, the other in 
<br />
B. Each of them know where they have been reconsituted and so each of 
<br />
them get one bit of information. But this bit is uncommunicable from a 
<br />
third person point of view. An outsider would get 0 bit from a phone 
<br />
call by each copy (by default I assume the cut/past device is 100% 
<br />
reliable.
<br />
I identify the third person with the body or with any third person 
<br />
description of the body, it could be program (with comp). Despite 
<br />
Jonathan (I know you agrees with me) I consider as fundamental to 
<br />
distinguish the 1-person knower from the 3-person body/brain/program. 
<br />
So when I say that only a person can think, I am really meaning a 
<br />
1-person.
<br />
What is cute with comp, is that the theatetus definition of knowledge 
<br />
(and most of its variants) leads to a well defined distinction between 
<br />
1 and 3 person. What is nice also, is that the knower is not, in any 
<br />
way, 3-describable (we get freely a 
<br />
Brouwerian-Heraclitean-Bergsonian-Poincarean ... theory of 
<br />
conscious-time-duration... at the place where we would the least expect 
<br />
it ).
<br />
<br />For the modalist I recall this consists in defining knowing p by 
<br />
proving p and p is true: Cp = Bp &amp; p. The non equivalence follows from 
<br />
incompleteness.
<br />
<br />&lt;snip&gt;: &lt;I snip when I agree, or when I believe the disagreement would 
<br />
push us outside the main topic&gt;
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Church-Turing thesis and arithmetical platonism (my all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; description strings condition fulfills a similar role to arithmetical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; platonism) are enough.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I am not so sure. You are not always clear if the strings describe the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; equivalent of a program (be it an universal program or not), or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; describes a computations (be it finite or infinite).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Both actually. One can feed a description into the input tape of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; UTM, hence it becomes a program. They may also be generated by a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; program running on a machine.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I was not making that distinction. I was distinguishing between a 
<br />
program (being a product of another program or not) and the 
<br />
computation, that is the running of the program. The computation can be 
<br />
described by the description of the trace of the program (like when we 
<br />
debug a program). For example the basic program &quot;10 goto 10&quot; has an 
<br />
infinite trace, like 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 ...
<br />
<br />That distinction is primordial for the understanding of the work of the 
<br />
Universal Dovetailer which dovetails on all programs. The UD generates 
<br />
all programs and dovetail on all their executions. The possibility or 
<br />
consistency of this is a consequence of Church's thesis.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; eventually is related to bunch of (sheaves of) infinite computations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; they can be coded by infinite strings, but they are not programs.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is this  because they are ultimately not computable (due to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inherent indeterminism)?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I don't think so. It is just because for any computational states there 
<br />
are an infinity of computations going through that states, and this is 
<br />
a logical &quot;cause&quot; of the 1-person indeterminacy (given that the 
<br />
1-person are not aware of the huge &quot;delays&quot; (number of steps of the 
<br />
execution of the UD). This is one line summary of the UDA (see my URL 
<br />
for links to longer explanation).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; There are various strengthenings of the CT thesis which are far from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; obvious, and even false in some cases. One of my criticisms of your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; work is that I'm not sure you aren't using one of the strong CT
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theses, but we can come back to that.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I am using the original thesis by Church, Post, Markov, Turing, ... 
<br />
They are equivalent and can be summarizes &quot;anachronically&quot; by all 
<br />
universal digital machine computes the same functions from N to N.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; This obviates
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; having to fix the UTM. Perhaps this is the route into the anthropic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; principle.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ? Church's thesis just say things does not depend on which UTM you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; choose initially
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; All programs need to be interpreted with respect to a particular
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine. The machine can be changed by appeal to universal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computation, but then the program needs to be translated as well. But
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then, I'm sure you know all this.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Yes, sure. Remember that I postulate arithmetical truth (well a tiny 
<br />
subset of it). The whole work of the UD is entirely embedded in the 
<br />
arithmetical truth. The movie graph argument shows we cannot (with 
<br />
comp) distinguish &quot;real world&quot; with virtual world with (modal) 
<br />
arithmetical world (where a world in that last setting can be described 
<br />
by maximal consistent extension).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Finally, there is the possibility that a concrete observer (the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; noumenon) exists somewhere, and that &quot;conscious descriptions&quot; are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; merely the anthropic &quot;shadow&quot; of the observer being observed by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; itself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Again this is to fuzzy for me. I can agree and I can disagree.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; With COMP, I'm sure you disagree. Chapter 4 of your thesis directly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argues against this possibility. I don't really agree with it either,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but cannot rule it out once COMP is relaxed.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I am glad you see this!  Actually the word &quot;concrete&quot; is provably an 
<br />
&quot;indexical&quot; with comp. It has only a relative meaning like the word &quot;I&quot; 
<br />
(in third person!), or &quot;modern&quot; of &quot;now&quot;, etc.  (of course the 1-person 
<br />
&quot;I&quot; is absolute, so much that the 1-person &quot;I&quot; is just unameable by any 
<br />
3-person describable &quot;I&quot;). Well here we must go to modal logic to make 
<br />
this clear).
<br />
<br />(Note: it is here that I depart from Derek Parfit theory of personal 
<br />
identity where he argues that &quot;we&quot; are token, where I pretend that with 
<br />
comp we are necessarily type.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; just saying that we say with &quot;a machine can think &quot; it is an abuse of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; language for &quot;the person associate to that machine is thinking&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Bruno
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Are you saying that it is an abuse of the language to say that my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer maps O(x) can think? In which case I'd agree with you (and I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have never made that particular language abuse that I can recall).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, I consider human beings to be machines of a particular kind,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and I do consider human beings to think. Of course &quot;machine&quot; in this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; case has only a rather loose connection to the machine of theoretical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computer science (the abstract Turing machine).
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />Yes, I see what you mean (I think), but the problem with that kind of 
<br />
talk is that it looks like Searle or Jonathan (recently) way of 
<br />
talking. By being clear about the fact that it is really the 1-person 
<br />
who thinks and never his brain or body or any 3-description related to 
<br />
that 1-person (always by assumption), you can prevent the confusion 
<br />
between the 1-person and the 3-person. Sorry if that remarks just seems 
<br />
to be about pedagogy, but given that the &quot;measure&quot; problem needs to be 
<br />
clear on that distinction I think it is important to be as clear as 
<br />
possible about it.
<br />
Instead of saying that comp entails that machine can think, it is less 
<br />
misleading to say that comp entails machine can vehiculate a knower, 
<br />
who is the one which can think. The day &quot;we&quot; can be vehiculated through 
<br />
the net in digital form, people will learn that difference by 
<br />
experience ...
