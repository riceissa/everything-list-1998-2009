<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a selfish viewpoint: the relative measure of the next moment:
</em><br />
<br />So let me try an interesting variant on the experiment.  I think someone
<br />
else proposed this recently, the idea of &quot;retroactive causation&quot;.
<br />
I won't put that exact spin on it though.
<br />
<br />Suppose you will again be simultaneously teleported to Washington
<br />
and Moscow.  This time you will have just one copy waking up in each.
<br />
Then you will expect 50-50 odds.  But suppose that after one hour,
<br />
the copy in Moscow gets switched to the parallel computer so it is
<br />
running with 10 times the measure; 10 copies.  And suppose that you know
<br />
beforehand that during that high-measure time period (after one hour)
<br />
in Moscow you will experience some event E.
<br />
<br />What is your subjective probability beforehand for experiencing E?
<br />
I think you agreed that if you had been woken up in Moscow on
<br />
the super-parallel computer that you would expect a 90% chance of
<br />
experiencing E.  But now we have interposed a time delay, in which your
<br />
measure starts off at 1 in Moscow and then increases to 10.  Does that
<br />
make a difference in how likely you are to experience E?
<br />
<br />I am wondering if you think it makes sense that you would expect a 50%
<br />
probability of experiencing events which take place in Moscow while
<br />
your measure is 1, but a 90% probability of experiencing events like
<br />
E, which take place while your measure is 10?  I'm not sure about this
<br />
myself, because I am skeptical about this continuity-of-identity idea.
<br />
But perhaps, in your framework, this would offer a solution to the
<br />
problem you keep asking, of some way to notice or detect when your
<br />
measure increases.
<br />
<br />In that case we would say that you could notice when your measure
<br />
increases because it would increase your subjective probability of
<br />
experiencing events.
<br />
<br />Perhaps we could even go back to the thought experiment where you have
<br />
alternating days of high measure and low measure.  Think of multiple
<br />
lockstep copies being created on high measure days and destroyed on low
<br />
measure days.  Suppose before beginning this procedure you flip a quantum
<br />
coin (in the MWI) and will only undergo it if the coin comes up heads.
<br />
Now, could you have a subjective anticipation of 50% of experiencing the
<br />
events you know will happen on low-measure days, but an anticipation of
<br />
90% of experiencing the events you know will happen on high-measure days?
<br />
Then that would be a tangible difference, and you would be justified in
<br />
pre-arranging your affairs so that pleasant events happen on the high
<br />
measure days and unpleasant ones happen on the low measure days.
<br />
<br />It's an interesting concept in any case.  I need to think about it more,
<br />
but I'd be interested to hear your views.
