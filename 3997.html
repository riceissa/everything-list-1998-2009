I'll say a few words on my personal journey in math.
<br />

<br />I don't place _too_ much importance on which fields is the parent and 
<br />
which is the child. My personal journey in physics drifted away from 
<br />
spacetime stuff almost 30 years ago, as I sought to prepare myself for 
<br />
a career by moving more into solid state physics. I read the popular 
<br />
accounts of guys like Kip Thorne on black holes, but thought it was far 
<br />
removed from anything in my life. And aside from reading Rucker (&quot;Mind 
<br />
Tools&quot; is one of my favorites), Gardner, Devlin, W.W. Sawyer, Halmos, 
<br />
and the recent accounts of logic (Hofstadter, Smullyan), I hadn't 
<br />
looked at math in many years.
<br />
<br />This changed half a year ago when I was reading Greg Egan's &quot;Distress,&quot; 
<br />
with the &quot;All Topologies Model&quot; idea, then John Baez's site, then Lee 
<br />
Smolin's fabulous book &quot;Three Roads to Quantum Gravity.&quot; And I was 
<br />
starting to learn about category theory, which I had only _heard_ of 
<br />
before, but had never had the slightest clue about.
<br />
<br />As I have said here before, the stuff on category theory and 
<br />
(especially) topos theory, spoke to me in a way that was compelling. 
<br />
Whether it is algebra or logic or topology/geometry, it's for me the 
<br />
right approach. It provides a set of tools and, more importantly, a set 
<br />
of concepts for unifying a bunch of things. The unification of geometry 
<br />
and logic via algebra is compelling to me.
<br />
<br />But maybe not to others. Wei Dai asked me to recommend just one book, 
<br />
so I picked Lawvere and Schanuel's &quot;Conceptual Mathematics: A first 
<br />
introduction to categories.&quot; Well, WD reported that he had not found 
<br />
anything relevant to his interests, so...&quot;different strokes for 
<br />
different folks.&quot;
<br />
<br />For me, the categorification approach unifies and makes sense of causal 
<br />
sets, modal logic, possible worlds semantics, probability, and the 
<br />
nature of time.
<br />
<br />And it's fun. This is by far the most important thing, that it 
<br />
stimulates me to delve into so many areas.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; There are also many built-in biases in mathematical and theoretical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and one of them in my opinion is the bias toward dissolution of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; geometry at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the sub-Planck level.    Part of this is the pre-quantum computer bias
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; toward the discrete and finite or at most countably infinite and the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; digital
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; vs analog computer bias (in favor of digital computers).   The real 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; line and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; real line segments of course are uncountably infinite and connected, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thee would essentially be no applied mathematics or mathematical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; example without it - and not much pure mathematics either.
</em><br />
<br />I'm essentially a constructivist. I believe the abstractions about R^N 
<br />
(real line, real plane, real space, etc.) are useful, and that even the 
<br />
Axiom of Choice is useful, but I'm not sure any of these platonic 
<br />
ideals exist outside of Reality. Brouwerian pragmatism in Cantor's 
<br />
paradise.
<br />
<br />But the views are not contradictory. Topos theory gives us a set of 
<br />
tools for constructing mathematical universes. Paul Taylor puts it well 
<br />
in his recent book, &quot;Practical Foundations of Mathematics,&quot; when he 
<br />
says that the apparently conflicting views of Platonism vs. Formalism 
<br />
can be reconciled through these modern results.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I hope that we can resist the temptation to go into absolutes.   I am 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; glad
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to see that you started your reply with a tolerant and compromising 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tone,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and I will end this posting with a similar tone.
</em><br />
<br />My tone may be an accident of how I was writing at that particular 
<br />
time! (insert silly smiley here as you wish).
<br />
<br />I have no reason to be partisan on these issues. I don't know what time 
<br />
is, and I doubt anyone does. But I see glimpses, and new concepts, 
<br />
which are giving me what I think is a more useful understanding than 
<br />
any I got back when I was studying relativity intensively! (I may have 
<br />
been too young, or too focussed, or too worried about a career, or just 
<br />
not exposed to the wonderful mathematics I'm now aware of.)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The discrete and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; connected are in my opinion different theories or parts of different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theories overall, and they are also parts of different 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interpretations.   My
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; view is that science progresses by tolerating different theories and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different interpretations for competition and because many supposedly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wrong
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theories or interpretations end up much later having something useful 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contribute.
</em><br />
<br />I agree. However, this argues for spending some more time on the 
<br />
&quot;discrete&quot; view, as certainly the _continuous_ view of space and time 
<br />
has dominated for most of the past century (time lines, time as a 
<br />
river, the flow of time, Riemannian manifolds, etc.).
<br />
<br />In particular, whether space and time &quot;really&quot; are discrete at the 
<br />
Planck scale or &quot;continuous all the way down&quot; (to 10^-35 cm, 10^-50 cm, 
<br />
10^-100 cm, etc.), is not what I am thinking about right now. It may 
<br />
not even matter, except for the unification of QM and gravity, the main 
<br />
reason for trying to resolve this issue.
<br />
<br />Rather, I am more interested in the issue of ordered sets and lattices, 
<br />
posets especially, for the study of time and causality at human scales. 
<br />
(Without going into details, here, there are issues relating to the 
<br />
nature of belief and trust which have to do with these causal orders 
<br />
and possible worlds. I've hinted at some of these points in other posts 
<br />
here...someday I'll solidify enough of the swirling ideas to summarize 
<br />
them.)
<br />
<br />I agree strongly with Lee Smolin that topos theory (and related ideas, 
<br />
tools) is not just the right logic for dealing with quantum cosmology, 
<br />
it is also the right logic for dealing with a huge number of other 
<br />
things.
