<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I am afraid this is nonsense. Obviously I can count the outputs of

</em><br />
<br />By generating a real I mean that the program generates bigger and
<br />
bigger portion of that real. And for *each* real the dovetailer
<br />
generates those portions.  For the same reason the simpler program

<br />will *generate*, if it doesn't stop, each positive real written 
<br />
in binary and less than 1. Of course at each step the line
<br />
are approximation of uncountably many reals. Sure! I am not
<br />
pretending the UD *enumerates* the set of all the reals.
<br />
<br />All what I say is that for each real, the dovetailer
<br />
will generate all its prefixes in succession. We can argue 
<br />
it is a bad idea to use the word ``generate&quot;, but the important 
<br />
point is the following derivation. (Because the fact that ALL 
<br />
the reals play a role is linked to the FIRST person points of 
<br />
view. I explain below).
<br />
<br />Let us suppose comp. That is let us suppose there is a level such that
<br />
I survive a digital substitution. (OK with that ?)
<br />
And then I am duplicable.  (3-duplicable).
<br />
<br />Let us suppose I am duplicated. I am annihilated at Brussels and
<br />
recontituted at both Washington and Moscow.
<br />
<br />By comp I survive. I cannot predict with certainty where I will feel
<br />
myself (1-person point of view) after the experiment. If I predict
<br />
Washington the one in Moscow knows that I was wrong of being sure. Idem
<br />
if I predict Moscow. I cannot predict I will feel being at both place,
<br />
(because I will not *feel* being at both places, or comp is false),
<br />
and if I predict  nowhere, then by definition I will die and comp is 
<br />
false again.
<br />
<br />So there is an uncertainty on the domain of reconstitution. OK ?
<br />
Self-duplicability entails first person indeterminacy.
<br />
(You can formalize that with duplication of inference inductive
<br />
machines + Kolmogorof complexity).  I mean there is no magic 
<br />
use of ``consciousness&quot; in the first person concept). OK with that ?
<br />
(It correspond to the use of the word ``subjective&quot; in Everett's paper).
<br />
<br />The ``time&quot; invariance lemma says: for all ways I choose to quantify
<br />
that first person undeterminacy, the number (probabilities, 
<br />
credibilities, whatever ...)  remains unchanged if we add 
<br />
arbitrary (but finite) delays in the reconstitution (because the first
<br />
person has no way to be aware of these delays). OK ?
<br />
<br />Now let us run the UD. And let us call S your current computational 
<br />
state.
<br />
<br />Let us first suppose we run the UD for n steps, where
<br />
n is a finite very big number (to fix our mind).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From the invariance lemma it follows that 
</em><br />
the domain of uncertainty is given
<br />
by the set of all the virtual reconstitutions of 
<br />
your state S which
<br />
has occured in that running. Let us call that set S_n
<br />
Now suppose we let the UD never being stopped. Then,
<br />
thanks to the invariance lemma, the uncertainty is given by 
<br />
the union of all the S_n, n positive integer.
<br />
<br />It is an easy exercise to show that we will not succeed to 
<br />
quantify the uncertainty by putting equiprobable weight on all the
<br />
equivalent state S. This entails white noise.
<br />
<br />We must put the weight on the (relative) computationnal
<br />
histories going through S.
<br />
<br />And the set of all infinite computational histories has
<br />
the cardinality of the continuum.
<br />
(It contains the ``stupid&quot; dovetailing on the reals 
<br />
described above!).
<br />
You must not confuse the 3-person point of view
<br />
concerning the actual running of a UD, with the first
<br />
person point of view, which is defined on states independently
<br />
of any time for reaching the states by the UD. That is why the
<br />
union of the S_n is taken on all the natural (N), and that
<br />
is why we must take the uncountable set of all the 
<br />
infinite histories for the domain of the ``probability or
<br />
credibility (whatever) distribution&quot;.
<br />
<br />I am not actually saying that the UD build a non computable 
<br />
object or enumerate an uncountable set, I am merely
<br />
saying that with comp the UD makes sets of non computable 
<br />
object playing a role in the distribution of possible 
<br />
histories *from* the first person point of view of the machines.
<br />
<br />I agree that I say something shocking. At each instant
<br />
I am not multiplied by 10^100 like in deWitt's view of Everett
<br />
formulation of QM, I show that with comp we are multiplied
<br />
a priori by 2^aleph_0, at each instant ...
<br />
I agree it is weird. But is it weirder than Feynman Integral.
<br />
For me Feynman Integral is still weirder ...
<br />
<br />I'm afraid you don't take the difference
<br />
between first and third person into account, or am I wrong ?
<br />
<br />Remember also that, in fine, I use arithmetical realism
<br />
(the UD does not need to be runned).
<br />
This is not constructive. I am not pretending having
<br />
prove that self-aware machine face the continuum, I am 
<br />
merely proving that if we are machine, and if arithmetical
<br />
truth (the continuum of models of arithmetical theories)
<br />
exists independently of me, then self-aware machine
<br />
will be in front of that continuum when trying to 
<br />
quantify their own (comp) undeterminacy.
<br />
<br />In my paper I give a reason to expect the solution of the
<br />
UD explosion of possible futurs could be a Quantum Universal
<br />
Dovetailer (Feynman lesson + Everett insight: the white rabbits
<br />
disappear not because they are rare, but because they are terribly
<br />
numerous and the average white rabbits annihilate themselves
<br />
with their *minus white rabbits*).
<br />
<br />I am at a billion miles isolating the right measure (if it
<br />
exists) but the interview of the sound UTM gives an 
<br />
original and pure (not empiricaly influenced) way to begin
<br />
with.  Finding a semantics for the Z logics should clear
<br />
the way. 
<br />
<br />I hope not having been to long, but please, Juergen, tell
<br />
me exactly where in the above derivation-sketch you want
<br />
to disagree.
<br />
<br />Bruno
