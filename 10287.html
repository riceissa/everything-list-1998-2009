We kill cows to eat them. I feel sure they are conscious beings yet the
<br />
killing goes on.  Inhabitants of simulations or of this world seem to opt
<br />
for what suits them.  However, slavery was changed and maybe animal rights
<br />
will change as we humans get more thoughtful and considerate.  Like I said,
<br />
I hope simulator's are moral.  If the simulator's save the stages though
<br />
they can always resurrect the suffering souls to correct their moral
<br />
mistakes.  As Bostrom says you could always return to some datum point and
<br />
rerun the simulation to get rid of or erase a part which has a lot of
<br />
suffering in it.  Unfortunately, like entropy the sum total of suffering in
<br />
world + simulation always increases.

<br />I see what you mean, of course. However, it's not really what I was
<br />
trying to elicit by my original post. If I were to try to justify my
<br />
actions to you in the sort of way you describe above, I don't think
<br />
you'd be very accepting of this, nor would much of the rest of society.
<br />
I don't mean to say that there isn't a great deal of hypocrisy and
<br />
deviation from ethical conduct in the real world, but unless one is
<br />
prepared to discard the project of working together to make things
<br />
better rather than worse, I believe that we should take ethical
<br />
dialogue seriously. My sense is that much more advanced civilisations
<br />
would have developed in this area too, not just technologically - for
<br />
one thing, they have presumably found ways to live in harmony and not
<br />
self-destruct.  So at the least these issues would have meaning for
<br />
them.
<br />
<br />That's why I feel that your dismissal of the issues isn't very
<br />
illuminating. BTW, I don't intend this as a complaint, I'm just
<br />
clarifying what I had in mind in my original questions - that it would
<br />
be interesting to explore the ethical dimensions of possible simulaters
<br />
and their simulations. I think you're saying that we can't know and
<br />
shouldn't care, which I don't find very interesting.
<br />
<br />As a challenge to your view, might I suggest that in your example re
<br />
the E. coli - if we knew that the E. coli was conscious and had
<br />
feelings, we might be more concerned about it. Do you think it's a
<br />
reasonable assumption that technologists capable enough to include us
<br />
in their simulation, regardless of their 'ultimate purpose', would a)
<br />
not know we had consciousness and feelings, or b) not care, and if so,
<br />
on what justification? Or is this simply unfathomable? I'm not asking
<br />
rhetorically, I'm really interested.
