<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; From the perspective of any one instance of S(.) within the structure, no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; matter how huge and complex it is, there is a 'perspective' view of any

other point in the structure. That 'view' is the view that is 'as-if'

you
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; walked all the way down to the bottom of the hierarchy to a common
</em><br />
ancestor (parent) S(.) element and then walked all the way up the
<br />
structure to the S(.) that you are viewing from wherever you were. This
<br />
is
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; a direct causal chain. Connected/organised S(.) literally are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; causality/causal chains.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; This property is inherent or intrinsic or innate to any structure of S(.),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; regardless of the details of S(.). I posit that this 'visibility', or
</em><br />
at
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; least the potential for it, is fundamental to the generation of qualia.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, good language. 'This visibility, or at least the potential for it',
</em><br />
is the heart of my intuitions about the primacy of the 1st-person - i.e.
<br />
'I' am an indexical lens on a manifestly/ ubiqitously/
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unmediatedly/ relflexively/ revealingly behaving 1st-person gestalt
</em><br />
(badly needs abbreviating, but all the adverbs are required).
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />OK. Let's go with this explanation for the 'potential' for a view as
<br />
instrinsic to the structure.
<br />
<br />Remember: in this model of reality one organisation of S(.) is space,
<br />
another and atom, another a scientist inclusive of yet another called
<br />
qualia. All the same.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; If one S(.) has some sort of proto-experience, then cohorts of S(.) acting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; coherently will combine their proto-experiences in the manner of the
</em><br />
collective behaviour of the cohort.
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Having arrived at this point we have said nothing about the nature of
</em><br />
&quot;what it is like&quot; i.e. that the visibility thus conferred has any
<br />
particular quality to it..light, sound, taste and so on. You can
<br />
imagine
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; this is being cohorts of S(.) behaving in different ways for different
</em><br />
subjective qualities.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, this is in essence what I've been trying to express in my dialogue
</em><br />
with Peter, where I've used 'structure' as the static equivalent of
<br />
'behaviour'. He doesn't believe that qualia have this aspect of
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure or behaviour, and I'm not sure how debatable this is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indexically, but IMO it's strongly suggested by experiential
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correlation with physical processes.
</em><br />
<br />I think Peter's blockage may be the usual...difficulty imagining how space
<br />
and matter can be differently organised collections of the same primitive.
<br />
When any 'matter' behaves at the top of the hierarchy it drages the entire
<br />
hierarchy with it. At some deep layer space and the matter become an
<br />
expression of a common parent. Imagine making a universe out of lots of
<br />
identical elastic bands. You'd have to make structure for a) space and
<br />
then structures called b) matter that can move around in it. The only way
<br />
you could do this is by inventing some sort of common parent structure
<br />
that enables a) to move around inside b) naturally.
<br />
<br />What would elastic band qualia look like? Imagine how you would contrive
<br />
an elastic band qualia in an elastic band scientist.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The fundamental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'what-it's-likeness' of cohorts (or modalities) of qualia is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; incommunicable, though not incommensurable, because they are the
</em><br />
instantiation of information, not information itself, which is
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; abstracted from their structural/ behavioural relations. This primary
</em><br />
representation appears analogically (i.e. what it's *like*) with
<br />
digital-ness a second-order derivation (using analogic qualia as bits).
<br />
<br />My simplified language for this would be that qualia are simply a
<br />
measurement spoken into your head by the structure. All qualia are 'about'
<br />
the rest of the structure. The measurement does not have to be accurate.
<br />
It merely has to be repeatable. Lets say we see an omnidirectional field
<br />
of redness when in the presence of an elephant. This is our perception of
<br />
elephantness. Have we correctly depicted an elephant in any way? Nope.
<br />
It's 100% innacurate in that regard. Are we able to know conclusively we
<br />
are in the presence of an elephant? Absolutely.
<br />
<br />What is important is that in the above weird universe of perception we
<br />
would not call the experience redness. We'd call it 'elephantness'. This
<br />
experience is our entire and only reality. The production of
<br />
'elephantness' qualia is the only reality owned by the perceiver. The
<br />
issue of the intrinsic privacy of that measurement is irrelevant to this.
<br />
The issue of intentionality - the 'aboutness' of the experience - as to
<br />
whether it applies to 'self' or 'not-self', is merely one of organisation.
<br />
I could look at my hand and get a 'redness' field. It's up to me to
<br />
somehow discriminate my hand from an elephant. More/different qualia are
<br />
needed...and so on.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; B) The structure expresses a quale. The structure behaves quale-ly.
</em><br />
From
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the perspective of being the structure that does this behaviour quale-ness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is experienced. In the direction of the quale is perceived a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'perspective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; view' of character 'qualeness'. (tough language, this!) This is
</em><br />
'matter'
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; but has intentionality. It is intrinsically 'about' something
</em><br />
elsewhere.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, this reiterates the point about analogy or metaphor. Language is
</em><br />
rooted in metaphor, and the 'what-is-it-like?' regression has to
<br />
originate somewhere.  This point of origin is the 'like this!'
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; character of 'qualeness'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; David
</em><br />
<br />Bless Thomas Nagel for showing us the poet's cul-de-sac!
<br />
<br />To me metaphor is far more. IMO you could literally replace the word
<br />
'metaphor' with the words 'associative memory'. You can literally replace
<br />
the word 'metaphor' for perception. The former has no intrinsic
<br />
experiential qualities (until recall) and the latter literally is
<br />
experiential quality.
<br />
<br />This includes all scientific laws. Scientific laws correlate appearances
<br />
in a percptual slice across the structure that our brains deliver to us as
<br />
experience. That the law may usefully predict the behaviour within the
<br />
perceptual field is merely that. a useful property of the underlying
<br />
structure in the context of a human made of it, perceiving it. No more.
<br />
<br />Which brings us back to 'dual aspect' science, of course. The science of
<br />
the structure aspect that describes the structure that then....delivers
<br />
appearances (experienced qualia as metaphors for the structure) and the
<br />
science of apearances that give us our usual empirical laws (as metaphors
<br />
for the contents of the appearances).
<br />
<br />Notice we're making a whole bunch of progress here without talking about
<br />
quantum mechanics or computation, but by just looking at what is going on
<br />
in ourselves and around us and describing it simply? :-)
