<br />Well, in a sense no &quot;consciousness&quot; are associated with, let us

say, substancial things. (Matter in a general sense can survive, for

<br />I don't know. Each time I go out of my body I wake up, or I made
<br />
lucid dream (dreams where you bet you are dreaming).
<br />
<br />With comp a substancial spirit cannot go out of a substancial body,
<br />
because neither exist.
<br />
<br />Nevertheless a success in psychokinesis would not refute comp. It would
<br />
be a powerful argument that our level of substitution is very low, 
<br />
perhaps.
<br />
(I find it not very plausible imo).
<br />
<br />I was used to say I will believe in psychokinesis if someone
<br />
writes a program in FORTRAN capable to bend a fork. Note that the 
<br />
special quantum KILL-THE-USER machine can probably do that succesfully
<br />
from the point of view of the user! (appendice on QM in my thesis).
<br />
But it is hard to imagine a more pathetic and egocentric way to bend
<br />
reality! (Also you must be sure that the probability of a quantum bending
<br />
is higher that the probability you should die with the killing 
<br />
instruction.
<br />

<br />I know someone who, after some shock, has the OBE *experience* every
<br />
ten seconds, and it seems to be rather handicaping, especially for
<br />
concentration.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I'm not sure I grasp the concept of duplicates in arithmetic.
</em><br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<br />It is not so easy. You see, Godel proves his incompleteness
<br />
theorem by &quot;duplicating&quot; PEANO ARITHMETIC (PA) *in* arithmetic.
<br />
Today you can more easily prove incompleteness phenomenon for
<br />
machines by duplicating the machine in the language of the
<br />
machine. But for my purpose it seems at some time we should
<br />
take the time to work on a particular &quot;duplication&quot; of this
<br />
type. The main point is that you can represent the functionning
<br />
of a machine (or an axiomatiosable theory) in term of purely
<br />
arithmetical relation between number. If you know how a (classical)
<br />
computer work, you should guess that such a translation is 
<br />
possible. In fact a small (and generable) subset of the set
<br />
of arithmetical true proposition is rich enough for being a
<br />
universal programming language. Basically logic + positive 
<br />
integer addition and  multiplication are enough.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Arithmetic is abstract and immaterial.  There can be duplicate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;representations of 2+2=4 but I don't see how there can be duplicate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;facts in Platonia corresponding to 2+2=4. As an immaterial fact of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;logic it can't be duplicated because there can be no distinction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;between two instances of it.
</em><br />
<br /><br />But 2+2=4 is really what I take to be true in Platonia, by
<br />
which I mean essentially &quot;true independently of myself.
<br />
An arithmetical representation of &quot;2+2=4&quot; would be something like
<br />
<br />2^(Godel number of '2') * 3^(Godel number of '+')
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* 5^((Godel number of '2') * 7^(Godel number of '=')
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* 11^(Godel number of '4')
<br />
<br />That is, a number.
<br />
('4' is s(s(s(s(O)))), and its godel number is generated
<br />
in a similar way. Note the use of prime numbers for being
<br />
sure of univocity in encoding).
<br />
<br />But 2+2=4 can incarnate itself in long computations, like
<br />
I dring 2 cups of coffee this morning and two at noon, which
<br />
mades already 4 cup of (strong italian) coffee today, ouh la la!
<br />
<br />Here 2+2=4 has been incarnate in a incredible story mixing
<br />
superstrings (in the electron of the hydrogen atom of the
<br />
water molecule of my coffee), but also in my brain, etc.
<br />
By comp such histories are generated by the arithmetical UD 
<br />
and &quot;feeled&quot; (if that is english) by &quot;me&quot; many &quot;times&quot;. 
<br />
The arithmetical relation  corresponding to those 
<br />
computational histories are atemporally, asubstancially, 
<br />
aspatially, if I can say, in Plato Heaven, well, even in 
<br />
Pythagore Heaven (by Church-Turing-Post-Markov-Kleene thesis).
