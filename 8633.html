<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; guilty; being sentenced to death but getting off on appeal; being

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; pardoned by the Governor at the last moment; finding that you are one of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the 1/billion people who have a natural resistance to the lethal agent.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Only your last scenario is causally connected to having received a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;lethal injection.  What does &quot;shunted&quot; mean in the above?  Once I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;experience having had the injection, how would I get &quot;shunted&quot; to any of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the preceding outcomes?
</em><br />
<br />I meant that looking at your future prospects, it is more likely that you 
<br />
end up not facing the near-death situation in the first place, rather than 
<br />
facing it and escaping somehow by the skin of your teeth (to put it mildly). 
<br />
But you are right, there will be versions of you who will face situations 
<br />
from which escape would appear very improbable, or near-impossible.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; If that all falls through, you might find that your arrest and execution
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; was all part of a dream, or that you were actually executed but your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; head was preserved and you were resurrected as a computer upload in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; future, or you were resurrected as a result of brute force emulation of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; every possible human mind in the very far future. These latter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; possibilities may be more likely than quantum tunneling to a tropical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; island, but in the final analysis, however unlikely the escape route may
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; be, if its probability is non-zero, then it *has* to happen, doesn't it?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;These scenarios are all causally connected to having been lethally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;injected.  But your final question goes to the heart of the issue I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;raised.  What is the likeliest scenario which includes the memory of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;being lethally injected?  Are there always non-zero probability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;outcomes, which, according to MWI, must be realized somewhere?
</em><br />
<br />Here is Brent Meeker's comment on this post from 16 December 2005:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Only if the number of chances has a high enough cardinality.  Suppose you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are digitally generating all the continuous functions over the interval 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(0,1).  Your generator can come closer and closer to approximating this set 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of functions, but it can't generate all of them because their cardinality 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is higher than that of the integers.  So is depends on what &quot;possiblities&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;means.  Just &quot;we can imagine it&quot;, or &quot;it isn't self contrdictory&quot; is too 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;loose to be meaningful.
</em><br />
<br />I think when we say &quot;anything imaginable&quot; or &quot;every possible experience&quot; we 
<br />
are talking about a much more limited number of things than may at first 
<br />
seem to be the case. Since there are 10^10 neurons in the human brain, a 
<br />
reasonable upper limit for the number of possible mental states is 2^10^10 ( 
<br />
if you allow that the significant factor in cognition is whether each neuron 
<br />
is &quot;on&quot; or &quot;off&quot;), and a maximum upper limit is set by the Beckenstein bound 
<br />
for a brain-sized object. These are very large but finite numbers, and they 
<br />
will remain finite even if in the far future brains grow to the size of 
<br />
Jupiter, so there should be no problem fitting every possible thought of a 
<br />
finite brain into the multiverse. Of course, even if your brain is the size 
<br />
of Jupiter, you will eventually start repeating mental states, but 
<br />
dissatisfaction with this is dissatisfaction with being limited to &quot;just&quot; 
<br />
every possible experience.
