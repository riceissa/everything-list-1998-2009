<br />You're right! Every time I post on these topics I *know* I'm wrong: I
<br />
just don't know how specifically, but I keep doing it in the hope that
<br />
someone will show me. Trouble is, there's something about this area
<br />
that resists us - we seem doomed to come at it all wrong (particularly
<br />
in those moments when we think we've got it right!) It's the struggle
<br />
that fascinates us, I suppose.

<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have the feeling that we are discussing words. Everybody tries how to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'make sense' of them, in a personal &quot;taste&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Colin expressed it in his usual sophisticated ways, Ben more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comprehensively, in many more words. The fact is: we observe the observer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (ourselves) and want to describe it to others.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The American 'slang' comes to mind: Consciousness Smonciousness - do we get
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anywhere with it? whether a device 'looks at' or we see if somebody
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understands what he sees?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; During the early 90s I gave up thinking ABOUT consciousness, it seemed a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; futile task with everybody speaking about something else. Now I see a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reasonable topic behind it: &quot;ourselves&quot; - the object with which I struggle
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lately to identify (for myself about myself, which is the crux of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem). I see no point to explain it to others: they will not get the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'real' image (only the interpreted (their) 1st person view of me).

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Colin, Stathis, Brent,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1. I think we need to distinguish a cybernetic, self-adjusting system like a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sidewinder missile, from an inference-processing, self-_redesigning_ system
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like an intelligent being (well, not redesigning itself biologically, at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; least as of now).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Somehow we're code-unbound to some sufficient extent that, as a result, we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can test our representations, interpretations, our systems, habits, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;codes&quot; of representation and interpretation, rather than leaving that task
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entirely to biological evolution which tends to punish bad &quot;interpretations&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by removal of the interpreter from the gene pool.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There's something more than represented objects (sources), the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; representations (encodings), and the interpretations (decodings). This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;something more&quot; is the recipient, to whom falls any task of finding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; redundancies and inconsistencies between the message (or message set) and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the rest of the world, such that the recipient -- I'm unsure how to put
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this -- is the one, or stands as the one, who deals with the existential
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consequences and for whom tests by subjection to existential consequences
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are meaningful; the recipient is in a sense a figuration of existential
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consequences as bearing upon the system's design. It's from a design-testing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; viewpoint that one re-designs the communication system itself; the recipient
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; role in that sense is the role which includes the role of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;evolutionator&quot; (as CA's governor might call it). In other words, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recipient is, in logical terms, the recognizer, the (dis-)verifier, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (dis-)corroborator, etc., and verification (using &quot;verification&quot; as the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; forest term for the various trees) is that &quot;something more&quot; than object,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; representation, interpretation. Okay, so far I'm just trying to distinguish
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an intelligence from a possibly quite vegetable-level information processs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with a pre-programmed menu of feedback-based responses and behavior
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; adjustments.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2. Verificatory bases are nearest us, while the entities &amp; laws by appeal to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which we explain things, tend to be farther &amp; farther from us. I mean, that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Colin has a point.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There's an explanatory order (or sequence) of being and a verificatory order
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (sequence) of knowledge. Among the empirical, &quot;special&quot; sciences (physical,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; material, biological, human/social), physics comes first in the order of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being, the order in which we explain things by appeal to entities, laws,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; etc., &quot;out there.&quot; But the order whereby we know things is the opposite;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there human/social studies come first, and physics comes last. That is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the usual way in which we order those sciences, but it is the usual way in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which we order a lot of maths when we put logic (deductive theory of logic)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and structures of order (and conditions for applicability of mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; induction) before other fields -- that's the ordering according to the bases
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on which we know things. The point is, that the &quot;ultimate&quot; explanatory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; object tends to be what's furthest from us; the &quot;ultimate&quot; verificatory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; basis tends to be what's nearest to us (at least within a given family of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; research fields -- logic and order structures are studies of reason and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reason's crackups; extremization problems in analysis seem to be at an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; opposite pole). Well, in the end, &quot;nearest to us&quot; means _us_, in our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; personal experiences. Now, I'm not talking in general about deductively
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certain knowledge or verification, but just about those bases on which we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; gain sufficient assurance to act (not to mention believe reports coming from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one area in research while not putting too much stock in reports coming from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; another). We are our own ultimate points of reference. Quine talks somewhere
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about dispensing with proper names and using a coordinate system spread out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; over the known universe. Which universe? The one we're in. As a practical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter, the best answer to the question &quot;which planet is Earth&quot; is &quot;the one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we're on.&quot; What's more, we do have experiences bearing upon our experiences.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We get into that sort of multi-layered reflexivity -- and I don't mean just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in an abstract intellectual way. Experiences vary in directness, firmness,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reliability, etc., among other things. In these senses and more, Colin is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; right.  One unmoors oneself from personal experience only at grave risk.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3. The problem is that it seems possible to distinguish verification,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; verificatory experience, etc., from consciousness. We learn sometimes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unconsciously, we infer conclusively yet sometimes unconsciously, etc., we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; test and verify sometimes unconsciously, non-deliberately, etc. &quot;Reasoning&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is what we can call conscious inference. Testing doesn't have to be fully
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious and deliberate any more than interpretation does. The point is, is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the system of a nature to learn from that which tests the system's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; character, its design, structure, habits, etc.? Learn, revise itself, etc.,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciously or unconsciously. Any time one enters a situation with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conjectures, expectations, understandings, memories, one is testing them and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even testing one's ways of &quot;generating&quot; them, testing oneself, aside from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one's having some overriding purpose of verification -- one may have some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very different purpose in the given situation. And it's really quite as if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we have experience unconscious as well as conscious. Maybe there's a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; question of the definition of the word &quot;experience&quot; as including the idea of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness, but the point is that, when we look at the things that make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for a genuinely intelligent process, we find in our own experience that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness is associated with its working very intelligently in some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; respects, but not associated in every case with its working. Indeed there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are persistent cases of intelligent, inferential processing going on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unconsciously. Even leaving aside the phenomenon of somewhat autistic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; musical prodigies, and leaving aside the complex and not entirely conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dynamics of interpersonal relationships, I think most of us have heard of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Poincare's discussion of unconsciously working on a problem till, in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moment of unexpected illumination, the solution came to him, as he stepped
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; onto a bus. Well, I don't really know what to make of this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distinguishability between consciousness and verificatory experience which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; may be conscious or unconscious, as regards what Colin is saying, but it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does seem a real question.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Best, Ben Udell
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (P.S. Also, there is perhaps more than one &quot;flavor&quot; of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; less-than-consciousness -- there's a difference between slowly,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unconsciously working on a problem, and lightning-quick though sometimes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; iffy insights which one has, one &quot;knows not how.&quot; -- and while one can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suppose that the latter are simply the outcomes of the former, I think that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the latter can interact with each other in a darting and hard-to-follow way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that's like the extreme opposite of the former. End of digressive
</em><br />

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is a mind-blowingly irrelevant diversion into the usual weeds that

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fails to comprehend the most basic proposition about ourselves by an

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then attribute it to humans as equivalent. Forget the bloody missile. I am

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; talking about YOU. The evidence you have about YOU within YOU.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Take a look at your hand. That presentation of your hand is one piece of

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; content in a visual field (scene). Mind is literally and only a collection

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of (rather spectacular) phenomenal scenes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Something (within your brain material) generates the visual field in which

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is a hand. You could cognise the existence of a hand _without_ that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scene (this is what blindsight patients can do - very very badly, but they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can do it). But you don't. No, nature goes to a hell of a lot of trouble to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; create that fantastic image.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You have the scene. Take note of it. It gives you ALL your scientific
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evidence. This is an intrinsically private scene and you can't be objective

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; PROOF
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Close your eyes and tell me you can be more scientific about your hand than

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To say consciousness is not observable is completely absolutely wrong. We
