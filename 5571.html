<br />For the record, friend George, my post of yesterday was certainly meant to be taken 
<br />
&quot;tongue in cheek&quot;, so to say. It was spurred on a whim by my brother asking me to 
<br />
tell him all I know.&lt;grin&gt; My answer I decided to post here, too. The list has been a 
<br />
little quiet of late even though there is very recent new Chandra evidence in support 
<br />
of dark energy, see:
<br />
Dark Energy
<br />
I am pleased that my post has invited you to comment, and I'm sure we would all 
<br />
like for you to put forth your thoughts in much greater degree. There are some 
<br />
*very* educated people on this list, some come at the genre of this list from a 
<br />
philosophical view, some primarily from a mathematical view, some from a pure 
<br />
logic point of view, some from a conjecture point of view, and many from some sort 
<br />
of combination of those views.
<br />
<br />Back on 2-Nov-03 I joined this list and argued from a logic point of view, and with 
<br />
distant reference to data from such things as that Chandra article alludes to. I poked 
<br />
fun at the mathematicians by stating that mathematics is a subset of logic which can 
<br />
not fully describe the universe because mathematics is digital but the universe is 
<br />
analog ... those decimal places keep confusing things!&lt;grin&gt; This did not exactly 
<br />
enamor me to those members of the list, but I believe they realize the intended 
<br />
humor being that we just don't really have a good enough tool to measure what we 
<br />
see. Mathematics certainly models a very good representation of our universe.
<br />
<br />There, on 2-Nov-03, I argued that the universe and by way of quantum mechanics 
<br />
did indeed arise from nothingness. I went further to state that the expansion of the 
<br />
universe is its apparent effort to return to that original state (kind of like a bubble in 
<br />
a vacuum), and that we perceive this effort as being what we call dark energy (an 
<br />
ever acceleration of the expansion of the universe that will eventually lead to what 
<br />
has been called the Big Rip), that a black hole is yet another route to that same 
<br />
seeking of state, and more. I was surprised to see the main arguments against my 
<br />
post being primarily about if the Big Rip will really occur or not, a subject that is still 
<br />
being hotly debated in the general scientific community.
<br />
<br />But make no mistake, I am not a scientist. I am only a thinker, one who seeks proof 
<br />
of being misguided. Logic is my only tool. Others here are much more educated in 
<br />
these matters than I am, and all here are tolerated and respected.
<br />
<br />Welcome to the list about the Theory of Everything, George.  :)
