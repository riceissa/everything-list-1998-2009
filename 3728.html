After writing the following response, I realized that my argument against
<br />
the self sampling assumption doesn't really depend on E1 and E2 being
<br />
experiences. They can be any kind of events.  Suppose they're prizes that
<br />
the copies can win for the original. E1 is a TV and E2 is a stereo. You'd
<br />
prefer a TV over a stereo but would rather have one TV and one stereo
<br />
instead of two TVs. Then my argument still works.
<br />
<br />The issue of whether substitution effects can apply to experiences of 
<br />
copies is of independent interest, so my original response still has a 
<br />
point.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; U({E1,E1'}) &gt; U({E1,E2}).  Is it really rational for this to be otherwise?
</em><br />
<br />Yes, I believe it can be. If you believe otherwise you have to convince me
<br />
why it's impossible to value diversity of experience in your copies, or 
<br />
why having that value would lead to absurd consequences. 
<br />
<br />We all know the law of diminishing marginal utility, which says that the
<br />
marginal utility of a good decreases as more of that good is consumed, and
<br />
the existence of substitution effects, where the marginal utility of one
<br />
good decreases when another similar good is consumed. I suggest there is
<br />
no reason to assume that the value of experiences of one's copies cannot
<br />
exhibit similar cross-dependencies. Actually I think the reason that
<br />
we have diminishing marginal utility and substitution effects, namely that 
<br />
they provide an evolutionary advantage, also applies to the value of 
<br />
experiences of copies.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; We know that rationality puts some constraints on the utility function.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We can't have cyclicity in the utility preference graph, for example.
</em><br />
<br />Our normative theories of rationality (i.e. decision theories) do put
<br />
constraints on preferences, but the history of decision theory has been
<br />
one of recognizing and removing unnecessary constraints, so that it can be
<br />
used by wider classes of people. The earliest decision theories for
<br />
example where stated in terms of maximizing expected money payoffs rather
<br />
than expected utility, which implicitly assumes that utility is a linear
<br />
function of money. Today, of course we recognize that utility can be any 
<br />
function of money, even a decreasing one. Another example is the move from 
<br />
objective probabilities to subjective probabilities.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But in the case above, where U({X,Y}) means the utility of having two
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different independent experiences X and Y, maybe it does follow that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; U({X,Y}) and U({X,Z}) must compare the same as U(Y) and U(Z).  You don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have any choice but to accept the equivalence.  As Lewis Carroll wrote,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Then Logic would take you by the throat, and FORCE you to do it!&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (<a href="http://www.mathacademy.com/pr/prime/articles/carroll/index.asp">http://www.mathacademy.com/pr/prime/articles/carroll/index.asp</a>)
</em><br />
<br />But remember that we choose the axioms. Logic doesn't tell use which 
<br />
axioms to use.
