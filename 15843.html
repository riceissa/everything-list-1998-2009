<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; consciousness *must be* instantiated in this way, but I think

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; there must be

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; something that makes the &quot;states&quot; part of a process - not just

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; snapshots.  Bruno
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; gets around the problem of defining states by assuming a digital

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Turing like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; process, but then he has to provide something besides spacetime to

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; of states a sequence; which is he does by invoking the requirement  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; that they be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; a computation.  I have some doubts as to whether this is enough,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; but at least it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; is something.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It comes down to whether the brain is Turing emulable. If it is, then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I see no problem describing it in terms of a sequence of discrete
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; states. The question then arises whether the causal links between the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; states in an intact digital computer are necessary to give rise to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; consciousness, which is what I thought you were claiming, or whether
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the same states in disconnected fashion would achieve the same thing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Opponents of computationalism such as John Searle have argued that if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; a Turing machine can give rise to consciousness then the disconnected
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; states would also have to give rise to consciousness, which is then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; taken as a reductio against computationalism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However a Turing machine is not just a set of states, it also  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; requires a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; set of transition rules.  So in the same abstract way that the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; integers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are ordered by &quot;succession&quot; the computational states of a Turing  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are ordered.  Whether just abstract rules, without implementation, are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sufficient isn't clear to me.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK, but then the UDA is supposed to explain that.
<br />
When we abandon the physical supervenience principle, and still keep  
<br />
digital mechanism, comp, we have to make clearer the comp  
<br />
surpevenience thesis. When you say in a previous post, to Stathis:
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno gets around the problem of defining states by assuming a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; digital Turing like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; process, but then he has to provide something besides spacetime to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; make the set
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of states a sequence; which is he does by invoking the requirement  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that they be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a computation.  I have some doubts as to whether this is enough,
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I only bet that there is a universal machine with respect to which  
<br />
that sequence of states is a computation.
<br />
UDA makes it *necessarily* enough, once you say &quot;yes&quot; to the  
<br />
digitalist surgeon. I think.
<br />
(then from the first person point of view it will be an infinity of  
<br />
computations-universal machines)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; but at least it is something.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Thanks. But what a thing! It is no my thing, it is what clearly  
<br />
&quot;nature&quot; has not stopped to show us with life, brains (amoebas getting  
<br />
cabled), and computers: apparition and re-apparition of *the* (by  
<br />
Church thesis) Universal &quot;Machine&quot;.
<br />
<br />You get a point on Stathis: a sequence of states, or a sequence of  
<br />
description of states, or a description of a sequence of states, none  
<br />
of those things can &quot;implement&quot; consciousness ... per se. Sequences of  
<br />
states ,or description of sequences of states, implement consciousness  
<br />
only relatively to universal machine, either in the third person way  
<br />
(get accessed by the UD), or from the first person points of view the  
<br />
most probable (or credible, or bettable) universal machine(s)  
<br />
relatively to its indexicaly current state.
<br />
<br />I think Stathis can conceive that a stone could implement all  
<br />
computations. In a sense, this is true (assuming comp), given that a  
<br />
stone, from *your* point of view should already be described by the  
<br />
collection of *all* computational history going through the state of  
<br />
&quot;the stone&quot; (if that exists) or the state of &quot;you + the stone&quot;. This  
<br />
is advanced stuff and could perhaps be resolved by hands, but it is  
<br />
more funny, deeper, and modest, and then this is what I have done  
<br />
after all, to directly interview the universal machine itself.
<br />
Which leads to AUDA.
<br />
<br />Assuming comp, specifying just one universal machine will do,  
<br />
ontologically. And elementary arithmetic, taught in high school, and  
<br />
captured by Robinson Arithmetic is enough. It defines implicitly a  
<br />
universal deployment. If f(x) = z, f computable, then Robinson  
<br />
Arithmetic will prove that fact (and also that if f(x) = z &amp; f(x) = y  
<br />
then y = z).
<br />
<br />But it is epistemology which counts, in particular Physics is first  
<br />
person (plural), and to be described, we need a universal machine  
<br />
which is little bit more introspective. Here there is a theorem (not  
<br />
mine!): if you had, to Robinson Arithmetic, the infinity of  
<br />
&quot;induction&quot; formula (Ax means &quot;for all number x ...&quot;, )
<br />
<br />(F(0) &amp; Ax(F(x) -&gt; F(x+1))) -&gt; AxF(x)
<br />
<br />then you get already a sort of unsurpassable, in its introspective  
<br />
power, universal machine. The one I called Löbian, because it obeys  
<br />
the modal modesty formula B(Bp-&gt;p)-&gt;Bp which is Löb's Theorem, &quot;as  
<br />
said by the machine about itself&quot; (with Bp = Beweisbar('p'), p  
<br />
arithmetical sentences. I will not coming back to this now, perhaps  
<br />
later. it is the main axioms of G and G* which provably characterize  
<br />
such the provable and the true of such systems.
<br />
<br />AUDA illustrates the obvious:  comp get its main meaning(s) through  
<br />
theoretical computer science and mathematical logic, which needs some  
<br />
works.
<br />
<br />The hard work has been done by Gödel, Löb and Solovay (and many others).
<br />
<br />Note that I would have concluded in the falsity or in the solipsistic  
<br />
nature of comp, if nature, through Einstein, Everett, Feynman, ...,  
<br />
didn't give a glimpse of plural, sharable, uncertainties: we share  
<br />
deep computations, and the bottom seems linear.
<br />
<br /><br />It is hard to explain more without being more technical, but the  
<br />
notion of universal machine is both very easy to define (like a  
<br />
definition of the Mandelbrot set) and creepily hard to predict (again  
<br />
like an falling point on the Mandelbrot set).
<br />
<br />In a sense, related to abductive power inference, there is already  
<br />
something uncomputably clever than a universal machine, it is a couple  
<br />
of universal machines. It is another way to show that reductionism  
<br />
fails. Universal machines tends to self)accelerate relatively to each  
<br />
others. In my opinion Babbage, Turing, Post, and many others have made  
<br />
a major discovery. Now it is Church thesis which makes those universal  
<br />
machines ... universal.
<br />
<br />Comp makes theoretical computer science fundamental. It is used in a  
<br />
UDA step 7 in a specific way.
