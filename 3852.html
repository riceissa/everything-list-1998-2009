<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here's a simplified thought experiment that illustrates the issue. Two 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; copies of the subject S, A and B, are asked to choose option 1 or option 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2. If A chooses 1, S wins a TV (TV), otherise S wins a worse TV (TV2). If 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; B chooses 1, S wins a stereo, otherwise S wins TV. S prefers TV to TV2 to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stereo, but would rather have a TV and a stereo than two TVs. The copies 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have to choose without knowing whether they are A or B.
</em><br />
<br />I am confused about the relation of S to A and B.  Did S go into a
<br />
copying machine and get two copies, A and B made, in addition to S?
<br />
And now A and B are deciding what S will win?
<br />
<br />Why should they care?  If S gets a TV that does not benefit them.  Is it
<br />
just that they are similar to S, being recent copies of him, so they
<br />
have a sort of brotherly fondness for him and would like to see him happy?
<br />
<br />I thought the earlier experiments had a more direct connection, where
<br />
the people making the decisions were the same ones who were getting
<br />
the reward (or at least, future copies of themselves)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now I want to show that while my earlier suggestion to consider yourself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to be both A and B works in this case, it doesn't work in general when A
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and B have different utility functions. Consider the following game, which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we can call Amnesiac Prisoner's Dillemma. Players A and B can choose
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Cooperate or Defect. If they both Defect they both get sentenced to 5
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; years in prison. If they both Cooperate they both get 1 year. If one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Cooperates and the other Defects they get 3 months and 10 years
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; respectively. The twist is that you have no memory of who you are and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't know whether you're A or B. If you consider yourself to be both A
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and B, then you would choose Cooperate, which contradicts our intuition. A
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; game theoretic analysis with the SSA would go like this. Suppose you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; expect the other player to Cooperate. Then EU(Cooperate) = .5*EU(Cooperate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; | I'm A) + .5*EU(Cooperate | I'm B) = .5*U(I'm A and A gets 1 year and B
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; gets 1 year) + .5*U(I'm B and A gets 1 year and B gets 1 year) &lt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; EU(Defect) = .5*EU(Defect | I'm A) + .5*EU(Defect | I'm B) = .5*U(I'm A
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and A gets three months and B gets 10 years) + .5*EU(I'm B and A gets 10
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; years and B gets three months). So Cooperate is not a Nash equilibrium.
</em><br />
<br />I'm not sure I understand this; since the payoff matrix is symmetric it
<br />
doesn't matter if you are A or B so I don't see what the point is of
<br />
introducing amnesia.  Would there be any cases with symmetric payoffs
<br />
where an amnesiac would behave differently than someone who knew whether
<br />
he was A or B?
<br />
<br />Tangentially, it seems that the PD is a case where the &quot;evidential&quot;
<br />
vs &quot;causal&quot; principles of decision theory would show a difference.
<br />
The evidentialist would argue that by cooperating, it increases the
<br />
chance that the other person will cooperate (perhaps to a certainty, in
<br />
some versions), hence cooperating can be justified.  This is basically
<br />
Hofstadter's principle of super-rationality.  The causalist would reject
<br />
the possible correlation of choices and choose the dominant strategy
<br />
of defecting.  Does that seem correct?
<br />
<br />What about this: you are going to be copied, and your two copies are going
<br />
to play a PD game.  You know this ahead of time and so you can decide
<br />
on whatever strategies you intend to follow during this time before the
<br />
copying occurs.  Do you think in that case it would be rational to firmly
<br />
decide beforehand to cooperate?
<br />
<br />And would &quot;amnesia&quot; make a difference?  We might arrange for amnesia by
<br />
having the duplicates immediately play the game, without any knowledge
<br />
of which they are; and remove the amnesia by simply telling them that
<br />
one is A and one is B, before they play.  Again, with a symmetric game
<br />
I don't see how the amnesia or its absence would be relevant.  Maybe I
<br />
am misunderstanding that aspect.
