(Reflectivity and Consciousness Part 2 - Strategies For Attacking The
<br />
Puzzles)
<br />
<br />Consider the two hypotheses put forward.  I have suggested that an
<br />
effective communication system, consciousness and reflectivity are all
<br />
the same thing.  This is the means through which the sub-agents of the
<br />
mind talk to each in order to integrate their behaviour.  And so
<br />
intimate does the link between mathematics and knowledge appear to be
<br />
- when we consider algorithms as 'dynamical mathematical objects' the
<br />
picture we are drawn to suggests a network of 'knowledge nodes' with
<br />
consciousness itself as the DP Modelling Language of the mind.  Bring
<br />
together the ideas suggested and a new strategy for solving
<br />
reflectivity suggests itself.
<br />
<br />Solving Reflectivity
<br />
<br />*Firstly, stop searching for the oxy-moronic 'Reflective Decision
<br />
Theory'.  There isn't one.  Reflectivity, we have established, is not
<br />
in the decision making business, it's in the communications business.
<br />
The tools we should be deploying to solve reflectivity are the tools
<br />
of Communication Theory, *not* the tools of Decision Theory.
<br />
<br />*Secondly, bring to bear the tools that already exist for an analogous
<br />
field: the field of data communications.  Deploy the language of
<br />
nodes, time messaging and networking.
<br />
<br />*Thirdly, investigate further the connections between the computer
<br />
science and the pure mathematical sciences to obtain further insights
<br />
and unifications of helpful concepts.  Model mathematics using the
<br />
object oriented paradigm and consider algorithms as 'mathematical
<br />
objects' which can have states, identities and behaviours.  This
<br />
approach leads naturally to the big idea that consciousness is 'The DP
<br />
Modelling Language Of The Mind'
<br />
<br />*Draw analogies to other fields of mathematics to obtain clues about
<br />
specific tools for use in attacking reflectivity puzzles.  For
<br />
instance, concepts from Calculus are suspected to be relevant.  Recall
<br />
that Reflection was considered to be 'a network of interacting
<br />
knowledge nodes' and 'a system of interacting dynamical mathematical
<br />
objects'.  These are concepts roughly analogous to physical objects
<br />
moving through fields, which is modelling using Calculus.  The concept
<br />
of a 'Limit' looks important.  Considering again our cognitive network
<br />
of interacting sub-agents, unified behaviour involves moving the
<br />
system towards an optimal 'Limit'.  This again, brings to mind the
<br />
concept of a 'Limit' from the branch of calculus, for calculus itself
<br />
is the science of limits.
<br />
<br />Conclusion
<br />
<br />A sketch of some new perspectives was here suggested for attacking the
<br />
puzzles of consciousness and reflectivity.  It was suggested that
<br />
reflectivity is not what it is believed to be.  It is not, it was here
<br />
argued, a part of Decision Theory, but instead should be thought of as
<br />
part of Communication Theory.  Two core hypotheses were suggested. (1)
<br />
That the function of consciousness is as an internal communication
<br />
system of the mind which enables sub-agents to interact effectively
<br />
and (2) That reflectivity can be considered as a network of
<br />
interacting dynamical 'mathematical objects' (knowledge nodes) which
<br />
points to an equivalence between reflectivity and consciousness and
<br />
suggests that conscious itself is the 'DP Modelling Language Of The
<br />
Mind'.  A few more specific ideas were suggested, namely that the
<br />
mathematics of Calculus (and especially the concept of a 'Limit')
<br />
could be highly relevant to the solution to the twin puzzles of
<br />
consciousness and reflectivity.
