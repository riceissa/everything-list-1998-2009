<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Hi Brent,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 1a) Brent meeker wrote (quoting Jim Heldberg) :
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     Atheism is not a religion, just as a vacant lot is not a type of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     building, and health is not a form of sickness. Atheism is not a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     religion.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     --- Jim Heldberg
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It seems to me that Jim Heldberg confuse the scientist (indeed) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; attitude of agnosticism and atheism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Let D = the proposition &quot;God exists&quot;, &quot;~&quot; = NOT, B = believes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; An agnostic is someone for which the proposition &quot;~BD&quot; is true. (And 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;~B~D&quot; could be true as well)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; An atheist is someone for which &quot;B~D&quot; is true.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But what does &quot;true&quot; mean?  Does it mean provable? and on what basis?  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Does it mean &quot;our best guess&quot;
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />I am using &quot;true&quot; in its usual informal sense here. To be more precise 
<br />
here would be a 1004 fallacy. In the technical part, all proposition 
<br />
are purely arithmetical, and if you want you can defined that notion of 
<br />
arithmetical truth in set theory for example. But the Tarski definition 
<br />
of truth is enough in the present context. The proposition P intended 
<br />
by the sentence A is true when it is the case that A.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The atheist is a believer. As John M often says, an atheist already 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; has some notion of God such as to be able to believe it does not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; exist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Now most atheist are already &quot;believer&quot; in believing &quot;religiously&quot; in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Primary Matter (a metaphysical entity).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I'am agnostic in both sense. I do not believe in God, nor do I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; believe in Matter. Those terms are not enough well defined.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I do neither believe in the inexistence of God, nor in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; inexistence of Matter. I wait for more data.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Right.  &quot;God exists&quot; is not well enough defined to believe or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; disbelieve - both &quot;God&quot; and &quot;exists&quot; being ill defined.  But I think 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;theism&quot; is well enough defined.  Theism is the belief in an immortal, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; supernaturally powerful person, who is concerned with the welfare and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behavior of human beings.  I believe this god of theism does not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exist.  As to other gods, such as the god of deism or pantheism, I'm 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; agnostic - I don't believe they exist and I don't believe they don't 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exist.  In all the above &quot;believe&quot; means my considered opinion - not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something mathematically provable, but something I think is provable 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the legal sense of &quot;preponderance of the evidence&quot; or in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scientific sense of &quot;in accordance with our best model&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />OK, but here you do the inverse of the 1004-fallacy. I was thinking we 
<br />
were already more precise than that. There is a problem of vocabulary. 
<br />
You continue to use the word &quot;God&quot; as related to our particular 
<br />
history. I just defined &quot;theology of a machine&quot; by the truth about that 
<br />
machine (whatver that truth is).  Given that I limit myself to 
<br />
self-referentially correct machine, the provable sentences by the 
<br />
machine are included in the truth about the machine. The inclusion has 
<br />
to be proper due to incompleteness of all such machines. Unlike the 
<br />
christian theologians, I have no (not yet) evidence that &quot;God&quot; (truth, 
<br />
the ONE, ...) is dedicated to the welfare of man (although I have 
<br />
evidence that man, or at least some man, are dedicated too the serach 
<br />
of truth.
<br />
Also, nobody has proved the existence of a primitive physical universe. 
<br />
With the present definition of theology, the belief in a physical 
<br />
primitive universe *is* a theological proposition. And I have shown 
<br />
that such a belief is epistemologically incompatible with the belief in 
<br />
comp (that there is a level where &quot;I&quot; am Turing emulable).
<br />
The Mechanist position in the philosophy of mind is just 
<br />
(epistemologically) incompatible with, not the belief in a physical 
<br />
universe&quot;, but with the belief in the primary nature of that physical 
<br />
universe.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So atheism is not a religion - it's the belief that a particular class 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of religion is mistaken.  To reject a belief that is contrary to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evidence is not a matter of faith.  It doesn't take faith to believe 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is no Santa Claus.
</em><br />
<br /><br />It does not take faith to NOT believe in Santa Klaus. It does take 
<br />
faith (if only in your own consistency) to believe that you will never 
<br />
believe in Santa Klaus. Now I (re) define locally and in a first 
<br />
approximation GOD as the ultimate reality, for which I do have 
<br />
evidence. Thanks to Plotinus and Augustin there is case that this 
<br />
notion of GOD is closer to the christian notion than a &quot;primitive 
<br />
physical universe&quot;, for which I have no evidence at all (beyond the 
<br />
usual extrapolation of self-consistency that all higher mammal seems to 
<br />
do all the time).
<br />
I am closer to the atheist when I say that the GOD is not a person (or 
<br />
is a zero-person). But with comp, I have to abandon &quot;materialism&quot;, even 
<br />
in the weak sense that there is a primary notion of matter.
<br />
Materialism, for a computationalist (who has understand the complete 
<br />
UDA) is a form of vitalism: it invokes something nobody can verify, and 
<br />
which (by UDA) is shown to explain absolutely nothing. Like the 
<br />
collapse of the wave, it is not even defined.
<br />
The use of materialism in physics, since Aristotle, is just a provisory 
<br />
metaphysics used to postpone the delicate questions. I have not yet 
<br />
find a paper by physicist (except Bunge) which really assumes, in some 
<br />
scientist modest way, the hypothesis of materialism.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But assuming comp, I must confess that I have *reason* to put some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; more credo on Plotinus, and other platonist approaches, on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;mind/god/matter&quot; and fundamental principle, than on the aristotelian 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; primitive matter theory. Actually, I infer the same belief from the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; empirical quantum data.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 1b) Brent wrote to John M:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     Values existed longer before humans.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; So you are a bit Platonist too .... :)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, I'm willing to contemplate different kinds of existence - so  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that mathematical structures made be said to exist and statements like 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Sherlock Holmes was a detective.&quot; are in some sense true while 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Sherlock Holmes was a Russian.&quot; are false.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But whether arithmetic is more fundamental than matter - I'm agnostic.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Then you would be kind to point exactly where you miss the point in the 
<br />
UDA. Or perhaps you are just saying that you are agnostic with respect 
<br />
to comp? That is ok, I am too, and that is why I have work hard to 
<br />
distill a testable version of comp.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 1c) Brent wrote (to Stathis):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     How is this infinite regress avoided in our world? By 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     not representing the rest of the world.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; That is an interesting idea. You could elaborate a bit perhaps? I do 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; agree with your most of your recent replies to Stathis about the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; question &quot;does a rock think?&quot;. But perhaps not entirely for the same 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; reason as you. We will see.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's a half-baked idea, so I'm not sure I can fill it out.  But it is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; similar to Stathis's point that language (and all symbolic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; representation) must be grounded in ostentive definition.  In Stathis 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; example the conscious computer is conscious by virtue of reference to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a real world - which has now been replaced by a simulator.  But in a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; closed system, with no outside reference, the ostensive definition 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; itself must be represented computationally.  And in what sense is it a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; representation of an ostensive definition?  Only in virtue of some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meta-dictionary that defines it as such in terms of still other 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; representations.
</em><br />
<br /><br />When you ask your computer to print a document, the computer typically 
<br />
does not search the meaning of the words &quot;print&quot; or &quot;document&quot; in a 
<br />
dictionary. Other more subtile self-reference are handled by the 
<br />
diagonalization technic which makes it possible to cut the infinite 
<br />
regresses. IF and when I come back on the Fi and Wi, I will give you 
<br />
Kleene second recursion theorem which solves all those infinite regress 
<br />
appearing in computer self-reference.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     The world is what it is and representation is not essential. I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     suppose this is somewhat like Peter's &quot;primitive substance&quot; whose
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     only function is to distinguish things that exist from their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     representation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; yes, but then the question is &quot;what are you assuming to exist?&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Our best model seems to be the quantum fields of the standard model.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Quantum field theory (QFT) does assume numbers, and strictly speaking 
<br />
relates numbers with numbers (actually they appear also mathematically 
<br />
as invariant of knots, but this is out-of-topic right now). QFT, like 
<br />
QM compress a lot of information concerning our local appearances, but 
<br />
it does not tackle the fundamental question (that is: it postulates 
<br />
quanta, and does not address qualia at all). Quantum thermodynamic can 
<br />
be said closer to the qualia, but in a still very implicit way, and 
<br />
almost by chance.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I think it is the wrong question to ask &quot;what do you assume to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exist&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />When we got startling results, or address very fundamental questions, I 
<br />
think there is a time where we should be able to put all the cards on 
<br />
the table. I think we have to accept the axiomatic method. If not we 
<br />
could realize one day that we are just mislead by vocabulary, and that 
<br />
is a waste of time relatively to the question of the content of our 
<br />
theories/assumption.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You don't start with assuming something to exist, that's a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematician's axiomatic approach; you start with what you observe, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with appearances.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I don't believe in &quot;just appearance&quot;. Those &quot;appearance&quot; is the result 
<br />
of both observation together with theories. Even a baby who begins to 
<br />
distinguish its hands and its mother's hand relies on theories whose 
<br />
results from millions years of researches.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You may be able to model them with different ontologies and then the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; question is, &quot;How can you test them.&quot;
</em><br />
<br /><br />Hmmm.... OK (logicians and physicians use different word here, but OK).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  As Thales said, &quot;The question is not what exists, but how can we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; know.&quot;  It may be that different ontologies produce the same empirical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; results - as quantum fields and elementary particle theories seem to - 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and there is nothing to choose between them.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />This is not obvious at all, unless you start directly from a 
<br />
physicalist assumption. Of course a more general theory is needed if 
<br />
you want to *explain* where the laws of physics come from. And such a 
<br />
more general theory has to be non physical, as John Archibald Wheeler 
<br />
has already quite convincingly explained. But the UDA proves that if 
<br />
comp is true, then Wheeler's idea are not an option, just an 
<br />
unavoidable consequence.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 1d) Brent wrote to Mark Peaty (in Jason's thread about 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;irreversibility):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     I think there is a confusion creeping in here. I don't think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     &quot;logically reversible&quot; is misleading. It is only physical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; processes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     that can be termed reversible or irreversible. Logic lives in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     timeless Platonia. Computers operated irreversibly, they dissipate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     heat when they they erase data. Feynman pointed out that this was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     not necessary and a computer that did not erase data could operate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     without dissipating heat (no increase in entropy).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The logician Hao Wang, is, as far as I know, the first to prove that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; a universal machine can operate without ever erasing information, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; this is enough for developping notion of logical reversibility (quite 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; useful in quantum computing). I say more in term of &quot;combinators&quot; in

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; You seem quite sure about that. How do you know? Why couldn'it be

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that *you* find this &quot;limited&quot; due to your own prejudice about

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; That is true!!! Are you serious about being a lobian machine? As a

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; matter of fact, lobian machine can know and prove that they are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; lobian.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; To prove being a *consistent* lobian machine is quite another matter, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; though ....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It is not impossible. *Inconsistent* lobian machine *can* prove that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; they are consistent lobian machine, but then they can prove the

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     it help if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     I said that if a conventional computer is conscious, then, to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     consistent, a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     rock would also have to be conscious?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I think you could be right ... It is difficult because terms like 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;conventional&quot; and &quot;physical&quot; are quite fuzzy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I do think that if a conventional (material in the mundane sense) is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; conscious, most probably anything *is* conscious, and that is related 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to the fact that I think (assuming the comp hypothesis) that a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; conventional computer is *not* conscious. Consciousness is a first 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; person attribute, and the UDA shows that it has to be associated with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; an (infinity) of (mathematical) computations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why isn't the computer (or rock) associated with an infinity of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computations?  I'm assuming you mean a potential countable infinity in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the future.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I have answered this in my preceding post to you. I will come back on 
<br />
this difficult point in my conversation with Stathis.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; This 1-person has no shape, and can even be considered as not being a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; machine. I guess we will have to discuss this with more details.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     It's difficult to find the right words here. I think we can all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     agree on the appearance
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     of a physical reality as a starting point.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Yes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     The common sense view is that there is an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     underlying primitive physical reality generating this appearance,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     without which the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     appearance would vanish and relative to which dream and illusion 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     be defined.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     If this is so, it is not a scientifically testable theory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I think it is testable indirectly. Recall that although I disagree 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; with Penrose godelian argument, I do arrive at similar conclusion: 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; you cannot have both &quot;computationalism&quot; and &quot;materialism&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     We can't just switch off the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     physical reality to see whether it changes the appearance, and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     further we delve
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     into matter all we see is more appearance (and stranger and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; stranger
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     appearance at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     that). Moreover, dream and illusion are defined relative to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     appearance of regular
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     physical reality, not relative to the postulated primitive 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     reality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I would say &quot;relative to a theory explaining the appearances&quot;, not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; just to the appearances.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     John Searle, among others, believes this is absurd, and that

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     computationalism. Another approach is that it shows that it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     absurd that consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     supervenes on physical activity of any sort, but we can keep
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     computationalism and

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     drop the physical supervenience criterion, as Bruno has.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Yes.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     Any serial computation can be made up of multiple parallel

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     computations, and vice versa. You can't say, aha, we've used that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     string for &quot;dog&quot; so we can't now use it for &quot;cat&quot;, because who is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     going to patrol the universe to enforce this rule? This is what 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     are left with if you eliminate the constraint that the computation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     has to interact with an external observer.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     I am aware that this is a very strange idea, perhaps even an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; absurd
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     idea, but I don't see any way out of it without ruining
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     computationalism, as by saying that it's all bunk, or only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     computations that can interact with the environment at the level 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     their implementation can be conscious. Because if you insist on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     latter, it implies something like ESP: the computer will know the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     difference between a false sensory stimulus and one emanating from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     the environment... possible, but not very Turing-emulable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I agree with Brent's remark on that: &quot;I find that doubtful - do you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; have a reference? Isn't it the definition of &quot;incompressible&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; computation that there is no way faster than executing each step in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; sequence (Brent Meeker).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 3e) Stathis' answer to Brent:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     I'm not referring to speed, just to doing it. For example, a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; serial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     stream of consciousness can be emulated by multiple shorter 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; parallel
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     streams; there is no way of knowing whether you're being run in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     serial, parallel, how fast the real world clock is running, etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I agree there is no way to know whether you are being run in serial, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; parallel, etc. But mathematically multiple shorter parallel streams 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; have to be able to be glued, at least mathematically, for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; constituting a proper computation. If not literally anything can be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; described as a computation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That's a reductio argument and when you've reached an absurdity it can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be anyone of your premises that is wrong - including comp.
</em><br />
<br /><br />That is my point.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; That is why I explicitly use a mathematical definition of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; computation, and then(and only then) try to figure out what is a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; rock, for example.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 4) Mark Peaty wrote (to Brent):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     As I say, the essence of evil is the act of treating other persons
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     as things.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I so agree with you. And then, with Church thesis (less than comp, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; thus) you can understand the reason why even some (relative) machine 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and some (relative) numbers should not be confused with any of their 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; third person description.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     On another tack: it seems to me the extent and scope of suffering 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     the world is one of the most powerful arguments in favour of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     total irrelevance of the concept of G/god/s. However it is not for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     me to go around telling those who believe in some G/god/s that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     are deluded.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Do you agree that those who believe in a primitive physical universe 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; could be deluded in the same manner than those who believe in some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; notion of God. Perhaps even in a worse manner, because many people 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; believe that the existence of a primitive material universe is a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;scientific fact&quot;. Of course not. At least in many theological text, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the word &quot;God&quot; is used in a more axiomatic way than &quot;Matter&quot; is by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; some scientist (at lunch or during the week-end). Most religious 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; people will never say that the existence of God is a scientific fact, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and in that sense are less deluded than many materialist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; They say the existence of God is a matter of faith and that is a more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certain kind of knowledge than scientific knowledge.  Because faith is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; independent of evidence religion is a much more resistant delusion 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than erroneous science.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Personal pain/pleasure: that is what we can believe without act of 
<br />
faith. All the rest need an act of faith, by which I mean the ability 
<br />
to believe in assumptions, that is in proposition without a proof. To 
<br />
go from &quot;I see the moon&quot; to &quot;there is a moon&quot; you need faith or ..., 
<br />
well by being non truring emulable perhaps .... (up to you to show me 
<br />
how ...).
<br />
<br />This is provable for any monist theory. In a monist theory you have to 
<br />
embed the &quot;theoretician&quot; in its object of study (like Everett embeds 
<br />
the physicist in the physical world (described by the SWE), see also 
<br />
the work of the physicist Otto Rossler: his endophysics is really an 
<br />
endomathematics once we assume comp). If the &quot;theoretician&quot; is emulable 
<br />
by a turing machine, any everything-theory he can build has the 
<br />
property that the consistency of the big picture entails its own 
<br />
consistency, and this can only be inferred, never proved.
<br />
<br />Our theories are counterintuitive and do handle very subtle questions, 
<br />
I really think than the axiomatic method can help. You cannot explain 
<br />
General Relativity to people who believes the Euclid fifth axiom is a 
<br />
consequence of the fourth preceding one. The same occur in our context. 
<br />
It is impossible to understand the consequences of comp for those who 
<br />
believed comp needs materialism when it is actually incompatible with 
<br />
(weak) materialism, as it has been justified.
