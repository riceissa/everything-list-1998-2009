<br />
<br />BM:  BTW I have discovered that the book edited by Martin Davis &quot;The
<br />
undecidable&quot; has been republished in 2004 by Dover.
<br />
<br />DN:  I've just ordered it from Amazon.
<br />
<br />BM:  Many Sc. fiction book go through such experience, and the book &quot;Mind's
<br />
I&quot; (ed. by Hofstadter and Dennett) contains relevant thought (but miss my
<br />
favorite sc. fi. book, the
<br />
&quot;SIMULACRON III&quot; by Daniel Galouye). Mind'I eyes missed the first person
<br />
comp indeterminacy and the subsequent reversal.
<br />
<br />DN:  Yes, science fiction did stimulate some of my speculations, and I found
<br />
Minds's I frustrating for just the reasons you give.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This seemed somehow to entail the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emergence of finitude from the not-finite, which seemed weirdly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; right.
</em><br />
<br />BM:  ? (comp presupposes the natural numbers. Indeed they constitute the
<br />
absolutely unsolvable mysteries).
<br />
<br />DN:  Yes, I know.  One might say that (at least the human understanding of)
<br />
mathematics is cast as a kind of figure-ground relation between finite and
<br />
not-finite, but this is more poetical than technical, and hence need not
<br />
detain us.  You propose the natural numbers and their relations as a
<br />
necessary point of departure for comp, and show that this leads to
<br />
unexpected results.  My own thought was that analysis of the semantics of
<br />
whole and part leads to a fundamentally self-relative epistemology and
<br />
ontology, and this can also lead to unexpected results.  But this is
<br />
non-technical and largely intuitive hand-waving on my part.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Anyway, it would be the histories that differed, not the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'self'.
</em><br />
<br />BM:  This could depend on choice of vocabulary. If you define the self by
<br />
what is consistent, or better sound, and invariant in all comp histories,
<br />
you will get the arithmetical hypostases.
<br />
<br />DN:  Here I intended 'self' in the primary or 0-person sense.  1-person
<br />
would be attached to the histories, and hence the arithmetical hypostases
<br />
would pick out sound and invariant features of 1-personal histories.
<br />
Consciousness would then be associated with the relation of the 0-self to
<br />
such features of itself.  In a sense this equates to a sort of all-embracing
<br />
'solipsism' - but a solipsism of the All.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  The histories would break the symmetry of the self into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; differentiated sub-selves that would be 'I' with respect to their own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; private environments.
</em><br />
<br />BM:  Hopefully. That is what is under the course of verification. Again,
<br />
accepting the positive integers makes such symmetry breaking easy to
<br />
understand.
<br />
<br />DN:  Yes, this is how I understand comp with respect to the semantics of
<br />
self-relation I've been using.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But since these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'entities' could only be self-defined emergents of the original self-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relativisation, everything was in fact 'outside-less' and continued to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exist uniquely or monistically as a network of self-relation.
</em><br />
<br />BM:  .. itself emerging from the additive/multiplicative number relations.
<br />
The self itself is what computer science and provability logic explains
<br />
the better.
<br />
<br />DN:  Yes, in the comp frame the numbers and their relations would be the
<br />
basis of what I've been calling sense and action (i.e. self-relation in its
<br />
1 and 3-person aspects).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Depending on whether the participatory or 'objective' perspective was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; adopted, self-relation could apparently decompose into 'sense' or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'action' narratives, but such decomposition was in fact illusory, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perspective-dependent.  Self-relation in fact remained singular or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; decomposable in nature
</em><br />
<br />BM:  This is fuzzy. I can agree but I have more than one interpretation.
<br />
It's hard not being more technical here.
<br />
<br />DN:  I'm sorry, I missed out a 'non'!  I should have said &quot;self-relation in
<br />
fact remained non-decomposable&quot;.  By 'non-decomposable' I mean that the
<br />
terms 'sense' and 'action' should be understood as observer effects in a
<br />
self-relative frame. So epistemologically they are decomposable, but
<br />
ontologically they aren't.  To avoid further confusion, I see that in the
<br />
comp frame 'self-relation' can indeed be 'decomposed' into different numbers
<br />
and their relations, but that these are not further decomposable.  I would
<br />
have no problem with this.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Consequently, if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics is held to be fundamental to consciousness, and consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is an observer effect, then such observers must be fully describable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by physical relationships, not functional ones, and the appropriate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; substitution level is physical duplication, to some level of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tolerance.
</em><br />
<br />BM:  OK, but this is explicitly what cannot be done in the comp frame. A
<br />
good thing given that &quot;physical&quot; can hardly be defined by the product
<br />
of observation.
<br />
<br />DN:  Yes.  I'm sorry if it wasn't absolutely clear that my point in this
<br />
section of the argument was precisely to give a reductio of the materialist
<br />
position on functionalism or computationalism.  So of course I'm claiming
<br />
that it can't be done.  I assume then that you agree with my line of
<br />
argument?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; By contrast, if the reality of parts and relationships is to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; considered fundamentally numerical,
</em><br />
<br />BM:  The main first half of my work consists in showing that comp does not
<br />
give a choice in those matter.
<br />
<br />DN:  As indeed follows from my reductio.  Or rather more generally, what
<br />
follows is that 'physical' relations themselves must emerge from a deeper
<br />
self-relation if any kind of 'functionalism' is to be coherent as an
<br />
explanation for consciousness.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Nonetheless, if the observer decomposition continues to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; regarded as 'functional' with respect to the physical one,
</em><br />
<br />BM;  This is unclear, I'm afraid.
<br />
<br />DN:  IOW, this proposes the case where the observer 'decomposition' or
<br />
interpretation can't simply be superimposed on the physical one.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; they remain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in some deep sense orthogonal - i.e. the 'functionalism' is that of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'imaginary parts' and 'imaginary relations' with respect to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical description.
</em><br />
<br />BM: ?
<br />
<br />DN:  That is, they are considered as being based on different 'parts' in
<br />
different 'relations'.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It follows that there may be no final way of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'de-crypting' any unambiguous observer structure from the physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; description alone.  We would then be left unavoidably with an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'objectively' unknowable and unprovable imputation of consciousness to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any physically-defined structure.  So be it.
</em><br />
<br />BM:  ?
<br />
<br />DN:  That is, we might have no unambiguous way of correlating the two
<br />
narratives, given that they would be based on different 'parts' in different
<br />
'relations'.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But it might then be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; questioned how observer and physical narratives could somehow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'converge' on a common or consistent environmental interface as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; result of any form of co-evolution. Such a notion would seem to imply
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that equivalent selection effects could be operating on both
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; environments despite their orthogonal orientation. It is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; immediately apparent why this should be so.
</em><br />
<br />BM:  As far as I understand, this is *the* problem. It seems insoluble
<br />
untill you take into account explicitly the incompleteness phenomenon
<br />
which put high constraint of what sound machines can believe, bet,
<br />
observe, feel ... (that what the hypostases are all about).
<br />
<br />DN:  This seems crucial.  So the hypostases are in this sense a theory of
<br />
the co-evolution of physics and consciousness, or at least the basis for
<br />
one.  But is there as yet a way to see how such correlation might be
<br />
designed or engineered, as opposed to evolving or being cloned?  IOW, a
<br />
basis for saying yes to the doctor that isn't just a wild gamble.  Is there
<br />
a way for grandma to follow these arguments?  Maybe the roadmap?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consequently not 'functional' with respect to the physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; description, but in some real sense isomorphic or analogic.
</em><br />
<br />BM:  Hmmm ... there is a fixed point ... I am not sure this helps here ....
<br />
<br />DN: It would be wonderful if it did help, because this is a sticking point
<br />
at the moment in my comprehension.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, I can't at this point see whether such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; alternatives can be resolved purely theoretically, or whether they are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fundamentally empirical issues.
</em><br />
<br />BM:  I think I have make progress in that direction. BTW you can consult my
<br />
last SIENA paper &quot;A Purely Arithmetical Interpretation, yet empirically
<br />
falsifiable, of Plotinus' theory of Matter&quot;.
<br />
<br />DN:  I've read it, and must study it further.  But, sorry to mention the
<br />
roadmap again, is there any way to help the interested enquirer, still
<br />
unsure of the technicalities, more generally to jump-start their
<br />
intuitions?  I can see that consciousness and physics need to be integrated
<br />
on a common foundation if  comp is to go through.  But that this doesn't
<br />
immediately suggest any obvious direction in which to look for a new
<br />
intuition of how this might run.  There may simply be no non-technical way
<br />
to proceed from this point, but it would be wonderful if you could suggest
<br />
one!

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Le 02-juil.-07, à 18:12, David Nyman a écrit :
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; After very kindly concurring with bits of my recent posts, Bruno
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; nonetheless quite reasonably questioned whether I followed his way of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; proceeding.  Having read the UDA carefully, I would say that in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'grandmotherly' way I do, although not remotely at his technical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; level.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Concerning the Universal Dovetailer Argument (UDA) a subtle
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prerequisite is Church Thesis, if only to understand the relation with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arithmetical realism and also to understand the term &quot;Universal&quot; in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; UD. Coming back from Siena I am not sure &quot;Church thesis&quot; is well
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understood today.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; BTW I have discovered that the book edited by Martin Davis &quot;The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; undecidable&quot; has been republished in 2004 by Dover. This is really the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comp basic bible. It contains the readable original paper by Godel,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Church, Kleene, Rosser, and, above all the incredible anticipation by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Post. Actually Post did even anticipate my thesis, that is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; platonistic reversal physics/number-computer-science. To be sure he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; adds a footnote (footnote 118) saying he changed his mind ... I think I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will write a paper just on that footnote ....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But I had been doing thought experiments of a somewhat similar
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; nature literally for decades, based on questions like &quot;why am I me and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; not you?&quot; or &quot;how do I know that me now is the same as me 5 minutes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ago?&quot; or &quot;is the person who gets out of the transporter the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; person as the one who began the journey?&quot;  For some time, faced
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; largely with incomprehension or disinterest, and seeing hardly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; anything remotely like this referred to in print, I despaired of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; finding others who believed these questions were anything but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; irrelevant or crazy.  But gradually these topics seemed to emerge into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; discussion from a variety of directions, and now I've found a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; community of similarly crazy people on the Internet.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Actually those typical comp or mechanist thought experiences
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (reasonings) exist since humans use tools. Reference are in the biblios
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of &quot;conscience et mécanisme&quot;. Many Sc. fiction book go through such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience, and the book &quot;Mind's I&quot; (ed. by Hofstadter and Dennett)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contains relevant thought (but miss my favorite sc. fi. book, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;SIMULACRON III&quot; by Daniel Galouye).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mind'I eyes missed the first person comp indeterminacy and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subsequent reversal.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The conclusion I had come to is broadly summarised in my recent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; posts.  It seemed to me that the 'transporter' questions could only be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; resolved if I thought in terms of my being incorporated in some unique
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; or 'global' pre-differentiated manner, which nonetheless
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; multifariously self-localised by differentiation of structures that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; embodied distinct 'histories'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would say that, once we accept comp, the only problem which remains
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is the &quot;white rabbit problem&quot;, that is: the problem of isolating from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computer science the measure on the relative computational histories
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; capable of justifying the apparent normality of the observable laws.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This seemed somehow to entail the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; emergence of finitude from the not-finite, which seemed weirdly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; right.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ? (comp presupposes the natural numbers. Indeed they constitute the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; absolutely unsolvable mysteries).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Anyway, it would be the histories that differed, not the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'self'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This could depend on choice of vocabulary. If you define the self by

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  The histories would break the symmetry of the self into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; differentiated sub-selves that would be 'I' with respect to their own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; private environments.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hopefully. That is what is under the course of verification. Again,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; accepting the positive integers makes such symmetry breaking easy to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand. The real mystery (partially solved though) is in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understanding of the physical initial apparent symmetry.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; These environments, being participatory, could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; only be shared with other such sub-selves by signalling', and the sum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; total of shareable signals, re-embodied, would be the 'objective' or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'outside' physical description of the situation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hopefully again. This would correspond to the first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   person plural notion, as far as some part of the comp indeterminacy is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sharable (like the quantum reality seems to confirm).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But since these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'entities' could only be self-defined emergents of the original self-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; relativisation, everything was in fact 'outside-less' and continued to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; exist uniquely or monistically as a network of self-relation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ... itself emerging from the additive/multiplicative number relations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The self itself is what computer science and provability logic explains
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the better.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Depending on whether the participatory or 'objective' perspective was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; adopted, self-relation could apparently decompose into 'sense' or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'action' narratives, but such decomposition was in fact illusory, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; perspective-dependent.  Self-relation in fact remained singular or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; decomposable in nature
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is fuzzy. I can agree but I have more than one interpretation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's hard not being more technical here.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Having said this, I can now perhaps contextualise more clearly my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; concern about functionalism.  Functionalism is the doctrine that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; consciousness is a function of the relationship between parts.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hmmm... I would say that this is the old, pre-comp, physicalist account
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of functionalism. With comp, and with the fact that consciousness is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; typical first person notion, it is not clear if we can describe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness by any local relation between part. Consciousness (but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; also matter) is necessarily related to &quot;all histories&quot;. Only the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible third person discourse can be locally related to describable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relations between describable parts.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; entails that, discounting eliminativism, consciousness must be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; actualised by such relations,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by an infinity of them. This should follow from the UDA.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and that if such parts were to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; considered 'ultimately' to be physical,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think this has no meaning in the comp frame. The physical is what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; glues the (lobian) personal experience. This includes an infinity of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;linear stories&quot; capable of multiplying themselves by &quot;tensor product&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of independent computational histories. But I have not yet isolate this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tensor structure, to be sure. If it does not exist, comp is false.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Cosmology could be related to the depth and other Church-Turing like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; complexity notions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; then the relevant relations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; could only be physical relations.  If this were so, the actual or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; realised relationships existent in a physical structure would be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; exhausted by its physical description, and the ascription of a super-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; added set of 'computational' relationships would merely be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; metaphorical and hence not real enough to be &quot;I&quot;.  Consequently, if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; physics is held to be fundamental to consciousness, and consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is an observer effect, then such observers must be fully describable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; by physical relationships, not functional ones, and the appropriate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; substitution level is physical duplication, to some level of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; tolerance.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK, but this is explicitly what cannot be done in the comp frame. A
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; good thing given that &quot;physical&quot; can hardly be defined by the product
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of observation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; By contrast, if the reality of parts and relationships is to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; considered fundamentally numerical,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The main first half of my work consists in showing that comp does not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; give a choice in those matter.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; then consciousness and physics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; could indeed be derived functionally or computationally from this kit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of parts and their relations.  From this perspective, the physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; structure of the body and the observational structure of the mind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; could be held to emerge
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ... should emerge, ok.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; respectively from 'action' and 'sense'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; decompositions of the fundamental self-relative nature of number-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; relations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Nonetheless, if the observer decomposition continues to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; regarded as 'functional' with respect to the physical one,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is unclear, I'm afraid.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; they remain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in some deep sense orthogonal - i.e. the 'functionalism' is that of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'imaginary parts' and 'imaginary relations' with respect to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; physical description.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It follows that there may be no final way of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'de-crypting' any unambiguous observer structure from the physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; description alone.  We would then be left unavoidably with an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'objectively' unknowable and unprovable imputation of consciousness to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; any physically-defined structure.  So be it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But it might then be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; questioned how observer and physical narratives could somehow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'converge' on a common or consistent environmental interface as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; result of any form of co-evolution. Such a notion would seem to imply
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that equivalent selection effects could be operating on both
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; environments despite their orthogonal orientation. It is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; immediately apparent why this should be so.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As far as I understand, this is *the* problem. It seems insoluble
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; untill you take into account explicitly the incompleteness phenomenon
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which put high constraint of what sound machines can believe, bet,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observe, feel ... (that what the hypostases are all about).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It may consequently offer some theoretical advantages to suppose that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a single evolutionary path is followed as a consequence of one-to-one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; reciprocity at some level between sense and action components of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; primitively self-relative narrative, and that consciousness is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; consequently not 'functional' with respect to the physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; description, but in some real sense isomorphic or analogic.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hmmm ... there is a fixed point ... I am not sure this helps here ....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; would not, ISTM, be to postulate any fundamental 'material' substrate,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; but rather to be saying something about the way a 'neutral'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; fundamentally self-relative process could 'decompose' into apparently
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; reciprocal components as a consequence of the embodiment of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; observation.  However, I can't at this point see whether such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; alternatives can be resolved purely theoretically, or whether they are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; fundamentally empirical issues.
