&quot;Kim Jones&quot; &lt;kimjones.domain.name.hidden&gt;  said
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Conversations with God&quot; by Neale Donald Walsch (Hodder and
</em><br />
Stoughton
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1995) is &quot;a bloddy good read&quot; as we like to say here in Australia
</em><br />
<br />I think myself that one problem with such books is that they are very
<br />
Christian oriented. I recently heard a lecture by David Tacey (Latrobe
<br />
U, Melbourne) which really sounded as if it had a lot of good ideas
<br />
buried in it and was reasonably broad minded. Probably both his books
<br />
and those of Walsch are well worth reading by anyone with the time.
<br />
Then I read details of his stuff on the Web. It was simply Christian,
<br />
little more. e.g. no Hinduism, which I actually prefer generally to
<br />
Christianity at this time. I felt 'let down'. And Moslems, Buddhists,
<br />
extreme agnostics and freethinkers might well feel 'let down' also,
<br />
just as I did. No blame to Tacey, but Christianity is now a rather
<br />
minor religion, relatively speaking. That is probably another good
<br />
reason for Bruno to keep dogmatism out of any serious spiritual work
<br />
if he contemplates writing it. But one only has to look at the current
<br />
cartoon riots to see that these matters are important. Many people
<br />
just do not see it. As for example the fact is that many honestly
<br />
consider the prophet Mohammed to have been a pedophile That is a fact
<br />
occurring in very many cartoons but NOT the Danish ones, e.g. the fact
<br />
is referred to in  <a href="http://www.homa.org/">http://www.homa.org/</a> , a cartoon-free URL, I think,
<br />
incidentally. There is elsewhere on the web a picture of the prophet
<br />
Mohammed with a large erection with a frightened small child who is
<br />
going to be forced to submit etc. etc., the cartoon is enough to make
<br />
a Christian to want to murder any Moslem or anyone who could support
<br />
Islamic ideas and it could well be fair comment. Maybe the Moslems
<br />
have guilty consciences and that is one reason for their protests.
<br />
These matters are certainly unsavory but writing a book on theology
<br />
without dogma is worth considering. Worse could be said about
<br />
Christians. The gospel according to Mary Magdalene is becoming more
<br />
popular nowadays, as well as the apparently common buggery by priests
<br />
and bishops of one another and small boys.That is almost a clerical
<br />
joke by now! One feels like saying after a service, 'Poor sermon
<br />
today, weren't you buggered by the Bishop last night?'. All most
<br />
unseemly, Sodom and Gomorrha definitely come to mind. And indeed so
<br />
does global warming and the lack of Church efforts in that regard.
<br />
Instead the fools trifle with frivolities. They want Sodom and
<br />
Gomorrha, it seems, and that is probably what they will get.
