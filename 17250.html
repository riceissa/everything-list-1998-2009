<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Didn't anyone ever explain arithmetic or geometry to you?  Not every
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explanation needs to be a causal one.
</em><br />
<br />Well, I think that's what I'm saying.  Causal explanations are not
<br />
really explanations, because you can never trace the causal chain back
<br />
to it's ultimate source.  Or if you do, the ultimate source is itself
<br />
uncaused.  So, if you rephrase the answer in terms of ultimate causes,
<br />
you end up inserting either &quot;unknown&quot; or &quot;uncaused&quot; everywhere.
<br />
<br />So causal explanations are subjective...only meaningful within a
<br />
limited context.  Going back to my granite block example:
<br />
<br />Let's consider two adjacent specks of white and gray found within a
<br />
block of granite.  Why are they adjacent?  What caused them to be
<br />
adjacent?  Well, if we consider this block of granite within the
<br />
context of our universe, then we can say that there is a reason in
<br />
that context as to why they are adjacent.  There is an explanation,
<br />
which has to do with the laws of physics and the contingent details of
<br />
the geologic history of the area where this block of granite was
<br />
formed (which is in turn derived from the contingent details of the
<br />
initial state of our entire universe).
<br />
<br />BUT if we take an identical block of granite to be something that just
<br />
exists uncaused, like our universe, then there can be no explanation.
<br />
The two specks are just adjacent.  That's it.  No further explanation
<br />
is possible.
<br />
<br />So in the first case, the geologic explanation makes sense in a local
<br />
subjective way, but not in an absolute way, because the universe that
<br />
provides the context for the geologic explanation has no reason behind
<br />
its initial state or it's governing laws of physics.  The universe
<br />
just is the way it is.  Therefore, ultimately the block of granite
<br />
just is the way it is.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And being uncaused doesn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prevent explanation - for example decay of an unstable nucleus is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; uncaused, i.e. it is random, but it is still explained by quantum mechanics.
</em><br />
<br />So you can explain it within the context of the laws of our universe,
<br />
but this just raises the question of why the laws of our universe are
<br />
what they are.
<br />
<br />Ultimately your answer is:  unstable nuclei decay because that's what
<br />
unstable nuclei do.  Tautology.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think you point is better made by observing that an explanation must
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be of something less known in terms of something better known.  Since
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nothing can be better known than our own subjective experience, it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cannot be explained.
</em><br />
<br />Well, that is pretty good.  I'll file it away for future use.  Thanks!
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; So I am saying that no matter how this system evolves, no aspect of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the system can ever be given a meaningful explanation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now you've introduced another term &quot;meaningful&quot; explanation.  If one can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand it, it must be meaningful.
</em><br />
<br />So when people find hidden messages in the Old Testament using the
<br />
&quot;Bible Code&quot;, these are meaningful messages?  Really?
<br />
<br />If something means something to me...that's subjective.  It means
<br />
something TO ME.  I have a conscious experience of finding that thing
<br />
meaningful.  There's something that it's like to find it meaningful.
<br />
Qualia.
<br />
<br />I'm not sure where I'm going with this point, but...I think it means
<br />
something.  To me.  Ha!
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; And neither is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; there any reason to think that it won't continue it's predictable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; pattern.  The system follows it's own &quot;uncaused&quot; rules, which we may
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; be able to guess at, but which we cannot know, due to the system's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; fundamentally uncaused nature.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You seem to take the position that because knowledge isn't certain no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; knowledge is possible.
</em><br />
<br />Well, no.  That's not what I'm saying.  I'm saying that the conscious
<br />
experience of knowing is somehow more fundamental and important than
<br />
what is known.
<br />
<br />If conscious experience is uncaused and acausal, then in some sense
<br />
knowledge is irrelevant.  Your uncaused experience could be of
<br />
believing that you &quot;know&quot; something which is actually false (e.g.,
<br />
that 121 is prime).
<br />
<br />If conscious experience is caused, then knowledge is...still
<br />
irrelevant.  But for a different reason...in this case what you *can*
<br />
know is determined by those external causes.  You could be caused to
<br />
believe that you *know&quot; something which is actually false (e.g., that
<br />
121 is prime).  But if you then trace the causal chain back, you will
<br />
never find what ultimately caused you to be wrong...when you phrase
<br />
your answer in terms of the ultimate causes, it will just be &quot;I was
<br />
wrong because that's the way the universe is&quot;.
<br />
<br />Do you see what I'm getting at with all of this &quot;uncaused&quot; stuff, and
<br />
the equivalence between an uncaused universe and just an isolated
<br />
uncaused conscious experience?  At all?  Anyone?
