</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; computation is still *conscious* even if no-one else is able to figure this out or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; interact with it. If a working brain in a vat were sealed in a box and sent into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; space, it could still be dreaming away even after the whole human race and all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; their information on brain function are destroyed in a supernova explosion. As far
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; as any alien is concerned who comes across it, the brain might be completely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; inscrutable, but that would not make the slightest difference to its conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; experience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Suppose the aliens re-implanted the brain in a human body so they could interact with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it.  They ask it what is was &quot;dreaming&quot; all those years?  I think the answer might
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be, &quot;Years?  What years?  It was just a few seconds ago I was in the hospital for an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appendectomy.  What happened?  And who are you guys?&quot;
</em><br />
<br />Maybe so; even more likely, the brain would just die. But these are contingent facts about 
<br />
human brains, while thought experiments rely on theoretical possibility.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; then it can be seen as implementing more than one computation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; simultaneously during the given interval.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; AFAICS that is only true in terms of dictionaries.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Right: without the dictionary, it's not very interesting or relevant to *us*.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; If we were to actually map a random physical process onto an arbitrary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; computation of interest, that would be at least as much work as building and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; programming a conventional computer to carry out the computation. However,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; doing the mapping does not make a difference to the *system* (assuming we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; aren't going to use it to interact with it). If we say that under a certain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; interpretation - here it is, printed out on paper - the system is implementing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; a conscious computation, it would still be implementing that computation if we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; had never determined and printed out the interpretation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And if you added the random values of the physical process as an appendix in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; manual, would the manual itself then be a computation (the record problem)?  If so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; how would you tell if it were a conscious computation?
</em><br />
<br />The actual physical process becomes almost irrelevant. In the limiting case, all of the 
<br />
computation is contained in the manual, the physical existence of which makes no 
<br />
difference to whether or not the computation is implemented, since it makes no difference 
<br />
to the actual physical activity of the system and the theory under consideration is that 
<br />
consciousness supervenes on this physical activity. If we get rid of the qualifier &quot;almost&quot; 
<br />
the result is close to Bruno's theory, according to which the physical activity is irrelevant 
<br />
and the computation is &quot;run&quot; by virtue of its status as a Platonic object. As I understand 
<br />
it, Bruno arrives at this idea because it seems less absurd than the idea that consciousness 
<br />
supervenes on any and every physical process, while Maudlin finds both ideas absurd and 
<br />
thinks there is something wrong with computationalism.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; The problem remains that the system's own self awareness, or lack thereof, is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; not observer-relative. something has to give.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Self-awareness is observer-relative with the observer being oneself. Where is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; difficulty?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Self-awareness is awareness of some specific aspect of a construct called &quot;myself&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is not strictly reflexive awareness of the being aware of being aware...  So in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the abstract computation it is just this part of a computation having some relation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we identify as &quot;awareness&quot; relative to some other part of the computation.  I think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it is a matter of constructing a narrative for memory in which &quot;I&quot; is just another
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; player.
</em><br />
<br />I don't think &quot;self-awareness&quot; captures the essence of consciousness. We commonly think 
<br />
that consciousness is associated with intelligence, which is perhaps why it is often stated 
<br />
that a recording cannot be conscious, since a recording will not adapt to its environment in 
<br />
the manner we normally expect of intelligent agents. However, consider the experience of 
<br />
pain when you put your hand over a flame. There is certainly intelligent behaviour associated 
<br />
with this experience - learning to avoid it - but there is nothing &quot;intelligent&quot; about the raw 
<br />
experience of pain itself. It simply seems that when certain neurons in the brain fire, you 
<br />
experience a pain, as reliably and as stupidly as flicking a switch turns on a light. When an 
<br />
infant or an animal screams in agony it is not engaging in self-reflection, and for that matter 
<br />
neither is a philosopher: acute pain usually displaces every other concurrent conscious 
<br />
experience. A being  played a recording of a painful experience over and over into the relevant 
<br />
neural pathways may not be able to meaningfully interact with its environment, but it will 
<br />
be hellishly conscious nonetheless.
