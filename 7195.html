<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and Tom Buckner followed up with an interesting comment on the potential

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for time travel in Tegmarkian multiple universes.
</em><br />
<br />Those are interesting speculations, but I don't think it really makes
<br />
sense to imagine travelling between the worlds of the Tegmark multiverse.
<br />
There are no causal connections between them of the type that would be
<br />
necessary for an information packet to travel in the way we normally
<br />
think of it happening.
<br />
<br />I think David Deutsch had some ideas about time travel in the MWI
<br />
going between parallel worlds, but again I didn't think that could work,
<br />
physically.  Once worlds have decohered, there are no physical mechanisms
<br />
for them to interact to any measurable degree.
<br />
<br />However I do think there are connections between time travel and the
<br />
MWI, different from Deutsch's rather simplistic picture of travel to
<br />
parallel worlds.
<br />
<br />The big problem with time travel is not so much the kill-your-father
<br />
paradox, because as Ben writes this can be easily dealt with by
<br />
postulating that only consistent time travel works.  The bigger puzzle
<br />
then is the apparent necessity of the universe to be intelligent, for the
<br />
natural laws to engage in strategic reasoning at least as advanced and
<br />
sophisticated as the intelligent beings whose free will it is thwarting.
<br />
<br />When a time traveller tries to do something, there has to be the potential
<br />
for a sort of back-reaction from the universe which can interfere with
<br />
his actions if they would lead to a paradox.  Let's suppose he goes
<br />
to do something, make a change in the past which it turns out will be
<br />
inconsistent with his memories in the future.  Something's going to
<br />
stop him.  But how does the universe know that this has to be stopped?
<br />
It seems that there has to be at least a potential or virtual universe
<br />
created in which his actions play out, their consequences extend through
<br />
time into the future where the time traveller departed from, and the
<br />
inconsistency with his mental state is detected.
<br />
<br />This can be represented as a quantum wave function which is travelling
<br />
around a causal loop, such that only consistent conditions can exist.
<br />
But for this to work I think we have to imagine universes existing where
<br />
the other things happen, the ones which will get cancelled out in the end.
<br />
<br />This is not unlike a commonplace phenomenon in QM, where the classical-
<br />
physics paths of particles arise from what is actually a much more muddled
<br />
condition at the quantum level.  The seemingly straight path of a beam of
<br />
light is actually the result of constructive interference much like what
<br />
we are postulating to prevent time paradoxes.  Light actually takes every
<br />
possible path from A to B.  Most of them cancel out, and only the paths
<br />
that are straight interfere constructively rather than destructively.
<br />
<br />The thing is, though, that the other paths do exist and are represented
<br />
in the wave function.  They are not usually considered, even by believers
<br />
in the MWI, to represent &quot;worlds&quot;.  This is because they do not decohere
<br />
and so do not acquire independent existence.  They all get folded back
<br />
together much like the two paths through a double-slit experiment.
<br />
<br />We can imagine a model of the MWI which does treat the two paths through
<br />
a double slit experiment as separate worlds, which then recombine.
<br />
I think this is actually the perspective that Deutsch prefers.  In that
<br />
view, we could say that the crooked light beams also exist in worlds
<br />
of their own, which recombine and cancel each other out.
<br />
<br />In the case of time travel, if we apply the same concepts, then the
<br />
decohered-out worlds would also be said to have existence in the MWI.
<br />
They don't have lasting existence or effects, but they exist in some
<br />
sense for some period of time.
<br />
<br />It is in these &quot;shadow&quot; worlds that the apparent intelligence of nature
<br />
arises in the case of time travel.  Any action that would produce a
<br />
paradox, no matter how complex the effect or how long the chain of
<br />
causation that it requires, gets simulated and all its effects get
<br />
determined in shadow universes.  Real people live there whose lives
<br />
are affected by the changes in history, and whose actions may play a
<br />
part in making the paradox arise.  It's almost like a super-powerful
<br />
quantum computer running to check everything the time traveller does
<br />
for consistency.
<br />
<br />In the movie Back to the Future, Marty travels back to the past and meets
<br />
his mother when she is a teenager.  She falls in love with him instead of
<br />
his father, so Marty won't be born.  This is a paradox which nature would
<br />
prevent in a real situation.  Nature might stop Marty from meeting his
<br />
mother, so things will still go as they were supposed to.  But how does
<br />
nature know that he shouldn't be allowed to meet her?  It seems that there
<br />
must exist a shadow world where they do meet, where she falls in love,
<br />
and all the consequences play out.  Yet that world ends up having no
<br />
real existence.  It gets cancelled out just like the crooked photon paths.
<br />
<br />What of the version of Marty's mother who fell in love with him?  What is
<br />
it like to be her?  I think QM would predict that she is of measure zero.
<br />
It's not clear what that means, but under the ASSA it would seem to mean
<br />
that there is essentially zero chance that anyone will find themself
<br />
in such a situation.  Yet, she had to live, she had to breathe, her
<br />
heart had to beat and fall in love, for the paradox to be recognized.
<br />
Was she a zombie?  Did she act as an automaton, without consciousness?
<br />
How could she fall in love if so?
<br />
<br />These are tough questions and I don't really have an answer for them.
<br />
On the one hand, it seems that we will never have to face the prospect
<br />
of living in a paradox.  On the other, it seems that someone must live
<br />
there or else there would be no way of recognizing that a paradox would
<br />
arise out of certain actions.
<br />
<br />A related manifestation of this paradox in time travel stories is the
<br />
creation of information out of nothing.  The classical example is the man
<br />
who is given a gift by his older self of a time machine from the future.
<br />
He presents it to the world and is acclaimed as the inventor of time
<br />
travel.  All future time machines are based on his model.  There's no
<br />
paradox here, but who invented the time machine?  Well, the universe did.
<br />
How did the universe get that intelligence?  From the shadow worlds.
<br />
<br />Imagine, for example, if the time machine were actually invented by
<br />
someone, and they wanted to go back in time and give it to their younger
<br />
self.  That would be a paradox and would be prevented.  But maybe the
<br />
simplest way to prevent it is to just skip the invention part and let the
<br />
younger man receive the time machine as a gift.  This solves the problem,
<br />
avoids a paradox, achieves local consistency, and perhaps requires less
<br />
work on nature's part.
<br />
<br />Deutsch, or maybe it was Moravec, wrote an article years ago about
<br />
how you could coerce nature into doing computation for you, if you had
<br />
a time machine.  Basically you would set things up so that a paradox
<br />
would arise unless a randomness circuit got lucky and came up with a
<br />
solution to a hard-to-solve problem.  Where does the solution come from?
<br />
Again you are getting nature to act as a quantum computer for you,
<br />
in the shadow branches.
<br />
<br />Isaac Asimov had a story about a chemical which would dissolve *before*
<br />
it was placed in water.  He wrote about how scientists learned to extend
<br />
the time span, and then the military found a way to use this effect
<br />
for a bomb.  When a sample of the chemical was observed to dissolve, it
<br />
was sealed in a dry, water-tight container and dropped in an unfriendly
<br />
country.  Now, in so many hours, it was certain that the interior of the
<br />
bomb would get wet.  But how could that happen?  The only force strong
<br />
enough was a disastrous flood, of such magnitude that the container
<br />
would be carried off and torn open, so that the chemical could dissolve.
<br />
And of course this would do tremendous damage to the enemy's facilities.
<br />
<br />Once again, nature is forced to act intelligently, even strategically,
<br />
in order to prevent paradox.  The substance had to get wet, it had, in
<br />
a sense, already gotten wet, and nature had to find the best way to do it.
<br />
<br />One final point, which is that there is a related phenomenon in some of
<br />
our multiverse models.  It seems that to avoid a paradox, nature must
<br />
in some sense try different things to see which ones work.  But &quot;when&quot;
<br />
does it do this?  How much time does it take?  Well, it can't happen in
<br />
the regular time coordinate.  We already know what happens there, the
<br />
non-paradoxical time line occurs and no paradoxes exist.  I suggested
<br />
that there are parallel universes where the paradoxes occur, and this
<br />
provides a mechanism and place and time for the extra work, the trial
<br />
and error, to happen.
<br />
<br />In some multiverse models, we allow for a certain amount of trial and
<br />
error to create a universe.  We don't always stick to just a simple case
<br />
where we set up the initial conditions and natural laws, and evolve them
<br />
forward, time-step by time-step.  We have discussed more complex rules
<br />
which would work in part by trial and error, setting things first one
<br />
way and then another, until various consistency criteria are satisfied.
<br />
Such an optimization or satisficing machine might be a better model
<br />
for our own universe than the simple Cartesian clockwork program we may
<br />
naively imagine as our first conception.
<br />
<br />The point is that there is a time coordinate within the universe, but it
<br />
is not necessarily the same as the time coordinate of the computer that
<br />
is creating the universe.  That computer may be going back and forth,
<br />
tweaking here, changing there, taking a long time just to set up a small
<br />
patch of space-time in its output tape.  This is another way to think of
<br />
&quot;where&quot; and &quot;when&quot; the alternatives for paradox free time travel could
<br />
be considered and rejected.
