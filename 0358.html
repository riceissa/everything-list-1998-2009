<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I find it hard to accept the premise that &quot;I&quot; am a random selection from

</em><br />
<br />Wei replied:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why do you find it hard to accept?
</em><br />
<br />It is difficult for me to understand what this premise would mean.
<br />
I know that I am a human being in a certain place and time.  How can
<br />
I say that I might be, or might have been, a poor Chinese peasant?
<br />
An inhabitant of ancient Rome?  Or a bug eyed alien?
<br />
<br />The one way I can make sense of this is a rather weak reading: if all
<br />
conscious entities try to draw a conclusion based on the assumption
<br />
that they are randomly selected from among all conscious entities,
<br />
then most of them would be right.  Suppose it turns out, for example,
<br />
that most conscious entities exist in groups near others, rather than
<br />
in isolation.  Then for most conscious entities, the conclusion that
<br />
&quot;I am near others&quot; would be true.
<br />
<br />This is basically tautological.  It is just a matter of the definition
<br />
of what &quot;most&quot; means.  Things that are known to be true for most observers
<br />
are true for most observers.  But I have the impression that we want to
<br />
make a stronger statement here.
<br />
<br />This leads to the problem of what is the proper reference class.  If all
<br />
I know is that I am a conscious observer, then I can draw these kinds
<br />
of conclusions.  But I know more.  I know that I am human.  If I know
<br />
that humans have hemoglobin, then I can conclude that I have hemoglobin.
<br />
<br />I know more than this.  I know that I am a human being living in the
<br />
year 1999, a resident of the U.S.  From this I can conclude more about
<br />
my likely circumstances, for example, if I have a heart attack I can
<br />
probably get medical treatment in about 15-30 minutes.
<br />
<br />But it seems to me that I know even more than this.  I know that I am a
<br />
specific individual, with specific memories and personality.  This is the
<br />
maximal information I have available to me.  The only actual uncertainty
<br />
I have about my position in the universe must be consistent with this
<br />
information.
<br />
<br />There may be other instances of consciousnesses which are
<br />
indistinguishable from mine somewhere in the universe.  I don't know
<br />
which of those instances I am.  It seems to me that this is the proper
<br />
reference class from which I should consider myself a random selection.
<br />
It is the only one which fully takes into consideration the information
<br />
I have available.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course you can choose not to accept
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it, but then you lose a very important advantage of the &quot;everything&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theories, which is an explaination of why our experiences are so simple
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and regular, as opposed to random and arbitrary. How would you explain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this fact without the above premise?
</em><br />
<br />If we could show that among instances of me, most were in lawful
<br />
universes, that would be a good first step.  It would not show why I
<br />
existed in the first place, but it would give me reason to conclude that
<br />
the apparent lawfulness of the universe was not an illusion.
<br />
<br />I earlier wrote:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In this way I do not try to draw conclusions about the likelihood or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; longevity or measure of other consciousnesses than the one I am now
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiencing.  I don't conclude that the human race is doomed, or that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I won't live forever, or that few aliens exist.  These conclusions are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very questionable, in my opinion.
</em><br />
<br />And Wei replied:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Me too, but I think the problem is in the arguments, not in the premise. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you care to exhibit such an argument, I'll try to point out the error. 
</em><br />
<br />The doomsday argument has a large amount of literature on it.  Nick
<br />
Bostrom has a page at <a href="http://www.anthropic-principle.com/preprints.html">http://www.anthropic-principle.com/preprints.html</a>
<br />
with several links to it.  These people have spent a lot more time
<br />
thinking about it than I have, and if there is an error, no one seems
<br />
to agree on it.  Nick and Robin Hanson had a long debate about the
<br />
subject on the extropians list a few months ago, but were not able to
<br />
come to agreement.  (They seemed to bog down on the issue of the proper
<br />
reference class, whether it made sense to say that I might have been
<br />
a rock.  That was what I got out of the debate, anyway.)
