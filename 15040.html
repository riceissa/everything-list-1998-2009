<br /><br />OK, measure theory theory does not relate directly to the similarity  
<br />
relations. This happens with the comp hyp through indiscernability  
<br />
relations. Indeed you cannot distinguish the computations which differ  
<br />
below the level of substitution, like you cannot distinguish your  
<br />
state of mind you would have if some electron has this or that  
<br />
position within the same energy level. The measure on first person  
<br />
histories has to take this equivalence into account. But we cannot  
<br />
know our level, we can only make some empirical bets. Strictly  
<br />
speaking the equivalence relation is not constructive. We don't really  
<br />
can know who we are, and the probabilities cannot be defined with  
<br />
certainty. If some probability calculus works well, empirically, it  
<br />
would give evidences (not proof) for some level, and if QM can be  
<br />
extracted from comp, this would mean that empirical quantum mechanics  
<br />
would assess the idea that, roughly speaking, our level of  
<br />
substitution is given by the position of our particles up to the  
<br />
Heisenberg uncertainiy relations. The quantum indeterminacy would, in  
<br />
that case directly results directly from the 1-person comp  
<br />
indeterminacy, but we don't yet know this. That would be nice because  
<br />
the empirical many-world (the empirical reasons for not believing in a  
<br />
collapse of the wave packet) would comfort the fact that we share  
<br />
histories (given that we can share the quantum indeterminacy). Quantum  
<br />
Mechanics would really be a non-solipsistic first person *plural*  
<br />
indeterminacy calculus, and physical reality as we know it today,  
<br />
would really be the product of dream sharing. QM would comfort that we  
<br />
belong to the same &quot;matrix&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What bearing does it have on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; case when you make exactly two copies of a person, one which is exact
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and one which contains (say) roughly half of that person's memories,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; personality, or whatever?
</em><br />
<br /><br />To make a prediction on the future from the past you have to remember  
<br />
the past (or at least some relevant part of the past). If you allow  
<br />
(partial) amnesia, it could depend on many things including the type  
<br />
of computations allowing the amnesia: it makes almost no sense a  
<br />
priori. It would be like asking what is probability to get six  
<br />
(subjectively or as first person experience, like we have to do  
<br />
assuming comp) when throwing a dice knowing in advance that once you  
<br />
have thrown the dice you will forget that you have thrown the dice!
<br />
So I am not sure the question can even make sense. I said to George  
<br />
Levy a long time ago (in this list) that all first person  
<br />
probabilities in self-multiplication experiments presuppose that the  
<br />
level of substitution (of brain material) has been chosen correctly,  
<br />
and thus serendipitously given that we cannot known for sure our own  
<br />
substitution level.
<br />
<br />Now, your question could still make sense if you accept the idea that  
<br />
there is only one person possible. We would all be the same person in  
<br />
different context. With this you can predict that amnesia would be  
<br />
lived as a remembering of your more correct identity. Unfortunately  
<br />
record of amnesia by wounded person does not confirm this, except,  
<br />
apparently for some drug induced amnesia, like the one provoked by the  
<br />
use of the plant salvia divinorum (there are many reports available on  
<br />
the net). So it looks like some type of amnesia (which belong to some  
<br />
type of computation) could confirm &quot;we are the same person&quot;, and in  
<br />
that case, those amnesia would not change the probability rules. But  
<br />
all this is much more speculative so I conjure you to take this with a  
<br />
bit of a distance. Of course if you are lucky to belong to a country  
<br />
where the consumption of salvia divinorum is authorized, you could  
<br />
test it on yourself but read the manual before and be cautious. I have  
<br />
tested it and I do find the effect very interesting for learning  
<br />
things about identity and reality, but not to the point of having get  
<br />
any definite conclusion. It certainly opens me to be more interested  
<br />
in the amnesia phenomenon, and it makes me more open to the &quot;only one  
<br />
person&quot; proposition, but it is not a sort of knowledge easily  
<br />
sharable, except, well like consciousness,  through sharing identical  
<br />
brain transformation, which of course is very hazardous when they are  
<br />
produce through the use of some chemicals (but still less hazardous  
<br />
than using an hammer on your skull or getting a car accident).
<br />
<br />The day will come (not tomorrow) where we will bet on some effective  
<br />
artificial brain, and this will lead to more systematic way to handle  
<br />
such questions in much less hazardous way. The hazardous part will be  
<br />
put entirely in the bet on our substitution level.
<br />
<br />To sum up my comment: probability of self-multiplication with loss of  
<br />
memory depends most probably on the way such memories are deleted.
<br />
The fact that some drugs give a &quot;remembering&quot; feeling through amnesia  
<br />
could be an evidence that Darwinian evolution (by itself very long  
<br />
computations) has handled brain/identity recuperation mechanism, and  
<br />
that we share a personal identity. Some mystic describes similar  
<br />
experiences.
