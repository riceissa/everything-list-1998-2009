</em><br />
<br />Yes, and as I've said, I was trying to convey the essence of this
<br />
thought with what became (unfortunately) confused with 1-person primacy
<br />
on this list. I'd be grateful for help on reformulating this more
<br />
coherently if possible. The heart of it is the primary intension of
<br />
'exists', whose fons et origo I take to be: 'exists in the sense that I
<br />
exist subjectively'. The problem is that as soon as one formulates it
<br />
in this way, all sorts of unlooked for windmills spring up for the Don
<br />
Quixotes of the logical mind to struggle with. Somehow one must avoid
<br />
being distracted into grappling with pseudo-problems of pansychism,
<br />
idealism, solipsism etc. - in their timeworn academic clothing - and
<br />
focus on the embeddedness, or 'here-ness' that is central to this
<br />
primary sense of 'exists', and see that everything else is somehow
<br />
derivative of, or emergent from, this primary intension. And, as you
<br />
say, by this token we are of course ourselves directly rooted in this
<br />
reality, whatever it is.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The belief that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'underlying reality is actually made of quantum mechanics (as opposed to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being merely described by it) to me looks like a mass delusion of the most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bizarre kind.
</em><br />
<br />One implication of this (which I think is also implied by comp) is that
<br />
1-person experience derives from a more complex instantiation than the
<br />
3-person narrative that emerges from it. That is, there is a global
<br />
instantiation level of sufficient complexity to express 1-person
<br />
existence 'qualitatively'. At this level, qualitative modalities -
<br />
'qualia' - also function as stripped-down 'relata', encoding '3-person
<br />
worlds' of structure, relation, transaction, and locality. We may
<br />
speculate, for example, that our experientially dynamic discrimination
<br />
(A-series) of relation and structure (B-series) emerges from the
<br />
'unmediated intuitive grasp' of such relational locality within
<br />
qualitative globality. All this strongly entails that we will never
<br />
find the 1-person within the 3-person. The evidence of course is
<br />
perhaps already staring us in the face, were we to accept it as such.
<br />
There is nothing at all in the 3-person that looks like, or that we
<br />
have any notion could possibly look like, the 1-person. Maybe this is
<br />
why.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No, it's better visualised as 'being a not-mirror' :-)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Imagine you embedded a mirror in your head, but you were only interested
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in everything the mirror was not. That is, the image in the mirror is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; manipulating the space intimately adjacent to the reflecting surface.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Keep the space, throw the reflecting surface and glass away. What you are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interested in is 'being' that space, not the mirror. When you do that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the 'movie screen' that is the experiential field becomes part of you. Yes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it's a play, only 1 viewer who literally 'is' the theatre, no regressing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; homunculi.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [David Nyman]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Oddly, I think I *see* what you mean (and I use the term advisedly).  One
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the problems we experience in discussing these issues (certainly  I do,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anyway) is the lack of a really effective way to share powerful
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *visualisations* of what we're proposing. Not everything we're trying  to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; express is formalisable (at this stage anyway) in mathematical or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; strictly logical terms. I've tried to express before this image of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relationship between what-is-functioning-as-perceiver and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what-is-functioning-as-percept, and the picture in my head was always
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something like you describe. And the key aspect is that you *are* this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relationship, your grasp of the situation is unmediated, there is no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; regress. For me, this is the primary intension of 'exists', and it lies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at the heart of what I confusingly referred to as 1-person primacy -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaning only that you can't come by any of this unless you *are* the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entity in question. The commitment is total - there is no way of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; climbing outside of this to study the situation 'objectively'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [Colin Hales]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Glad to 'see' that you 'see'. :-)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is very interesting to see how much trouble people have with this and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it is very ironic because it is the position we naturally inhabit (all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observation is subjectivity), yet the subjectivity delivers the capacity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to behave objectively so brilliantly we think we have actually stepped
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; back from it... but as you say...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;there is no way of climbing outside of this to study the situation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'objectively'&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yet that is what we scientists insist we are doing! Without subjectivity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there's no 'objectivity' (in the form of an 'as-if' or virtual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; objectivity) to be had. The descriptions we define as 'objective' and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; describe 'objectively' are merely generalisations in respect of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appearances of what bruno would call 'objective' (actual) reality...what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it is that is actually there, whatever it is that is the 'underlying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality'..... That also delivers the appearances into your brain/via your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain, which as actually made of the underlying reality, not of anything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we divine through the appearances it delivers.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Indeed I would hold that our subjective experience (subjectivity)is our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one and only intimate and complete connection to the underlying reality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and it is the existence of it (subjectivity) 'at all' which is most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; telling/instructive  of the true nature/structure of the underlying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality, not the appearances thus delivered by subjectivity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As I think I have said before: 'seeing' is evidence of the underlying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality and its capcity to deliver 'that which is seen'. The latter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; delivers two sorts of evidence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a) more evidence of the organisation of the underlying reality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; b) what we regard as objective evidence used by scientists in formulations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of emopirical laws that organise the appearances but tell us nothing about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the underlying reality because we throw (a) away for no reason other than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it is our culture to do so.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There's a lot more to observation than merely 'that which is seen'. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; act of seeing at all is also observation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Metaphorically... if you hear &quot;X is true&quot; being said you get 2 lots of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evidence, not one:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; c) some evidence in support of the proposition that &quot;X is true&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; d) more definite evidence of the proposition &quot;somebody said something&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'that which is seen' corresponds to &quot;X is true&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The underlying reality is the 'somebody'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Science calls any consideration of the 'somebody' as evidenceless
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non-scientific metaphysics and spurns/eschews it when is is actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; _more_ evidenced! in that (d) is a better supported claim than (c)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That's about the lot on 'observation' except to wonder when mainstream
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; science (in particular cosmology and neuroscience) finally 'get it'. This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simple cultural foible hides the key to 'everything'. The belief that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'underlying reality is actually made of quantum mechanics (as opposed to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being merely described by it) to me looks like a mass delusion of the most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bizarre kind. Thomas Kuhn should be marching up and down with placard
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; saying &quot;NO MORE EVIDENCE-ISM&quot; &quot;EVIDENCE DISCRIMINATION UNFAIR TO
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; UNDERLYING REALITY&quot;. :-)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cheers,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
