<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; VIRTUAL is just a word. &quot;AS-IF&quot; would be a good synonym. The 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; physicists in question are trying to make sense of a *model* of

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; appearances (how the world appears to them when they look). They can

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; be 100% predictive  (in the article now, 98% predictive) and be 100% 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; not talking about what reality is made of.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Agreed - you have explained this very well in many of your other 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; posts. I'm not even a physicist's or a logician's or even a humble 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematician's bootlace, so if I can understand you, that's a big 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; complement on the clarity of your exposition
</em><br />
I think I might be a physicist's armpit or maybe the itchy bit that you 
<br />
just can't get at. :-)
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The reason is that they build the phenomenal consciousness of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; scientists into all laws whilst creating a set of laws of appearances 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that entirely and permanently fail to predict phenomenal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; consicousness. A system I am entirely fed up with and choose mostly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to resign myself to (in the sense of I give up arguing about it).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So here I may need some help. Aren't you some kind of latter-day 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Copenhagenist in this? Or are you saying scientists introduce the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer as if real and then fail to see his reality in the data (as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; somehow affecting the data?) I know this list has been pummelling away 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at this issue for years, but I was just hoping that somebody for once 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; may have actually damped down the dust a little - as this article 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suggests. Psychologist Carl Jung got very excited in the late 50s 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; after he gained a rudimentary understanding of particle physics from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Wolfgang Pauli and was completely over the moon about Heisenberg's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Uncertainty Principle because he had always believed in his heart of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hearts that reality was God's &quot;dream&quot; (he was a bit of a closet 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theologian as well) and was seeing in all this confirmation of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; central place in the universe of human consciousness (the &quot;psyche&quot; as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; he and Freud called it)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; He saw this as God's hand at work. Maybe this is tangential to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point; I don't know
</em><br />
I choose this:
<br />
*Or are you saying scientists introduce the observer as if real and then 
<br />
fail to see his reality in the data (as somehow affecting the data?)
<br />
*as me (ish)
<br />
<br />QM goes this far:
<br />
(a) The human scientist  is inside the system described.
<br />
(b) In a scientific act the human is involved in the particular outcome.
<br />
(c) The observation then acts in support of the QM model.
<br />
<br />QM's XYZ interpetation then says &quot;reality if made of my flavour of math 
<br />
XYZ&quot;. and then runs off into the implications of the *math*, rather than 
<br />
what reality actually is. In other words they all attribute a QM &quot;law of 
<br />
appearance&quot; in some way as structural.
<br />
<br />The thing is that this mis-attribution fails because it fails in all 
<br />
ways to predict phenomenal (P-)consciousness. Prediction (c) is merely 
<br />
&quot;contents of P-consciousness&quot; = particular observation. I mean it (QM) 
<br />
fails to predict the existence of P-consciousness.....which is EXACTLY 
<br />
the failure you would predict would occur if appearances were NOT 
<br />
structural in any way (or better - that descriptions of structure and 
<br />
descriptions of appearances are NOT the same thing).
<br />
<br />I am not saying that there is a discovery to be made in the existing 
<br />
paradigm of physics.
<br />
<br />I am saying that the discovery to be made is about OURSELVES....we must 
<br />
discover how to do science, rather than accept hand-me-down dogma from 
<br />
our ignorant forbears via the mentor/novice system, which is what 
<br />
actually happens.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Reality can be made of interacting 'somethings', where that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'something' has not even been uttered yet in any physics ever, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the results in the paper would still be as they are because all the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; scientists are doing is organising appearances.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have absolutely no problem with that thought. Who would have even 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; DREAMED of Dark Matter and Dark Energy before they turned up? Your 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; separation of the two &quot;systems&quot; of thinking into the subjective world 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of appearances and the phenomenal (virtual/&quot;as-if&quot;) world strikes me 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as extremely useful and simplifies a lot of the angels-on-pinheads 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aspect to much of the relentless discussion going on. Once again, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we've been talking about &quot;observer moments&quot; for years. I imagine 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there's a lot more talk still to come.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I only ask (muse?) - can't they BOTH be true (the psychical/subjective 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; phenomenality AND the substratum - whatever that is: numbers, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical objects, a primitive physical materiality, whatever?) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Considering most people are now entertaining serious notions of higher 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dimensions, parallel universes and the like - it would seem there is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; room for both (dare I say) realities to co-exist (and associate via 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interference phenomena?) What that could possibly mean is up to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; someone with more clout than I to say
</em><br />
Yes. MUSE+++++
<br />
Both are real.
<br />
Both are equally empirically supported by P-consciousness.
<br />
But the existing descriptive paradigm, has failed for 2000++ years to 
<br />
predict P-consciousness.
<br />
....because it is the STRUCTURE (noumenon) side that is actually 
<br />
delivering the P-consciousness - it is ACTUAL reality.
<br />
<br />I have a paper here: Hales, C. (2006), 'AI and Science's Lost Realm'. 
<br />
IEEE Intelligent Systems 21(3):pp. 76-81.
<br />
which mainly bitches on about inconsistencies in science.
<br />
<br />I have another 'Dual Aspect Science' paper in review elsewhere, which 
<br />
details the science structure and examines the implications. This I hope 
<br />
might break down a barrier or two. We'll see.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; So in terms of the use of the word 'virtual' you seem to want to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; discuss ... yes, it is 'as-if' the universe were made of &lt;pick your 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; fave from the zoo of particle/antiparticle pairs&gt;. But the universe 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; could _actually_ be made of something completely different and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; they'll never know because they never let them consider the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; possibility of separation of &quot;appearance&quot; and &quot;structure&quot;(that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; creates appearances in humans made of the structure). So ....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But that underscores the need for something like Bruno's comp hyp, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; surely. We can only BET on the higher realities. Goedel has kind of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proven that we can never prove anything about them
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We are stuck on the inside of Nothing, as Russell says.
</em><br />
(i) I still don't know whether Bruno's COMP is a 
<br />
structure(noumenon)-aspect description of an actual reality.
<br />
OR
<br />
(ii) If it is a model being computed in our reality that is supposed to 
<br />
behave 'like' ours.
<br />
<br />In the case of (i) COMP would be the rules underlying 'natural cellular 
<br />
automaton' and could actually be a viable structure aspect 'science'. 
<br />
There is no computer. The interacting structural primitives are reality.
<br />
<br />In the case of (ii) COMP is just false. As in COMPutationalism. An 
<br />
abstract model of reality cannot deliver the dynamics of a reality 
<br />
because it cannot deliver a scientist inside it because it has to 
<br />
perfectly define ignorance..which means it must know everything already 
<br />
and it doesn't because science is possible. Logical sweet-spot.
<br />
<br />Re: RUSSEL &amp; &quot;We are stuck on the inside of Nothing&quot;
<br />
*Excellent!* I didn't know he said that...where?
<br />
0 = 1-1+1-1+1-1......(you) +1-1+1 ...(me) +1-1+1- (boat) 
<br />
+1-1+1-1+(physicist)+1-1+1-1+1- ..... .....
<br />
&quot;Nothing&quot; (No-thing) is impossible, You can't add up quick enough to 
<br />
make it perfect.
<br />
Or....to state it better: &quot;Nothing&quot; is an unstable (temporary) equilibrium.
<br />
<br />(a) Noumenon is the RHS of the above.
<br />
(b) Phenomenon is the RHS from the perspective of being (you) or (me) as 
<br />
a scientist.
<br />
<br />'virtual particles' are appearances produced by  (b) not (a).
<br />
We haven't even recognised the right for the (a) description to be 
<br />
constructed yet.
<br />
We are assuming descriptions of (b) are impossible. Still, after 2000++ 
<br />
years of assumption.
<br />
Which all sucks really.
<br />
I tend to think in very practical modes. I am only interested in the 
<br />
universe we are in and in which there are chronic pain sufferers who'd 
<br />
really like to have their P-consciousness fixed. This means explaining 
<br />
P-consciousness. Which as I have described... is the very thing current 
<br />
physics-of-appearances fails to do.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;According to this article, the best we can do is to VIRTUALLY CONFIRM
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; something. But since reality is VIRTUAL, according to this VIRTUAL
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; CONFIRMATION, is not VIRTUAL CONFIRMATION equivalent, in reality, to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; CONFIRMATION?&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'Confirmation' (insofar as consistency with a model does that) of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; virtual particles as a model of appearances cannot be confused with a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'virtual' or 'AS-IF' confirmation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But you are saying scientists are regularly doing just that. Hence 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your ongoing frustration, yes?
</em><br />
Much simpler... a language problem...
<br />
confirmation of virtual particles is not virtual confirmation! It's 
<br />
confirmation.
<br />
<br />The problem I have is the sense in which what has been done is 
<br />
'confirmation'. It represents is consistency with a model of 
<br />
appearances. That is all. Predictive, useful...but only that. NOT 
<br />
structural. As usual the process is completely in presupposition of the 
<br />
existence of appearances and of a scientist to accept/have those 
<br />
appearances.
<br />
<br />It seems that the last thing physicists want to do is predict 
<br />
themselves. They do absolutely &quot;everything&quot; except that. When they say 
<br />
&quot;everything&quot; in a &quot;Theory of Everything&quot;, that's what they actually 
<br />
mean: Everything except physicists (and their P-consciousness).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Scientists don't act 'as if' they do science. They actually do it, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; even if it's only the 'appearances' half of the pair of possible 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; science models). So the above sentence conflates terms, which is why 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I thought you weren't serious.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm both serious and unserious. I exist in an infinitude of brain 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; states over this. Humour, lateral thinking and discontinuity 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (provocation) often gives birth to previously hidden directions in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thinking. A well placed jocular statement can often show people the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sidetrack that leads straight to the solution that they just zipped 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; past in blind straight-ahead vertical thinking fashion. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
Here's hoping this might happen in the mental states of a few here on 
<br />
'everything'!
