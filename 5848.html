<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Sorry Jesse, I can see in retrospect that I was insulting your intelligence

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;as a rhetorical ploy, and we &gt;shouldn't stoop to that level of debate on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this list.
</em><br />
<br />No problem, I wasn't insulted...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;You say that you &quot;must incorporate whatever information you have, but no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;more&quot; in the &gt;envelopes/money example. The point I was trying to make with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;my envelope/drug example is that you &gt;need to take into account the fact 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that the amount in each envelope is fixed
</em><br />
<br />Well, I think that's like saying that in the videotaped coinflip example, 
<br />
you need to take into account the fact that the outcome of the flip is 
<br />
already fixed. I don't think it matters whether it's &quot;really&quot; fixed or not, 
<br />
since probabilities are about your knowledge rather than objective reality 
<br />
(they're epistemological, not ontological), and since you are equally 
<br />
ignorant of the outcome regardless of whether the flip happens in realtime 
<br />
or on video, your probabilistic reasoning should be the same.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;But you have passed over the final point in my last post, which I now 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;restate:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(1) The original game: envelope A and B, you know one has double the amount 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the other, but you &gt;don't know which. You open A and find $100. Should 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you switch to B, which may have either $50 or &gt;$200?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(2) A variation: everything is the same, up to the point where you are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;pondering whether to switch to &gt;envelope B, when the millionaire walks in, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and hidden from view, flips a coin to decide whether to &gt;replace whatever 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;was originally in envelope B with either double or half the sum in envelope 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;A, i.e. &gt;either $50 or $200.
</em><br />
<br />Well, my argument about the two-envelope paradox all along has been that you 
<br />
need to think about the probability distribution the millionaire uses to 
<br />
stuff the two envelopes, and that once you do that the apparent paradox 
<br />
disappears. So we need to consider what probability distributions the 
<br />
millionaire used in these examples. Let's say, for example, that the 
<br />
millionaire flips a coin to decide whether to put $50 or $100 in one 
<br />
envelope, and then puts double that amount in the other. In that case, if I 
<br />
pick an envelope randomly, there is a 1/4 chance I'll find $50 inside, a 1/2 
<br />
chance I'll find $100 inside, and a 1/4 chance I'll find $200 inside. If I 
<br />
find either $50 or $200, I know with complete certainty how much the other 
<br />
envelope contains; but if I find $100, then from my point of view there's a 
<br />
1/2 chance the other envelope contains $50 and a 1/2 chance the other 
<br />
envelope contains $200.
<br />
<br />Now, if you assume that in game (2) the millionaire *only* replaces the 
<br />
amount in the second envelope with a new amount based on a coinflip *if* I 
<br />
found $100 in the first envelope, but doesn't mess with the second envelope 
<br />
if I found $50 or $200 in the first one, then both games are exactly equal, 
<br />
from my point of view. In both cases, whenever I find $100 in the first 
<br />
envelope, my average expected return from switching would be (0.5)($50) + 
<br />
(0.5)($200) = $125, so it's better to switch.
<br />
<br />On the other hand, if in game (2) the millionaire replaced the amount in the 
<br />
second envelope with a new amount based on a coinflip *regardless* of how 
<br />
much I found in the first envelope, this would change my strategy if I found 
<br />
either $50 or $200 in the first envelope. In this case, it will be to my 
<br />
advantage to switch no matter how much I find in the first envelope, since 
<br />
my average expected return from switching will always be 1.25 times however 
<br />
much I found in that envelope.
<br />
<br />In contrast, in game (1) my average expected return from switching would be 
<br />
$100 if I found $50 in the first envelope and $100 if I found $200 in the 
<br />
first envelope, while my average expected return from switching if I found 
<br />
$100 would still be $125, so my total average expected return from switching 
<br />
regardless of what I find in the first envelope is (1/4)($100) + (1/2)($125) 
<br />
+ (1/4)($100) = $112.50, while my average expected return from sticking with 
<br />
my first choice regardless of how much I find is (1/4)($50) + (1/2)($100) + 
<br />
(1/4)($200) = $112.50 as well. Again, in game (1) the resolution of the 
<br />
apparent &quot;paradox&quot; must be that for any possible probability distribution 
<br />
the millionaire uses to pick the amounts in the envelopes, your average 
<br />
expected return from sticking with your first choice if you don't open it to 
<br />
see how much is inside must always be equal to your average expected 
<br />
winnings if you decide to switch without first checking how much was inside 
<br />
your first choice.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now, which game would you prefer to play, (1) or (2)? They are not the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;same.
</em><br />
<br />With the conditions I mentioned--the millionaire flips a coin to decide 
<br />
whether to put $50 or $100 in one envelope, then puts double in the other, 
<br />
and in game (2) he only replaces the amount in the second envelope if you 
<br />
find $100 in the first envelope you choose--then the two games actually are 
<br />
exactly the same, in terms of probabilities and average expected returns. If 
<br />
you want to suggest some different conditions, though, go ahead.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Look at it another way: game (2) is actually asymmetrical. The amount you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;win if you play it many times &gt;will be different if you switch, because you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;really do have more to gain than to lose by switching (and &gt;the millionaire 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;will have to pay out more on average). On the other hand, intuitively, you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;can see that &gt;your expected gains in game (1) should be the same whether 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you switch or not. The paradox comes &gt;from reasoning as if you are playing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;game (2) when you are really playing game (1).
</em><br />
<br />If we say that in game (2) the millionaire replaces the amount in the second 
<br />
envelope with a new amount based on a coinflip *regardless* of how much you 
<br />
found in the first envelope, then I agree that the paradox comes from 
<br />
reasoning as if you're playing game (2) when you're really playing game (1). 
<br />
But I would say the reason for that is that there's no possible probability 
<br />
distribution the millionaire could use to stuff the envelopes in game (1) 
<br />
that would lead to all the same probabilities and average expected returns 
<br />
as in game (2) -- the reason is that there's no possible distribution where 
<br />
you should conclude there's a 50% chance of the second envelope containing 
<br />
double what you found in the first and a 50% chance of it containing half, 
<br />
regardless of what amount you actually found in the first envelope. For 
<br />
every real probability distribution the millionaire could use in game (1), 
<br />
your estimate of the probability of the second envelope containing double or 
<br />
half will vary depending on the amount you found in the first.
<br />
