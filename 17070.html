<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You could say, for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; example, at any point &quot;to go further you would need a deeper grasp of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; x, but for now, it has this or that role or function in the overall
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; story&quot; - or something like that.  I'd be very grateful - and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attentive.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think that you have already understood that this will just lead back to an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unsolved mind-body problem.
</em><br />
<br />But might it not, nonetheless, help to improve the mind-body
<br />
intuitions?  Let's see.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let me define two notions of first person indeterminacies.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is the local one, when your current state is duplicated relatively to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; earth, or me (say) . This is done in the first sixth steps of the UD
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reasoning.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; From some of your post I can suspect that there is something perhaps still
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unclear there.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In the Washington/Moscow duplication, the *you* arriving in Moscow (resp.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Washington) provably cannot understand why he is the one arriving in Moscow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Washington). It is the same question as the one you asked me: &quot;why am I me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and not my brother&quot;. It is trivial, with comp. No program can predict which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; backup, among two, will be the one being re-instantiated, relatively to its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; most probable history/computation.
</em><br />
<br />Actually, I do follow the first six steps of the UD reasoning; my own
<br />
'beam me up, Scotty' reasoning had led me to similar conclusions. So,
<br />
no problem with this.  But I do have trouble grasping what is, I
<br />
think, a different aspect of the observer moment, and I'll try to
<br />
state it as clearly as I can.  When I imagine an infinity of OMs, as
<br />
it were, co-existing in some atemporal sense, I find I still can't
<br />
satisfactorily answer the question: why am &quot;I&quot; experiencing JUST this
<br />
one?  I don't mean of course, why does this experience possess just
<br />
*these* characteristics - this is always determined by the structure
<br />
of the OM, as per the UD steps.  The issue, rather, is that &quot;I&quot; is
<br />
essentially a global referent that fundamentally applies only to the
<br />
whole, and that the 'part' or 'little me' is thus nothing but the
<br />
*viewpoint* of the whole at a given moment
<br />
<br />So under this assumption the real question is: why is the *whole* at
<br />
this moment seemingly limited to ONLY this view rather than any - or
<br />
indeed all - of the available co-existing alternatives?  And in the
<br />
light of an infinity of co-existing OMs, I can't answer this, because
<br />
such a co-existing whole should presumably co-presently see (i.e.
<br />
'be') ALL points of view 'at once'.  AFAICS, notions of measure do not
<br />
suffice to resolve this.
<br />
<br />However I have a wacky intuition: despite the platonic criterion of
<br />
co-existence, 1-person experience of the temporal dynamism (i.e.
<br />
sequentiality) of the part - i.e. each OM - might reasonably persuade
<br />
us that sequentiality should also possess, in some ineliminable sense,
<br />
a role in the whole.  Consequently, under this assumption, could the
<br />
UD (to reify it only to this degree) be conceived for this purpose to
<br />
be 'sequentially resolving' each 'OM-programme-step'?  Indeed my
<br />
understanding is that this dovetailed sequentiality is actually a key
<br />
conceptual element of COMP.  In this sense - and in this sense only -
<br />
could the UD therefore be thought of as temporally instantiating that
<br />
OM *uniquely* at each step on behalf of the whole COMP-multiverse, and
<br />
thus bringing into focus - in effect - its *unique* point of view?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then there is the global first person indeterminacy, which appears at step
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 7, although it is &quot;definitely there&quot; with the step 8. It is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indeterminacy of your immediate subjective future &quot;in front&quot; of a never
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ending universal dovetailing. At that step, assuming (or not with step 8) a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concrete universal dovetailing in the universe (or in arithmetic) you should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand that you are duplicated &quot; at each instant&quot;, so that your future
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subjective instant is determined by an infinity of computations: all those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (existing in the U dovetailing) going through your actual states. So, in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; order to attach your mind to a physical appearance, you have to justify the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical appearances from an infinite set of computational histories. OK?
</em><br />
<br />Yes, I understand as I've said above that I am duplicated at each
<br />
instant (what I used to think of as being 'teleported into the
<br />
future').  However, I must press you on your use of the expression
<br />
'going through your actual states'.  I think you mean:
<br />
<br />1) Your 'actual state' corresponds to some OM (i.e. the one you 'find'
<br />
yourself in).
<br />
2) The UD entails that an infinity of prior and posterior states is
<br />
implied by your finding yourself in *this* OM - i.e. they 'go through'
<br />
this state.
<br />
3) Hence the physical appearances you discover in this OM must depend
<br />
on (i.e. be justified by) the totality of these states.
<br />
4) It follows therefore that any association of your mind - as the
<br />
collection of these states - can be correlated only with the
<br />
*totality* of physical appearances derived from this collection.
<br />
<br />Is this right?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The physical reality can no more be just a mathematical structure among
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; others. There may or may not exist such a structure, but in any case this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure or quasi-structure has to result from the statistical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;interference&quot; of an infinity of computations.
</em><br />
<br />Implied by 3) above.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; AUDA illustrates the consistency of such an idea, and provides a technical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way to extract already the logic of the observable events. But AUDA is far
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more demanding in logico-mathematical technicalities.
</em><br />
<br />You said it!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; AUDA is UDA, where the &quot;yes doctor&quot; is replaced by a &quot;direct&quot; interview of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correct self-introspecting universal machine.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Somehow, what I am saying in AUDA is that, thanks to the work of Gödel, Löb,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Solovay, etc., we can already have a talk with the universal machine and ask
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; her opinion, and what &quot;her&quot; physics looks like.
</em><br />
<br />Now, the 'yes doctor' is an act of faith.  But how much further will
<br />
we be able to rely on the machine's opinions on what her physics looks
<br />
like?  Enough to take the leap with certainty, or is there always some
<br />
irresolvable doubt? (I think the answer is yes, because the
<br />
substitution level remains always below the level of introspection.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then it is a rather technical point to show that by adding non computational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; power to such a universal machine will not change the AUDA interview, unless
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you bring necessarily vague ad hoc &quot;non comp&quot; feature build for changing the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interview.
</em><br />
<br />So what is consequential on this?  Do you mean that in this case the
<br />
machine can still derive consistent (though incomplete) opinions on
<br />
her physics and therefore make reasonable bets on her duplicability?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If a universal machine bet that God create earth and heaven in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; six days and that she is not duplicable, well, it becomes hard to even argue
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if the AUDA physics will change or not.
</em><br />
<br />And what is consequential on this? Do you mean that her view of her
<br />
physics has become such that neither she (by fiat) nor we (per theory)
<br />
can make reasonable bets on her duplicability?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hope this &quot;heroic failure&quot; can help the grandma a little bit,
</em><br />
<br />Yes, it helps when we go more slowly and step by step, so that the
<br />
ignoramus can keep up.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;gods&quot; (non emulable entities). The theology of the machine van be

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lifted to almost all &quot;self-duplicable&quot; entities (but the proofs get

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more complex). It applies to most of the &quot;gods&quot; I mentioned in some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; post. You have to go very near the big unnameable for getting rid of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the completeness of G/G* propositional theology. This was seen by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Solovay (with other terms).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Or you have to postulate we are much less than universal machine,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which is just &quot;obviously false&quot;, imo.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is a weakness, it means we can only test a very general
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; principle. Most gods have similar physical realities, they have the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; same observable. Physics become a very strong invariant, it is stable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for many non recursive permutations. But it is real hard math to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; handle all this material.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Actually, comp itself has a huge spectrum according to the choice of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; substitution level. Transfinite weakenings of the notion of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; substitution level can help to extend most comp consequence on those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; weakenings. But this could be only of academical interest, I don't know.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am not sure I would say &quot;yes&quot; to a doctor who does propose me an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; actual infinite brains.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Actually, I find much of the above VERY hard to follow except in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; vague way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The problem is that the negation of COMP is a very vague and multiple
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; notion.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; All what I say is that most of the consequence of COMP remains true for most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; precise technical weakening of the comp hyp.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Unless you weaken so much comp that you lost the self-duplicability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; property: you say no to all possible doctors.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Would it be possible, as an accompaniment of your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; step-by-step exposition of the UD in detail, to also give a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; step-by-step storyline of the above, but with the absolutely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; irreducible minimum of reliance on the deeper (i.e. very hard for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ingnorami like me to access) technicalities.  You could say, for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; example, at any point &quot;to go further you would need a deeper grasp of

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We talked in the past of a grandmother version or roadmap - do you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recall?  I've got a feeling that you sometimes wonder if you may let
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; us - or yourself - down by *not* going into all the detail all the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time, but the problem - at least for me - is that my memory isn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; retentive enough to retain the pivotal elements of the narrative
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whilst we charge off on the next - no doubt essential - safari into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the logical-mathematical jungle.  But could we try grandma's version
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; again?  Even heroic failure would teach us something.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
