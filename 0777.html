<em class="quotelev1">&gt;	Suffice it to say, though, that whether the number of branches is

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;finite or infinite makes little difference.  The point is you lose measure

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with a QS.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Some people in the multiverse have more measure than others,

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and measure is proportional to effective probability.  If you deny this I

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;don't see how you can even explain why people descended from apes have

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;higher effective probability than those that form spontaneously.
</em><br />
<br />I do agree with the relation between measure and effective probability.
<br />
The solution is linked to Wei Dai's *little program*. Although that is 
<br />
not enough. But OK, let us not try to resolve this issue now.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; [BM] The problem is that Jacques M Mallah is computationnalist. I am afraid
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that this entails he has no other choice than to choose the relative SSA.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Only by choosing a strong physicalist ontological principle AND by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; choosing a strong (and rather mysterious) link between consciousness and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; physical activity, will it be possible for him to get a &quot;limited MW&quot; in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; which branching is absolute. Such a link between consciousness and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; physical activity has been showed incompatible with mechanism (by myself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; in 1988, and independently by Tim Maudlin in 1989, precise reference in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; <a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal</a>.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;	[JM] Yeah right.  I wanted to see this crackpot proof only because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(unlike QS) it does directly touch on my interests, but unfortunately it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;was unreadable.  So what's the idea of the &quot;proof&quot;?  In English.
</em><br />
<br />1) I like very much your sense of humor, Jacques. Do you really believe 
<br />
that
<br />
I will be clearer in English ? ... and without drawings, and without
<br />
hands waving ?
<br />
<br />2) Is is not premature ? I'm still amazed you don't see the point in
<br />
the PE-omega thought experiment (the Universal Dovetailer (DU) argument).
<br />
After all, the main goal of the *crackpot proof* is the elimination of
<br />
the extravagant hypothesis HE, i.e. the need for a CONCRETE execution of a
<br />
universal dovetailer (Schmidhuber's great programmer, Wei Dai's 
<br />
counting algorithm, etc.).
<br />
<br />2) Is it necessary ? This very discussion list, as we can realize by 
<br />
looking at the beginning in the archive, is founded on the idea 
<br />
(see also Tegmark and Schmidhuber, and (of course) Everett !) that 
<br />
allowing more [every] things to exist makes possible the isolation of 
<br />
more [the most] simpler [simplest] explanation possible. This, I think,
<br />
means that almost every one in the list accept some kind of 
<br />
conceptually strong form of Occam Razor (as explicitely,
<br />
exemplified by James Higgo). With such an idea, there is no need for
<br />
eliminating HE. Any arithmetical (abstract) DU is enough.
<br />
<br />3) Is it possible ? When I explain the UD argument (the PE-omega 
<br />
thought experiment in the list) to people, they usually understand it 
<br />
...eventually. 
<br />
And because most of them dislike the conclusion (the ontological 
<br />
reduction of physics to computer science or number theory, 
<br />
the disappearence of the universe, the many-worlds phenomenology) 
<br />
they drop out computationnalism, and go back to their activities.
<br />
... or they begin to believe that our universe (beside being unique)
<br />
is very little so that HE is false, ... but here enter the crackpot proof.
<br />
<br />Unlike the UD argument, when I explain the movie graph argument 
<br />
(the *crackpot proof* in your so poetical manner to name things), 
<br />
most people remain silent, looking at me as if I am crazy, or 
<br />
begin to try to argue upon every things !
<br />
I met Tim Maudlin in the early 90thies and ask him about the reaction
<br />
to his (equivalent) paper. He told me &quot;none&quot;. 
<br />
I am not to much astonished you find the movie graph argument 
<br />
(my *crackpot proof*) unreadable.
<br />
If I try to explain it, it could be a very long thread ... 
<br />
<br />4) ... and you tell us you will unsubscribe (snif!). May be you 
<br />
deserve that I try, at least, to give you the idea, before you go, of 
<br />
&quot;the proof&quot;, 
<br />
in a nutshell, in &quot;English&quot;.
<br />
<br />The argument &quot;prove&quot; the incompatibility between computationnalism (comp)
<br />
and the physical supervenience thesis (sup-phys) i.e. the 
<br />
idea that consciousness is linked (causaly, epiphenomenaly,
<br />
whatever...) with the physical activity of the brain.
<br />
<br />The problem here is that the &quot;physics&quot; cannot distinguish a
<br />
counterfactually correct firing of a neuron (for exemple) and an
<br />
accidentally correct firing of a neuron.
<br />
<br />For exemple, think that
<br />
the neuron is broken and that, by pure chance, a cosmic ray supplies 
<br />
it in real time.
<br />
&nbsp;Then, if consciousness supervenes on the physical activity
<br />
of a digital computer (emulating a brain), it will be not difficult 
<br />
to show that consciousness will supervene
<br />
on a physically equivalent device, at some level below our substitution 
<br />
level,
<br />
where the device is build in such a way   -by filming the computer-  that 
<br />
all &quot;computationnal activity&quot; will be purely
<br />
accidentally correct (like in a cartoon where the dropping of a stone in
<br />
a window is NOT the cause of the breakdown of the window).
<br />
<br />That mean that consciousness could supervene on something equivalent to a
<br />
filmed brain, in which there is no form of &quot;physical&quot; computation at all. 
<br />
This is basically the idea of the reductio ad absurdum.
<br />
<br />5) ... enough for today. I'm tired and my english looks more
<br />
and more like french.
<br />
I would still like to mention that Hal Finney (if I remember correctly) 
<br />
has pointed toward a similar form of argument in the discussion. 
<br />
I don't remember where. I will look for it in the archive.
