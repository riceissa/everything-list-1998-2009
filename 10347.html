</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) Well, this obviously depends on the subject of the seeming. To me,

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'red', 'middle C', or 'bitter' all *do* seem to possess a sort of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; directly sensed 'vibrational' quality that is essential, for example,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to why I would feel they were 'like' or 'unlike' other colours, sounds,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or tastes, or where they would *subjectively* lie in 'spectra'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; analogous (but not identical) to those of 'physical' properties.
</em><br />
<br />They have some mathematical/structural properties, but they a
<br />
re underdefined by those properties -- theya
<br />
re far from the wholes tory.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) They are by definition incommunicable in mathematical or any other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; language, but this does not in my *experience* equate to their being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'structureless' in *feel*.
</em><br />
<br />I disagree. I can discern no structure *within* the taste
<br />
of lemon or the colour red. There are relations between
<br />
tastes, colours and so on, but they underdiefine the tastes
<br />
and colurs themselves.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If I attempt to imagine what the 'bare
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; substrate' would *feel* like, I am frankly at a loss because it *seems*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to be devoid of content - what would there be to be 'felt'? But beyond
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the substrate we have the equally fundamental IMO notion of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; differentiation (a neutral term I'm using because it isn't committed to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a purely 'physical' view) and it seems to me that the intersection of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; substrate and differentiation could well *be* the direct experience of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; content.
</em><br />
<br />The substrate could be differnentiated into properties
<br />
that have no further reducible structure -- ie qualities.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I also call such content 'structure' because it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; differentiated but if you'd rather reserve this for the relational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; idea, so be it.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Correlation is not identity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Precisely. But the correlation of qualia with structurally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; differentiated 'physical' phenomena leads to the intuition that qualia
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; themselves may be an *experiential synthesis* based on structural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; differentiation of the same bare ('property-less' in your own terms)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; substrate.
</em><br />
<br />What is an  experiential synthesis ?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The substrate, as you say elsewhere, provides enduring
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence within which the properties manifest and change. I'm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suggesting that the *existence* of the differentiated substrate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *synthesises* the qualia (i.e. they entail multiple differentiations)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and the mutual *relations* of the differentiated substrate *are* the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'properties'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; BTW, when I meditate on a substrate whose differentiation resolves into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'me' 'you' and other persons, I tend to 'take it personally'.  The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'impersonal' gaps between persons are IMO no different in kind than the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; gaps between my own experiences at different times, places, branches of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MW, etc.
</em><br />
<br />I have no idea why you would think that.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The substrate is in these terms a single 'potential
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiencer'.
</em><br />
<br />It's a potential everything. Why an experiencer in particular ?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The actual experiences it possesses are then a function
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of an infinite network of differentiation. I've said something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; elsewhere about the implications of this for the perception of time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; both as discrete, rather than totalised, experiences, and as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'dynamic' quale, mediated by discrete 'capsules' of locally-delimited
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Mutual relations are not internal relations. Purple
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; lies between red and blue, but being told that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; doens't tell you what purple looks like unless you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; already know what red and blue look like. Realtional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; information about colours does not convey the colours
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; themselves.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Nothing can 'tell you what purple looks like'. Purple is a medium that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; carries information, not information itself. However, the *feel* of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; purple may seem related to the *feel* of blue. Isn't this ultimately a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter for each 'seemer' to meditate on?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; If that were the case, there would be no HP, and threfore no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; need for any first-personness worth arguing about.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't think that the HP is a useful idea.
</em><br />
<br />That's hardly relevant! Problems are problems. They
<br />
don't slink away if you accuse them of uselessness.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I think there is existence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and this is something I 'take personally' because it *seems* to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; manifest as me, and other mes, all of whom I find it intuitive to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conceive as subsets of a much Vaster me, with 'conscious regions' (e.g.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'me yesterday', 'me on the branch where I didn't have that last beer',
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'Peter five minutes ago') and 'unconscious regions' (e.g. 'me after
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that last beer', interstellar space, a rock).
</em><br />
<br />Ontology is all about what you take as fundamental,
<br />
and why. Your grounds for taking the me/not-me
<br />
distinction as fundamental seem subjective and inutitive rather
<br />
than logical.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  The EP is the observable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behaviour (information content) of all this, insofar as we have access
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to and can make sense of it.
</em><br />
<br /><br />There must be a reason why the Ep is easy.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; That is still pure Chalmers -- natural supervenience is not identity,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; after all.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, if 'experience' is the fact of *being* differentiable existence,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and 'the physical' is the observable relations thereof, then both
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ultimately 'supervene' on there being something rather than nothing.
</em><br />
<br />No. There being something rather than nothing is only
<br />
1 buit of  information: not enough for a universe to
<br />
supervene on.
<br />
<br />A set of complex, changing  properrties can only supervene on another
<br />
set of complex, changing properties.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/supervenience/">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/supervenience/</a>
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Further correlation is IMO an empirical issue from which might stem a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more robust theoretical model embracing both. If this is the substance
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of Chalmers' claim then I suppose I would go along with it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; How - by relational modulation of the 0-personal substrate.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; If you modulate a bunch of relations , you get another bunch
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of relations. That is no departure from reductive physicalism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, but that's not what I meant. You experience as the fact of *being*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the 'modulated' (differentiated) substrate, not *observing* it (i.e. as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information). You do of course observe it, but that then is 2nd-order,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the relational level of information, not the substrate level of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence.
</em><br />
<br />I am beginning to think your substrate is one level above my substrate.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is why I insist that differentiation is as 'primitive'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as the substrate, in the sense that there is nothing in the notion of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'substrate' as a semantic container for 'bare enduring existence' that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would lead you to suppose that it was differentiable.
</em><br />
<br />But you cna't hav edifferentiation without something to
<br />
be differentiated. So the substrate is more basic.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; There's no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reducible 'process of differentiation' at this semantic level, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rather having introduced the notion of difference, you can then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; synthesise this into whatever sort of differentiation/ structure/
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relation/ content you need for your theoretical ends.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; If you are going to continue being unable to specify what is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; personal about your primordial 1st peson, then that would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; be better, yes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't really want to go back into the word dispute, but as I've
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implied above, this may just be an aspect of explanatory style. Of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; course I never meant to claim that the substrate is a 'person' as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conventionally conceived,
</em><br />
<br />That's just the problem I have. How can you have personality without
<br />
persons ?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; but as I say, I can't help 'taking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; personally' the existent thing from which I and all persons are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emanating. I think, imaginatvely, that if one pictures a 'block
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe', Platonia, MW, or any non-process conception of reality, this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is more intuitive,
</em><br />
<br />I don't see why it should be. It does not conform to our
<br />
experience.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  because everything is 'just there' - superposed, as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it were. So, sure there's a 'layer' at which the individual 1st-person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'emerges', but it's taking everything else 'working together' to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; manifest it. So in this sense, for me, it's all 'personal'. But maybe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not for you.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It all depends on what you mean by physical. For me,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; what physicalism means beyond materialism is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; all properties are quantitiative and relational. A consequence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is that there is no layering of any significant kind.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You're on to something here, I think. Of course you're right that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical description renders the other 'chemical', 'biological' etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; schemas redundant. However, this is clearly not the case
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experientially, and this seems a very fundamental distinction. 'Form'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for example exists experientially where it is a redundant concept
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physically (though not Platonically). So there is something that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; producing a 'layering' that is shaping what we experience and in what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way. I've already suggested that experience is the fact of *being* the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structured substrate, and when we start to conceive the structure in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; terms of behaviour (i.e. treat it dynamically) what emerges may well
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; display the characteristics of a  perceiver+perceptual model system.
</em><br />
<br />That isn't at all clear to me - mainly because you
<br />
are nto makign the all-improtant distinction between
<br />
structures-structures and qualia-structures.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; These characteristics would include the 'forms' of its perceptions and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the modalities of their qualia, including the 'dynamic' quale of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; temporal experience. This would yield a relational treatment of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience which would could be correlated to whatever degree with a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical description. The results of this would be an empirical test of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conjectured 'supervenience' relations.
