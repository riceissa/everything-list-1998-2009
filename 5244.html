<br />This is getting somewhat off-topic for this list, as it's not really
<br />
multiverse related (except insofar as everything is multiverse related,
<br />
since the multiverse includes everything).
<br />
<br />However you should be aware that evolutionary theory prefers to avoid this
<br />
kind of reasoning.  At one time it was widely assumed that such behaviors
<br />
as altruism could be evolved and maintained for reasons similar to what
<br />
you describe, that they benefit the group, and so groups whose members
<br />
were altruistic would tend to survive better than groups whose members
<br />
were selfish.
<br />
<br />Later analyses showed that this doesn't really work; that selfish
<br />
behaviors have strong selective advantage compared to the relatively
<br />
weak effects of group selection.  It would be very difficult for an
<br />
altruistic behavior to spread and persist within a group if it caused
<br />
disadvantage to the individuals who possessed it.
<br />
<br />Instead, biologists eventually identified alternative explanations for
<br />
altruistic behavior, in terms of kin selection and similar factors.
<br />
Group selection is now discredited as an evolutionary force.
<br />
<br />See <a href="http://www.utm.edu/~rirwin/391LevSel.htm">http://www.utm.edu/~rirwin/391LevSel.htm</a> for some class lecture
<br />
notes discussiong group selection.
