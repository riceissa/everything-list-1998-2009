<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Well, Russell did also say that OMs and events seemed to him about as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; alike as chalk and cheese. It's starting to look that way:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; So, alas, it seems that the firmly established meanings of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;event&quot; and &quot;observer moment&quot; can't really be said to be at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; all the same thing. (Folks like Russell and Hal have been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; using the term &quot;OM&quot; for years and years, and &quot;event&quot; has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a pretty standard meaning in physics.) Observer moments have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to do with something conscious (and, evidently, pretty complex).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; And of course, as Hal wrote later on, consciousness exists on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a gray scale.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then dare I say that any Theory based on this &quot;restricted&quot; definition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of OMs (happening to observers with consciousness/intelligence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;comparable&quot; to ours) can never be as complete as a theory based on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the much simpler (and encompassing) notion of events.
</em><br />
<br />I am hugely sympathetic to the point of view you are proposing, namely that theories based on OMs do have inherent weaknesses, and
<br />
are quite out of line with the progress sciences has shown historically.
<br />
<br />Most of the proponents of OM-based theories will succumb to the temptation to resort to introspection as an investigation tool. Yes,
<br />
some will at all times keep flexibly in mind the realization that any OM explanation must be totally consistent with its dual
<br />
event-based explanation.
<br />
<br />However, it's the eternal search for ever simpler more unifying explanation that fuels the search for a way to avoid another dualism
<br />
(so it seems to me), the idea that mathematics and physics are separate. That is, they want to derive everything about physics from
<br />
the platonic existence of mathematical patterns.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ok, the above sounds a bit arrogant on my part, but its just that when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think of Big things like ToEs, I am much more comfortable without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the burden of assuming that I am special in some way. If it were so,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It would either be too much of a coincidence, or some act of a God
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that I can never hope to explain to myself.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, some of Wheeler's theories (e.g. an observer created universe) have this very characteristic: the observer (to me an immensely
<br />
complicated machine, a johnny-come-lately in evolution) is placed at the center and deemed fundamental. But to be fair, the
<br />
time-deniers (the math Platonists who seek everything explained by patterns) allow that all conscious, complex entities have
<br />
non-trivial OMs.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I can only agree to disagree by saying that any theory that explains
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness in terms of something more than just &quot;interference of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; events&quot; on a HUGE scale, is pretty much the same as explaining away
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [coincidence] as acts of a God: that unreachable, unfathomable &quot;entity&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />Yeah, well said.
<br />
