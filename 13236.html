Dear Stathis, sorry for the delay, I had to 'save' most of this response and
<br />
finish it later. Of course that will show in the inadequacy of the last
<br />
part, a second guess never matches.-
<br />

<br />
I tried to direct that overgrown discussion back to Earth, you went up the
<br />
clouds again.
<br />
Let me, please, interject in ItALICS into the copy os OUR post below.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Standard computationalism is just the theory that your brain could be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; replaced with an appropriately configured digital computer and you would not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; only act the same, you would also feel the same. - *
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &lt;JM&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I am not implying that you accept it, just scribble down my remarks to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the topic - in accordance maybe with your opinion.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 1. Standard? meaning our embryonic-level (first model) 0-1 binary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; digital mechanism? Do we really believe that our &quot;human complexity&quot; is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; simplistic and ends at the inner surface of our skull? Even there (locally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; restricted) we know only a bit of what our &quot;thinking mind&quot; is capable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of/doing. Some of these features are reproduced into binary digital
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; churnings and that is the standard. A robot of limited capabilities (maybe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; if in certain aspects even exceeding the limits of our human activity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; details).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I think 'comp' as Bruno uses the word and compares it to a L-machine is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; not like such 'standard': it may be &quot;analogous&quot;, or, if digital: of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; unlimited variance (infinitary, not only binary), and not even simulable in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; our today's epistemy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The non-standard part of Bruno's comp, as I see it, is to accept that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computation can lead to thought but to reject the physical supervenience
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory, i.e. that computation requires certain physical processes to take
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; place in order to &quot;happen&quot;. But that question aside, computationalism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; depends on the idea that (a) it is *in principle* possible to reproduce all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the physical processes in our brain using a computer, to an arbitrary degree
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of precision, and (b) such a reproduction, yielding by definition a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; functionally identical brain, also yields a functionally identical mind -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; i.e., as opposed to a zombie. Roger Penrose says that (a) is false; John
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Searle and religious people say that even if (a) is true, (b) is false. I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tend to think that (a) and (b) are both true, but I am not completely sure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
Here we go:
<br />
i.e. that computation requires certain physical processes to take place in
<br />
order to &quot;happen&quot;.
<br />
What else can we 'imagine'? Ideationa -- of whom? Mine? Yours? I wouild not
<br />
recite &quot;of the unioverse&quot; because HOW do we have access to a conscious
<br />
process of the totality with our limited mind?
<br />
*
<br />
...(a) it is *in principle* possible to reproduce all the physical processes
<br />
in our brain using a computer,...
<br />
In principle EVERYTHING is possible. Look at the discussions on this list.
<br />
...(b) such a reproduction, yielding by definition a functionally identical
<br />
brain,...
<br />
If a 'model' is identical in all respects (&quot;functionally&quot;) it is not a
<br />
model, it is the THING itself. So we are in this case playing withg words.
<br />
NOTHING can be completely identical in this world, because everything is the
<br />
product of ALL the actual circumstances co- functioning in the construction
<br />
of the 'thing' (process). And ALL the circumstances do not ever repeat
<br />
themselves identically: it would be a merrygoround world loop what we so far
<br />
did not experience. We can find similarity in ALL aspects we observe, but
<br />
that does not include the complete totality. We like to call such similarity
<br />
an 'identity'..
<br />
.So I do not argue against your finding a) and b) possible, but does it make
<br />
sense?
<br />
*******************
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2. Replaced? meaning one takes out that goo of neurons, proteins and other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; tissue-stuff with its blood suply and replace the cavity (no matter how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; bigger or smaller) by a (watch it): *digital* computer, &quot;appropriately
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; configured&quot; and electric flow in it. For the quale-details see the par #1.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Each neuron is made up of macromolecules in a watery medium. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; macromolecules follow the laws of physics: there are equations which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; describe how phospholipid bilayers form membranes, how proteins embedded in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; these membranes change conformation when ligands bind to them, how these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conformation changes result in ion fluxes and changes in transmembrane
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; potential, and so on. So if you ignore for the moment the technical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; difficulties involved in working all this out and implementing it, it should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be possible to program a computer to behave just like a biological brain,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; receiving afferent impulses from sense organs and sending afferent impulses
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to muscles, which would result in a being whose behaviour is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indistinguishable from that of an intact human. The only way around this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conclusion is if the behaviour of the brain depends on physical processes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which are not computable, like Penrose's postulated quantum gravity effects.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is possible, but there isn't really any good evidence supporting it, as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; far as I'm aware.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />3-29 insert s:
<br />
...The macromolecules follow the laws of physics:...
<br />
NONONONONO!  Certain experiences with macromolecules are described in our
<br />
incompletge views as being described by certain (statistical?
<br />
probabilistic?) findings in the physical domain. Macro- or
<br />
nonmacromolecules, atoms, their parts, show behavior in our 'slanted',
<br />
'partial'. observation which have been matched to calculations drawn upon
<br />
similarly era-restricted observational explanatory calculations (physics). I
<br />
did not work with atoms or molecules, when I made my macromo;leculs and
<br />
their applications. I worked with masses that behaved. Then I put them into
<br />
a reductionist analysis abd tried to 'match' the numerical data to those in
<br />
the books. I made 'bilayers', 'ligands'. Indeed I got responses which I
<br />
described as performing as expected. And got the patents.
<br />
*
<br />
...it should be possible to program a computer to behave just like a
<br />
biological brain,...
<br />
How does a 'biological brain' work? we - so far - extracted some behavioral
<br />
deductions into the model we have about the goo-in-the-skull and call it a
<br />
&quot;total&quot; - even with those unknown parts which come from outside the
<br />
matter-reactions we have access to - or even from so far undiscovered
<br />
aspects/factors. And I would not call it &quot;biological&quot; which is a limited
<br />
model of the functionality. One difficulty is the baggage in the words we
<br />
are restrict to in our historically developed language.
<br />
... it should be possible ...
<br />
Amen. It should. I would be happy. (But, alas, it isn't)
<br />
... indistinguishable from that of an intact human....
<br />
looks to me like the right sentence, just let it be known by what
<br />
model-characteristics (qualia) do we distinguish? Or 'can' we distinguish. In
<br />
what respect? First: Do we KNOW all details of an 'infact human' full
<br />
process? I think we know only a part of it, the oneS which ARE accessible to
<br />
our presently applied observational power and knowledge base. Just compare
<br />
to the 'infact' human as described in 1000AD or 3000BC. etc. - not in
<br />
2300AD.
<br />
...if you ignore for the moment the technical difficulties involved in
<br />
working all this out and implementing it,
<br />
in other words it is impossible, but we can think about it. No, in my
<br />
practical thinking only the possible (everything though it may be) is
<br />
usable, not input of which we presume that it is not feasible (possible?).
<br />
The difficulties are not 'technical', they are ontological. Not fitting into
<br />
circumstances we 'even suppose' .
<br />
<br /><br /><br />3. &quot;you&quot; - and who should that be? can we separate our living
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; brain (I mean with all its functionality) from 'YOU', the self, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; person, or call it the simulacron of yourself? What's left? Is there &quot;me&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and &quot;my brain&quot;? As I like to call it: the brain is the 'tool' of my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; mind, mind is pretty unidentified,  but - is close to my-self, some call it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; life, some consciousness, - those items we like to argue about because none
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of us knows what we are talking about (some DO THINK they know, but only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; something and for themselves).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I find it hard to define consciousness, but I know what it is, and so does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everyone who has it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />And everyone (not really) knows it personalized and differently. Scholars:
<br />
slanted to their theoretical needs, others maybe to their emotions.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;4. &quot;feel&quot; ----????---- who/what? the transistors?
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (Let me repeat: I am not talking about Transistor Stathis).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You could equally well ask, do the proteins/ phospholipids/ nucleic acids
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; etc. feel? Apparently, they do. If your brain stops working or is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seriously damaged, you stop feeling.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />I am not speaking about how 'parts' feel, rather how the complexity acts.
<br />
The brain is a tool cooperating in our mental factor, so if the tool is
<br />
damaged certain activities of it may be missing, or perform inadequately.
<br />
<br />*-SP:
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Bruno goes on to show that this entails there is no separate physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; reality by means of the UDA, but we can still talk about computationalism -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the predominant theory in cognitive science - without discussing the UDA.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; And in any case, the ideas Brent and I have been discussing are still
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; relevant if computationalism is wrong and (again a separate matter) there is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; only one universe.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Stathis Papaioannou-*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &lt;JM&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Yes, &quot;we today&quot; KNOW about only 1 universe. But we believe in a physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; reality what we 'feel', 'live it' and hold as our 'truth' as well. Even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; those 'more advanced' minds saying they don't believe in it, cry out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (OMIGOD!) when &quot;Dr. Johnson's stone&quot; hurts their toe in the shoe.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I like to draw comparisons between &quot;what we know today&quot; and what we knew
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 1000, 3000, or 5000 years ago and ask: what will we 'know' just 500 years
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ahead in the future by a continuing epistemic enrichment? (If humanity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; survives that long).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Please, readers, just list the answers alphabetically.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't know the answer. Maybe next year there will be some discovery
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which will have us all laughing at the idea that computers can be conscious,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but at present we can only go on the information available to us, and try to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; keep an open mind.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />Stathis, I may cross my fingers, but would not hold my breath. IMO we 'know'
<br />
a little part, the unknown may be the essential and overwhelming. Good luck
<br />
to humanity to become smarter before extinct.
