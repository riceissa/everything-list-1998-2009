<br />Actually such universes are not too difficult to imagine. For example
<br />
you could end up in a universe where you have a secret admirer in the
<br />
lottery office, ie, the person who is programming the computer to
<br />
generate the winning numbers and who has been arranging the outcome of
<br />
the lottery to be in you favor. This person is a jilted lover who has
<br />
never lost her love for you, and has decided that if she disturb your
<br />
life enough by showering you with riches you might get a divorce from
<br />
your wife and get back together with her. As it turns out she has a
<br />
child who, unknown to you, was born after the torridly passionate affair
<br />
you had with her while you were in college. The child is sick and the
<br />
only cure is a transplant which can be provided only by a close
<br />
relative. Her blood type made that transplant impossible but since your
<br />
are type &quot;O&quot; you are the only person in the whole world who could save
<br />
that child. So brace yourself Saibal, you are about to lose a kidney for
<br />
the benefit of this newly found relative of yours. Oops but wait, there
<br />
is an element of doubt as to whether you are the real father... Should
<br />
you sacrifice yourself for the child of maybe another? Well, you are
<br />
still in love with your previous girlfriend. So what should you do?
<br />
<br /><br />By the way, this universe does not feel as if it has a low measure... It
<br />
is just as arbitrary as the universe we live in now.
<br />
<br />George
