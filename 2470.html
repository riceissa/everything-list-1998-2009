<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Jesse, nobody on this list is unaware of Carter's paper, to which I and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;others have referred in several of our papers. The point is, life is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;high-level concept, not relevant to the more fundamental debate I thought 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;were having. What was the point of Anthropic Reasoning 101?
</em><br />
<br />&quot;Life&quot; is a high-level concept, but the property of being an &quot;observer&quot; may 
<br />
not be, and that's basically what this debate is about.  And I don't think 
<br />
that what I was saying was trivial--I've seen plenty of discussions about 
<br />
the anthropic principle get bogged down by the fact that different people 
<br />
are using subtly different definitions without realizing it, so I wanted to 
<br />
define things clearly at the outset.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; So my question for you is, when you say &quot;the anthropic principle is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; universally mis-applied,&quot; are you saying that you think only Carter's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; original version of anthropic reasoning is valid, while the copernican
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; anthropic principle is not?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;As I thought was obvious form my posts, both assume that there is more than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;just this current thought. Both apply to 'life' in 'space' etc. Both assume
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a physical universe which is the substrate for a system which generates
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;thoughts.
</em><br />
<br />They can be interpreted this way, but they don't have to be.  The copernican 
<br />
anthropic principle can be described entirely in terms of the probability of 
<br />
being one observer-moment vs. another one, which is all I'm really 
<br />
assuming--I tend not to believe in the dualistic &quot;observer-moments vs. 
<br />
physical substrate&quot; view either.
<br />
<br />I think this is bollocks. A 'physical' universe is a massive
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;assumption, which I say again: I do not share. I assert that only your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;current thought exists, as far as you know. An your current thought 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;includes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a contemplation of the anthropic principle.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, but I'm assuming you're not really a solipsist, right?  Even though you 
<br />
can never &quot;prove&quot; the existence of anything other than
<br />
your current thought, I had assumed from other comments you made that you at 
<br />
least believed in the existence of a large set of observer-moments, perhaps 
<br />
with some kind of measure assigned to the set.  Am I wrong?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; principle but think the &quot;reference class&quot; can only consist of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; observer-moments that are using anthropic reasoning?  Or something else?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Yes, the reference is OMs which include thoughts about the anthropic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;principle.
</em><br />
<br />Why do you think the reference class should include only thoughts about the 
<br />
anthropic principle?  Why not all observer-moments?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;You ask: &quot;Is it just amazing luck that I find myself to be one of these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;extremely rare complex observer-moments?&quot; - surely you don't mean this.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;That
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;is equivaent to the traditional question &quot;Is it amazing luck that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;universe supports my life&quot;, to which the traditional mis-application of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;anthropic principle is the ripost.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This ripost only works if you assume multiple universes/regions, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;although
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; suppose you might say it doesn't work even then.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Yes, I do say that it doesn't work even then. It assumes that 'life'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;requires a suitable physical substrate. I believe that this is almost
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;certainly false.
</em><br />
<br />When you have an experience of interacting with another human, do you 
<br />
believe you are in some sense interacting with an observer-moment separate 
<br />
from your own?  How about an animal, or a computer program?  My own view is 
<br />
that we can indeed describe reality entirely in terms of observer-moments, 
<br />
but that what we call &quot;physical&quot; patterns may just be other observer-moments 
<br />
viewed &quot;from the outside&quot; in some sense.  This is equivalent to the 
<br />
pansychist view endorsed by Chalmers, which says that even a simple physical 
<br />
system like a thermostat has some consciousness associated with it...note 
<br />
that in this view it doesn't make much difference whether the &quot;physical 
<br />
system&quot; has its own independent existence, or whether a &quot;physical system&quot; is 
<br />
just what an observer-moment looks like when viewed from the outside by 
<br />
another observer-moment.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Clearly, OMs containing thoughts about the anthropic principle can exist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;That much we can say. We have no firm evidence to suggest that any other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;constructs exist (although, of course, my current OM does include 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;'memories'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of other thoughts).
</em><br />
<br />OK, but do you believe in the existence of non-James-Higgo OMs?  You can't 
<br />
be sure they exist either.  I think a TOE only has to be &quot;plausible&quot;, not 
<br />
&quot;provable&quot;...otherwise you can't go beyond solipsism.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You misunderstood my point.  I was saying that if my &quot;reference class&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; includes all &quot;self-referential thoughts&quot;, and if my definition of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; self-referential thoughts is such that simple ones greatly outnumber
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;complex
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ones, then I can *not* use anthropic reasoning (of either sort) to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;explain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; why I find myself to be a rare complex one rather than a simple one...so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; fact that I am a complex one would be very, very lucky in this case.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; then becomes a reason to say the original choice of reference class may
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; been incorrect.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;See above. It is pure speculation that 'simpler' thoughts can exist. I'm 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sure how you define thought complexity. It is perfectly likely that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;thought you are having now is the simplest thought in existence - even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;though it includes speculation about what possible, 'simpler', thoughts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;_might_ exist.
</em><br />
<br />As I said, anything's possible, including the fact that my current 
<br />
observer-moment is the only thing in existence.  But we won't get very far 
<br />
designing a TOE if we aren't willing to make a few unprovable assumptions.  
<br />
The reason I believe in &quot;simple&quot; observer-moments is that I expect a good 
<br />
TOE to define OMs mathematically, in terms of computations or something 
<br />
similar.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; And this is still true if you replace &quot;self-referential thought&quot; with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;thought about the anthropic principle&quot; or something similar.  I can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;write
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; simple program that prints out &quot;I am thinking about the anthropic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; principle&quot;, and the number of physical systems that implement this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;program
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is probably still much greater than the number of systems that implement
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; complex processes going on in my brain (unless you take Hans Moravec's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;view,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in which any system can be seen as implementing any 'thought' under the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; right mapping).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;You don't even know that 'you' have a 'computer' - something that itself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;requires a 'physical world'. You are making dozens of unjustifiable leaps
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;here.
</em><br />
<br />What is your definition of &quot;unjustifiable?&quot;  Is any belief other than 
<br />
solipsism unjustifiable?  Anyway, as I said, you don't need to believe in a 
<br />
physical world to believe that OMs correspond to computations, or some other 
<br />
mathematical structure (depending on what form your TOE takes).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But in that case, why do you think that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; observer-moments of the laws of physics operating normally should be any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; more common than observer-moments seeing crazy violations of physical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;law?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Can you not understand that I don't believe in physics?
</em><br />
<br />My question was about observer-moments which see the *appearance* of an 
<br />
orderly physical world vs. observer-moments which see crazy disorder.  
<br />
Again, it's really just a question of whether you believe in some global 
<br />
measure on the set of all OMs, so that OMs which experience business as 
<br />
usual are somehow more probable.
<br />
<br />There is no proof of
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a physical world. There is no proof of a physical world. There is no proof
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of a physical world. There is no proof of a physical world. There is no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;proof of a physical world. There is no proof of a physical world.  There 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;no laws. There is just this OM, that is all 'I' know. All 'I' know is this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;current thought.
</em><br />
<br />I may not have been making myself clear, but as I've been saying, none of my 
<br />
arguments ultimately depend on the assumption of a &quot;physical world.&quot;  And 
<br />
again, I thought we were discussing TOE's, not some ultimate philosophical 
<br />
idea of what we can &quot;know&quot;...if God asked you to bet on the existence or 
<br />
nonexistence of other OMs besides your current one, what would you say?
