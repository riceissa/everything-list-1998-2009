<em class="quotelev1">&gt;all times is equal to 1.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Not at all. The reason we use the term measure is that it may not be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;normalisable. Probability and measure are only equivalent when the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;measure can be normalised to 1. For example, the uniform measure is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;only normalisable on compact sets, a property that seems particularly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;unlikely of the Plenitude.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's your point?  And what does that have to do with what I said?
<br />
Of course, effective probability is not the same as measure.  It's measure 
<br />
divided by the total measure.  Each has its use.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now as to the Schroedinger equation, the question was why is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;evolution operator i times a Hermitian operator? Implicit in this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;question is that we're talking about the Multiverse (with time), and that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the Multiverse is described at each point of time by a vector \psi(t) drawn 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;from a Hilbert space. At each point in time, all possible observable 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;outcomes are described by \psi(t), so as I remarked, the probability 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;measure of that state must be equal to 1 at all times.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are talking past each other.  You are not responding to what I said, 
<br />
just repeating what you said already.  What I said was that even if one 
<br />
accepts the assertion that measure per unit time is given by |psi|^2, that 
<br />
doesn't mean it has to be conserved.  Of course, one can always calculate 
<br />
the conditional effective probability for an observer-moment to be at time t 
<br />
given that it's at time t, which is 1 by definition regardless of whether 
<br />
|psi|^2 is conserved.  Of course, the probability interpretation for 
<br />
|&lt;a|psi&gt;|^2 would have to be modified if it's not conserved; the measure 
<br />
interpretation might not have to be.  As I said
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     Even if it were established that the measure per unit time of an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;observer&quot; was equal to the squared amplitude of that &quot;observer&quot;'s
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; wavefunction (and this has yet to be satifactorily derived from theory), 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that might (in general) not have been conserved.  It may well be, too, that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the formula for measure would have to be modified if the sum of square 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;amplitudes was not conserved - which might even allow conservation of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;measure-per-unit-time without requiring conservation of squared amplitudes.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     James, you are abusing the AP.  SE is not like JM.  It would be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; worthwhile to try to derive SE [from AUH] because the effective 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probability of observer-moments that see it is likely to be large; we might 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be able to get a prediction.  In the case of JM, one name is just about as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;likely as another (of similar length), so most observer-moments probably 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;don't think they have the name JM.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Agreed.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interesting that you agreed with that.  It implies that you believe that 
<br />
one can consider effective probabilities of being different observers even 
<br />
in the AUH.  Implicitly, you accepted absolute measure.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     Humans, as I said, was just an example.  Stop confusing arbritrary

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;fast distinction between conscious and unconscious computations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;As I have said many times, it is not obvious that the reference class
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of all &quot;anthropically aware&quot; observer moments is well defined. I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;rather suspect it isn't.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just said it doesn't need to be well defined, because it's not a 
<br />
fundamental distinction, but instead is a basic practical distinction (for 
<br />
Bayesian reasoning).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     Your critique?  I must have missed that.  All you did was make some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;false statements about the ASSA which I corrected.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The critique was that you have the wrong reference class for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;addressing questions about age, at least as far as application of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;SSSA is concerned. What false statements? So far you have said
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;anything about false statements, other than the fact I restricted the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;application of the ASSA over individuals, rather than classes of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;individuals for comparison purposes. Hardly an important distinction.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OK, you said I have the wrong reference class.  The part I &quot;missed&quot; was 
<br />
you saying why it's supposed to be wrong.  I would say your mangling of the 
<br />
ASSA was important to whatever extent that the understanding about the main 
<br />
features of the world of you, or of anyone who might listen to you, is 
<br />
important.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     &quot;Individual&quot; - my problem with this is that first, I have yet to see 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a definition.  Your &quot;tree&quot; metaphor does little to help as you failed to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;define the nature and characteristics of the connections between 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observer-moments that you imply.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;As I said, there is a temporal partial ordering. This implies that for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;each point, there is a well defined set of points lying in the future
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of that point. If the set is discrete, then this defines a tree
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;structure. The continuous case is the obvious generalisation
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You seem to be missing the point.  OK - there's a partial oredering.  
<br />
That does place some restrictions if we assume timelike loops are forbidden. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;But it does nothing to establish which points are connected, which not, 
<br />
and why.  Your future observer-moments are presumably in your future but not 
<br />
in my future.  What's that distinction?  I don't see that from your partial 
<br />
ordering.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Second, I see no reason to assign any fundamental role to such a concept.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;[of individuals]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Because information processing requires time which imposes the partial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ordering. If you see no reason for this, then please explain how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;information processing can take place in the absence of time.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see no relevance of your above statement to my above statement.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;With RSSA,the reference class is the set of all future moments 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;adjacent to a given observer moment. All of this assumes that a temporal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;partial ordering in fact exists between observer moments.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     What does &quot;adjacent&quot; mean in this context?  Why should one take such 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a reference class???  By &quot;moment&quot;, do you mean a moment in time, or an OM?  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If the latter, how do you count identical twins (which may have a common 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;origin, e.g. copying)?  How does your definition relate to previous 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;definitions of the RSSA which are different?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The word adjacent is obvious when used in the discrete context. Are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you concerned about its meaning in the continuum case?
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.  What does it mean in the discrete context?  Give an example in 
<br />
which there is more than one &quot;individual&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;By moment, I do mean an observer-moment.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then say so from now on.  Or use 'thought'.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;With the ASSA, the measure attached to a particular observer moment 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is related to the complexity of that observer moment, ie how much history 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is contained within it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     Not necessarily related to complexity, but with the AUH there is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a relation.  Definitely not related to the amount of history; that's just 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;depth, not complexity.  Grab a Li &amp; Vitanyi if you don't know what I mean.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;I know exactly what you mean. However, at each &quot;branching&quot; event of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;the MWI, information/complexity is added to the history because of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;stochastic outcomes. Only if the outcomes are fully deterministic is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;complexity not increased, but depth is.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     So?  That doesn't justify your &quot;ie&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Of course it does.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not.  And even if there is branching, the complexity of the OM will not 
<br />
necessarily increase, as the observer is usually unaware of it.
<br />
<br />re: age expectation
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;There is still the problem that the ASSA reference class includes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observer moments with differing ages, which is surely a relevant 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;difference.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This you must explain.  Of course, to find one's expected age, one must 
<br />
consider the effective probability as a function of age.  That's the whole 
<br />
point of such an exercise, and the ASSA is clearly the way to do that.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;However, I doubt that an absolute measure exists over the whole
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;Plenitude.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     Going back to the evolution thread, in that case with the AUH you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;couldn't predict evolution is more likely for you to have as your origin.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Yes it is. This is precisely the point of the Occam paper.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, the Occam paper.  I shall address that soon enough.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     &quot;The AP observer&quot;?   I asked for the defintion of an observer.  Most

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;importantly, how could one distinguish one observer from another,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; observer-moments belonging to one observer from those belonging to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;another. This you did not address at all.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Since observer moments are linked by a temporal partial ordering,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;all future observer moments of some observer moment (such as the birth
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;event) belong to an individual. Of course taking birth as the root
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;event is somewhat arbitrary - in that case the indvidual in question
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;may have more than one name. Alternatively, you could take it to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the even when a name is irrevocably chosen (eg when registered). In
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the latter case, the individual has a unique name (up to changes by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;deed poll), but multiple individuals have the same name. Or you can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;chose any other observer moment that is convenient for your analysis.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to this again.  You can see why I combined the threads.  OK, so how 
<br />
are &quot;future observer moments of some observer moment&quot; defined?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The issue of cloning, Bruno Marchal style requires recognising
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;multiple individuals after the clone event. Its a relatively mild
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;change to the definition as discussed, and is only needed for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;hypothetical situations.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would think QM splitting would be much the same as cloning in this 
<br />
regard.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course I distinguish them, because splitting conserves measure, but 
<br />
for you?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;The way the statements M(x) and M(x') that you gave are phrased, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;they refer to the same &quot;generic&quot; observer, wondering why it sees an ordered 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;world.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     If there is such a &quot;generic&quot; observer, then is he the only 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observer ever to be in existance?  If so, then maybe I could understand 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;what you mean.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;Not the only observer, but the only class of observers. The &quot;generic&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observer can only have properties that all observers must share.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     So the &quot;generic&quot; observer is really not an observer at all, but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;instead ...?  Not a set of observers, from what it sounds like.  Perhaps 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you mean that any observer would have the same measure distribution as any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;other?  Absolute measures?
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm still waiting for this one.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;There may well be a special UTM, or distribution of UTMs, in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;which case what you say applies. However, it is simply not necessary 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;for the Universal Prior argument to work.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     Sure it is.  No special distribution, no universal prior.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Obviously, you haven't read my Occam paper.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, when one of us says 'obviously', the other is sure to say the 
<br />
opposite is obvious.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course I've read it.  Since you refer to it so often, I guess I'll 
<br />
have to shred it.  This I will do in my next post.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Of course as I said, a special distribution of UTMs must implement all 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;conscious computations, but that's quite different.  You may think you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;don't need it, but then you are wrong as usual.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Your statement sounds like a double convolution, leading back to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;original distribution. If p(U) is your distribution of UTMs, each of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;which implements a range of conscious computations M(c|U), each of whom
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in turn implement a range of UTMs p'(U|c), then \int_{c,U'}
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;p'(U|c)M(c|U')p(U')dcdU' must surely be equal to p(U) for self consistency.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many time do I have to say it?  Conscious computations do NOT 
<br />
(generally) implement UTMs.  Humans do NOT implement UTMs.  A UTM could 
<br />
implement a conscious computation, but so could other things.  The ensemble 
<br />
of UTMs is often used as a model for the AUH, and for that model a special 
<br />
distribution of UTMs is needed.
