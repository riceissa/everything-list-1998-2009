<br />The reason for the 20 foot radius was to get Mercutio correlated with 
<br />
Romeo and Juliet, to show that an &quot;objective&quot; framework can exist 
<br />
between two people ie, between Mercutio and Romeo, and to isolate 
<br />
Bathasar from this framework.In other words, I wanted Romeo and Mercutio 
<br />
to appear to be in a &quot;normal&quot; world and Balthasar to be in the abnormal 
<br />
world.
<br />
<br />Your question revolves around whether QS is &quot;Good&quot; or &quot;Evil.&quot; If we 
<br />
assume that Good is synonymous with increasing measure and Evil with 
<br />
decreasing measure, then we must look at the measure of the characters 
<br />
and of the earth's inabitants as the story unfolds. More specifically, 
<br />
we must look at measure as it is &quot;measured&quot; (if this can ever be done) 
<br />
by each participant, since each one may come up with a different 
<br />
measurement.
<br />
<br />There are two periods of interest:
<br />
1) Before the QS event
<br />
2) After the QS event
<br />
<br />1) Before the QS event, no crime has been committed. Any prosecutor 
<br />
would have to prove that the QS event would decrease measure. Without 
<br />
evidence he has no proof.
<br />
<br />2) After the QS event. Here, we face a difficulty because, with your 
<br />
given assumption, that the whole earth is correlated to the QS event, we 
<br />
lose the availability of an outside observer. To keep an observer, let's 
<br />
say that an astronaut is in orbit around the earth and is left 
<br />
unaffected by the QS event.
<br />
<br />We have now two points of views:
<br />
a) the point of view of the astronaut
<br />
b) the point of view of the criminal prosecutor who must decide whether 
<br />
to open criminal proceedings against Romeo and Juliet. 
<br />
<br /><br />a) The point of view of the astronaut.
<br />
He sees the destruction of the earth, of his family and country. From 
<br />
his point of view there was a loss. But the criminals are dead. Had the 
<br />
radius of operation of the QS machine been larger, or even encompassed 
<br />
the whole universe, there would not have been any witness to mourn the 
<br />
loss, and the only point of view left is the next one. So let's say 
<br />
that, not just the earth, but the whole universe has been destroyed 
<br />
which brings us to the only point of view left.
<br />
<br />b) The point of view of Romeo, Juliet and the criminal prosecutor
<br />
The criminal prosecutor shares his frame of reference everybody else on 
<br />
earth. From his point of view nothing has happened, no crime has been 
<br />
committed. Let's say that the prosecutor performs a forensic analysis 
<br />
and attempts to measure measure. He gets his hands on a Measurator.
<br />
<br />Let me explain what a measurator is. It's a machine that measures the 
<br />
entropy of any system that it is hooked up to. If the system is closed, 
<br />
the machine gives a continuously increasing reading. If the system is 
<br />
open, the reading of the Measurator can go up or down depending on the 
<br />
inputs and outputs.
<br />
<br />The prosecutor finds that at the time of the QS event, there was a sharp 
<br />
down spike in the entropy curve, of the earth system against the general 
<br />
noise background partially due to inputs and outputs.  This sharp spike 
<br />
is of course related to the end of the feud between the Montague and 
<br />
Capulet families. And this is the information that he presents to the 
<br />
judge, explaining that there was a drop in measure due to the drop in 
<br />
entropy.
<br />
<br />The defense however, replies that the end of the feud BEARS NO CAUSAL 
<br />
RELATIONSHIP with the NON-OPERATION of the QS machine and that Romeo and 
<br />
Juliet DID nothing wrong.
<br />
<br />The defense then tackle the issue of the entropy spike. It argues that 
<br />
this sudden lowering of the entropy curve may just be a coincidence and 
<br />
that, in any case, it is infinitesimal compared with the influence of 
<br />
our common quantum physical laws which are much more significantly 
<br />
responsible for holding entropy down.
<br />
<br />Without our quantum laws, for example, if we lived in a mechanistic 
<br />
universe, electrons, unfettered by their quantum levels would fall into 
<br />
their nucleii resulting in the almost immediate annihilation of all 
<br />
matter in the universe and a huge increase in entropy. Even though 
<br />
entropy of the universe is continuoulsy increasing, the universe is 
<br />
still in an incredible state of low entropy. In any case, the defense 
<br />
argues, if a low entropy spike is an indicator of criminal activity, 
<br />
then even God, himself, is not be immune from prosecution, since entropy 
<br />
was at its lowest at creation.
<br />
<br />The defense concludes that nature itself is a huge QS machine that 
<br />
filters only those worlds capable of sustaining consciousness. In 
<br />
comparison with the effects of quantum laws, the effect of the spike is 
<br />
infinitesimal and is equivalent to going back less than a picosecond in 
<br />
entropic time. What Romeo and Juliet did, if they did anything, is only 
<br />
a drop in the bucket compared with (infinitely) large natural influences 
<br />
the spike is close to or equal to zero. They should not be found guilty.
