<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why not instead adopt the scientific model?  That is, that

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we are three-dimensional creatures ensconced in a world 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; governed by the laws of physics, or, what I'll call the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;atoms and processes&quot; model. About observer-moments, I would

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; say what LaPlace answered to Napoleon about a deity:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;I have no need of that hypothesis&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />Observer moments are more than a hypothesis, they are our raw experiences
<br />
of the world.  It is more the world that is the hypothesis to explain
<br />
the observer moments, than vice versa.  &quot;I think, therefore I am... an
<br />
observer moment,&quot; as Descartes meant to say.
<br />
<br />However, given the strong evidence we have for the world's existence and
<br />
the explanatory power it gives for our experience, I don't think there
<br />
is a problem with treating it as fundamental.  This leads to a model of
<br />
world -&gt; observers -&gt; observer-moments.  A world maintains and holds
<br />
one or more observers, which can themselves be thought of as composed
<br />
of multiple observer moments.
<br />
<br />A key point is that the mapping is not just one-to-many.  It is
<br />
many-to-many.  That is, an observer moment is shared among multiple
<br />
observers; and an observer exists in multiple worlds.
<br />
<br />To explain the first point, observers merge whenever information is
<br />
forgotten.  And they diverge whenever information is learned.  This means
<br />
that each observer-moment is a nexus of intersection of many observers.
<br />
The observer moment has multiple pasts and multiple futures.
<br />
<br />To explain the second point, observers exist in any world which is
<br />
consistent with their observations.  The amount of information in
<br />
an observer is much less than the amount of information in a world
<br />
(at least, for observers and worlds like our own).  So there are many
<br />
worlds which are consistent with the information in an observer, and
<br />
the observer can be thought of as occupying all of those worlds.
<br />
<br />In this sense, the mapping above might be better expressed as world &lt;-&gt;
<br />
observers &lt;-&gt; observer-moments.  It is many-to-many in both directions.
<br />
<br />I see both views - worlds as primary, or observers and observer-moments as
<br />
primary - as playing an important role in understanding our relationship
<br />
to the multiverse.  In terms of choosing actions or making predictions,
<br />
we need methods for making quantitative estimates of what is likely
<br />
to happen.  This requires us to take into consideration the set of
<br />
worlds which our observer-moments span, and the set of possible future
<br />
observer-moments which we care about.
<br />
<br />To calculate, we need a measure over observer-moments.  Then we can have a
<br />
greater expectation of experiencing observer moments with higher measures.
<br />
So how do we do this calculation?
<br />
<br />I start by calculating the measure of universes.  Using an arbitrary,
<br />
simple, universal computer, I would calculate the minimum program size
<br />
for creating a given universe.  (Yes, I know this is non-computable, but
<br />
we can approximate it and use that for our estimates.)  The program size
<br />
gives the measure of that universe, and then that measure should lead
<br />
us to a measure for the observers and observer-moments in that universe.
<br />
<br />This step of going from universe-measure to observer-measure seems a bit
<br />
problematic to me and I don't have a completely satisfactory solution,
<br />
but I won't go into the details of the problems right now.
<br />
<br />Anyway, once you have the measure for an observer moment in a given
<br />
universe, you can sum the measures over all universes that generate that
<br />
particular observer moment, to get the measure of the observer moment.
<br />
<br />Then, with a measure over observer-moments, you can take your current
<br />
observer moment, look at ones that you identify with in the future, and
<br />
consider the measure of those observer moments in helping you to choose
<br />
what actions to take.  This is how one should behave in a multiverse.
<br />
<br />This approach seems to require acknowledgement of the fundamental
<br />
importance both of worlds and observer-moments.  We use worlds to
<br />
calculate measure; we use observer-moments to constrain the set of worlds
<br />
that we occupy, now and in the future.  A world-only approach would seem
<br />
to pin us to a single world and not recognize that we span all worlds
<br />
which contain identical observer-moments; an observer-only approach does
<br />
not seem to give us grounds to estimate measure a priori (although I
<br />
think Bruno may have a method which is supposed to do that).  We have
<br />
to use both concepts to get a complete picture of what is going on.
