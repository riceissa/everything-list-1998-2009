I think it's pretty obvious that you can't predict someone's decisions if 
<br />
you show him the prediction before he makes his final choice. So let's 
<br />
consider a different flavor of prediction. Suppose every time you make a 
<br />
choice, I can predict the decision, write it down before you do it, and 
<br />
then show it to you afterwards. Neither the infinite recursion argument 
<br />
nor the no fixed point argument work against this type of prediction. If 
<br />
this is actually possible, what would that imply for free will? 
<br />
<br />If you are an AI, this would be fairly easy to do. I'll just make a copy 
<br />
of you, run your copy until it makes a decision, then use that as the 
<br />
&quot;prediction&quot;. But in this case I am not able to predict the decision of 
<br />
the copy, unless I made another copy and ran that copy first.
<br />
<br />The point is that algorithms have minimal run-time complexities. There are 
<br />
many algorithms which have no faster equivalents. The only way to find out 
<br />
their results is to actually run them. If you came up with an algorithm 
<br />
that can predict someone's decisions with complete accuracy, it would 
<br />
probably have to duplicate that person's thought processes exactly, 
<br />
perhaps not on a microscopic level, but probably on a level that still 
<br />
results in the same conscious experiences. So now there is nothing to rule 
<br />
out that the prediction algorithm itself has free will. Given that the 
<br />
subject of the prediction and the prediction algorithm can't distinguish 
<br />
between themselves from their subjective experiences, they can both 
<br />
identify with the prediction algorithm and consider themselves to have 
<br />
free will. So you can have free will even if someone is able to predict 
<br />
your actions.
<br />
<br />The more obvious fact that you can't predict your own actions really has
<br />
less to do with free will, and more with the importance of the lack of
<br />
logical omniscience in decision theory. Classical decision theory
<br />
basically contradicts itself by assuming logical omniscience. You already
<br />
know only one choice is logically possible at any given time in a
<br />
deterministic universe, and with logical omniscience you know exactly
<br />
which one is the possible one, so there are no more decisions to be made.  
<br />
But actually logical omniscience is itself logically impossible, because
<br />
of problems with infinite recursion and lack of fixed points. That's why
<br />
it's great to see a decision theory that does not assume logical
<br />
omniscience. So please read that paper (referenced in the first post in
<br />
this thread) if you haven't already.
