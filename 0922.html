Hal's and Russell's posts are interesting. The minimum information principle 
<br />
is equivalent to the well known maximum entropy principle or equivalently to 
<br />
the second law of thermodynamics. I wonder how far we can take this.
<br />
<br />I believe that these are some of the facts that we have established:
<br />
<br />- The whole MW has zero information and therefore maximum (infinite) entropy. 
<br />
- The self sampling process raises the information level and  lowers the 
<br />
entropy of the observable worlds. 
<br />
- Small worlds are more numerous but cannot support consciousness. 
<br />
- Large worlds can support consciousness but are exponentially less numerous. 
<br />
<br />I believe that the anthropic principle can tie all these facts very well in 
<br />
defining the size of universes which can support consciousness.

&nbsp;I was thinking some more on the physical laws issue, and on Wei Dai's

&nbsp;point on what measure to apply to different universes. The solution
<br />
&nbsp;given is to weight shorter strings over longer ones.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;One way of thinking about this is to state that there are _no_ finite
<br />
&nbsp;strings at all in the everything world. Instead, the first n bits of a
<br />
&nbsp;string contain information, and the remainder are &quot;don't care&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;values. We also assume a uniform measure on all these infinite
<br />
&nbsp;strings. In this picture, worlds who are entirely specified by strings
<br />
&nbsp;with a smaller value of n will have higher measure than those with
<br />
&nbsp;larger n. The measure will fall off exponentially with n, in fact
<br />
&nbsp;precisely 2^{-n}, assuming the uniform measure above. This, then is
<br />
&nbsp;the universal measure sought by Wei Dai. Clearly, the everything
<br />
&nbsp;universe consists of all strings where we don't care what any bit
<br />
&nbsp;is. These have zero information, and measure = 1.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;So, by the SSA (strong, weak, relative - doesn't matter in this case),
<br />
&nbsp;we should expect a Universe with low Kolmogorov complexity, but high
<br />
&nbsp;logical depth, which in essence says we should expect simple physical
<br />
&nbsp;laws, and a relatively long evolution producing concious entities. We
<br />
&nbsp;could call this the &quot;minimum information principle&quot;.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;In the Tegmark picture, he discusses mathematical structures, which
<br />
&nbsp;clearly should be preferred by the minimum information principle over
<br />
&nbsp;unstructured worlds. We should also expect to observe the most general
<br />
&nbsp;mathematical structure capable of supporting consciousness, as greater
<br />
&nbsp;generality =&gt; fewer axioms =&gt; less information. I have given arguments
<br />
&nbsp;in earlier posts why complex valued vector space with unitary
<br />
&nbsp;evolution operators (ie quantum mechanics as we know it) should be the
<br />
&nbsp;most general such mathematical structure, although at the time I didn't
<br />
&nbsp;know why the most general such structure would be preferred.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;I disagree (for the moment at least) that the everything universes
<br />
&nbsp;should be restricted to programs on a universal turing machine. I
<br />
&nbsp;believe that it is information that is at the heart of the matter, and
<br />
&nbsp;that one can have information without computation (I'm happy to be
<br />
&nbsp;proven wrong if that is the case). However, the Schmidhueber picture
<br />
&nbsp;is at very minimum a useful metaphor, even if it turns out not to be
<br />
&nbsp;the whole story. &gt;&gt;
