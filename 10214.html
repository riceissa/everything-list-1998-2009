</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; themselves ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To be sure I have some problem to interpret this.
</em><br />
<br />I'll try to nail this here.  I take 'ontology' to refer to issues of
<br />
existence or being, where 'epistemology' refers to knowledge, or 'what
<br />
and how we know'.  When I say that our 'ontology' is manifest, I'm
<br />
claiming (perhaps a little more cautiously than Descartes): 'I am
<br />
that which experiences here'. I take these to be an ontological
<br />
continuum or set of equivalences, not properties: I -&gt;experience -&gt;
<br />
here.  For reasons of economy, I see no need to postulate any other
<br />
ontological status.  The challenge now is to see if the appearances can
<br />
be preserved from this point of departure, proceeding to
<br />
epistemological issues of what and how 'I know', which I discuss below.
<br />
<br />Firstly, though I must find a way to move beyond  the 'individual I'
<br />
established by this basic move, which is in a  sense illusory, unless
<br />
we are prepared to settle for solipsism.  If we wish to believe in the
<br />
reality of something larger than what we can see from our perspective,
<br />
our position must be localised and delimited from within a larger
<br />
context (what I've termed the 'global first person' or FP1g) by the
<br />
structure and availability of information. Some form of primary
<br />
differentiation of the basic ontology seems necessary, of which more to
<br />
follow.
<br />
<br />Insofar as some primary differentiation process in my schema ultimately
<br />
powers the emergence of the many persons and their many worlds, this is
<br />
very consistent IMO with MWI, where the superposition of the totality
<br />
of information is discriminated into multiple  perspectives by
<br />
limitations of access from any locale.  It has always  seemed to me
<br />
that there can be no 'preferred basis' for the assembly of  'personal
<br />
histories' other than the 'localising effect' of structured
<br />
information. BTW, is it the function of the 'dovetailer' within your
<br />
comp hypothesis to establish the localisation basis used in assembling
<br />
such 'points-of-view' into 'coherent personal histories'?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; That looks like a description of emergence of 1-person from 3-persons,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unless you define &quot;context&quot; and 'differentiation&quot; exclusively from your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; primary 1-person notion.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, I do define these exclusively in this way.  This is perhaps a key
<br />
point. My sense is that the context and the differentiation are both
<br />
primitive (irreducible).  That is why I say that I'm agnostic as to the
<br />
details of the differentiation at this logical level.  I take the
<br />
'context' to be primitive - a primary 'FP1' field, for the reasons
<br />
given above.  Further, however we decide to schematise the
<br />
differentiation of this field, at root we have to accept that *somehow*
<br />
parts are separable from the whole - which so far as I can see is
<br />
semantically paradoxical (without introjection from 'outside', what
<br />
could penetrate a 'seamless' whole?) - but in a sense this is a test of
<br />
true primitivity.  Consequently, in my schema, we have a primitive
<br />
field (context) with primitive differentiation (content).  These
<br />
together constitute the global first person FP1g.
<br />
<br />My point about third person is that this is simply terminological.
<br />
Since everything is uniquely constituted in terms of some aspect of the
<br />
FP1g context+content, this also applies to the totality of our
<br />
representations of the world, what I've termed the shared knowledge
<br />
base (SKB).  Within the SKB, such representations are what we refer to
<br />
as third person - the world at arm's length as it were - but this is
<br />
merely an epithet since the ontological status of the SKB in itself
<br />
must be FP1.  The very term 'third person' is literally an FP1 'object'
<br />
within the SKB that refers to a logical category we wish to apply to
<br />
certain aspects of the SKB and its presumed referents in 'externality'.
<br />
But, notwithstanding these internal categorisations, both the SKB and
<br />
its distant referents remain alike - and uniquely - constituents of the
<br />
FP1 context+content.  Consequently we 'share' the information content
<br />
of the SKB by instantiating it and distributing 'downloads' for others
<br />
to 'run'.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; We can talk in a third person manner about first person notions. But
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some care is needed for not falling in &quot;Chalmers delusion&quot; who forces
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; him to accept some universal first person telepathy, so as to be able
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to be at two places at once from a first person point of view. With
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comp this is just impossible.
</em><br />
<br />I find 'Chalmers delusion' just that - deluded.  I've said above (and
<br />
in my 'PC' analogy) that questions of knowledge and identity can only
<br />
be resolved by a person from what is available locally at their
<br />
point-of-view (however this is 'assembled').  This means both whatever
<br />
capability they have, and whatever information is available.  IMO, to
<br />
make intelligible the notion of being in two places at once, one would
<br />
need to posit some non-local (as you say telepathic) transmission of
<br />
information on the presumed basis of these two points-of-view being the
<br />
'same' person.  To me, this is mysticism.  IMO, what constitutes
<br />
'sameness' vis-à-vis persons is the history of points-of-view (which
<br />
from the individual first person point-of-view is a function of
<br />
memory).  At the point of any 'splitting' or duplication of persons,
<br />
there is a split in histories, after which they are no longer the
<br />
'same'.  This is I suppose somewhat analogous to splitting in MWI,
<br />
which sometimes causes similar confusion.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here I prefer to simplify and to treat sentences like &quot;I experience p&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by &quot;I know p&quot;. And keeping added nuances only when it is obligatory.
</em><br />
<br />If you mean that 'I know in virtue that I experience', we could agree,
<br />
although this use of 'know' can be confusing.  As I've said above, my
<br />
primary 'ontological' evidence is that 'I experience'.  This gives me
<br />
my purchase on reality, and with this purchase - this 'grasp' - I gain
<br />
access to information, in the form of what I've termed the SKB.  Within
<br />
the SKB, I can claim 'I know p' (with the above sense), and crucially
<br />
IMO this establishes the claim that the proposition 'I know p' is
<br />
itself directly a graspable 'FP1 object'.  However, the consequence 'p
<br />
is true' does not yet follow, since this must be a function of the
<br />
correspondence of p (per Tarski) with 'facts' located elsewhere in the
<br />
SKB (and, under presumption, in the co-varying distant parts of FP1g to
<br />
which it refers).  So IMO the truth-value of p, if p is a proposition,
<br />
is demonstrated in terms of the 'third person' relations of the SKB,
<br />
standing in place of its 'external' FP1g referents.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt; This is because experience is 'incorrigible', and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; consequently is not open to falsification.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So at least we agree on the main axiom of standard &quot;knowledge theory&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is capture by a formula like &quot;Kp -&gt;  p&quot;: meaning If I know p then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; p is true. We can know only true proposition. It is conform with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; traditional use of the verb &quot;to know&quot;. Nobody says &quot;John knew that (5 +
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4)^2 = 5^2 + 4^2, until he realized his error. We say instead &quot;John
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; believed (5 + 4)^2 = 5^2 + 4^2, until he realized his error.
</em><br />
<br />OK, in that case I can't agree that 'I experience' is equivalent to 'I
<br />
know' in this sense.  John in your example 'experiences' both when he
<br />
'knows' or when he merely 'believes'.  Further, he always 'believes'
<br />
whether it can be demonstrated that he 'knows' or not.  The ascription
<br />
of knowledge is here dependent on the truth-value of the proposition in
<br />
which he believes, which may at any given point be provisional.  In any
<br />
case, my use of the term 'I experience' as the primary 'purchase' on
<br />
reality seems logically prior to 'I know', from the above example.  'I
<br />
know' in the above sense is dependent on the truth-relations within the
<br />
SKB and its referents, which 'I experience' is not.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  'Knowing' is then an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; emergent aspect of the 'third' person - experience read as information.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; A key point is that this applies equally to the 'self' as it does to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; others, since both are in the same position vis-à-vis the 'shareable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; knowledge base' (SKB) that IMO is the basis of 'consensual reality'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; My point here is that the relation of both 'self' and 'others' to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'knowledge' consists of indicating and manipulating parts of the SKB.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'Experience' is the 'means whereby' we grasp this communicable base,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and is consequently itself not communicable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm not sure what you mean. As far as I understand it, it seems to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contradict what you say above.
</em><br />
<br />It isn't IMO contradictory, since the sense of 'I know' here, as
<br />
discussed above, is 'I know in virtue of the truth-values and other
<br />
relations within the SKB'.  But my (ontologically and epistemologically
<br />
prior) *purchase* on this 'knowledge' is my FP1 *experience*, the
<br />
medium and means whereby I am able to 'grasp' what is available to be
<br />
known.  Since knowledge in this sense is mediated by the SKB, it puts
<br />
'self' and 'other' on the same footing vis-à-vis the 'third person
<br />
world' represented by the SKB.  This IMO is crucial to understanding
<br />
third person discourse and the way it refers to FP1 reality.  The
<br />
reason all our discourse is 'third person' (including our own internal
<br />
discourse) is that it is forced to take place entirely in terms of the
<br />
SKB.  This makes it all too easy to forget (as the fish ignores the
<br />
water) that the SKB itself, together with the linked 'nodes' to which
<br />
it 'refers', when 'instantiated-as-unique-existent-entities' as opposed
<br />
to when 'read-as-narrative' - are all alike elements of the global FP1
<br />
domain.  Were it not so, neither we nor they would be present to
<br />
'grasp' or be grasped.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I will describe the comp theory and it will be nice to see if it will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fit with your notion of persons.
</em><br />
<br />Bring it on!
