Bruno/ George
<br />
<br />I thought I might offer the following analogy to help to clarify the
<br />
application and relevance of the distinctions I'm trying to make
<br />
vis-a-vis the different types of 'first person'.  I wouldn't want to
<br />
push it too far, but I think it has a certain formal similarity to the
<br />
points I've been trying to establish.
<br />
<br />Suppose that I am a PC running Word and Excel at the same time.
<br />
Suppose also that in some way you were able to interrogate me (i.e. the
<br />
PC) during some cycles when I am running Word, and ask me - &quot;who are
<br />
you?&quot;.  Given that I could refer only to the data available to me 'as
<br />
Word', I could only reply: &quot;I am Word, of course!&quot;.  Alternatively, if
<br />
the interrogation occurred during those cycles when I was running
<br />
Excel, my response would have to be: &quot;I'm Excel&quot;.
<br />
<br />Now this somewhat loose analogy makes the point that we have no
<br />
recourse but to refer to whatever data is accessible to us in
<br />
attempting to answer any query whatsoever, including those relating to
<br />
identity.  However, going back to the analogy, an observer might be
<br />
tempted to inform me, in my incarnations as PC-as-Word and PC-as-Excel,
<br />
that I should really say: &quot;I am a PC running both these applications
<br />
during different cycles under WindowsXP&quot;. So, in this limited domain,
<br />
'my' run-time instantiations of 'Word' and 'Excel' play the role of
<br />
FP1i, and the run-time PC-under-WindowsXP, that of FP1g.  The analogs
<br />
of these 'actors' - their descriptions in my narrative - would be
<br />
examples of 'FP2' : i.e. a *representation* of a first person, *not*
<br />
the unique 'runtime' FP1i.
<br />
<br />Now of course we can say: &quot;But the PC itself is more fundamentally an
<br />
electronics hardware platform with a certain architecture&quot;.  Fine, then
<br />
the claim should be &quot;In that case 'I' am that platform with that
<br />
architecture&quot;.  But suppose we believe that the 'hardware' is an
<br />
emulation within comp?  Well, &quot;In that case 'I' am a comp emulation&quot;.
<br />
It's 'I' all the way down, as far as you care to go.  Whatever you
<br />
believe the 'fundamental level' to be, or even if you think there is no
<br />
such thing, that's what is substantively making the claim to be 'I', in
<br />
the global sense of 'FP1g'.  And, since individual first persons are
<br />
somewhat in the position of 'Word' and 'Excel', or for that matter 'the
<br />
PC' in the analogy, each 'FP1i' is making the same claim: &quot;I am the
<br />
context of a local capability and knowledge base that gives me access
<br />
to such-and-such information&quot;.
<br />
<br />Comp/ QM/ MW etc. exist mutually as something of the nature of a
<br />
'superposition' - i.e. whatever exists does so in a unified manner that
<br />
we can only 'a posteriori' attempt to organise into schemas or
<br />
'levels'.  Consequently I feel justified in claiming that my ultimate
<br />
first personhood is founded in the whole not simply some part or level.
<br />
Further, IMO, this may be the only coherent way to understand the
<br />
arbitrariness of indexicality - that the individual 'I' is only a
<br />
delimited point-of-view arising from local structure, not an
<br />
independent ontological status.  Self-identification and the status of
<br />
'knower' are alike derived from locally-determined capabilities and
<br />
information 'in context', somewhat like that of 'Word' or Excel' in the
<br />
context of the PC in my analogy.
<br />
<br />Lastly, I suppose that my personal motivation here really stems from my
<br />
sense that the questions 'why is there anything?' and 'why am I here?'
<br />
amount to the same thing.  That is to say: the 'something' isn't 'out
<br />
there' - i.e.in the way its analog is represented in the 'knowledge
<br />
base' - but 'in here'.
<br />
<br />Does this help at all?
<br />
<br />David
