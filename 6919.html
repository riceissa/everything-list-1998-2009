<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I remembered Wei Dai posting on this topic in the early days of this

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; list, and indeed some of his postings influenced my &quot;Why Occam's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Razor&quot; paper. However, I do not recall his suggestions as being as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; detailed as what you describe here. Do you have a reference to where

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this might be written up? I'm also intrigued by the possibility of

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; demonstrating that transhumanist observer moments would have

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; substantially less measure than human observer moments. Such a result

<br />Well, I tend to be a lot more long-winded than Wei.  He did not write up
<br />
the idea formally but it was just something he proposed in the context
<br />
of one of our discussions on the list.  I don't know if he even believes
<br />
in it now.
<br />
<br />He proposed it in the context the thread on &quot;consciousness based on
<br />
information or computation?&quot; in January 1999, specifically
<br />
<a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m325.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m325.html</a> , which I will take
<br />
the liberty of quoting here:
<br />
<br />Wei Dai wrote:
<br />
<br />: Let me be more specific and precise about my proposal. I propose that the
<br />
: measure of a conscious experience is related to the measure of the
<br />
: associated state information, and take this measure to be the universal a
<br />
: priori distribution.
<br />
:
<br />
: The universal a priori probability of a string is inversely related to the
<br />
: length of the shortest program that outputs that string (the distribution
<br />
: actually takes into account all programs, but the shortest ones contribute
<br />
: most to the distribution). Now take an AI running on some computer, and
<br />
: consider its state at some given time. The shortest program (P1) that
<br />
: produces this state as output probably consists of two parts. The first
<br />
: part of the program simulates the physical universe (which let's say is a
<br />
: newtonian universe) which contains the computer running the AI. The second
<br />
: part of the program extracts the AI's state from this simulation.
<br />
:
<br />
: Now if the *memory* elements containing the AI's state were doubled in
<br />
: size, that should allow the second part of the program to be shorter,
<br />
: since it would take less information to &quot;find&quot; the AI's state in the
<br />
: wavefunction simulation. The smaller program size implies a larger measure
<br />
: of the state.
<br />
:
<br />
: If the AI were simultaneously running on two computers, there would be two
<br />
: shortest programs that produce the state as output (they would be
<br />
: identical in the simulation part but slightly different in the extraction
<br />
: part), and these two programs together would make twice as much
<br />
: contribution to the universal a priori distribution as P1, and again the
<br />
: measure of the state would be increased.
<br />
<br />This came out of a discussion in which I claimed it was obvious
<br />
that the size of an implementation should not matter, with regard to
<br />
its contribution to measure, and from this I concluded via a thought
<br />
experiment that the number of copies shouldn't matter(!), which causes
<br />
some problems.  Wei then challenged this assumption that &quot;size doesn't
<br />
matter&quot; and followed up with this detailed proposal, which I eventually
<br />
came to like very much.  The part about speed also mattering was my own
<br />
addition, but it is a pretty obvious corollary as speed is just a matter
<br />
of &quot;size in time&quot;.
