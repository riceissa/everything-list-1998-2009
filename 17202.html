2009/8/11 Rex Allen &lt;rexallen314.domain.name.hidden&gt;:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You speak as if though we have a choice as to how we behave!  This I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can't see at all.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Whether our behavior is caused subatomic particles or arithmetic, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is completely uncaused, there is no room for libertarian free will.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Whether will is free, and whether it is mine, are different issues.
<br />
Complete freedom of will involves a contradiction - randomness is not
<br />
choice, and choice always entails constraints.  Indeed it is ironical
<br />
that when we are most self-willed we often say how 'determined' we
<br />
feel.  Freedom of will consists in my not being prevented from doing
<br />
whatsoever I am capable of, and this is something that evolves.  For
<br />
example, today I am both capable of, and not prevented from, being in
<br />
New York tomorrow; 100 years ago I would not have had such capability,
<br />
and hence no freedom in this matter.
<br />
<br />However, 'free' or not, the willing can still be *ours*.  The standard
<br />
view of physics is that things are causally closed 'out there', and
<br />
this seems to rule out that such causation can in any sense be 'owned'
<br />
by us.  This is the view that I think is mistaken, precisely because
<br />
it is contradicted by our very experience.  And far from being
<br />
'illusory', this is the most cogent reason possible to doubt such a
<br />
view.  Illusions, it should be recalled, are not incorrect
<br />
perceptions; the perceptions are correct, even if the object of
<br />
perception is other than we imagine.  And here it is precisely the
<br />
ownership self-evidently present to us that requires explanation.
<br />
<br />Such an explanation entails that ownership be intrinsic to the whole
<br />
of existence, and thus that every &quot;I&quot; is a point-of-view of that
<br />
whole, not an isolated soul.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, I'm just using the block universe as a way of trying to make my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point more clear.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My point being that consciousness is fundamental and uncaused.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My secondary point being that even if consciousness is NOT
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fundamental, then it is STILL ultimately uncaused if it results from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any system that is itself uncaused...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My tertiary point being that if we have no evidence which points one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way or the other between consciousness being fundamental or not, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; default position would seem to be that it is fundamental.
</em><br />
<br />Well of course any regress must stop somewhere, and in this sense
<br />
everything is fundamentally uncaused (unless one subscribes to the
<br />
magic power of arithmetical truth to pluck up reality by its
<br />
hair-roots).  But beyond this, causation still retains a vital sense
<br />
in the inter-relation of the essential features of existence.  To be
<br />
willing to say nothing on this strikes us more or less dumb, and I
<br />
don't think this aspect is what Wittgenstein had in mind in his famous
<br />
dictum.
<br />
<br />As to whether consciousness is fundamental, there I am in sympathy,
<br />
although as you know by now I put a slightly different slant on it by
<br />
seeking to show that existence itself is in effect equivalent to what
<br />
we call consciousness.  The reason I do this is to eliminate any need
<br />
to invoke something like panpsychism as an adjunct to physicalism - in
<br />
my view this is tantamount to dualism, with all the incoherencies that
<br />
entails.  I don't believe that this is arbitrary in the least: the
<br />
notion of a species of 'existence' conceived as totally devoid of
<br />
self-access, such as that usually assumed to be implied by physics, is
<br />
self-annihilating.  IOW it is an 'existence' that nobody would ever
<br />
know about, thus falling victim to Occam's razor in the most egregious
<br />
degree.  So on this basis, we may assert two axioms:
<br />
<br />1) Existence simply IS a self-causing self-accessing continuity
<br />
2) All phenomena appear as self-relativisations of 1)
<br />
<br />From these axioms, we can build a subsidiary notion of causation which
<br />
achieves 'closure' step-by-step through the indivisibility of
<br />
self-cause and self-access.  My contention is that any causal schema
<br />
must have these features even to begin to account for our presence in
<br />
the context of what we observe.  Having questioned Bruno pretty
<br />
closely I now feel reasonably convinced that he takes COMP to fulfil
<br />
these criteria via the self-reflecting, self-relating characteristics
<br />
of the number realm.  This is not at all to say that COMP is thereby
<br />
true; only that it isn't obviously false on this basis.
<br />
<br />Standard physicalism, on the other hand, by banishing self-access from
<br />
its fundamental notions of causal adequacy (though arrogating the
<br />
right to whisk a mysteriously powerless ghost of it back later by
<br />
sleight of intuition) is clearly false (incomplete is the more politic
<br />
term).  The reason this isn't more widely understood rests of course
<br />
on the prestige of science, the authority of which has reached the
<br />
point where we're apparently willing to take seriously the absurdity
<br />
that the universe is a sterile pointless farago that could as well
<br />
play out in the absence of all experience.
<br />
<br />BTW Rex, your recent presence on the list has been welcome and
<br />
thought-provoking.  It would be interesting to know a little about the
<br />
background you bring to your thinking.
<br />
<br />David
