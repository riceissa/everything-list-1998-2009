Greetings;
<br />
this reply has taken some time...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't quite agree with your point of view, and the reason is maybe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; similar to our disagreement in my statement: &quot;It is not useful to talk
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about 1st person experiences in 3rd person terms, since when we do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that we lose the very thing that we want to study.&quot;
</em><br />
<br />I think you're right; this is the central disagreement.  To spell it 
<br />
out:  I do not believe the 1st person/3rd person distinction is 
<br />
fundamental.  That is, I think that once you've explained what a system 
<br />
does (and how it does it), you've explained everything.  Consciousness 
<br />
is simply a complicated set of behavioral dispositions, which can in 
<br />
principle be explained from an objective, 3rd-person standpoint; and 
<br />
the &quot;1st person&quot; viewpoint is just a description, a way that it 
<br />
naturally occurs to us to put things, because of our psychology 
<br />
(biology).
<br />
<br />When you said earlier that:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;In a materialistic framework, ' I ' am a bunch of atoms. These atoms
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;happen to constitute a system that has self-referential qualities that
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we call consciousness.&quot;
<br />
I took you to be agreeing with me on my view of consciousness.  But I 
<br />
think a difference is highlighted here:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't need to point out who ' I ' am. I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concerned with my first-person experiences, and that is easy to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; determine without even gaining acces to the other entities who look 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; me.
</em><br />
<br />What, exactly, are these &quot;first-person experiences&quot;? Are they really so 
<br />
easy to determine?
<br />
<br />I would say that whatever they are, they contain no information on 
<br />
whether you are Eric01 or Eric02.  We know that these completely 
<br />
specified entities do exist, but since Eric01 has no way of knowing he 
<br />
is in fact Eric01, it does not matter what he experiences; the 
<br />
difference between Eric01 and Eric02 is not a difference for Eric.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Hal Finney's thought experiment about the 2 identical computers is 
<br />
right on, I think.  You have 2 AI programs running in lockstep.  
<br />
Nothing in the programs' experiences can tell them which program they 
<br />
are (let's say each computer has a serial number on the outside; but 
<br />
this is completely inaccessible to the programs running on them).  Now 
<br />
I tell both programs that I'm going to turn off the machine labeled 
<br />
&quot;01&quot; and leave &quot;02&quot; running.  Our intuitions now point in different 
<br />
directions here.. I do not think it's meaningful here for a program to 
<br />
consider which computer it's running on.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
You would ask the next question:
<br />
&quot;If you were one of the programs, what would you expect to happen?&quot;
<br />
whereas I would ask it:
<br />
&quot;If you were the set of these 2 programs, what would you expect to 
<br />
happen?&quot;
<br />
<br />So I think it all comes down to which conception of &quot;you&quot; you decide to 
<br />
use.
<br />
<br />Another comment:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You are trying to identify ' me ' by somehowpointing it out from the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pool
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of similar entities in a God's perspective. That may be even 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; impossible,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if there is no God, but that is another discussion.
</em><br />
<br />You're right, it is impossible. (even if &quot;you&quot; were in one of Jürgen's 
<br />
or Bruno's programs, I would think it would be difficult and, to a 
<br />
certain degree, _arbitrary_ to completely isolate the part of the 
<br />
program that is &quot;you&quot; from the part that is everything else.)  I think 
<br />
the fact that it is impossible to determine who &quot;you&quot; are is precisely 
<br />
one of the things that makes QTI seem plausible.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  ' I ' am what I experience myself to be, and that is a completely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; specified entity since there are no interactions between universes.
</em><br />
<br />I think that your word &quot;that&quot; in this sentence does _not_ actually 
<br />
point to a completely specified entity.  Your experiences are not 
<br />
specifying what needs to be specified here.  You appear to be saying, 
<br />
&quot;Well, at any rate, I know that _I am me_ and no one else!&quot;.  But you 
<br />
do not experience yourself as a completely specified entity.  And it's 
<br />
still true that a vast number of (almost completely) identical bunches 
<br />
of atoms are saying the same thing as &quot;you&quot;, and invoking the same 
<br />
experiences in support of their assertion.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was my point about Wittgenstein's man who says he knows how tall 
<br />
he is.  The answer to the question &quot;How tall are you?&quot; is not &quot;This 
<br />
tall!&quot;, accompanied by a gesture with your hand.  It seems like an 
<br />
answer, but it won't do - because the question is asking for a 
<br />
measurement (given an agreed-upon metric, etc.).  For the purposes of 
<br />
the QTI, the question &quot;who are you?&quot; cannot be answered by doing, as 
<br />
you essentially are doing, &quot;I'm this person!&quot;, accompanied by pointing 
<br />
to your chest.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If two universes have any distinction, even in the state of a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particle, as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I understand the MWI, they are distinct universes. That is an objective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; statement, which has nothing to do with my lack of knowledge about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the small differences. One particular universe (the one  ' I ' am in) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; may
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have distinct outcomes in a dangerous situation, so that it splits in, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; say,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 50% universes where I am dead, and 50% where I am alive.
</em><br />
<br />We both agree with this setup of MWI and the outcomes of dangerous 
<br />
events, etc.
<br />
You might say, &quot;We agree on all the 3rd person facts&quot;.  For instance, 
<br />
we both agree that, say, Eric01 will die and Eric02 will live, and this 
<br />
has nothing to do with what either of them know.  The disagreement 
<br />
comes when you say, &quot;Yes, but what will *I* experience?&quot;.  I have been 
<br />
trying to argue that this question and its answer depends on the 
<br />
particular sense of &quot;I&quot; being used.
<br />
<br /><br />Regards,
<br />
Pete
