<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's possible that the initial, sequential run was necessary for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness to exist.
</em><br />
<br />I doubt this is the case.
<br />
<br />First of all, I don't think you should call it &quot;law&quot; at all, since 
<br />
such property is indeed derived purely from the interpretation we had 
<br />
made so far about our world. Although these interpretations (QM, 
<br />
Relativity, super string and etc.) are in favor now, they are 
<br />
logically no more &quot;valid&quot; than Newton's physics at his time (or even 
<br />
now). If we all this time dependency a &quot;defect&quot;, then we (still) do 
<br />
not know whether it is a defect of theories we favored, or a defect of 
<br />
the world we are in now, or a defect of our reasoning ability, or even 
<br />
a resultant defect induced from some other defect of our world. 
<br />
Infinite (or at least very large) number of theory can be developed 
<br />
based on finite number of observed facts, just like infinite numer of 
<br />
curves can pass through finite number of common points. However, we 
<br />
have principles like Occam's Razor to choose between them. How do we 
<br />
know that some other theory may not suffer from this defect?
<br />
<br />Second, even with the physics we use nowadays, there are still simple 
<br />
problems that can be calculate NOT IN ORDER. For instance, the 
<br />
displace of a single pendular at any time can be calculate regardless 
<br />
of its history. Put into more formal way, there exist some turing 
<br />
machine that can calculate in constant (regard to the time) steps. 
<br />
More generally, dynamic systems and complex systems are the only thing 
<br />
that has &quot;history&quot;. However, many dynamic system can be translated 
<br />
(however messly) into simple system of equations that can be solved in 
<br />
constant time with some turing machine. Take gas for example, the 
<br />
position of each molecule is no doubt a hard problem that only 
<br />
expressed with dynamic system. However, if we are to talk about gas in 
<br />
a higher level in terms of volume, pressure, and temperature, then 
<br />
most problem can be expressed in simple systems that can be calculated 
<br />
in constant time.
<br />
<br />Finally, our physics world may be one of the limit that some problem 
<br />
cannot be solved in constant time. This had been talked about quite 
<br />
thoroughly in the discussion about super-turing computation. I don't 
<br />
have much to add on to that.
<br />
<br />Conclusion: A world can be simulated IN or OUT OF ORDER, depending on 
<br />
the physics to be simulated, the world the simulator is in, and the 
<br />
design of the simulator (which is related to the level of intellegence 
<br />
of the designer in this particular case).
