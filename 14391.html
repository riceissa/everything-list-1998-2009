Hi Mirek,
<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hi Bruno and everybody,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; hope to send my comments and/or 'OK' sign :-) on Monday.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Take it easy. There is no deadline on the list.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Making a declaration helps me to get things done. Yet I'm late. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Whenever
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you see such sentences in my posts, you can skip it, they are mostly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; me :-)
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Am I suppose to skip this one too?  :)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ---------------
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'll try to write a summary in my own words. Let's see how much I did
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Prepositions:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A  .... finite alphabet
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A* .... finite words over A  (it is enumerable, moreover effectively
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; enumerable)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; L ..... a language over A.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; E  .... a subset of A*, a set of valid expressions in L  (obviously, it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is at least enumerable)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; M ..... a machine which understands to L
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; f ..... a total function from N to N.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Goal: I want to develop a universal language L which describes all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and only all functions f. Given an expression from E, M computes the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; result in finite time. Given the restrictions on L, the result is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; number and nothing else.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The set of all functions f from N to N is not enumerable (by Cantor's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; diagonal). Thus there is no bijection to E. Thus, I have to find a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; smaller set of functions. I will call this set a set of computable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; functions, C. Inevitably, this is computability by definition, by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definition of L. So L should be 'really good' in order to encompass as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; much functions f from N to N as possible.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, I think of a bijection between E and C.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 0 --- E_0 ~ f_0
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1 --- E_1 ~ f_1
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2 --- E_2 ~ f_2
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3 --- E_3 ~ f_3
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Since E are efficiently enumerable, C are efficiently enumerable ...
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I guess you want to say &quot;effectively enumerable&quot;. Typo error.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; ... as well. Yes, it might happen that f_i = f_j for i != j, but is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter as long as all unique f_i are in the enumeration.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Time for the Kleene diagonal argument. Opps, a language L that I dreamt
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of does not exist. I have to relax from the condition that M on E_i
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; always return a number in a finite time. Well, what to return if not a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; number ... nothing -&gt; M experiences an infinite loop.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What a world, ok, my language has to describe total functions from N to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; N and as well as strict partial functions from N to N.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And it is clear
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that I cannot know whether E_i corresponds to a total function or a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; strict partial function.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Clear for you, apparently. Is it clear for everybody? This follows from 
<br />
the Diagonal argument applied on the &quot;programs&quot; in L.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; f' stands for any function descriable by L.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 0 --- E_0 ~ f'_0
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1 --- E_1 ~ f'_1
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2 --- E_2 ~ f'_2
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3 --- E_3 ~ f'_3
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; N, E and C are enumerable, moreover obviously effectively enumerable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Any subset of C is at least enumerable. A subset of C corresponding to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; total functions is no effectively enumerable. It cannot be.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, a language L which describes both total and strict partial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; functions and hereby defines a set of computable functions is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; refuted by Kleene's diagonal.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK. I guess that you see now that is by allowing a universal machine to 
<br />
do infinite task which makes CT consistent (possible). OK?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is not obvious to me how strong sort of evidence that universal L
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exists, it is to survive Kleene's diagnonal. Droping an apple on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; floor is in favor of Newton's law but not very convincing :-)
</em><br />
<br /><br />Because the diagonal argument is *the* tool for demolishing the idea 
<br />
that such or such set is universal or complete, but then it does not 
<br />
work on language like Lambda, Turing, etc. This entails a strong form 
<br />
of incompleteness.
<br />
Then, Judson Webb, argued that Godel's incompleteness confirmed such 
<br />
incompleteness, and thus CT, and thus Mechanism, Comp ...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Oh, now I realize that my question is actually weird. Since the set of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computable functions is defined by L, and L is said to be universal if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it describes exactly these functions - it is simple to develop a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; trivial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; L  -&gt; it defines a set of computable functions ... and of course
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universal L exists.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK, but this is due to your &quot;definition&quot; above of the set of computable 
<br />
functions. Recall that we do have some starting intuition of what is an 
<br />
intuitively computable functions. Church thesis is the assertion that 
<br />
LAMBDA (or FORTRAN, or whatever programming system you love) does 
<br />
capture that starting intuition. CT is both philosophical (linking an 
<br />
epistemic concept with a mathematical class of functions) and 
<br />
scientific (refutable in Popper sense: CT would be refuted in case we 
<br />
find a clearly humanly computable function which would be uncomputable 
<br />
in Lambda (and thus in Turing, Java, or any modern all-purpose 
<br />
computer, etc.).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In this sence a universal language L always exists. So I write it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rather
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like this:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If we develop many sufficiently different programming languages and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; turn out to be all equivalent, it might convince me that the set of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'computable functions' is fixed.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes, and that is the case. I guess (from your thesis) that you are very 
<br />
well aware that the quantum computer itself does not compute more 
<br />
functions than FORTRAN, LISP, JAVA, PYTHON, Billiard Ball, Games of 
<br />
Life, etc.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Although, written like this I can think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of educated (math) people who will tell me: This is all you have????
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So, what are like 2-3 most direct consequences of CT which make CT to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seem rock-solid? Here I assume that CT basically says that the set of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; functions descriable by the lambda calculus is all what I can ever 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; compute.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Of course, the power of *evidences* could depend on your own 
<br />
background. Personally, the fact that the collection of partial 
<br />
computable functions is closed for the diagonalization procedure seems 
<br />
to me to be a very powerful reason to believe in CT. Of course it is 
<br />
not enough, you could try as exercise to build a class of functions 
<br />
closed for the diagonalization, yet not Turing-universal!. The evidence 
<br />
comes from the empirical facts that all attempts have lead to the same 
<br />
class, *together* with the fact that that the diagonal does not lead 
<br />
outside the defined set, + some particularly good analysis of what is a 
<br />
computation, mainly, imo, like the Turing's arguments, Church's one, 
<br />
Emil Post's one.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; -------------
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Regarding points 3)-5) of your summary, I am lost on terms such as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Absolute ontic TOE, Observer Moments, Aristotelian principles, Machine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theology, ...
</em><br />
<br />All right, all right .... that was an anticipation, at least relatively 
<br />
to the current thread. We will come back on this, but to give you some 
<br />
food I could say this:
<br />
Absolute Ontic Toe: that concerns the (minimal) ontological commitment, 
<br />
i.e. what I will take as existing independently of me, or (because this 
<br />
is just a question of phrasing) the set of sentences that I consider 
<br />
being true independently of me or of any observer whatsoever.
<br />
I can explain that on,ce we accept comp (if only for the sake of the 
<br />
conversation) then ontically we need not more than the number 
<br />
theoretical truth (this is perhaps not obvious, but it should be 
<br />
obvious that this follows from the UD Argument).
<br />
Observer Moment is a key informal &quot;everything-list&quot; concept. It has 
<br />
been introduced by Nick Bostrom in together with the notion of 
<br />
Self-Sampling Assumption, but the term is defensible in the comp 
<br />
context, with the condition to be clear on the distinction between 
<br />
states and the first person perspective. We can go back on this: I 
<br />
argue that if comp is true, then the physical world in an internal view 
<br />
of number theory as seen from inside. I like to paraphrase Kronecker: 
<br />
God created the numbers, all the rest are inventions by ... numbers.
<br />
Aristotelian principle: well, concerning matter it is just the quite 
<br />
common idea that there is a substancial world, made of &quot;matter&quot; ... I 
<br />
call that sometimes weak materialism: the belief in a notion of primary 
<br />
matter. Physicalism is very close to that idea: the dea that physics is 
<br />
the fundamental science.
<br />
Machine theology: once you assume Church's thesis, it is easy to show 
<br />
that most truth ABOUT machines can be written as relations between 
<br />
numbers. Those relations are either true or false. The theology ABOUT 
<br />
machine M is the set of all true relations among numbers which can be 
<br />
interpreted as relations about the machine (albeit not necessarily so 
<br />
by the machine). Due to the incompleteness phenonemon, this set is 
<br />
different of the set of provable (by M) relations among numbers 
<br />
(including again those relations bearing on the machine). In a 
<br />
nutshell: theology is the science of truth (about machines, and other 
<br />
entities), science itself corresponds to the provable relations. See my 
<br />
Plotinus paper for more. We have to go back on this in due time.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; -------------
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I wrote down a list of short-term goals on what I would like to have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some background/knowledge with a help from this list:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1\ I saw somewhere a sentence saying approximately this:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;.... so universe is performing a computation. Is then universe a big
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computer? No.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would like to know in a broad sense what it tries to say a why one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shoud rather accept it or reject.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2\ Bruno, you recently wrote that you do not agree with Wolfram's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Principle of Computational Equivalence. As I understand to that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; principle, Wolfram says that universe is a big cellular automata. What
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is the evidence that it is unlikely this way?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />The shortest answer is that you cannot simulate &quot;in real time&quot; a 
<br />
quantum computer with a classical cellular automata. OK?
<br />
Also: what does that mean that the universe is a big cellular automata? 
<br />
Now the main reason to find that unlikely is that such a vison is based 
<br />
on the idea that pour consciousness and experiences are related to the 
<br />
actual running of a machine/brain. This is shown just epistemologically 
<br />
unlikely through the UD Argument.
<br />
<br />Your points 1) and 2) are related. I maintain that if comp is true, 
<br />
then the physical or observable &quot;universe&quot; cannot be a computational 
<br />
object: i.e. it cannot be the output of a program nor can it be related 
<br />
to the running of a special program, except in some very weak sense. 
<br />
Why? that is really all what the UDA is about. And then the interview 
<br />
of the lobian machine will consist in making a rough, (but highly non 
<br />
trivial) arithmetical translation of UDA in the language of the 
<br />
(universal, even Lobian) machine. A Loebian machine is mainly an 
<br />
enlightened machine: a universal machine which knows that it (she ...) 
<br />
is a universal entity.
<br />
<br />The reason why, IF we are digitalizable machines, then the physical 
<br />
world cannot a priori be a machine, nor a product of a machine, comes 
<br />
from the fact that we cannot know which computations does actually go 
<br />
through our local states, and there is an infinity of such 
<br />
computations. To predict our local and relative  &quot;future&quot; we have to 
<br />
take into account *all* such computations. Comp predicts that if I 
<br />
observe myself at a level below the level of substitution (where I 
<br />
survive substitution by comp), then I will observe the trace of many 
<br />
parallel computations. I take QM (without collapse) as a confirmation 
<br />
of this.
<br />
<br />Did you grasp the first-person indeterminacy? Are you ok with the idea 
<br />
that comp makes us duplicable, at some level, and if we are duplicable 
<br />
(at that level) then if we are actually duplicated (copy and 
<br />
annihilated in Brussels, say, and reconstituted in Sidney and Beijing 
<br />
(say), do you accept that in Brussels we cannot predict with any 
<br />
certainty which places we will feel to be there?
<br />
<br />I must go and perhaps comment your other post later (about ordinal, I 
<br />
will have the opportunity to give some effective use of them related to 
<br />
the notion of universality).
<br />
<br />Bruno
