<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Very good answer, Kim, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Just a few comments. and then the sequel.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Exercice 4: does the real number square-root(2) belongs to {0, 1, 2,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;3, ...}?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;No idea what square-root(2) means. When I said I was innumerate I wasn't kidding! I 
</em><br />
could of course look 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it up or ask my mathematics teacher friends but I just know your explanation will make 
</em><br />
theirs seem trite.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Well thanks. The square root of 02 is a number x, such that x*x (x times x, x multiplied by 
</em><br />
itself) gives 2.For example, the square root of 4 is 2, because 2*2 is 4. The square root of 
<br />
9 is 3, because 3*3 is 9. Her by &quot;square root&quot; I mean the positive square root, because we 
<br />
will see (more later that soon) that numbers can have negative square root, but please 
<br />
forget this. At this stage, with this definition, you can guess that the square root of 2 
<br />
cannot be a natural number. 1*1 = 1, and 2*2 = 4, and it would be astonishing that x 
<br />
could be bigger than 2. So if there is number x such that x*x is 2, we can guess that such 
<br />
a x cannot be a natural number, that is an element of {0, 1, 2, 03 ...}, and the answer of 
<br />
exercise 4 is &quot;no&quot;. The square root of two will reappear recurrently, but more in examples, 
<br />
than in the sequence of notions which are strictly needed for UDA-7.
<br />
<br /><br />OK - I find this quite mind-blowing; probably because I now understand it for the first 
<br />
time in my life. So how did it get this rather ridiculous name of &quot;square root&quot;? What's it 
<br />
called in French?
<br />

<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;=============== Intension and extension ====================
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Before defining &quot;intersection, union and the notion of subset, I would like to come back 
</em><br />
on the ways we can define some specific sets.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In the case of finite and &quot;little&quot; set we have seen that we can define them by exhaustion. 
</em><br />
This means we can give an explicit complete description of all element of the 
<br />
set. Example. A = {0, 1, 2, 77, 98, 5}
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;When the set is still finite and too big, or if we are lazy, we can sometimes define the set 
</em><br />
by quasi exhaustion. This means we describe enough elements of the set in a manner 
<br />
which, by requiring some good will and some imagination, we can estimate having define 
<br />
the set.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Example. B = {3, 6, 9, 12, ... 99}. We can understand in this case that we meant the set of 
</em><br />
multiple of the number three, below 100.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;A fortiori, when a set in not finite, that is, when the set is infinite, we have to use either 
</em><br />
quasi-exhaustion, or we have to use some sentence or phrase or proposition describing 
<br />
the elements of the set.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Definition. I will say that a set is defined IN EXTENSIO, or simply, in extension, when it is 
</em><br />
defined in exhaustion or quasi-exhaustion. I will say that a set is defined IN INTENSIO, or 
<br />
simply in intension, with an &quot;s&quot;, when it is defined by a sentence explaining the typical 
<br />
attribute of the elements.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Example: Let A be the set {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ... 100}. We can easily define A in intension:  A 
</em><br />
= the set of numbers which are even and smaller than 100. Mathematicians will condense 
<br />
this by the following:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;A = {x such that x is even and smaller than 100}  = {x ⎮ x is even &amp; x 
</em><br />
special character, abbreviating &quot;such that&quot;, and I hope it goes through the mail.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />Just an upright line? It comes through as that. I can't seem to get this symbol happening so I will 
<br />
use &quot;such that&quot;
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;If not I will use &quot;such that&quot;, or s.t., or things like that.The expression {x ⎮ x is even} is 
<br />
literally read as:  the set of objects x, (or number x if we are in a context where we talk 
<br />
about numbers) such that x is even.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Exercise 1: Could you define in intension the following infinite set C = {101, 103, 105, 
</em><br />
...}C = ?
<br />
<br /><br />C = {x such that x is odd and x &gt; 101}
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Exercise 2: I will say that a natural number is a multiple of 4 if it can be written as 4*y, 
</em><br />
for some y. For example 00 is a multiple of 4, (0 = 4*0), but also 28, 400, 404, ...  Could 
<br />
you define in extension the following set D = {x ⎮ x &lt; 10 and x is a multiple of 4}?
<br />
<br />D = 4*x where x = 0 but also { 1, 2, 3, 4, 08 }
<br />
<br /><br />I now realise I am doomed for the next set of exercises because I cannot get to the special 
<br />
symbols required (yet). As I am adding Internet Phone to my system, I am currently using an 
<br />
ancient Mac without the correct symbol pallette while somebody spends a few days to flip a single 
<br />
switch...as soon as I can get back to my regular machine I will complete the rest.
<br />
<br />In the meantime I am enjoying the N+1 disagreement - how refreshing it is to see that classical 
<br />
mathematics remains somewhat controversial!
