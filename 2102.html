<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From: Brent Meeker &lt;meekerdb.domain.name.hidden&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;    Of course, if we already had a theory of quantum gravity, and if the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;math calculation already yielded the prediction that p=x, then p(o|1) (if 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you like, p(x|1)) would be 1 - based on that math, not on the fact that we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;do see x.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;That's exactly what I took Candidate #1 to be - we have a theory that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mathematically constrains all parameters either to particular values or to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ranges which are consistent with SAS's.  If that was not what you meant by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Candidate #1 (and apparently it wasn't), why didn't you consider that as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Candidate #4; after all it's what most physicist hope and work for.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole point is that right now, we don't have such a theory!  And 
<br />
what my analysis seems to point to is that there isn't one.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, on the other hand, we had a theory that exactly specified (up to 
<br />
many decimal places) each physical constant, and it predicted the values we 
<br />
see, then that theory would have a huge probability advantage over #2 (which 
<br />
only constrains the values to a range, albeit a narrow one).  We don't.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I said &quot;seems to&quot; because my example assumed there was only one set of 
<br />
physical laws.  It didn't take into account other possibilities such as some 
<br />
of the stuff discussed on the everything-list.  Thus, even if there is only 
<br />
one possible theory of quantum gravity, other types of physical laws could 
<br />
also exist as weighted by complexity.  The point being that QM + SM + 
<br />
gravity is already too complex to be the only physical reality, and as much 
<br />
of an anthropic constraint as the parameters.  The advantage will always 
<br />
belong to *some* type of ensemble theory, erasing the anthropic 
<br />
&quot;coincidence&quot;.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ensemble #2 easily beats non-ensemble #1, but &quot;apparent ensemble #2 with 
<br />
Tegmark ensemble&quot; is not necessarily any more likely than such an &quot;apparent 
<br />
non-ensemble #1 with Tegmark ensemble&quot;.  Tricky!  (And similar to the effect 
<br />
of the MWI on &quot;god's coin toss&quot;.)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But important to point it out now, lest physicists should come up with a 
<br />
unique consistent set of physical constants, and then try to use that as 
<br />
evidence against the MWI way of thinking about physical laws!  It wouldn't 
<br />
be.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;    I do mention consistent histories briefly on my historical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; interpretations page.  As for decoherence, that is a common feature of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;all interpretations because it's just part of QM, not an interpretation.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;As for more parsimonious, you are wrong.  The MWI just states (regarding 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physics) that the wavefunction evolves normally and doesn't collapse.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;There is no simpler interpretation possible in principle.  Of course to get 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;predictions from any mathematical model, even classical mechanics (if you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;don't cheat by leaving out the observers from the math), you need a theory 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of mind such as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; computationalism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The reason I consider the MWI less parsimonious is that either (depending 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;on which version you have in mind) 1) requires that there be some special 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;property of minds which causes the universe to branch when a mind becomes 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;aware of something OR 2) it requires that the branching be a continuous 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;process generated by every interaction that leaves a classical record.  I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;think the consistent histories approach may also require a special property 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of minds - namely that brains have evolved such that the minds they 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;implement only perceive via certain operators which correspond to classical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;variables.  This would be explained by evolutionary selection.  Of course 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this still leaves a stochastic element, which the MWI 'explains' by saying 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;'they all happen', but I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;don't find this explanation any better than just saying 'one of them 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;happens at random, in accordance with psi*psi.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You still don't seem to understand what the MWI says.  In both 1) and 2) 
<br />
you seem to assume branching is some special physical process beyond normal 
<br />
Shrodinger evolution.  You probably have seen a lot of books characterize 
<br />
the MWI that way.  Believing those books is like letting John Rocker be your 
<br />
tour guide in NYC.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, in both my version of the MWI and Everett's, &quot;branching&quot; is 
<br />
just a manner of speaking about the typical behavior in Shrodinger evolution 
<br />
where decoherence occurs.  A theory of mind is needed by *any* theory to 
<br />
generate *any* prediction about observations.  I attempt to formulate one in 
<br />
my CWIA.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, it's obvious to me that a stochastic theory, which says that 
<br />
the Kolmogorov complexity of the physical world increases with every event, 
<br />
continuously violates Occam's razor.
