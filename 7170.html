Dear List,
<br />
I cannot keep to myself remarks on TWO kinds of &quot;unreasonabilities&quot; surfaced
<br />
and are still being discussed to saturation (euphemism).
<br />
<br />#1: the use of the conditional form. This, as usually applied, pertains to a
<br />
select aspect of the model without (of course) taking the &quot;rest of the
<br />
world&quot; into consideration which effacts/affects all changes. One cannot
<br />
think of changing one aspect and disregard the result of ALL influences onto
<br />
it.
<br />
Maybe Job's bluecollar parents provided a firm and steady grip on his
<br />
growing up giving him the discipline to become a successful person, while
<br />
the affluent couple's possibilities would have led him into drugs and/or
<br />
crime.
<br />
<br />Si &quot;nisi&quot; non esset, perfectus quodlibet esset.
<br />
&nbsp;It's a mind-game. Sci (or not so sci?) - fi???
<br />
<br />One closing idea: the world is deterministic: All
<br />
that happens has its origin in intereffectiveness, we have access only to a
<br />
limited cognitive circle. So those 'facts' we want to hypothetically change
<br />
are determined by the OM circumstances. It is nonsense: just like the 10^100
<br />
pensimilar copies in 10^100 pensimilar universes - all according to our
<br />
(human and present) understanding, design and conditions. Our own
<br />
mind-limited artifact.
<br />
<br />#2: Over the millennia faith-strategists invented dualism to imply something
<br />
that 'survives' us and can be praised or punished just to secure the grip of
<br />
'faith' (organizations?) on the 'faithful, aoup carrying such memes over
<br />
millennia. It was not an esoteric thought: the basic reductionist thinking
<br />
humanity developed with its limited models gave rise to &quot;thinking in things&quot;
<br />
ie cut models, without understanding of the total interconnectedness.
<br />
<br />If we step a bit further, we find that &quot;the world&quot; is change, process,
<br />
&quot;substance&quot; is reduceable into such and it is our reductionist logic that
<br />
looks for &quot;material substance&quot; on traditional basis.
<br />
The process, change, ie. the 'function' usually assigned to such 'substance'
<br />
as being considered a separable entity (like spirit, soul, consciousness,
<br />
power, whatever) and voila: we have dualism.
<br />
I do not imply that the &quot;soul&quot; is the &quot;function&quot; of the &quot;body&quot;: the unit we
<br />
realize as our model of a human being (or anything else) is considered as
<br />
having a substrate AND a function separately. So the personalized function
<br />
can(??) 'survive' the substrate's demise. Bovine excrement: there is an
<br />
intrinsic unity of 'functional units' - no &quot;mind&quot; separable from the (so
<br />
called) material tool: the neuronal brain (and its functions).
<br />
<br />I don't blame Descartes: in his time dualistic basis kept him from the
<br />
inquisition. And we cannot judge by our present epistemic level of ongoing
<br />
information at our cognitive inventory, the outcome of another (lower?)
<br />
level conclusion. Ptolemy was right in his rite. Passé.
<br />
<br />I like this list, because it 'thinks' for the future. Of course sometimes it
<br />
is hard to shake off the firm handcuffs in thinking by traditional terms. We
<br />
all have been brainwashed into them.
<br />
<br />Please, excuse my unorthodoxy
<br />
<br />John Mikes
