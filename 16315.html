Hi Günther,
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hi Bruno,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thanks for your interesting answer, I have some questions though.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; course, as I said, this will depend of what you mean by &quot;you&quot;. In  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; case
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; you accept the idea of surviving with amnesia, you can even get to a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; state where you &quot;know&quot; you are immortal, because your immortality  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;past event&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would equate total amnesia with death (we've been through this  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; before,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Stathis has written about this, if I remember correctly).
</em><br />
<br /><br />I remember Quentin identifying himself with his memory, and very  
<br />
logically, identifying total amnesia with death.
<br />
It is a complex matter. Total amnesia concern only some form of  
<br />
declarative knowledge, you cannot loss your &quot;procedural memory&quot;,  
<br />
because it is part of ... arithmetic, and common to all elementary  
<br />
knowers.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree with you that you can't have a universal machine stopping
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relatively to all others from it's POV; but I don't see why we can't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think of it having total amnesia. So, for the time being, let us take
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; surviving as meaning to keep (at least large parts) of one's memory.
</em><br />
<br /><br />All right. Comp leads also to that form of immortality, at least for  
<br />
awhile (if I can say).
<br />
The problem of death is intrinsically difficult, because you will  
<br />
survive with amnesia or not according of the level of substitution,  
<br />
which we cannot know, but only bet on (or perhaps even choose in some  
<br />
circumstances?). Total amnesia seems to lead to the remembering of you  
<br />
being the universal person, plausibly Plotinus &quot;Soul-Universe&quot;, or the  
<br />
arithmetical S4Grz (the third hypostase).
<br />
Total amnesia is complete fusing. We &quot;remember&quot; we are all the same  
<br />
person. We can lost that memory only by differentiating oneself again.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; facts, like the continuum of many-worlds. If Loop Gravity is 100%
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; correct, and if the big bang has a finitely describable origin then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; comp is false!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Could you elaborate? I don't see why LG should be bad news for comp?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You mean because LG proposes a fundamental spacetime quantization?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't see how it would falsify comp?
</em><br />
<br />It is obviously an open problem. But taking literally the UDA, and  
<br />
making abstraction of some still possible (logically) conspiration of  
<br />
the numbers, it seems clear that comp predict that an electron, for  
<br />
going from A to B, with respect to you, will be supported by a  
<br />
continuum of computational histories. I have no clue how to select a  
<br />
finite or countable infinity of subcomputations. But if that is the  
<br />
case, the UDA shows that such a conclusion (like LG) has to be derived  
<br />
from arithmetic. Otherwise, it would be treachery.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And why the finitely describable Big Bang? It seems you have a problem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; when there are some finite limits (outside of the effective  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of mind). Is this because you need the continuum in the AUDA to get
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Quantum logic or something like that?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Not at all. That would be treachery too. If the continuum was not  
<br />
possibly emerging from AUDA, I would take this as an evidence that  
<br />
comp is false. The reason comes really from computer science and the  
<br />
(enumerable) redundancy of the computational states, and the non  
<br />
enumerable redundancy of the &quot;1-pov&quot; infinite stories.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Our bodies can be considered programmed to stop (by sex and death),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; our soul just cannot, there is always a consistent continuation (even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; without amnesia
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why do you believe that latter?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Consider someone who dies, relatively to you. Well, La Palisse was  
<br />
found of &quot;tautology&quot;: after he died, someone said&quot; 5 minutes avant sa  
<br />
mort, Monsieur de La Paice vivait encore&quot;. &quot;Fives minutes before he  
<br />
died, Sir de La Palice was still alive&quot;. Now, from the point of view  
<br />
of the dying person, the UD generates 2^aleph_zero histories going  
<br />
through that state &quot;where he is is still alive&quot;, and which are below  
<br />
its computational relevant substitution level. Even with just QM, you  
<br />
can see stories which will &quot;repair anything wrong with whatever needed  
<br />
to generate a short consistent computation. At his substitution level  
<br />
he is finite, and finite machine can always be fixed, and that is all  
<br />
the soul need to survive an instant. But this is true for all  
<br />
instants, by exactly the repetition of the argument. Perhaps some Gods  
<br />
can be mortal, but no souls, as supported by finite entities. That  
<br />
would be like my mechanics: &quot;no, you car is definitely broken&quot;. It is  
<br />
a lie, or a simplification, what it means is &quot;it would be more  
<br />
expensive to fix it than to buy a new one&quot;. In the ud, the first  
<br />
person has unbound-able resources.
<br />
<br />I think, and Quentin disagrees, that, would I be dying, I would feel  
<br />
myself surviving more probably in the &quot;amnesic stories&quot;, probably  
<br />
because I tend to believe (those days) that, if comp is true, my  
<br />
substitution level could probably be rather high. So I would survive  
<br />
in those &quot;normal world&quot; with a &quot;lesser brain&quot;. But if Quentin is right  
<br />
and all my memory are necessary for being me, I will survive in those  
<br />
consistent dreams where my brain has been repaired by friendly white  
<br />
rabbits.
<br />
Suggest me your substitution level (you could bet on) and specify me  
<br />
the corresponding most probable universal implementation, and from  
<br />
this I can &quot;program&quot; a generator of consistent extensions.
<br />
This could seem far stretched, but recall that the universal  
<br />
dovetailing is far stretched itself. And from inside we see only the  
<br />
projection of it, but of it all.
<br />
<br /><br />Now in auda, it is even more simple than in uda, because the soul is  
<br />
defined by the knower, which modality is defined in arithmetic by the  
<br />
proposition explicitly provable *and* true. Bp &amp; p. So Bp -&gt; p, and Bp  
<br />
-&gt; Dp (exercice), so we have Dt, and DDt, DDDt, ... in all worlds/ 
<br />
states. Somehow the soul is immortal quasi by definition. It is the  
<br />
root of the never ending self-extension. The builder of time and  
<br />
space, not yet matter, because it is logically before observation,  
<br />
comprehension, and reflexion. matter arrives when Dp is added (p  
<br />
Sigma_1).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; In arithmetic there are even histories where each time your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;brain&quot; dysfunction some alien white rabbits give you a new suitable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; brain, update it with suitable subroutines, and let you continue your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What continuations are possible in arithmetic? I would like to warn
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; against the approach of taking conceivability/ &quot;humand mind&quot; logical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possibility as a criterion (as you seem to suggest with saying that  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; transporter failed&quot; is a consistent extension). The criterion for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; continuation must be arithmetic possibility,
</em><br />
<br /><br />In uda, the accessible, by the UD,  states, and their points of view  
<br />
on their statistics, bearing on the conputations going through them.
<br />
<br />In auda, this will depend from the eigth hyspostases. But it is always  
<br />
an interplay of provability, consistency, and truth (Bp, Dp, and p).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and here, I don't see any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; formal or even informal way to get to &quot;worlds&quot; in the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anthropocentric sense.
</em><br />
<br />It is the place where indeed many can confuse the map and the  
<br />
territory, or accuse me of doing so. The key advantage of comp, is  
<br />
that when you say yes to the doctor, you do indeed identify your self  
<br />
with a local relative map of you. Then, in uda we reason informally,  
<br />
hopefully rigorously, in term of intuitive description of  
<br />
computational histories. In auda, we do it formally, by interviewing  
<br />
an ideally correct universal self-referring machine with elementary  
<br />
betting abilities, and a world is just a consistent extensions, but  
<br />
the geometry of the relation between worlds if dependent from the  
<br />
chosen point of view. Auda gives 8 (16, 32, ...) very different view  
<br />
of the same arithmetic. Only one of them gives physics, another gives  
<br />
physical sensibility, etc.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; opportunity to go through the UDA (seventh step) again with Kim. I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; suggest you polish your argument against comp-immortality until then,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; perhaps.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Will do :-) But I think beforehand we should clear up any mutual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; misunderstandings; you have obviously been thinking about these things
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for a long time, and you have made connections/inferences which may  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be as obvious as you think.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; BTW: thanks for your modal logic post (the Dt explanation), here again
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the above mentioned issue crops up: while the modal logic may be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; elemental, your interpretation of them is certainly not.
</em><br />
<br /><br />By Solovay theorem, G and G* gives the &quot;intelligible world&quot; of the  
<br />
machine. Or its propositional skeleton. The interpretation are  
<br />
mathematical structures, and I am interested in what the machine  
<br />
proves, and bet,  about them. The interpretations somehow are the  
<br />
consistent extensions themselves (I use in the background the  
<br />
COMPLeteness (not INCOMPLeteness) theorem of Gödel, and a more recent  
<br />
theorem by Orey which shows that Loebianne machine prove the  
<br />
completeness theorem.
<br />
<br />The comp hyp is the link between you and machine, and Solovay theorem  
<br />
is the link between machine and the logic G and G*.
<br />
<br />As far as we are self-referentially correct, Solovay theorem applies  
<br />
to us. If you bet on your correct level of substitution you are self- 
<br />
referentially correct, for example.
<br />
<br />The completeness theorem say that a theory is consistent (does not  
<br />
prove the false, = Dt) if and only if the theory has a model. That is  
<br />
there is a mathematical world which satisfies (in a mathematical  
<br />
sense) the theory. So Dt is really &quot;I believe in a reality, or in a  
<br />
world, state, etc.&quot;
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Often it is the interpretation that does all the work (consider for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instance Einstein's SR: the mathematics was there before, he &quot;just&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suggested a new interpretation by adding postulates (Principle of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Relativity for electrodynamics, c as constant speed of light)).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; These interpretation issues are often played down, but they are in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fact
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; essential.
</em><br />
<br />Take quantum mechanics, like Everett and Dewitt, I don't believe in  
<br />
human interpretations, I believe in the interpretation, or the  
<br />
corresponding discourses, made by the &quot;relatively statistically  
<br />
relevant&quot; entities described by the theory.
<br />
<br />With comp, you have to proceed in that way, too. You can do it  
<br />
mathematically with respect to the correct level of self-description.  
<br />
What is impossible in practice, is to guaranty any precise chosen  
<br />
level, you have to bet, pray, ... on something. This I never hide.
<br />
<br />Like consistency, the truth of comp guaranties the consistency of the  
<br />
falsity of comp. It is really a &quot;theology&quot;, but a mathematical one.
<br />
<br />It is even possible that the level is a matter of personal  
<br />
convenience. You could fuse by amnesia, and then come back in this or  
<br />
that reality to finish this or that job, like if you could chose  
<br />
between Mitra's backtracking and Anciaux's wish to  keep its books,  
<br />
CDs, hard and wet disk full of all its memories.
<br />
<br />Dying? The Loebian machine is confronted to a gigantic arithmetical  
<br />
Bardo Thodol, yet with infinitely many shortcuts. The arithmetical and  
<br />
analytical hierarchies provide good approximation, for the correct  
<br />
Lobian machine. The full first person of the lobian machine is not a  
<br />
machine, its vastly more deep, powerful ... unnameable also (like the  
<br />
knower is already not definable by the machine).
<br />
<br />It is new, and relates three non obvious fields, don't worry. I'm  
<br />
sorry I can't help more quickly. Logic is the most subtle branch of  
<br />
math, and is not well taught, when it is. Hope this helped a bit. I  
<br />
will go through this very slowly with Kim, so in the worst case, just  
<br />
be patient, but don't hesitate to ask questions. If you study logic  
<br />
(the Mendelson book, or Boolos, or Smoryinski) don't hesitate to ask  
<br />
question.
<br />
