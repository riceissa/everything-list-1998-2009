Who is the enemy?
<br />
<br />What is moral? What is not moral?
<br />
<br />What is morality in the context of the MWI?
<br />
<br />Is Quantum Suicide moral?
<br />
<br />Let me propose a conjecture and let us see how far we can go with it:
<br />
<br />&quot;Morality is the creation, protection and preservation of information.
<br />
Immorality is the destruction of information.&quot;
<br />
<br />In classical religious terms this fits pretty well with the Ten
<br />
Commandments. Lying, killing, bearing false witness destroys
<br />
information. Adultery messes up social order (information). Honoring
<br />
parents, protect and preserves their wisdom and  honors them as creator
<br />
(of information). Meta Commandments include observing the Sabbath which
<br />
honors creation itself and the first three Commandments which honor the
<br />
Creator (of world information). 
<br />
<br />As an aside, let me say that in the modern context the destruction of
<br />
the environment is immoral because it results in a decrease in
<br />
biodeversity (world information). Conversely, work that generates
<br />
information is very moral. I like to think that engineers are very moral
<br />
individuals (I am one :-)) because they create new thing that do not
<br />
exist in nature.  But if you really think about it, any work that
<br />
generates a desirable service or product of benefit to society is in
<br />
fact adding information to the world and is therefore moral.
<br />
<br />In response to Spudboy, we could define murder as killing that results
<br />
in the destruction of information. Killing that results in the creation,
<br />
preservation or protection of information is not murder. For example, A
<br />
lion killing an antelope does so to survive. This action preserves
<br />
biodiversity, allows the lions to continue as a specie and shapes the
<br />
evolution of lions and antelopes (faster running, better senses of
<br />
hearing, sights etc...) In short this action is necessary for the
<br />
creation (evolution) of the fauna.
<br />
<br />The Taliban destruction of the statues of Buddah, on the other hand was
<br />
evil because its aim was to reduce cultural diversity in Afghanistan.
<br />
The Holocaust was evil because its aim was to reduce ethnic diversity in
<br />
the world. The terrorist action of the World Trade Center and the
<br />
Pentagon was evil because its aim was to eliminate a way of life. 
<br />
<br />The Taliban operate within a very inflexible system. Bruno would call it
<br />
G. Our system on the other hand is much more flexible and adaptable.
<br />
Because our way of life allows a continuous adaptation we cannot be
<br />
described as a G. -- WE ARE THE TRUE REVOLUTIONARIES! Clearly we present
<br />
a threat to the terrorists: OUR WAY OF LIFE SHOWS THAT THEIR G IS
<br />
INCONSISTENT! In an evil attempt to restore their consistency, they
<br />
attempt to eliminate our way of life. They won't succeed. We shall
<br />
adapt. The world will end up better with more information.
<br />
<br /><br />Now, how does this conjecture fits with the MWI?
<br />
<br />The Plenitude contains zero information. No matter what you do, the
<br />
total amount of information will not change. For example, performing a
<br />
good action, merely means that you allow your consciousness NAVIGATES
<br />
the plenitude to a world where you have performed a good action. Other
<br />
branching to counterfactual &quot;bad action worlds&quot; also exist but YOU have
<br />
not NAVIGATED there. Other you's  (Yoush) have navigated there. As you
<br />
can see, making decision in the plenitude can be reduced to the concept
<br />
of NAVIGATION. You choose a branch, but yoush choose all branches.
<br />
<br />Thus the ABSOLUTE information of the world does not change NO MATTER
<br />
WHAT YOU DO! 
<br />
<br />It seems therefore that just like everything else in our world (all
<br />
physical entities) the only type of morality that matters is morality as
<br />
seen by the first person. We now enter the realm of first person and
<br />
third person perception and relativity. 
<br />
<br />To go any further I must now define the concept of objective world in
<br />
relative terms. Objective worlds are worlds which share frames of
<br />
reference &quot;close enough&quot; to the first person world as to be
<br />
indistinguishable from it. First and third person perceptions are
<br />
identical when the third persons live in such objective worlds. First
<br />
and third person perceptions differ (as in Quantum Suicide QS or FIN)
<br />
when the frames of reference are too far apart.
<br />
<br /><br />I would like to make a distinction between absolute morality and
<br />
objective morality. As I explained above absolute morality does not
<br />
exist - absolute information remains at zero no matter what. Objective
<br />
morality on the other hand does because objective worlds do exist.
<br />
Objective information can change.
<br />
<br />Thus insofar as there are objective worlds, there is objective morality.
<br />
Destroying a specie or a person to reduce diversity in the world is
<br />
objectively immoral. 
<br />
<br />QS or FIN however does not fall within the scope of objective morality
<br />
because, in this case, the first and third person worlds are very
<br />
significantly different. The only type of morality that applies is first
<br />
person morality. It appears that the action of QTI or FIN actually
<br />
creates first person information! Since I believe that measure does not
<br />
change with QS it appears that QS or FIN is actually moral! This is a
<br />
disturbing but IMO an inescapable conclusion!!!

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Bruno, what did you expect? You should expect Jacques to be a  typical

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;American.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The everything list is not a random sample. Unfortunately!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Because frankly I appreciate the Americans here.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I find them very sympa.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;You know how Americans on opposite sides of an issue tend to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;behave.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The champion of biased arguments has been an European!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Note also that Jacques Mallah has never been dishonest. I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just afraid by its lack of doubt on some fundamental questions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I keep asking, because I have no prejudice.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;E.g. recounting of votes in Florida,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is a triumph of democracy ('course, it's not a triumph of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; organisation). In my opinion they should perhaps recount again.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Especially now.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is good USA have a lot of allies but then you must listen to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them, and reassure them. Expression like &quot;crusade&quot;, &quot;infinite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; justice&quot; etc. are diplomatical errors. Worst: they are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; strategical errors. Why?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (with comp they are of course G* error: never pretend the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; good is on your side, especially when it is obvious).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;pro life versus pro choice...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And Death Penalty! God told them &quot;Thou shall not kill&quot;, and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; state himself shows the exemple of killing. Shocking. You got a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I know there is a lot of Americans shocked by that too.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Unthinkable here in Europe!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Be careful. I'm afraid it is thinkable here in Europe. Perhaps
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your country is very open minded, but I am afraid by the last
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; election in Italy. Even in part of Belgium some election have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; given frightful results. Extremism is not dead in our countries.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Anyway, there is nothing wrong with Jacques, he is behaving
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;in a way you should expect from the MWI or your theory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't know. I'm troubled by its persistence to negate the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distinction between first and third person point of view. But
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you should not put him so quickly in a box.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course you raise the question &quot;are the enemies the americans?&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course no. You know that americans are the victims here.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Still you can ask are *some* americans, and more generaly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some occidentals,  responsible?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course. Islam has begun a secularisation process, with a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; begining of separation of &quot;state and church&quot;, but this has been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stopped by the Wahabit (Saoudian) with the help of the occidentals.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So that the fanatical islamic schools have been favorised and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are still now favorised, by the occident (who have justify this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by the cold war with the (ex) Soviet Union, but also by the need
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of petrol).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But why to continue after the fall of Berlin wall? I don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Other questions: when did USA stop supporting the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Taliban? (After the Buddha destruction? after the 11 sept. ?)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Apparently unrelated, but I'm afraid it is perhaps *the*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; central question:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why is hemp forbidden in most countries? (One century of lies and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; propaganda). The international Petrol/Health politics is criminal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; since a long time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You can compare the relation between Occident and Middle East
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with the relation between the heroin-addict and its dealer.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm afraid the real hard dope on this planet could be petrol.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Half-jokingly when Bush administration decides not to respect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Kyoto protocol (signed by almost all countries in the world),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I told my friends that this was a declaration of war against the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whole planet!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The concrete enemy, I am afraid, is international banditism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We should depenalize all the dopes, if only to control black
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; money. Violence is of no use in this war. Its use will always
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; increase it and make it turn back. They are real technical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; international problem which must be solved the most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pacificaly possible.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If Georges Bush drops bombs on Afghanistan, there is a risk he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  will be obliged to drop Bombs on Pakistan, then on Saoudians, then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  ... on Americans, who are the real protector of what happens
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to be the roots of the hate of the occidental tolerance.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let us hope GB will not fall in this diabolical trap.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; USA and the whole occident should profit on being victim for doing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; serious inquest in the whole world.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The fanatics are dangerous. The cynics who help them in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shadow, are much more dangerous. And they are, in part, among us,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as it is more and more obvious days after days.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Nothing will be simple in this &quot;war&quot;. But please, in this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conflict the enemy is widespread in all countries. If you say it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is the Afghans, the Americans, the Occidentals, the Muslims,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; etc. you will always miss the point.
