<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ----- Original Message -----
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; From: Russell Standish &lt;R.Standish.domain.name.hidden&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 1) As you say yourself, a non-wff is just a meaningless string of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; symbols, i.e. one of the bitstrings making up the Schmidhuber
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; plenitude. As pointed out, the Schmidhuber plenitude does seem to have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a natural measure defined on it through K-complexity and Turing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; interpretability. The non-wff strings, as simple the K-incompressible,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; or random ones, however, they are still formal entities, and so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; contribute to the discussion of issues related to measure. I also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; belief that they are interpretable as well, just as Rorschach plots
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; are interpretable, even when they have no information content at all.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The reason that they're interpretable, is that they are close to a wff
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that has information.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This appears to me to be some kind of conflation of (at least) the two
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; schemes discussed earlier (my axiom-based one, and our earlier bit-based
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one) - it is certainly distinct from the basic axiom-based one that you have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; been criticising. Since this (axiom-based) scheme is not bit-based as it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stands, the 'Schmidhuber plenitude' assumption does not apply to it, and so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I can legitimately dismiss non-wffs as irrelevant to the dragon analysis as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; far as my scheme is concerned.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, let me follow your route (as best I can) for a little. I presume
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you must be choosing a particular interpretation of bits corresponding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simply to symbols. Some such strings lead to wff's, theories, and, for a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; minority of these, (the specification of) universes. Others are meaningless
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; strings (non-wffs). I think you would need to clarify:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) How any *additional* interpretation of bits (over and above that leading
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to symbols) could lead to actual universes.
</em><br />
<br />In the Schmidhuber plenitude, non-wff bitstrings are perfectly
<br />
reasonable universes. It is not clear whether they would have
<br />
self-aware substructures, and what the SASes would make of their universe.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) What actual role (if any) TM's play.
</em><br />
<br />I believe that we use TM's as a crutch to help our thinking, but that
<br />
they could be dispensed with an appropriate formalism (which hasn't
<br />
been properly worked out yet).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3) Whether bitstrings could be immediately interpreted as anything other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than symbol strings.
</em><br />
<br />You could interpret them as anything you like - UTM programs, axioms
<br />
of a mathematical theory, the works of Shakespeare. I'm not sure why
<br />
you are asking this though.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4) How K-complexity (if relevant) could be compatible with nonsense bits.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (I must say I also have a severe problem with a bitstring corresponding to a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non-wff being interpretable as anything other than the non-wff itself.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />The K-complexity of a nonsense string is equal to the length of the
<br />
string itself. This is the definition of randomness in the
<br />
Kolmogoraff-Chaitin theory.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 2) There is a curious duality here relating the Tegmark plenitude with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the Schmidhuber one, that I've not yet figured out. On one hand, all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; consistent mathematical systems are based on a finite set of axioms,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and a finite set of transition rules for deriving theorems. These can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; be encoded as a bitstring and a UTM, so all members of the Tegmark
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ensemble must be contained within the Schmidhuber one.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Note that many other systems (for example pre-programmed microchips, brains,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other mathematical mappings) can implement transitional rules - there is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nothing special about UTM sequential processors.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />Only that a UTM can implement any set of transitional rules. This is
<br />
not necessarily true of the other entities you mention.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; There is no 'defining away' of the white rabbit problem. It sounds to me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; if you are confusing white rabbit universes with logically inconsistent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; universes (the latter should not be able to exist in anyone's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; book).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I guess this is the contentious point. Dreams appear to be examples of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; logically inconsistent universes. I would explain them in terms of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; brain's capacity to interpret meaningless data streams generated in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the brain during sleep. I guess you would need to explain either that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; dreams are in fact logically consistent, or that somehow this example
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; doesn't count.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I can only think that we have fundamentally differing conceptions of what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constitutes a logically inconsistent universe. For me, a logically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inconsistent universe would be one where (P AND (NOT-P)) is true somewhere
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; within it (and from which *any* statement is derivable); this would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; presumably have to fall out from some logically inconsistent theory. Unless
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we are straying beyond the realms of science here, dreams are quite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comfortably compatible with physics (apart conceivably from the 'qualia'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem - which would apply at least as much to the waking state and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shouldn't be relevant to logical consistency anyway). If physical laws can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; accommodate dreams there is not even physical inconsistency, let alone
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logical inconsistency. (If by chance you are referring to dream *content*,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; these can hardly be considered as universes, but dream images anyway are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logically consistent, though dreamed flying rabbits obviously don't have to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conform to our physical laws.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />OK - I was using the dream idea as analogy, not asserting that dreams
<br />
are real universes. My point was that human beings, and by somewhat
<br />
iffy generalisation all SASes will attempt to interpret random (or
<br />
nonsense) data (in the K-C sense), and will partially succeed, even at
<br />
the expense of logical consistency. I'm not convinced that the
<br />
universe has to be logically consistent, or even logical at all. (It
<br />
is, of course, a precondition of the Tegmark plenitude - but I'm not
<br />
satisfied that this is correct, or even the only way of constructing a
<br />
plenitude). Sorry, I have Douglas Adam's image here of God
<br />
disappearing in a puff of his own logic! :)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a) The dragon universe is the outcome of a mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; description. In the sense we use dragon here of being non-lawlike, we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; may suppose that they are the outcome of a very complex mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; description. As we well know, the measure of such universes is much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; smaller than the very lawlike universe we inhabit.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; We don't know this unless we can find a proof. In fact the analysis that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; developed earlier can provide a strong indication of the small measure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; dragon universes. (See my web pages.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This result follows directly from the universal measure or universal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; prior employed in the Schmidhuber plenitude.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you are referring to our earlier derived explanation for the paucity of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dragons, that was what I was referring to as well. If not, please elucidate.
</em><br />
<br />There is an obvious mapping of the Tegmark plenitude into the
<br />
Schmidhuber one (axioms as bitstrings, transition rules as an
<br />
interpreter running in a UTM). To each member of the Tegmark plenitude
<br />
(ie a self-consistent mathematical system) corresponds a K-complexity
<br />
measure such that the greater the number of axioms, the greater the
<br />
K-complexity, and the smaller the measure. eg the set of Reals has
<br />
greater complexity than the set of complex numbers. Thus the
<br />
Schmidhuber plenitude induces a measure on the Tegmark plenitude. Now,
<br />
it may be possible to induce a measure on the Tegmark plenitude
<br />
without the scaffolding of the Schmidhuber one, but I sure as hell
<br />
don't know how to do it.
<br />
<br />Now dragon universes will have a more complex mathematical
<br />
description, and hence have smaller measure than non-dragon
<br />
universes. []
<br />
<br />This argument is completely different to the one we worked out in
<br />
July, but has much more in common with your &quot;new argument&quot;.
