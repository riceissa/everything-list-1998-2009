<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What do you make of Hume's observation, &quot;When I enter most intimately into what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I call myself, I always stumble on some particular perception or other, of heat
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or cold, light or shade, love or hatred, pain or pleasure. I can never catch
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; myself at any time without a perception, and never can observe anything but the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perception. When my perceptions are removed for any time, as by sound sleep, so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; long am I insensible of myself, and may truly be said not to exist.&quot; ?
</em><br />
<br />Well, we all know what he means, I think - and what wouldn't I give
<br />
for half my countryman's eloquence.  Fair enough, if you want to
<br />
restrict the sense of &quot;I&quot; to reflective self-consciousness, then it
<br />
indeed manifests variously and intermittently.  But actually, this is
<br />
the clue that points to the underlying ontology out of which
<br />
self-consciousness emerges. The self-conscious &quot;I&quot; manifests so to
<br />
speak as waves that rise out of the ocean: waves come in many shapes,
<br />
but they all need the ocean to manifest, and sometimes they're there,
<br />
other times they're not.  But whether manifested as waves or no, the
<br />
ocean remains.  This gives us the clue that the self-conscious &quot;I&quot; is
<br />
a particular manifestation of a permanent ontological category:
<br />
moreover, as a monist, I take pains to show that this category is the
<br />
only one we need lay claim to.
<br />
<br />In this, I diverge from Kant's analysis that we know via appearance,
<br />
but can know nothing of the entity in itself.  Rather my view is that
<br />
we simply *are* Kant's ding an sich, in terms of the logic I've set
<br />
out.  This analysis points to the double collapse of two apparent
<br />
dichotomies: that (wrongly) implied between being and knowing, to be
<br />
resolved in the tension between global and partial states-of-being;
<br />
and that (wrongly) implied in the shift from unknowing to knowing
<br />
(i.e. 'matter' shading into 'mind') to be resolved through a
<br />
reconceived understanding of the self-reflecting organisation and
<br />
dynamics of a complexly differentiated monistic existent.
<br />
<br />As I said in my post to Bruno, my way of pondering this is by a sort
<br />
of inhabitation of the system I'm seeking to understand.  In this
<br />
case, I intuit myself to arise in the differentiated manifestation of
<br />
a *singular*, present, self-encountering global entity: what I termed
<br />
getting-a-grip-on-Oneself.  'Self' in the sense I'm using it is
<br />
crucial in two ways. First, if one is positing a single comprehensive
<br />
entity - intrinsic to the notion of 'universe' - it can make no sense
<br />
to posit it in relation to anything else: nothing else exists.  Any
<br />
internal relations among differentiables in this context are
<br />
consequently *exclusively* reflexive, self-relating, or
<br />
self-encountering.  Second, following directly from the preceding
<br />
sense, any such entity intrinsically possesses self-intimacy: it is
<br />
reflexive in the sense of reflecting, referencing, or possessing
<br />
access to, itself.  Knowledgeable, if you like.
<br />
<br />At first glance, this latter might appear to be a super-added
<br />
requirement to 'bare existence', but IMO this is fatally mistaken and
<br />
indeed the most deeply obscured aspect of the root existential
<br />
misconception. In point of fact, I believe virtually all the
<br />
confusions we self-inflict with respect to what might be said to
<br />
'exist' stem from not recognising existence-for-self as primary: all
<br />
other senses of exist can be seen under analysis to parasitise on this
<br />
sense; conversely, lose sight of it and 'existence' is banished
<br />
instantly to the phantom status of an abstracted Cheshire Cat's grin.
<br />
<br />The power of this insight is that we can immediately grasp that
<br />
knowing, or epistemology, is simply a modality of being, or ontology.
<br />
Furthermore this collapse, or reduction, also explicitly collapses the
<br />
mind-matter, sense-action dichotomies of relation into a single
<br />
indivisible category.  If you're left nonetheless with the feeling
<br />
that something 'dual' remains, you're right: the irreducible duality
<br />
of whole and part, whose paradoxical nature I have previously
<br />
indicated.  But this is just to situate appropriately the mystery
<br />
ineradicable from any mortal conception.
<br />
<br />This multi-stage reduction allows us to achieve Chalmers' holy grail
<br />
of causal closure by encapsulating it in a unified monism, thus neatly
<br />
sidestepping his so-called 'hard' problem and all the monstrosities
<br />
and zombies it foreshadows.  BTW, he is queasily aware of this, and
<br />
confesses sneaking sympathy with the panpsychists, though the idea of
<br />
outing himself as one triggers incurable philosophical nausea.
<br />
Fortunately, he has no need to barf just yet, which is just as well
<br />
because panpsychism too is implicitly dualist.  Were the epithet not
<br />
already colonised, I suppose we could simply call this position
<br />
'existentialist', once we had cleared up the misconceptions about
<br />
existence.  I suppose in a sense it's neutral monism, properly
<br />
understood.  But it's all too easy to lose one's hold on the
<br />
intrinsically present and reflexive aspects in the 'neutrality' of
<br />
that formulation.
<br />
<br />A note on method: I don't hold with Colin McGinn that a coherent grasp
<br />
of mentality is unreachable by human powers, except, of course, in the
<br />
limit. However, I find that the problems in adequately expressing a
<br />
(moderately) non-standard view involves so many burdens of extraneous
<br />
sense attaching to nearly all the terms available to hand as to make
<br />
the task itself very taxing.  There is I suppose the option of
<br />
inventing a totally new vocabulary, but I would despair of holding
<br />
anyone's attention in the attempt (and probably not even my own).
