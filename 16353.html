Bruno,
<br />
I enjoyed your pretty comprehensive post!
<br />
Thanks!

PS&gt; one little question: have you ever been 'present' when in REM? JM

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hi Johnathan, Kim, Stathis
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree with you Johnathan. Scientists learn a lot from extreme cases,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and altered states of consciousness is worth to study, even to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand better what is a &quot;normal&quot; (if that exists) states of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now remember that our brain seems to generate already by itself a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; numerous of different &quot;naturally&quot;,  or self-altered, consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; states.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The most amazing and well known is the state of the so called
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; paradoxical sleep, or REM period, or dream state, or reality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simulation state. It is a state unknown by the dinosaurs and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reptiles. It appears with the birds and then all the homeothermic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; animals. Michel Jouvet called it paradoxical, because it makes the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; animal hallucinated and paralyzed which makes it an easy prey for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; predator, yet that states has survived 65 millions of years, nobody
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; really knows why, but we suspect its importance.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; During sleep, with some training you can be &quot;lucid&quot; not just during
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the REM paradoxical state, you can be somehow lucid during the slow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wave states, and that gives roughly speaking another collection of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; four &quot;natural altered states&quot;. Fever, some headache, some stroke could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lead to variants.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why altered states? I can find plausible that in situation of stress,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like for a mouse in the mouth of a cat, your probabilities of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; surviving are made higher if your brain has a system of self calm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; down, if not self lying. It is known that mouse indeed generates
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; endogenous morphine like pain killer, and as you know the brain is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; full of enhancers and inhibitors. Most drugs coming from plants are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; molecules looking like our own inhibitors of enhancers, general or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; specific. Which means (but don't repeat) that the first big drugs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constructor is the brain itself (don't repeat because make they will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; make the brain and computer illegal).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Like anything alive a big part of the work consists in self-repairing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and all those endogenous drugs, well all, depending the amount, can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; alter *a little bit more* the state of consciousness, than it does in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; normal circumstances, so that, again, a normal state of consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is a sum of altered states in a equilibrium, belonging to some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; neighborhood of states.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And why does plant constructs altered states of consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; molecules? In my opinion it has all to do with the incredibly complex
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relationships that plant have with animals, in general, and insects in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particular. Many plants have to detract predator insects. By killing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them, or by just smelling like, or imitating the smell of, of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appearance of  the worst predators of the insect (sort of lies!). But
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they must also to attract insects, feed them, and manipulate them in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such a way that Mister plant can send its Message to Missis Plant
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which leaves at five miles from Him. You bet that with millions of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; years they knows about manipulating insects and animals, from predator
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and pollinator to consumers.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And which explains perhaps why there are so much medicinal and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;psychedelic&quot; plants (entheogen).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now I agree with you Johnathan, that for discussing about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness, we should distinguish between drugs which alter the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mood and the perception, like cannabis and alcohol from hallucinogen,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like some mushrooms and cactus, and dissociators like Ketamine. Salvia
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Divinorum, strictly speaking, is a bit of both a dissociator and an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hallucinogen. The first alter your &quot;actual&quot; consciousness, the second
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; triggers an actual different in nature experience, like an out of body
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience, or a near death experience, or a dream, or a dream-like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scenario. Typically and without training you don't remain lucid: you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; forget you are under the product. You can't take Salvia casually, you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; take it to live a particular experience which requires your attention,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and preparation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, I would not compare the effect of Salvia with anything produced
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by any other entheogen. When smoked, it produces an effect which lasts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in general between 3 and 6 minutes. Unlike cannabis, alcohol, LSD, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; many others, the effect is disphoric, meaning not typically pleasant.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Animals does not push twice on the &quot;button&quot; with salvia, showing in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particular it is not addictive. Normal, &quot;my thesis&quot; in four minutes,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the poor animals!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The effect are quite different from people to people, and according to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the concentration of the salvinorin molecules. You find it  from 1X
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (the leaves), to 5X, 10X, ... 40X (beyond it seems to me only the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; price grows up, not the effect).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Many meet typical archetypes (elves, carnival wheel, clown). Some will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relive childhood events, or complete life of someone else. Most will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; talk about a strong pulling or pushing rotation, physically felt,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which can sometimes leads to being cut in billions parts and send to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as much parallel realities (some can panic here). All talk about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; realities and perception of realities. many% (on about 1000 reports)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; talk explicitly about feeling a &quot;feminine presence&quot;, which &quot;teach&quot; you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something, the last point of it seeming unmemorable. Some lives the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience very badly. In my own experiment, with 30 participants (one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by one), they made rewarding experiences, you just need to be patient
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and to increase the amount of concentration incrementally, and to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; encourage the respect of the plant. Most learns this by experience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is it safe? The effect are impressive, but apparently not dangerous.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you look at the YouTube Video, you see that used in the worst
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conditions it leads, in the worse case only to bruises and nightmares.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (With alpinism, a slight error can kill you and others). Like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cannabis, no overdose level exists. Given big amount of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;infinityX&quot; (pure salvinorin) to rats makes then &quot;sleep&quot; for 4
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; minutes, and then they resume their activities. It is estimated that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on the last 2 millions of American who smoked salvia, there are zero
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; death related to it, nor even emergency calls. There are thousand of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; death related to alcohol consumption, and many more injuries, just to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; compare.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Salvia is above all a medicinal plant. Incredibly enough, I did cure a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; severe migraine recently. The person told me she did try all possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; medications, without success, she has to just keep calm in the dark
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for 12 hours. A little hit of leave made it disappear in three
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; minutes.  It is one of the main use among the Mazatec. It helps for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nasal congestion too, it helps for sleep (always 1X here).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is antidepressant, and it is antiaddictive. It is a medication
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; against drugs!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And yes Kim, it is easy (far more than cannabis which is already easy)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to grow your own plant and to multiply it. It is alas less easy to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; find the plant, there are no seeds available, because Salvia Divinorum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has literally abandon sexual reproduction (I think she did have its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; own predator as pollinator, explaining the subtleties of her message).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You don't need light, she hates light, she loves the dark, heat and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; water a lot. She lives, or at least her ancestors were used to live
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (because since 700 years she has been cultivated by the Mexican
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mazatec) in dark hot and humid forest, in the nightlight of the day
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; within the shadows of trees with many branches. Below 0° (celsius) she
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dies.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am glad I found my master. A plant!  (grin). But I will continue to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explain UDA+AUDA for those who prefer the pure third person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; communicable way. Don't worry, (or worry, perhaps :).  It is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; question of taste. Reality is creative, beyond wonders and surprises.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; People who does not like wonders, surprises should not study computer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; science and logics, neither physics, and should avoid Lewis Carroll
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and Salvia Divinorum. That plant likes joking. Here a video of someone
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very sensible, and a bit unprepared, who seems to appreciate the joke:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1QavlZe2H8&amp;feature=channel_page">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1QavlZe2H8&amp;feature=channel_page</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; About that plant, I would like to add that I am certainly in favor of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some regulation. But criminalization of it is no less than criminal.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The plant becomes really dangerous: it can send you to hell (jail),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even without smoking it!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We should have laws forbidding defamation about products related to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; health. Against the abuse of systematic well known errors of logic,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the ignorance of what is a trance states, etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
