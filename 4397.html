Thanks Bruno, for your comments, I fully agree with you. Let me add a 
<br />
few comments for Tim and Scerir

</em><br />
<br /><br />Tim, this example is completely inapplicable to the case of QS just like 
<br />
you would not set up a relativistic experiment to measure the slowing of 
<br />
a clock in which the clock travels one mile per hour. To get significant 
<br />
results you must travel a significant fraction of the speed of light.
<br />
QS decisions are significantly different from &quot;classical&quot; decisions when 
<br />
the life of the experimenter is at stake, (or as I pointed out earlier 
<br />
the memory of the quantum suicide machine in the mind of the 
<br />
experimenter  must be at stake). The amount &quot;at stake&quot; does not have to 
<br />
be 100% as I shall explain below. Even intentional death (suicide) is 
<br />
not necessary. The incoming death may be entirely unintentional!
<br />
<br />This reminds me of a science fiction story I read about 30 years ago in 
<br />
which the end of the world was forecasted for midnight. A zealous 
<br />
journalist was faced with preparing a story to be published the next day 
<br />
(after the world ended.) He accomplished the task by stating in the 
<br />
story that the forecast was in fact in  error and that the world had not 
<br />
ended. In the branch of the manyworld, in which he remained alive, his 
<br />
story was right, and he therefore, astonished the public with his 
<br />
prescience. He made the right QS decision.
<br />
<br />As you can see, suicide is not necessary. One could be on death row - in 
<br />
other words have a high probability of dying - and make decisions based 
<br />
on the probability of remaining alive.
<br />
<br />Being on death row, dying of cancer, travelling on an airline, or 
<br />
sleeping in our bed involve different probability of death... These 
<br />
situations only differ in degrees. We are all in the same boat so to 
<br />
speak. We are all likely to die sooner or later. The closer the 
<br />
probability of death, the more important QS decision becomes.
<br />
<br />The guy on death row must include in his QS decision making the factor 
<br />
that will save his life: probably a successful appeal or a reprieve by 
<br />
the state governor. The person flying in an airline should include in 
<br />
his QS decision process the fact that the plane will not have a 
<br />
mechanical failure or be hijacked. The person dying of cancer must 
<br />
include the possibility of finding a cure to cancer, or of being 
<br />
successfully preserved somehow by cryogenic means.
<br />
<br />As you see, suicide is not necessary for QS decisions.
<br />
<br />In addition the whole issue of &quot;measure&quot; is in my opinion suspect as I 
<br />
have already extensively stated on this list. See below.

<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Lev Vaidman wrote that we must care about all our 'successive' 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;worlds in proportion to their measures of existence [Behavior 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Principle]. He does not agree to play the 'quantum Russian 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;roulette' because the measure of existence of worlds with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;himself dead is be much larger than the measure of existence 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the worlds with himself alive and rich!
</em><br />
<br />I agree that QS is unethical. Yet, the reasons given by Vaidman could be unjustified because maximizing measure may not be possible if measure is already infinite - a clue that measure is infinite is that the manyworld seem to vary according to a continuum since schroedinger function is continuous.
