<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The way I see it, the premise should not be used to draw conclusions, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rather serves as an explanation. Because you already know you are a human
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being named Hal Finney, it no longer matters that you are a random sample
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of all beings. However, the premise helps explain why you are Hal Finney
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and not some bug-eyed alien, namely that Hal has a larger measure than the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; alien (assuming that is actually true). 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here's an analogy: suppose you have just been dealt a hand in a card game. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Since you know what cards you have, the distribution from which they were
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; chosen no longer matters and won't help you play, but that distribution
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; helps explain why you got the cards you did. 
</em><br />
<br />Conclusions and explanations are not so different.  Explanations seem to
<br />
be conclusions that are consistent with what you already know.  Imagine
<br />
if it were possible to make a new prediction based on the everything-
<br />
exists hypothesis, something about the likely nature of the universe
<br />
which had not yet been observed.  Then if that prediction were confirmed,
<br />
it would be dramatic evidence of the explanatory power of the hypothesis.
<br />
This would be both an explanation and a deduction.
<br />
<br />I do have a problem with the way explanations use probability.  In your
<br />
card game example, what happens when you are dealt an unlikely hand?
<br />
What kind of explanation can the theory offer?  If you are playing many
<br />
times, you can say that the theory does give the frequency with which
<br />
such hands will appear.  But in life, it seems like we only play once.
<br />
<br />I look around the world and see that the vast majority of people are poor
<br />
third-worlders struggling with difficult lives.  I am fortunate enough to
<br />
live in a wealthy country, have a good education, and tremendous riches
<br />
by the standards of most people.  What kind of explanation is there for
<br />
this based on the assumption that I am a random selection from among
<br />
all people?  We can't run the universe again and let me be a different
<br />
random selection next time.  This is the same conceptual problem I keep
<br />
encountering with this notion.
<br />
<br />It gets worse if you consider not just me as a random sample from among
<br />
all observers, but if you consider me-now as a random sample from among
<br />
all observer-instants.  Now it seems that I have to adopt an atemporal
<br />
perspective where my consciousness dwells here in Hal Finney, 1999, for
<br />
an instant, then jumps back to a slave in ancient Rome, then dwells for
<br />
a moment in our bug-eyed alien.  I can't make sense out of this.
<br />
<br />This view is especially perplexing if my measure changes drastically
<br />
over time.  With some of our thought experiments, I could boost the
<br />
measure of an instant of my consciousness by making copies of my brain
<br />
state (say, a high-resolution X-ray).  But the next instant, my measure
<br />
drops again.  Would I somehow expect to notice myself spending more
<br />
time in that amplified instant?  Suppose I spent half my days with a
<br />
big brain and half my days with a small brain.  Am I to be puzzled on
<br />
those days I am in the small brain, faced with the mystery of why I am
<br />
not experiencing the measure-enhanced big-brain days?
<br />
<br />This is related to the quantum immortality question.  As time goes on,
<br />
my measure becomes less.  But it is hard to understand what I should
<br />
expect to experience as a result of this.
<br />
<br />Hal
