<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dear Stathis,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       This was an interesting post. You're right in that, until quite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recently, we've understood the world only as well as we've needed to, in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; order to survive. But if you believe, as some people on this list do, that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instantaneous 'observer moments' are the only fundamentally real objects in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the universe, (and that the reasoning, 'I think therefore I am' runs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; primarily in that direction) then it is the logical structure of our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thoughts that is at each moment retrospectively generating a history in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which there evolved a creature intelligent enough to think them.
</em><br />
<br />It is indeed a question of which one suspects to be more
<br />
fundamental: observer moments?  or what I'll call &quot;atoms
<br />
and processes&quot;.
<br />
<br />An important aspect of this is the age-old desire for
<br />
*certainty*. But beginning with several developments 
<br />
in 20th century mathematics, perhaps culminating in
<br />
Morris Kline's excellent book &quot;The Loss of Certainty&quot;,
<br />
this goal becoming more and more deprecated with the
<br />
passing of each decade.
<br />
<br />In fact, the XX century saw many axiom-based philosophic
<br />
schemes which, it seems to me, were little more than 
<br />
manifestations of &quot;math-envy&quot;. And such schemes and such
<br />
thinkers are in less repute than ever these days. (Yet it
<br />
sounds as though a number of people on this list are
<br />
impressed with the *certainty* with which one can regard
<br />
his or her 1st person experiences, and believe that this
<br />
is one of its chief advantages.)
<br />
<br />Instead, the best theories appear to be those based upon
<br />
ideas similar to those of Popper, with &quot;Pan-Critical
<br />
Rationalism&quot; being the highest and best form. From these
<br />
we affirm that our best theories are those whose origins
<br />
---however dubious---have, vitally, withstood powerful
<br />
and well-directed criticism, and the test of time.
<br />
<br />Among these honored theories are, of course, all our best
<br />
scientific theories including heliocentrism, the theory of
<br />
evolution, GR and QM. Also these last centuries deployed ideas
<br />
that were (or should be) the death of vitalism, from Kohler in
<br />
1828, through Urey in 1952 to Watson and Crick in 1953. These
<br />
laid what seem to be an irrefutable basis for the main contentions
<br />
of materialism, to wit, that even the most complex phenomena we
<br />
know of, including the workings of the human brain, ultimately
<br />
reduce to the laws of chemistry and physics (i.e. QM).
<br />
<br />It is difficult to overstate how successful QM has been. Accuracies
<br />
of fifteen decimal places are routine! No one could have anticipated
<br />
such unprecedented success. Thus we at this time have very little
<br />
reason to doubt the contention that brain behavior ontologically
<br />
reduces to QM.
<br />
<br />To me, regarding &quot;observer-moments&quot; as fundamental smacks of
<br />
solipsism. It strikes me as entirely useless. The different
<br />
observer-moments of different (or even the same) entities are
<br />
not at all comparable, and we have no means (except
<br />
introspective ones) to study the phenomena.
<br />
<br />Why not instead adopt the scientific model?  That is, that
<br />
we are three-dimensional creatures ensconced in a world 
<br />
governed by the laws of physics, or, what I'll call the
<br />
&quot;atoms and processes&quot; model. About observer-moments, I would
<br />
say what LaPlace answered to Napoleon about a deity:
<br />
&quot;I have no need of that hypothesis&quot;.
<br />
<br />To be sure, we all have our 1st person experiences, but they're
<br />
inaccessible to anyone else. Moreover, their very existence
<br />
is hardly problematical: would you really believe some aliens
<br />
who landed here and enjoined us in conversation, and then claimed
<br />
to have none?
<br />
<br />As Eugene Leitl is reported to have said, &quot;Experience is just
<br />
what the system looks like from the inside&quot;.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It wouldn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; make sense on evolutionary grounds for typical mammals
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; such as ourselves to be unable to report internal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; impressions, plans, feelings, and anticipations. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This it seems to me is a black box approach. Shades of Skinner's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behaviorism? Not terribly useful or satisfying IMHO. One could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; take the same approach to any biological system or process:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pronounce it adaptive (at least sufficiently till now) and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; leave it at that. &quot;Next problem!&quot;. 
</em><br />
<br />I would say that it's not quite fair to label the materialist
<br />
approach &quot;behaviorist&quot;, because the behaviorists were notorious
<br />
for limiting their inquiries to areas outside the brain. The
<br />
brain is a material device, and of course demands explanations.
<br />
<br />First-person accounts, on the contrary, while irreplaceable in
<br />
psychiatry, have never been of much use in scientific theories,
<br />
and efforts to so use them were generally abandoned along about
<br />
1890, and for very good reason.
