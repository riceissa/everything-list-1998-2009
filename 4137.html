<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Romeo and Juliet, being very unhappy with their families, the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Montague and the Capulet, decide to engage in QS. (By QS, I do not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mean Quantum Sex, even though such an activity has intriguing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;possibilities indeed. This topic is beyond the subject addressed 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;here so I will postpone it for a later posting)
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Neither is QS for Qualified Specialist, nor for Quantum Stupidity I suppose.
<br />
Instead of telling what QS is not for, you could remind us what
<br />
QS *is* for...   Ah! Quantum Suicide. I remember.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;After discussing the idea of QS with their dear friend Mercutio, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Romeo and Juliet decide to go ahead with the project. Mercutio 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;design the machine and under his instruction, Balthasar, Romeo's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;loyal servant,  builds a QS contraption capable of operating on two 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;persons simultaneously. The QS machine is specifically designed not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to operate if the feud between the Montague and Capulet families 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;comes to an end.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I'm afraid it would be better to give the families a deadline!
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Otherwise the machine terminates itself with both persons inside it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in a microsecond. Anyone within a radius of 20 feet of the machine 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is also terminated.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Even within 19,99999999887642109 feet ?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  A few days later, after a series of successful tests demonstrating 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the non-operation of the machine, (otherwise the tests would destroy 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the machine) the device is ready to operate.  Tearfully, Romeo and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Juliet say their goodbyes to their dear friends. They kiss 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;passionately, and slowly step into the machine. Balthasar moves away 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in a hurry afraid for his life. Romeo is sitting in front of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;command panel. One last time, he looks at Juliet who gives him a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;nod. Romeo pushes the ignition button....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;... and nothing happens, Romeo and Juliet step out of the machine, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and full of joy, run to their families to announce thier engagement 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and prepare their wedding...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;...and a huge exposion shakes the ground... Balthasar is at a safe 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;distance and is not hurt. However, Mercutio, who could not bear to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;lose his friends, had decided at the last minute to share their 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;fate. He had moved within one foot of the machine when Romeo hit the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;iginition switch.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now here are a few questions involving first and third person points 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of views :
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Q1. What is the first person point of view of Juliet by Balthasar?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />What do you mean by &quot;the first person point of view of X by Y&quot;?
<br />
Here I would say the (local) third person point of view is the description
<br />
of the (genuine part) of the Schroedinger wave. No less.
<br />
We are discussing *Quantum* S!
<br />
Also, by definition I would say the the first person point of view of X
<br />
is available to X, and nobody else. Oh, perhaps you mean someone, belonging
<br />
to the same quantum branch, and  who
<br />
read Juliet (X) personal diary? OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;A1. He saw the machine explode. No more Juliet.
</em><br />
<br /><br />In the (locally and even relatively) normal worlds *those* normal
<br />
Balthazar saw the machine exploding. No more manifestation of Juliet
<br />
relatively to *those* Balthazar, indeed.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Q2. What is the first person point of view of Juliet by Romeo?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;A2. He sees his dear Juliet alive and well.
</em><br />
<br /><br />And well? What about the vast set of quasi normal worlds
<br />
(that is those worlds nearest to the normal world(*) where you relatively
<br />
consistently survive)
<br />
where Romeo and/or Juliette survive(s) but are wounded, and not so well?
<br />
Those worlds where Mercutio can even no more put some new ignition button.
<br />
What about those quasi normal worlds where the feud continue but
<br />
Romeo and Juliette (and Mercutio, and Balthazar) get a brain disease
<br />
and do no more really follow the drama?
<br />
Both with comp and (pure) QM, violent self-annihilation send you to hell,
<br />
I'm afraid. The amount of energy to annihilate yourself depends on the
<br />
unknowable comp level of substitution.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Q3. What is the first person point of view of Juliet by Mercutio?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;A3. He sees Juliet alive and well.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Same remarks.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Q4. What is the first person experience of Juliet by Juliet?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;A4 She is happy to be alive and in love with Romeo.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK (modulo the remarks).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now here is the trick question
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Q5. What is the third person point of view of Juliet?
</em><br />
<br />?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;A5. Balthasar sees Juliet dead, but both Romeo and Mercutio see her 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;alive and well.
</em><br />
<br />Just looking at the Balthasar point of views:
<br />
<br />The many (normal) Balthasar sees Juliet dead.
<br />
The many (but relatively much less) quasi-normal Balthasar sees Juliet, and
<br />
Romeo, and Mercutio, terribly wounded.
<br />
The exceptional Balthasar sees, with astosnishment, Romeo and Mercutio
<br />
alive and well.
<br />
<br />(Exceptional because we take Shakespeare word for describing the &quot;normal
<br />
world&quot;, where the feud is not supposed to stop!)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;There lies the paradox.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The question should be rephrased as:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;1) What is the third person point of view of Juliet by Romeo,
</em><br />
<br /><br />I don't understand to much this phrasing. I think you described only
<br />
first person (plural) points of view. The third person point view
<br />
can be taken (by hypothesis) as the wave with its many superposition.
<br />
We bet on it. We can never be sure. The third person point of view
<br />
is really the intended scientific point of view. By construction it
<br />
is doubtful, and with comp, it is never really distinguishable with
<br />
some plural first person point of view.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;2) What is the third person point of view of Juliet by Mercutio, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;3)What is the third person point of view of Juliet by Balthasar.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This rephrasing however defeats the whole point of having a &quot;third&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;objective person.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Sure. But there is a third person *point of view*. With QS it is the 
<br />
description
<br />
of the (universal) quantum wave. It has been implicit here. (Note 
<br />
that you could
<br />
have use comp instead).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;There is no such a thing as a third person.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I would agree. I prefer to talk on third person point of view. It is
<br />
the ideal point of view of a scientist making a repetable experiment
<br />
or a verifiable argument, it is the cart we put on the table, the local
<br />
rule of the game we accept for the sake of the argument. Or the local
<br />
experimental device we accept as obviously presented.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The concept of third person should be rephrased in terms of persons 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sharing the same experience because they share the same frame of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reference.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I think that this is what I call the first person plural point of view.
<br />
Amazing, we where just talking about it. Let me quote myself:
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;This gives rise to a notion of first person plural discourse, which is
<br />
just sharable first person discourse, and which can make some of
<br />
the typical first person notions (like the 1-indeterminacy) into locally
<br />
third person notions (like the apparent quantum indeterminacy).&gt;&gt;
<br />
(at the recent <a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m4075.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m4075.html</a>  )
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;In this thought experiment, both Romeo and Mercutio share the same 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;frame of reference and therefore perceive Juliet in the same way.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes. This exemplifies the need of relativizing the probabilities.
<br />
QM illustrates a way to make that relativization in some coherent way.
<br />
With comp it is still an open problem, although results shows
<br />
it is meaningful to expect such coherence from the constraint of Church
<br />
thesis.
<br />
<br />I think your thought experiment illustrates quite well the distinction
<br />
between the first person and the first person plural povs.
<br />
It is true that sometimes I call the owner of the third person point
<br />
of view a &quot;third person&quot;. You make me think that this language abuse
<br />
can be misleading, thanks.
<br />
Your experience illustrates also very well CS, (it is'nt comp sex ;)
<br />
<br />I have a question (related to the unsolvable question of the possible
<br />
number of persons). Would you say Juliet has survived in case a long
<br />
&quot;time&quot; after the &quot;normal&quot; explosion she get total amnesia, and believes
<br />
she is ... George Levy?
<br />
<br /><br />Bruno
<br />
<br /><br />(*) This is roughly speaking the Lewis-Stalnaker semantics for the
<br />
conterfactuals, like in Hardegree 1976, and in James J. Joyce book on causal
<br />
decision theory suggested by Wei. People interested can also read
<br />
the book &quot;Inquiry&quot; by Stalnaker.
