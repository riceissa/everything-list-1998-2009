<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; selectively eliminating &quot;poverty-branches&quot; (or at least making them

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; observerless) by linking them to suicide mechanisms. That will have

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the effect of increasing the consentration of wealthy brances. This 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is somewhat analogous to killing the poor people in the world in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; order to thereby raise the average standard of living.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think this is a good way to think about the situation. But regardless of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; how you think about it, there is something wrong with a theory that says
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; playing Russian roulette is rational.
</em><br />
<br />What is rational for you to do depends on what your goals are. If the 
<br />
only thing we cared about was the average standard of living in the 
<br />
world, then it might indeed be rational to kill off the poor. 
<br />
Similarly, if the only thing you cared about was the average 
<br />
prosperity of future continuations of your present persona, then it 
<br />
might be rational for you to kill off the poorest 99% of your future 
<br />
continuations. The lesson to draw is, I think, that these averages 
<br />
are not the only thing we care for; the number of people/personal 
<br />
continuations enjoying a given standard of living is also important. 
<br />
If we assume that that is part of our goals, then the Russian 
<br />
roulette option is no longer recommended.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If nothing else the number of people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; who believe the theory will dwindle very quickly.
</em><br />
<br />I agree.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The P(X|Y) notation comes from Tegmark's TOE paper. It means the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probability that I will perceive X after subjective time t, given that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I've perceived Y so far.
</em><br />
<br />But what does it mean that &quot;I will perceive X&quot;? Does it mean that 
<br />
there is at least one continuation (a copy perhaps) of my present 
<br />
self that will perceive X? Or does it mean that, if we 
<br />
randomly choose one future continuation from the set of all 
<br />
future continuations of myself, this random sample will 
<br />
perceive X? In the latter case, we might want to count the number of 
<br />
future continuations of myself that perceive A and divide this number 
<br />
by the total number of future continuations of myself. The resulting 
<br />
ratio would be the probability of &quot;I will perceive X.&quot; in this 
<br />
sense.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; A problem with the AUH is that it is not at all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; clear how to define probabilities for general propositions, or that such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probabilities would mean anything. This is especially true for my more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; radical AUH which says binary strings are the fundamental objects that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have independent existence, and universes are interpretations of certain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; collections of strings. How would you define the probability for &quot;There
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will be n instances of experiences of type A.&quot;? 
</em><br />
<br />In ordinary contexs, one would say &quot;There is a 34% probability that 
<br />
the world is such-and-such. And if the world is such-and-such, then 
<br />
that means there are 326 instances of experiences of type A (i.e. 326 
<br />
brains in that specific state.&quot;.
<br />
<br />On the AUH then there would be a 100% probability that there are 326 
<br />
instances of experiences of type A (say -- we set to aside for the 
<br />
moment the problem that results from the fact that the AUH seems to 
<br />
imply that the number is infinite). What you can do, given the AUH, 
<br />
is to count what fraction of future continuations of yourself 
<br />
perceive A. This fraction could perhaps then be interpreted by you as 
<br />
your subjective probability that you will wake up next moring and 
<br />
perceive A.
<br />
<br />(This still leaves us with the problem of how to deal with the 
<br />
infinities.)
