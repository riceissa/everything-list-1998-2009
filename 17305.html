<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm afraid you are solipsist.
</em><br />
<br />Ha!  Ouch!  But it's not quite as simple as that.  I don't deny that
<br />
there MAY be something that causes consciousness, BUT if there
<br />
is...this ultimately doesn't matter.  In the final view, the
<br />
conclusion is the same...consciousness experience just is what it is.
<br />
<br />Further, I definitely don't deny the existence of conscious
<br />
experiences other than mine.  And there's nothing I've said that
<br />
implies this.  In fact, I've explicitly said the exact opposite in a
<br />
response to David in this very thread.
<br />
<br />So, if I'm a solipsist, so are you, and so is basically everyone
<br />
EXCEPT those who believe (somehow) in libertarian free will.  Which
<br />
you and I and David at least have all disavowed as being a nonsensical
<br />
concept.
<br />
<br />SO, in our last couple of emails we focused on the explanatory
<br />
gap...which is really just the wakeup call that something's out of
<br />
whack with our view of reality.  It's not part of the core argument
<br />
I'm making.
<br />
<br />My main argument is not even really *against* your theory...my
<br />
argument relates to what your theory means if it is true (which it may
<br />
be, who knows):
<br />
<br />If numbers and their relations exist timeless and uncaused, and our
<br />
consciousness is (to use your description) the view from inside a
<br />
local summary of the infinities of computational relations between all
<br />
the numbers, THEN our conscious experiences are also objectively
<br />
timeless, aren't they?  And so they can all be viewed as existing
<br />
simultaneously, even if they have the subjective feel of being
<br />
sequential when experienced &quot;from the inside&quot;.
<br />
<br />If these conscious experiences all exist necessarily as a consequence
<br />
of &quot;the infinities of computational relations between all the numbers&quot;
<br />
(TIOCRBAN), then they just exist.  There is no reason that TIOCRBAN
<br />
have this conscious aspect, it's just the way arithmetical reality is.
<br />
<br />So, why do you feel the desire to understand conscious experience?
<br />
Well, this desire is a timeless and eternal consequence of TIOCRBAN.
<br />
This conscious experience of desire that you feel in this moment has
<br />
always existed and will always exist in TIOCRBAN.
<br />
<br />Will you succeed in your quest?  Trick question!  The future already
<br />
exists!  If you succeed, this success already exists timelessly and
<br />
eternally in TIOCRBAN.  In fact, maybe a &quot;Bruno experience&quot; of success
<br />
AND of failure both exist somewhere within TIOCRBAN.
<br />
<br />The entire collection of Bruno's conscious experiences just exist.
<br />
And they just are what they are.  This feeling of effort that you have
<br />
of working towards your goal...it just exists.  There is no effort,
<br />
only the experience of effort.  The feeling of understanding when you
<br />
learn something new?  There is no understanding OR learning...there is
<br />
only the experience of these things, caused by the intrinsic nature of
<br />
TIOCRBAN, and like TIOCRBAN existing timelessly and eternally.
<br />
<br />If TIOCRBAN causes your conscious experiences, then TIOCRBAN do all of
<br />
the work.  Your conscious experience is just along for the ride as an
<br />
aspect, a facet, of TIOCRBAN.
<br />
<br />Further, if TIOCRBAN just exists, uncaused and timeless, then your
<br />
experiences also just exist as an aspect of TIOCRBAN and thus also
<br />
uncaused and timeless.
<br />
<br />If there is no reason behind the nature of TIOCRBAN, then there is no
<br />
reason behind the nature of your conscious experiences.  No
<br />
explanation is possible, only description.
<br />
<br />Right?  How could it be otherwise?
