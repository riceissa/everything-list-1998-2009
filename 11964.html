</em><br />
<br />I've been away for a bit and I can't pretend to have absorbed all the
<br />
nuances of this thread but I have some observations.
<br />
<br />1. To coherently conceive that a PZ which is a *functional* (not
<br />
physical) duplicate can nonetheless lack PC - and for this to make any
<br />
necessary difference to its possible behaviour - we must believe that
<br />
the PZ thereby lacks some crucial information.
<br />
2. Such missing information consequently can't be captured by any
<br />
purely *functional* description (however defined) of the non-PZ
<br />
original.
<br />
3. Hence having PC must entail the possession and utilisation of
<br />
information which *in principle* is not functionally (3-person)
<br />
describable, but which, in *instantiating* 3-person data, permits it to
<br />
be contextualised, differentiated, and actioned in a manner not
<br />
reproducible by any purely functional (as opposed to constructable)
<br />
analog.
<br />
<br />Now this seems to tally with what Colin is saying about the crucial
<br />
distinction between the *content* of PC and whatever is producing it.
<br />
It implies that whatever is producing it isn't reducible to sharable
<br />
3-person quanta. This seems also (although I may be confused) to square
<br />
with Bruno's claims for COMP that the sharable 3-person emerges from
<br />
(i.e. is instantiated by) the 1-person level. As he puts it -'quanta
<br />
are sharable qualia'. IOW, the observable - quanta - is the set of
<br />
possible transactions between functionally definable entities
<br />
instantiated at a deeper level of representation (the constitutive
<br />
level). This is why we see brains not minds.
<br />
<br />It seems to me that the above, or something like it, must be true if we
<br />
are to take the lessons of the PZ to heart. IOW, the information
<br />
instantiated by PC is in principle inaccessible to a PZ because the
<br />
specification of the PZ as a purely functional 3-person analog is
<br />
unable to capture the necessary constitutive information. The
<br />
specification is at the wrong level. It's like trying to physically
<br />
generate a new computer by simply running more and more complex
<br />
programs on the old one. It's only by *constructing* a physical
<br />
duplicate (or some equivalent physical analog) that the critical
<br />
constitutive - or instantiating - information can be captured.
<br />
<br />We have to face it.  We won't find PC 'out there' - if we could, it
<br />
would (literally) be staring us in the face. I think what Colin is
<br />
trying to do is to discover how we can still do science on PC despite
<br />
the fact that whatever is producing it isn't capturable by 'the
<br />
observables', but rather only in the direct process and experience of
<br />
observation itself.

<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; in the sense that it is fully functional.

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, adaptive behaviour -- dealing with novelty --- is functioning.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Yes - but I'm not talking about merely functioning. I am talking about the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; specialised function called scientific behaviour in respect of the natural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; world outside.You assume, but have no shown, that it is in a class of its own.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The adaptive behaviour you speak of is adaptivity in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; respect of adherence or otherwise to an internal rule set, not adaptation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in respect of the natural world outside.False dichotomy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Any adaptive system adapts under the influence under the influence of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; external impacts, and there are always some underlying rules, if only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the rules of physics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; BTW 'Adaptive' means change, change means novelty has occurred. If you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; have no phenopmenality you must already have a rule as to how to adapt to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; all change - ergo you know everything already.Rules to adapt to change don't have to stipulate novel inputs in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; advance.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I spent tens of thousands of hours designing, building,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; benchtesting and commissioning zombies. On the benchtop I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; have pretended to be their environment and they had no 'awareness'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; they weren't in their real environment. It's what makes bench
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;  testing possible. The universe of the zombies was the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; universe of my programming. The zombies could not tell if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; they were in the factory or on the benchtop. That's why I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; can empathise so well with zombie life. I have been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; literally swatted by zombies (robot/cranes and other machines)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; like I wasn't there....scares the hell
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; out of you! Some even had 'vision systems' but were still
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; blind. so....yes the zombie can 'behave'. What I am claiming
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; is they cannot do _science_ i.e. they cannot behave
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; scientifically. This is a very specific claim, not a general
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; claim.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; I see nothing to support it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I have already showed you conclusive empirical evidence you can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; demonstrate on yourself.No you haven't. Zombies aren't blind in the sense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of not being able to see at all,. You are just juggling
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different definitions of &quot;Zombie&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Perhaps the 'zombie room' will do it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;- it's all the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; same - action potential pulse trains traveling from sensors to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; brain.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; No, it's not all the same. Its coded in a very complex way. It's like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; saying the information in you computer is &quot;all the same -- its all ones
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and zeros&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; yes you got it - all coded....I am talking about action potential pulse
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; trains. They are all the same general class. Burst mode/Continuous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; mode,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; all the same basic voltage waveform, overshoot, refratory period...LTP,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; LTD, afterhyperpolarisation.... all the same class for sight, sound,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; taste, imagination, touch, thirst, orgasm etc etc... coded messages
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; travelling all the way from the periphery and into the brain. They are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the same...and..
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; They need to be interpreted an contextualised against other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; other information. How does that lead to the conclusion
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; that zombies can't do science?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; They can do science on their sensory data only.All the data in the human phenomenal view originated in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; senses. Unless you are appealing to clairvoyance.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; They have no a-priori
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; method for applying any interpretationThere is no reason why they should lack apriori
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; methods are behaviour, behaviour is function.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; as to its context in the natural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; world that originated the sensory feeds.Absent clairvoyance, we contextualise one sensory feed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; against another. You have not made it clear
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; why that requires phenomenality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; If you like: it can do the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; science of its boundary. Even that is a stretch - for it has no idea it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; has a body or any boundary.Blindsight can reach beyond the boundary.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; They cannot contextualise NOVELTY with respect to the external world,Once more, asserted without argument/
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; merely against the non-phenomenal rule-set they have concted.You have no evidence that humans use anything more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; grand than a &quot;concocted rule set&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; They cannot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; do science on the natural world - but they can do science on zombie sense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; data and internal rule-sets, whose correpondence with any sort of external
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; world is a complete mystery.Humans use educated guess-work -- conscious and unconscious --
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to relate sense data to an external world. Why shouldn't zombies?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  If any of the rules they concoct happen to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; correpond to the a natural world law it'd be an accident and they'd never
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; know it.Nonsense. They would no whether their &quot;concocted&quot; rules worked
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or not in the same way humans do -- their rules would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fail to predict. They might fail to predict
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unconscious sense data instead of failing to predict conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perceptions. but the two are in sync anyway.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; None of it says anything about WHY the input did what it did. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; causality outside the zombie is MISSING from these signals.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; It's missing from the individual signals. But we must
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; be able to build up a picture of the external causes on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; the basis of the combined information. We
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; don't have anything else to go on. Pheneomenality is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; not an extra source of information that clairvoyantly tells
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; you where each photon originated.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Yes it is an extra source. That is the whole point. The fact that you call
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; it 'clairvoyance' merely means that it is unknown. Why is it so impossoble
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to think that your current understanding of the universe may be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; incomplete?That is not how phenomenality is generally understood,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and there is no evidence for it. That means you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; haven't &quot;proven&quot; anything about Zombies, since you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; need to assume something quite strange and not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; widely accepted about phenomenality in order
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to arrive at your conclusion. Anyone can avoid your conclusion
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by rejecting your assumption.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; There is nothing supernatural going on. The reality of phenomenality is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; stark. Your neurons have a way of access enough information to constrcut
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; phenomenal scenes.Yes. I am disputing that the process requires extra information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that doesn't arrive through the senses (or the genes).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; They do it. They are real. There is far more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; information inthe phenopmenal scenes than arises from the sensing.Nonsense. The brain is a filtration system. The is a lot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *less* information available to consciousness than comes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in through the senses.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; inability to see how that may be does not negate it as a reality.The fact that there is no evidence for it negates it as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; In the mathematical proof I gave the extra information is built into P(.),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; which the zombie does not have.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; They have no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; intrinsic sensation to them either. The only useful
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; information is the body knows implicitly where they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; came from..which still is not enough because:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Try swapping the touch nerves for 2 fingers. You 'touch'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; with one and feel the touch happen on the other.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The touch sensation is created as phenomenal consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; in the brain using the measurement, not the signal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; measurement itself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Now think about the touch..the same sensation of touch
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; could have been generated by a feather or a cloth or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; another finger or a passing car. That
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; context is what phenomenal consciousness provides.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; It creates it out of information that is also available to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; zombie.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; No it doesn't. The information the zombie has is &quot;neurons a,b,c,d, fired
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in finger tip'. That's it. The zombie and the human both have that.Yes. And humans make the hypothesis that a particular pattern of firing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in those particular neurons was probably caused by a thing called a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;feather&quot; , which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correlates with various visual data. There is nothing to stop
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a zombie doing the same.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; It doesn't create new information ex nihilo.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Of course not. It creates new information by a mechaniusm you don;t

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; understand that is perfectly natural. &quot;ex nihilo&quot; actually means it can;t
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; do it based on what I know...not that it is impossible.Mechanism is function. If humans have that mechanism , so do zombies.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Yes but how is it to do anything to contextualise the input other than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; correlate it with other signals?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Why would it need to ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; re robot...now do science on a signal and use the signal to make a

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; elsewhere away from/outside the robot. It can't. It's blind, deaf,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; can't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; taste or smell or touch.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; It can interact with its environment: you have already conceded that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; No. It's body boundary (which it has no means to intuit) can interact with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; whatever impacts with it. That's it. Beyond the boundary? Multiple
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; external worlds could present the same stimulus and the zombie would never
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; know.The same is true of humans. We can be fooled. we don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exist in a state of complete certainty about what is causing our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; phenomena, and we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't have magical clairvoyant powers.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The main fact is that the zombie does not have sensation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; at all and that as a result it cannot do science on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; world outside the zombie.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; A zombie has sensors which can alter its behaviour in response
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; to changes in the environment.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;It doesn't even know there is a world to do science on.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Why not? Because it can't paint a causal picture of where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; its signals came form? Why not?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Where does this notion of 'causality' come from? You. Not it. You are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; projecting your internal life into the numbers the zombie has. Stop it!My notion of causality is function/behaviour. It is not a phenomenon --
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not a taste or colour, it does not seem like anything.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So my zombie counterpart has it as well.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; All it can do is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; correlate measurements with each other, measurements that could have come
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; from anywhere and the zombie can never tell from where.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Why not? Surely it only takes a kind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; for information analysis to tell that a set of signals
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; probably came form a cubic object, or whatever.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Where has the zombie got any idea of 'cube', space, distance?If it is a functional duplicate of person, it will have them
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; since they are functional.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You! Stop doing that. You keep grounding the zombie in your own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; experiences and assuming it can do what you can. It has no idea of space,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; time ,matter, causality, the natural world itself....NOTHING.So you say. But the standard definition is the a zombie
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is a functional duplicate. You seem to be talking past
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everybody on this point.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I have great empathy for the poor zombie! Indeed I am starting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; to realise that it may be my practical training which has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; enabled me to better understand the zombie
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; I am not sure you grasp the standard meaning of &quot;philosophical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Zombie&quot; at all.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I couldn't care less about the philosopghical zombie.If you are not talking about philosophical zombies,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it is misleading to use the term.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Who ever said
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; philosophy had a patent on the concept!It's a question of communication. Language is based on shared meanings.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; If you like dump the whole label
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and replace every occurrence of the word zombie with &quot;a human but with a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; brain not capable of phenomenal consciousness&quot;.If you do that, it is still far form clear
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that your claims would follow. Would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a human without PC have a concept of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;cause&quot;? Well, they wouldn't have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; learnt it phenomenally..but maybe they would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have learnt it unphenomenally...or maybe it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would be innate ... maybe it is innate in humans...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Using your definition of &quot;zombie&quot;, the situation is jut unclear.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; What point is there in bothering with it. The philosophical zombie is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ASSUMED to be equivalent! This is failure before you even start!If you can show that the idea is self-contradictory, you can prove
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; wrong and it's proven wrong because there is a conclusively logically and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; empirically provable function that the zombie cannot possibly do without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; phenomenality: SCIENCE.You haven't shown that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The philosophical zombie would have to know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; everything a-priori, which makes science meaningless.PZs only lack phenomenality. They don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessarily lack the ability to take in information.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; There is no novelty
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to a philosophical zombie. It would have to anticipate all forms of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; randomness or chaotic behaviour.... NUTS.Assuming &quot;no phenomenality&quot; means &quot;no sensory perception
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whatsoever&quot;. Unwarrantedly.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I am only intersted in the state where there is no phenomenal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; consciousness and the role it has in science. You can have the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; philosophical zombie - it's an oxymoron and you're welcome to it. You can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; let it define your world if you like - I'd prefer to let the natural world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; be my guide.Why use the word if you don't like the concept?
