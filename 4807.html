Dear David,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very good post! I would like to point you to a proposal that Vaughan Pratt discusses in several of his papers found here:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://chu.stanford.edu/guide.html">http://chu.stanford.edu/guide.html</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="http://chu.stanford.edu/guide.html#ratmech">http://chu.stanford.edu/guide.html#ratmech</a>
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic idea goes like this:
<br />
<br />A causes B if and only if the information of B implies the information of A.
<br />
<br />or A =&gt; B iff A* &lt;- B*
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This goes into a commutation diagram that can be chained:
<br />
<br />... A ----&gt; B -----&gt; C ...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|          |           |
<br />
... A* &lt;== B*&lt; == C* ...
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea is that physical events chain together only if their representations imply each other and the &quot;arrows&quot; of &quot;causation&quot; and &quot;logical implication&quot; go in opposite directions. In this way we can make sense of how the past is &quot;so well behaved&quot; while the future is wide open to possibilities that include pathologies. BTW, this idea is very much in line with Wheeler's &quot;Surprise 20 Questions&quot;.
<br />
<br />Kindest regards,
<br />
<br />Stephen

&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject: Is the universe computable?
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In the words of Tegmark, let's assume that the physical world is completely mathematical; and everything that exists mathematically exists physically.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been thinking along these lines since my days at university - where it occurred to me that any alternative is mystical.  However,  the problem remains to explain induction - ie the predictability of the universe.   Why is it that the laws of physics can be depended on when looking into the future, if we are merely a &quot;mathematical construction&quot; - like a simulation running on a computer.  It seems to me that in the ensemble of all possible computer simulations (with no limits on the complexity of the &quot;laws&quot;) the ones that remain well behaved after any given time step in the simulation have measure zero.  
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the &quot;source code&quot; for the simulation of our universe, it would seem to be possible to add some extra instructions that test for a certain condition to be met in order to tamper with the simulation.   It would seem likely that there will exist simulations that match our own up to a certain point in time, but then diverge.  Eg it is possible for a simulation to have a rule that an object will suddenly manifest itself at a particular time and place.   The simulated conscious beings in such a universe would be surprised to find that induction fails at the moment the simulation diverges.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, at each time step in a simulation the state vector can take different paths according to slightly different software programs with special cases that only trigger at that moment in time.  It seems that a universe will continually split into vast numbers of child universes, in a manner reminiscent of the MWI.  However there is a crucial difference - most of these spin off universes will have bizarre things happen.  It is difficult to see how a computable system can be tamper proof.  How can a past which has been well behaved prevent strange things from happening in the future?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In the thread &quot;a possible paradox&quot;, there was talk about a vanishingly small number of &quot;magical&quot; universes where strange things happen.  However, it seems to me that the bigger risk is that a &quot;normal&quot; universe like ours will be the atypical in the ensemble!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;A possible argument is to invoke the anthropic principle - and suggest that our universe is predictable in order for SAS's to evolve and perceive that predictability.  However,  that predictability only needs to be a trick - played on the inhabitants for long enough to develop intelligence.  There is no reason why the trick needs to continue to be played.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that the requirement of a tamper-proof physics is an extremely powerful principle.   For example, we deduce that SAS's only exist in mathematical systems that aren't computable.   In particular our Universe is not computable.  
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;- which is what Penrose has been saying.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I have assumed that non-computability coincides with being tamper-proof but this is far from clear.  For example, it is conceivable that the Universe is a Turing machine running an infinite computation (cf Tipler's Omega point), and &quot;awareness&quot; only emerges in the totality of this infinite computation.  Perhaps our awareness is a manifestation of advanced waves sent backwards in time from the Omega Point!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it's important to distinguish between an underlying mathematical system, and the formal system that tries to describe it.   I think this is a crucial distinction.   For example, the real number system can be defined uniquely by a finite set of axioms.   Uniqueness is (formally) provable - in the sense that it can be shown that an isomorphism exists between all systems that satisfy the axioms.    However the real numbers are uncountably infinite - and therefore are very poorly understood using formal mathematics - which is limited to only a countably infinite set of statements about them.   So formal mathematics should be regarded as an imperfect and coarse tool which only gives us limited understanding of a complicated beast!  This is after all what Godel's incompleteness theorem tells us.  
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not surprising that a computer will never exhibit awareness - because it is merely using the techniques of formal mathematics, and not tapping into the &quot;good stuff&quot;.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
