<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (if they're using radio), and that's why all we can detect is noise.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in a finite simulation?
</em><br />
<br />I don't know that multiverse concepts explain the Fermi paradox, but
<br />
they do cast it in a different light.
<br />
<br />As Bruno points out, our first-person experiences could be created by
<br />
many different kinds of programs, corresponding to different &quot;realities&quot;.
<br />
It could be that everything is pretty much as it seems.  Or perhaps we
<br />
are living in a simulation controlled by aliens, or our descendants,
<br />
or robots.  Or it's even possible that everything is an illusion and we
<br />
are in effect imagining it.  All of these possibilities contribute to the
<br />
measure of our experiences.  So in some sense it must be simultaneously
<br />
true that we are in a simulation, and that we are not in a simulation.
<br />
Both situations exist in the multiverse and both contribute to the
<br />
reality of our experiences.
<br />
<br />The hard part of the Fermi question still remains.  It might be stated,
<br />
why is the universe seemingly so large and so empty?  In multiverse
<br />
terms, why is the measure of observers who live in large, empty universes
<br />
so large, compared to the measure of observers who live in universes
<br />
teeming with life?  For if the measure of the latter observers were much
<br />
greater than the measure of the former, we would be highly unlikely to
<br />
find ourselves one of that very small set of observers who see sparse
<br />
universes.
<br />
<br />(Of course, I am skipping past the various conventional explanations that
<br />
have been offered which allow for the universe to in fact be full of life
<br />
but for it somehow not to be observable.  Those have not been generally
<br />
found to be convincing so we should focus on the hard part.  Also,
<br />
note that while I write &quot;life&quot; for short I really mean intelligent life.)
<br />
<br />A while back I speculated as follows.  Presumably there are laws of
<br />
physics which would lead to very densely populated universes.  And we
<br />
know that there are laws that lead to very sparse universes, like
<br />
the ones we live in.  All universes exist; all laws are instantiated.
<br />
<br />For various reasons many of us argue that universes with simpler laws
<br />
are likely to be more common, to have larger measure.  Now, we know that
<br />
if the laws are too simple, life cannot exist.  Trivial universes are
<br />
not living ones.  Presumably, as the laws get more complex, we pass a
<br />
threshold where life can start to exist.  But perhaps it is reasonable
<br />
to assume that we will first find laws where life can barely exist,
<br />
before we find laws where life is very common.  If so, then there is a
<br />
band of complexity where universes at the simple end of this band have
<br />
very sparse intelligent life, and universes at the complex end have very
<br />
dense intelligent life.
<br />
<br />Then, to be consistent with our observations, we have to conclude that
<br />
this band is quite wide - that universes that are just barely complex
<br />
enough for life have much simpler laws than universes that are teeming
<br />
with life.  That is how we would explain the fact that we find ourselves
<br />
in one of the first kind.  Their boost from having simpler laws must
<br />
outweigh the increase in numbers of intelligent life forms in the more
<br />
complex universes.
<br />
<br />I read that the universe is estimated to have about 10^23 stars.
<br />
A universe with a high density of intelligent life might therefore be
<br />
10^23 times more densely populated than ours.  This is about 2^75 times.
<br />
Therefore we would predict that the physical laws necessary to create
<br />
such a densely populated universe would be at least 75 bits longer than
<br />
the simpler laws of our own universe.
<br />
<br />This is a prediction of multiverse theory as I interpret it.  If it should
<br />
turn out that there are very simple sets of laws that would create very
<br />
numerous observers, then that would contradict the theory in this form.
