<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mind is what my brain does?
</em><br />
<br />Where I'm trying to get is that there is no explanation for our
<br />
conscious experience.  It just is.
<br />
<br />So all that we have to work with are our observations, plus our innate
<br />
reasoning processes.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, these two things are not enough to determine what, if
<br />
anything, really exists outside of our experience.
<br />
<br />At best, we can take our observations and apply our innate reasoning
<br />
processes to produce theoretical models that are consistent with what
<br />
we have observed.
<br />
<br />Kant covered all this I think.
<br />
<br />So first, the theories on offer, carried to their logical conclusions,
<br />
don't take you anywhere.  They all hit explanatory dead ends:  The
<br />
universe came into being uncaused, for no reason, and everything else
<br />
follows.  Or the universe exists eternally, but with no explanation
<br />
for why this should be or why it takes the form that it does.  Or the
<br />
platonically existing infinities of computational relations between
<br />
all the numbers do not just represent but inexplicably &quot;cause&quot; our
<br />
conscious experience of a material universe.  Why?  Because that's the
<br />
way it is.
<br />
<br />Second, even if any of these things are true, there's no way that
<br />
*from inside that system* we can justify our belief that the theory is
<br />
true (as opposed to just consistent with conscious observation).
<br />
<br />And third, even if true, the bottom line for all of them is,
<br />
&quot;conscious experience just is what it is&quot;.
<br />
<br />For instance:  Bits of matter in particular configurations &quot;cause&quot;
<br />
conscious experience.  Fine.  So what deeper meaning can we draw from
<br />
this?  None.  In this case the bits of matter being in the particular
<br />
configurations that they are in is just a bare fact.  The universe,
<br />
considered in its entirety, just is that way.  So the conscious
<br />
experience that goes with that particle configuration just is a bare
<br />
fact.
<br />
<br />But, by all means, continue with your theoretical system building.  We
<br />
have to do something to pass the time, after all.
<br />
<br />But, to revisit your original question:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Where are you trying to get?
</em><br />
<br />Okay, I gave you my answer.  So, where are YOU trying to get?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;If you make yourself small enough you can avoid responsibility for everything.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;        --- Daniel Dennett, in Elbow Room
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Every word in your quote, except &quot;for&quot;, has to be considered in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; context of Dennett's special terminology.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Seems prefectly straightforward to me.  If you define yourself as something apart from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical processes that move your arms and legs then you avoid responsibility for what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your arms and legs do.
</em><br />
<br />Right.  &quot;If you define yourself as...&quot;.  Well sure.  That makes it
<br />
easy, and that's what Dennett does.  Just makes up arbitrary
<br />
definitions that suit his ends.
<br />
<br />If things were that way, that's the way they'd be alright.
<br />
<br />But, the question is, are things that way?  And if you say so, what's
<br />
your full reasoning?  I mean your reasoning that takes into account
<br />
the entire ontological stack of what exists, of course -- since I
<br />
don't see any discussing an arbitrary subset of what exists that
<br />
you've conveniently carved out to make some rhetorical point about
<br />
what seems perfectly straightforward to you given some particular
<br />
context.
