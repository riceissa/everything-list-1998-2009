<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; What I argued was that it would be easier to find the trace of a person's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; thoughts in a universe where he had a physically continuous record than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; where there were discontinuities (easier in the sense that a smaller
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; program would suffice).  In my framework, this means that the universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; would contribute more measure to people who had continuous lives than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; people who teleported.  Someone whose life ended at the moment of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; teleportation would have a higher measure than someone who survived
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the event.  Therefore, I would view teleportation as reducing measure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; similarly to doing something that had a risk of dying.  I would try to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; avoid it, unless there were compensating benefits (as indeed might be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the case, just as people willingly accept the risk of dying by driving
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to work, because of the compensating benefits).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You can say that &quot;by definition&quot; the person survives, but then, you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; can say anything by definition.  I guess the question is, what is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; reasoning behind the definition.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK, this is the old ASSA versus RSSA distinction. But leaving this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argument aside, I don't see how teleportation could be analogous to a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; risky, measure reducing activity if it seemed to be a reliable process
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from a third person perspective. If someone plays Russian Roulette, we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; both agree that from a third person perspective, we are likely to observe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a dead body eventually. But with teleportation (destructive, to one place)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is a 1:1 ratio between pre-experiment subjects and post-experiment
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subjects from a third person perspective. Are you suggesting that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; predicted drop in measure will have no third person observable effect?
</em><br />
<br />First, I tend to think that the phrase &quot;third person observable&quot; is
<br />
something of a contradiction.  Observation is a first-person activity.
<br />
I would prefer to think of third person effects as simply the physical
<br />
record of events.
<br />
<br />In this case, there will definitely be a third person effect.  Having
<br />
someone teleport is a third-person difference from not having them
<br />
teleport.  We are talking about two cases here that are third-person
<br />
distinguishable, with very different physical histories, hence it is
<br />
plausible that there be different subjective first-person effects.
<br />
<br />As far as the comparison with Russian Roulette, if someone only plays it
<br />
once, there might not be a third person difference.  Yet I would argue
<br />
his measure was reduced (in the multiverse).
<br />
<br />Really, when we are talking about third person records, all we have
<br />
is the actual sequence of events that occurs.  Suppose someone plays
<br />
Russian Roulette multiple times.  In this universe, perhaps we see them
<br />
pull the trigger five times and survive, and on the sixth pull they die.
<br />
That subjective history, of playing RR six times, is instantiated in
<br />
this universe.  This universe contributes measure to that history.
<br />
<br />Other universes, not observable to us, may have him die after different
<br />
trials.  Each of those contributes measure to subjective histories that
<br />
end at different points.  The result is that the measure of his lifespan
<br />
is reduced at each trigger pull, but that in any single third-person
<br />
universe that reduction in measure is unobservable.  Instead we see no
<br />
change until the final trigger pull.
<br />
<br />Consider this example: someone commits to killing himself if you die, and
<br />
now you play Russian Roulette yourself.  Each time you pull the trigger
<br />
you reduce his measure, that of the other person who will kill himself
<br />
if you die.  But you will never observe him dying (in the first-person
<br />
sense).  This is a case of an unobservable measure decrease which you
<br />
might nevertheless believe in.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; As far as Lee's suggestion that people could be dying thousands of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; times a second, my framework does not allow for arbitrary statements
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; like that.  Given a physical circumstance, we can calculate what happens.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It's not just arbitrary what we choose to say about life and death.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; We can calculate the measure of different subjective life experiences,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; based on the physical record.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; If we wanted to create a physical record where this framework would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; be compatible with saying that people die often, it would be necessary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to physically teleport people thousands of times a second.  Or perhaps
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the same thing could be done by freezing people for a substantial time,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; reviving them for a thousandth of a second, then re-freezing them again
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; for a while, etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; If we consider the practical implications of such experiments I don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; think it is so implausible to view them as being worse than living a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; single, connected, subjective life.  It would be quite difficult to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; interact in a meaningful way with the world under such circumstances.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Assuming it could be done seamlessly, how would it make any difference? If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you believe the important aspect of our consciousness resides in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; activity at neural synapses, this is exactly what is happening. They
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are constantly falling apart and being repaired in an energy-requiring
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; process, such that the matter comprising our synapses completely turns
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; over in a matter of minutes. It's just the basic brain template that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is maintained over time, and even that changes as we change. If you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could somehow gold plate your neurones so that the normal turnover of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter due to wear and tear stops, and only the turnover due to thinking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different thoughts occurs, do you think it would make any subjective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; difference? What if the turnover increased, or it happened all at once
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in bursts rather than gradually, all the while maintaining the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; basic structure as occurs normally?
</em><br />
<br />Yes, I think these physiological differences might make a difference in
<br />
measure, although it would probably be small.  Why would you believe
<br />
otherwise?  Would you suggest that no physiological change could make
<br />
a difference?  The basic functionalist/computationalist paradigm?
<br />
<br />I have argued before some problems with functionalism, and of course there
<br />
is a vast philosophical literature pro and con.  The most basic problem
<br />
is that functionalism assumes that there is meaning to the question of
<br />
whether a given physical system implements a given abstract computation,
<br />
and IMO no one has ever given a satisfactory method to answer this.
<br />
<br />In practice, as long as you stick fairly close to conventional
<br />
implementations, you're probably OK.  Your gold-plated neurons are
<br />
not a big deal.  People are still interacting with the real world.  But
<br />
computationalism commits you to far more exotic kinds of implementations.
<br />
Uploaded brains running millions of times faster than regular ones,
<br />
for example.  Or brains scattered across the universe exchanging data
<br />
at incredibly slow paces.  Brains which have been suspended - are they
<br />
still alive, still &quot;conscious&quot;, or not?  The guy who gets teleported every
<br />
millisecond - what is his life like, exposed to a kaleidoscopic of images
<br />
and realities that would be impossible to meaningfully interact with?
<br />
<br />To roughly translate my mathematical principles into words, our subjective
<br />
lives gain reality from being embedded and instantiated in real worlds.
<br />
As our connection to reality becomes fuzzier and less direct, the
<br />
degree to which we can be said to gain measure from those realities
<br />
is diminished.  And likewise, as the instantiation is made simpler and
<br />
more solidly grounded to reality, measure increases.  This is based
<br />
on the mathematical principle of conditional Kolmogorov complexity,
<br />
where we ask how short a program could be to output the trace of a given
<br />
subjective experience, starting from the third-person physical record.
<br />
<br />When we come up with these exotic thought experiments that make the
<br />
concept of implementation fuzzy, it makes sense that measure would
<br />
be reduced.  The more we break the connection between physical reality
<br />
and a straightforward implementation of a logical calculation, the less
<br />
measure that reality will contribute to the calculation.  This is what
<br />
I see going on in some of these experiments.
