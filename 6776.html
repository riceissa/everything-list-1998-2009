<em class="quotelev1">&gt;brainstorming.
</em><br />
<br />To me, &quot;brainstorming&quot; just means any creative attempt to come up with new 
<br />
tentative speculations about solutions to a problem. Since Einstein's ideas 
<br />
cannot possibly have been anything but tentative and speculative before the 
<br />
theory of general relativity was worked out, then of course he came up with 
<br />
them through brainstorming. How else would he have come up with them, 
<br />
logical deductions from a set of axioms whose truth was totally certain? 
<br />
Divine revelation?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;You're the one that &gt;called the ideas discussed here often as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;half-formed&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, and I would define any idea that has not been made into a fully-worked 
<br />
out, complete theory as &quot;half-formed&quot;. Thus, until Einstein worked out the 
<br />
full tensor equations of general relativity, his ideas were half-formed, by 
<br />
definition. Perhaps you woud define the term &quot;half-formed&quot; differently, but 
<br />
that's all I meant by that.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The problem I used to have (I'm too busy to &gt;even give darn anymore) is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;when ideas are put out that &gt;don't seem to any thought behind them, prior 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to being offered.
</em><br />
<br />What if the person has thought about them, but doesn't know themselves 
<br />
whether they're any good, and wants feedback from others? Are you suggesting 
<br />
that before making any proposal, we should always feel 100% certain in our 
<br />
own minds about whether the proposal is correct or not?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Like my still unanswered question to Saibal about how people who aren't 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;really&quot; there but exist in &gt;Nash's head can still be considered real in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;our universe&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />Maybe he didn't know the answer himself--is that a bad thing? Anyway, one 
<br />
could argue that simulations in someone's brain are just as real as 
<br />
simulations on a computer--do you think A.I. shouldn't be considered real 
<br />
beings in our universe? Of course, I don't think the &quot;simulations&quot; of 
<br />
characters in a schizophrenic mind or in a dream are really being simulated 
<br />
at anything like the same level of detail as a genuine A.I. would be.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;That's what I'm talking about. That's a fully formed idea with absolutely 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;no basis in the objective world &gt;that was just put out there like it meant 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;something, when in fact it's ridiculous.
</em><br />
<br />Whatever gave you the idea that it was a &quot;fully formed idea&quot;? Do you think 
<br />
Saibal believed he had a complete theory of how the brain of a schizophrenic 
<br />
simulates the imaginary characters he interacts with, for example?
<br />
