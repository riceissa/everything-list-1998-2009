<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There have always been two ways to interpret the interrelationship

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between the physical world and our minds.
</em><br />
<br />There's a lot more than two ways.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The first one is to consider
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the physical world to be fundamental; from this perspective, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appearance of the mind is to be understood with the help of some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; neurological theory that maps physical states of the brain to states
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the mind or observer moments.
</em><br />
<br />Not neccesserily.  There are several possible variations on taking the
<br />
physical world to be fundamental.  Strong materialism does not map
<br />
physical states to observer moments - strong materialism - or
<br />
'eliminativism' - says that observer moments are merely a human
<br />
construct we use to describe what are really physical processs.
<br />
According to this doctrine, you can't rightly talk about observer
<br />
moments at all.  What you have described above is weak materialism -
<br />
weak materialism - or property dualism - would agree that the physical
<br />
world is fundamental, but allow that observer moments are still real
<br />
'ontological primatives' which attach to (map to) the physical.  See
<br />
my next paragraph below.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The second way starts with the mind,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; denying the fundamental role of the physical world. According to this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumption, the physical world is introduced with the help of a theory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of physics mapping mental states to physical states that reproduce the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mental state within themselves. Imprecisely speaking, the second way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; questions the reality status of the physical world.
</em><br />
<br /><br />As I mentioned, there are still other possibilities.  Neither of  your
<br />
two possibilities is compatible with *comp*.  According to comp (which
<br />
seems to be the most popular position on this list) it's the
<br />
mathematical world which is fundamental.  Both the mind and physical
<br />
reality emerge from mathematics.  So there's a third possibility
<br />
there.
<br />
<br />The second possibility you mention has a long history of  ignominious
<br />
failure - Idealist approaches seem to lead to mysticism mostly and
<br />
have not helped the advance of science.  I think we can rule out
<br />
Idealism .  I think it's got to be either *comp* (mathematics is
<br />
fundamental), or some variation on possibility 1 - at the end of the
<br />
day I'd have to go with possibility 1 - weak materialism (only
<br />
physical substances exist), but with some kind of property dualism
<br />
(additional non-physical propties can attach themselves to physical
<br />
substances - these non-physical properties supervene on - are
<br />
dependent on the physical - but are not reducible to them).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Both ways allow the elaboration of an ensemble theory. The first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; approach starts from the ensemble of all physical worlds (or formally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with descriptions thereof). The second approach uses the ensemble of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all observer moments (or descriptions thereof). When Rolf expressed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the idea &quot;UTM outputs a qualia, not a universe&quot; (which is similar to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the second approach), I wrote: &quot;I have always been hopeful that both
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; approaches will finally turn out to be equivalent.&quot;
</em><br />
<br /><br />The third possibility (comp) starts with an ensemble of mathematical
<br />
relations , not an ensemble of all physical worlds, nor an ensemble of
<br />
all observer moments.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's a very trivial fact though that the two approaches are not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; equivalent. Nonetheless it's interesting to note it. I argue that we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have good reasons to discard the second approach. The fundamental role
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will be assigned to the physical worlds (hence the title of this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; message). The difference between the two approaches leads to different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; expections to the question &quot;What will I experience next?&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Consequently it can be measured empirically. We find this result by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observing that different physical worlds may produce the same observer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moment (e.g. if the physical worlds differ in a detail not perceivable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by the observer). This assigns a higher probability to the observer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moment when chosen randomly in order to answer the question (it's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multiply counted because it appears more than once in the everyting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ensemble). Opposed to this, every observer moment (in the RSSA within
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a given reference class) would have an equal probability to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; selected if we used the second approach.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think that the quantum mechanical Born rule strongly supports the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; first approach: Observer moments are weighted according to a specific
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; formula. They don't have equal probability!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Example: Both quantum states, |A&gt; = |0&gt;/sqrt(2) + |1&gt;/sqrt(2) and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; |B&gt; = |0&gt;/sqrt(3) + |1&gt;/sqrt(1.5)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lead to the same two possible observer moments when a measurement in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the (|0&gt;,|1&gt;) basis is performed. According to the Born rule the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probabilites for the two observer moments are equal for |A&gt; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different for |B&gt;. Starting from the second approach (observer moments
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are fundamental) this result cannot be understood.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If we take this result seriously, Bostrom's self-sampling assumption
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Each observer moment should reason as if it were randomly selected
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from the class of all observer moments in its reference class.&quot;
</em><br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; should be modified:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Each observer moment should reason as if it were randomly selected
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from the class of all observer moments in its reference class,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; weighted with their frequencies in the Everything ensemble.&quot;
</em><br />
<br />No, neither Bostrom's version nor your modified version works.  There
<br />
is no strong reason for believing Bostrom's self-sampling assumption
<br />
at all, as he himself admits in his detailed analysis.    The problem
<br />
is that the very process of reasoning is interfering with the thing
<br />
being reasoned about (since  reasoning is a thought process and so are
<br />
'observer moments').  For this reason all versions of the Anthroic
<br />
Principle are stuff and nonsense if you ask we.  Reflectivity (how to
<br />
think about thought itself) is an unsolved problem in probability
<br />
theory, the solution for which is known only to me.   I have no
<br />
intention of revealing that solution here however, since it's the key
<br />
to AI and my opponents are undoubtably reading my postings on this
<br />
messagelist.  Suffice it to say that there needs to be a
<br />
generalization of probability theory to enable one to reason about
<br />
probablities themselves, and this requires the introduction of a
<br />
second-order number which is not itself a probability, but is a number
<br />
representing something else entirely....... :D
