<em class="quotelev1">&gt; language? In the latter &quot;probably&quot; just means &quot;likely to happen&quot; but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if EVERYTHING happens then how can the concept make sense? I guess it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; must be two different concepts, then?
</em><br />
<br />No, not necessarily.
<br />
<br />There are two ways that probability can play a &quot;real&quot; role in MW.
<br />
This is no different from how it plays a role in other interpretations
<br />
of quantum physics, though.
<br />
<br />First would be real-world probability.  Take an electron cloud.  We
<br />
can say that the probability that the electron appears in a certain
<br />
range is, say, 90%.  This is a real probability that guides our
<br />
expectation.  If we measure a bunch of electrons we expect to find
<br />
around 90% of them in that range, and when we measure them, we do.  In
<br />
MW this is like saying that 90% of worlds consist of that particular
<br />
electron being in that range.  There are an infinite number of places
<br />
that electron could be, and an infinite number of places it could not
<br />
be.  But there's still a 90% chance of it being in the specified
<br />
range.  So we can...in a sense...think of 90% of the possible worlds
<br />
being in that range.
<br />
<br />If you're confused it's probably in part because of a lack of
<br />
understanding in the shift from finite to infinite.  Infinite numbers
<br />
don't operate under the same rules than finite numbers do, just like
<br />
negative numbers operate differently than positive numbers.  I could
<br />
explain this but it would take a few hours of expounding on set theory
<br />
to get you there.  Just know that infinite sets are compressible and
<br />
manipulable in ways that finite sets aren't.  For example, we can pair
<br />
up the squares of all natural numbers with the set of all natural
<br />
numbers one-to-one: 0 = 0, 1 = 1, 2 = 4, 3 = 9... and so on, so that
<br />
no number in either set is unpaired.  This is possible even though the
<br />
odds of selecting a perfect square arbitrarily out of the natural
<br />
numbers is 0%, because as you approach infinity, 0% of all natural
<br />
numbers are squares.  Newton took this to mean than reasoning about
<br />
infinity was absurd, but this was because he didn't understand the
<br />
difference between the cardinality and the ordinality of numbers.
<br />
<br />Second, we can talk about what it means for something to have
<br />
virtually no chance of happening.  We should always expect things that
<br />
are beyond reason not to happen, even though an infinite number of
<br />
such worlds must exist.  A cow could appear directly in front of me
<br />
right now due to quantum effects, but the odds are virtually zero so I
<br />
do not expect the occurrence.  In these cases a mathematician would
<br />
say that &quot;almost all&quot; worlds obey a certain property that precludes
<br />
the appearance of the cow.  &quot;Almost all&quot; has a technical meaning in
<br />
mathematics, but it means that the chance of something occurring is
<br />
too minute to put in terms of a real number.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Another thing I wonder about: Are your understandings of MW purely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical, or can you imagine or &quot;see&quot; the MW universe before your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; eyes? In particular: Can you &quot;see&quot; the probability aspect of it? And
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in that case, can you describe it in a simplified way for a dummy like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; me?
</em><br />
<br />I can envision it somewhat, but it's an abstract idea, yes.  Just
<br />
think about an electron cloud, for one example.  It's a cloud of
<br />
probability...but the electron isn't totally bound by it.  It's just
<br />
less and less likely to be further and further away from the main
<br />
portion of the distribution.
<br />
