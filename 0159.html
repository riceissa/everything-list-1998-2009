I attach Rainer's paper on a proof of MWI
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&lt;&lt;plaga test many-worlds.pdf&gt;&gt; 
<br />
<br />Also a recap of e-mail conversation with Rainer:
<br />
<br />Rainer Plaga: 	On your quantum immortality: you're right about traffic
<br />
accidents and the like. But I would guess that the fact that nobody ever
<br />
gets older than, say, 300 years is a deterministic law of nature, or in
<br />
other words that there is no single  branch in which a 300 year old James
<br />
exists. Isn't that plausible?
<br />
<br />James Higgo:	Thanks, Rainer.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that nobody over 300 exists in this universe is
<br />
unsurprising. But this is one of quite a few universes.  And perhaps they're
<br />
hiding. Will you concede there is a one in a thousand billion chance that
<br />
you will live over 300 years?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regards
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James
<br />
<br />Rainer Plaga:	I don't know what the chance for a branch with a 300 year
<br />
old James is. But how do you know it is not equal 0?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rainer
<br />
<br />James Higgo:	Anything that's possible exists, according to David Deutsch.
<br />
Sorry to appeal to his authority.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James
<br />
<br />Rainer Plaga:	Yeah, anything *that's possible* but I guess nobody knows
<br />
whether a 300 year old James *is possible* according to the laws of nature.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rainer
<br />
<br />James Higgo:	But it's possible that all the molecules in my body just
<br />
rearranged themselves by chance into the form of a teapot, so it's certainly
<br />
possible that you don't die.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James
<br />
<br />Rainer Plaga	Hello James,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see what you are saying now. Probably you are right. Unfortunately
<br />
even when we're 300 years old we will have a hard time to convince our
<br />
fellow ``branchians'' that the reason for our extreme longevity is MWI!
<br />
(Analogous to Max's experiment). Could there be something extremely
<br />
improbable that led to the survival of the human race? (Your idea's analogy
<br />
to my A-bomb experiment) An example would be: if we could prove that it is
<br />
extremely improbable that a time span of 70 million years goes by without a
<br />
nearby supernova that would wipe out the human race. This would be an
<br />
argument in favour of MWI.  This was only an example, one can show that it
<br />
is quite probable that no nearby SN happens within 70 million years. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But perhaps we can find an example that works. Actually: this would
<br />
also explain the absence of extraterrestrial intelligence (Fermi's paradox).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the best Rainer
<br />
<br />James Higgo:	Some fine ideas.  So I take it you're a convert, O Immortal
<br />
one!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James
<br />
<br />Rainer Plaga:	I believe
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually there is a corollary: It is impossible to commit suicide.
<br />
Each time you try you will find that some stupid accident or strange
<br />
improbable force kept you from doing it. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rainer
<br />
<br />James Higgo: 	Absolutely. And you will miraculously survive terminal
<br />
cancer.
<br />
<br />Rainer Plaga	I think Henri's point is correct. When we say
<br />
``immortality'' this is probably not age=infinity but age=large number.
<br />
However this is very speculative you come into questions like the heat death
<br />
of the universe etc.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For me these questions are not so pressing, as the pressing
<br />
question: Is MWI true? We have to find tests! Somebody who has a proof that
<br />
tests are impossible should publish it. (If the proof is convincing MWI will
<br />
become ``many words'' for me).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A last point: You only focus on the positive. Tomorrow I'll go on a
<br />
plane. If MWI is true some fraction of me will go through the agony of  a
<br />
drawn out plane crash. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rainer
<br />
<br />James Higgo	Yup. You will crash. Sorry.  If you're coming to London give
<br />
me a call. On Henri's point, we have finite number of atoms, but I am not
<br />
certain that there is a finite number of configurations for those atoms in
<br />
relation to their environment. You must be a positivist if lack of proof
<br />
will cause you to discount MWI.  As Goedel showed, many true hypotheses are
<br />
unprovable.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James
<br />
<br />Rainer Plaga	&gt;On Henri's point, we have finite number of atoms, but I am
<br />
not certain that
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">	&gt;there is a finite number of configurations for those atoms.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, that's a very difficult question. There is an article by
<br />
F.Dyson on RevMod Phys ca. 1979 whether life ever has to stop in an
<br />
expanding universe and he reaches the conclusion that it does not have to.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">	&gt;As Goedel showed, many true hypotheses are unprovable.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OK, true in principle. I have only a very modest question: Can one
<br />
get experimental evidence for the existence of other branches? (In last
<br />
consequence this means communication). This is most important question in
<br />
physics, I feel. There are two answers possible in principle:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. this is impossible in principle because...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no paper which evens aims to give such a proof. Max thinks
<br />
this is true but without giving a demonstration.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. the simplest device possible for this feat is...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David Deutsch gives a very scifi device which is certainly
<br />
nonrealiszable in the immediate future.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't understand why people who favour MWI do not agree on the
<br />
importance of this question. Even I my proposal is wrong, and a correct
<br />
proposal would be much more difficult to realize: the exp. proof of parallel
<br />
branches is clearly more important than the exp. detection of a Higgs boson,
<br />
so about 5 billion $ would not be too high a price to realize such a
<br />
proposal. The fraction of myself that will die tomorrow says goodbye, it was
<br />
nice to have made your email acquaintance.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rainer
<br />
<br />James Higgo	Perhaps we believe MWI so strongly that we're not so
<br />
determined to prove it.  Eventually everyone will accept it anyway as it is
<br />
the most elegant, simplest and most consistent (with my world-view)
<br />
interpretation. Enjoy the trip.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Subject:	How many mind states?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Yup. You will crash. Sorry.  If you're coming to London give me a call on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;0171 337 3760.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;On Henri's point, we have finite number of atoms, but I am not certain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;there is a finite number of configurations for those atoms.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In my opinion, brain states are highly degenerated in the sense that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; typical mind states are probably linked to macroscopic neural states,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; corresponding to many microscopic configurations. It is further probable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that many neural states can correspond to the same apparent mind state,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; since we are continuously (in most worlds!) loosing a lot of neurons
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; without suffering dramatical consequences. As we have around 10^10
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; neurons,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would guess that the total number of mind states would be lower (and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probably much lower) than 2^(10^10), many of them not corresponding to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sensible thoughts. This would let some room for the memory of a very long
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; life, but not for an infinite one...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; For me these questions are not so pressing,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; is the pressing question:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Is MWI true?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; We have to find tests!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Somebody who has a proof that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; tests are impossible should publish
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; it. (If the proof ios convincing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; MWI will become ``many words'' for me).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In my opinion again, the difficulty of &quot;proving&quot; MWI is that genuine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quantum effects are only visible in interference terms, as the decoherence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory tells us. That's why Tegmark's suicide experiment, although correct
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the MWI, can not be considered as a proof of it, even in the worlds
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where the experimentalist survives. As already mentioned, it could be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; merely considered as the realization of a very unlikely probability, which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is also compatible with the wave function collapse interpretation. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proof of MWI would be by a statistically significant deviation from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; classical evolution after a measurement, due to interference with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;ghost&quot; universes which are supposed to have disappeared in the WFCI. It
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should be reproducible in any world (some kind of macroscopic Aspect's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiment). Unfortunately, the decoherence theory tells us that these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deviations are VERY VERY small, so I cannot figure out how to make them
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; significant... The best argument for MWI is still that of logical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-consistency. Well, we are quite confident that gravitational waves do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exist, although nobody has been able to detect them up to now!
