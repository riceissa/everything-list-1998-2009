<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; I would say the multiple branches are needed to have any *stable*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; conscious experience, i.e. to have conscious experience &quot;with the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; right
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; (relative) probabilities&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It may as a matter of fact be the case that our consciousness is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; spread across
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; multiple branches, but I don't see how this would confer stability. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; When people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; pray for something, they are actually asking God to prune the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; multiverse branches
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in which undesirable outcomes occur. If God complies, in the extreme 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; case leaving
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; only a single branch intact, their future conscious experience will be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; very stable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; indeed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK. You also ask this to Russell:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Is there any reason to believe that we would lose consciousness, or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; notice
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that anything strange had happened at all, if most or all of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; parallel branches
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in the multiverse suddenly vanished?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think we would. Suppose you put coffee in a cup. One second after you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; drink it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, both with the comp hyp., or with just the quantum hypothesis, you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; know there are quantum or comp continuations in which the coffee will 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be transformed into tea (or white rabbits ...). Suppose God prunes all 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the branches where the coffee does not change, then, during that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; second, the probability of drinking coffee, relatively to tour 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience of having put coffee in the cup, will be zero. I guess you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will noticed the difference.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Recall the seventh step of the UDA (in the SANE version of UDA with 8 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; steps). You drop a pen, and you evaluate the probability that the pen 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hits the ground (if that is english). By the comp first person 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indetermincacy, the comp-exact first plural calculus, in principle, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consists in considering *all* computations in UD* (i.e. generated by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the UD in Platonia where we are supposed to be infinitely patient) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; going through your &quot;actual state&quot; (i.e. the one when you will just 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bring the cup to your mouth), and to see what is going on (from some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; third person pov) in each of the consistent computational 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; continuations. If some &quot;comp Goddess&quot; was able to prune, the way she 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wants, the computation or their continuations she could change 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arbitrarily your local physical laws, and unless she decides to revised 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your memory (and thus your actual states) you would notice.
</em><br />
<br />You would if it were the non-miraculous branches that were selectively 
<br />
pruned, although I guess that it is just this sort of pruning people would 
<br />
be asking of God (you would hardly need to pray that your coffee remain 
<br />
coffee). Nevertheless, even if the content of your conscious experience 
<br />
changed, there is no reason why you should not remain conscious as long 
<br />
as there was one single branch left in which you were conscious. To put it 
<br />
differently, there is no way you can tell that some single world / collapsing 
<br />
wave function interpretation of QM is correct, if you exclude quantum 
<br />
interference effects (and even that does not convince everyone, as we 
<br />
know).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; About your question &quot;could a recording be conscious?&quot; Well, let me 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quote you:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But WHY can't a recording be conscious? How do I know I'm not in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a recording at the moment? True, I am surprised by my experiences
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and believe I could have acted differently had I wanted to, but that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; might all be part of the script to which I am not privy, so that things
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; could only have been different if the recording had been different.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think I mainly agree with you, but I have some reason to discard 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; expression like &quot;a recording can be conscious&quot;. If it is a recording of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a (genuine) *computation* (unlike just a program), you can *associate* 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness to .... not really to the recording, but to the &quot;person&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; having that piece of computation recorded. That is, I think only 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;person&quot; can think. I don't believe a brain can think, nor any piece of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; local &quot;comp-matter&quot;. Only persons think, and only first persons are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aware of thinking.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Giving your other posts, I think this could just be a terminological 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nuance, but it helps to separate persons and their many relative third 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person (or first plural) incarnations/implementations.
</em><br />
<br />What I meant was, if a computer program can be associated with 
<br />
consciousness, then a rigid and deterministic computer program can also 
<br />
be associated with consciousness - leaving aside the question of how 
<br />
exactly the association occurs. For example, suppose I have a conversation 
<br />
with a putatively conscious computer program as part of a Turing test, and 
<br />
the program passes, convincing me and everyone else that it has been 
<br />
conscious during the test. Then, I start up the program again with no memory 
<br />
saved from the first run, but this time I play it a recording of my voice from 
<br />
the first test. The program will go through exactly the same resposes as 
<br />
during the first run, but this time to an external observer who saw the first 
<br />
run the program's responses will be no more surprising that my questions 
<br />
on the recording of my voice. The program itself won't know what's coming 
<br />
and it might even think it is being clever by throwing is some &quot;unpredictable&quot; 
<br />
answers to prove how free and human-like it really is. I don't think there is any 
<br />
basis for saying it is conscious during the first run but not during the second. I 
<br />
also don't think it helps to say that its responses *would* have been different 
<br />
even on the second run had its input been different, because that is true of 
<br />
any record player or automaton.
