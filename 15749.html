2009/1/1 &quot;Hal Finney&quot; &lt;hal.domain.name.hidden&gt;:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I want to emphasize that this picture of how Boltzmann fluctuations would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; work is a consquence of the laws of thermodynamics, and time symmetry.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sometimes people imagine that the fluctuation into the Boltzmann
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; low-entropy state is fundamentally different from the fluctuation out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of it. They accept that the fluctuation out will be similar to our own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence, with complex events happening. But they imagine that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fluctuation into low entropy might be much simpler, molecules simply
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aggregating together into some convenient state from which the complex
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fluctuation out and back to chaos can begin. While this is not impossible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and hence will happen occasionally among the infinity of fluctuations in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Boltzmann universe, it will be rare. It will be no more common for a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;simple&quot; fluctation-in process to occur than for a simple fluctuation-out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; process. In our universe, knowing it will evolve to a chaotic heat
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; death, we might imagine that molecules would just fly apart into chaos,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but we know that is highly unlikely. Instead, by far the most likely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; path is a complex one, full of turbulence and reactions and similar
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; activity. By time symmetry, exactly the same arguments apply during
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the fluctation-in phase. The vast majority of Boltzmann fluctuations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that achieve a particular degree of low entropy will do so via complex,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; turbulent paths which if viewed in reverse will appear to be perfectly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; plausible sequences of events for a universe which is decaying from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; order to disorder, like our own.
</em><br />
<br />This is an interesting idea. I had imagined that the fluctuations in
<br />
the decreasing entropy or winding up direction would involve chaotic
<br />
aggregation of matter which would then wind down in a more organised
<br />
way, giving rise to stars and planets and so on, but as you point out
<br />
there is no reason to assume this. I am not sure why you suggest that
<br />
the winding up direction lacks causality (leading to your question
<br />
about whether it could give rise to consciousness): if all the air in
<br />
the room moved to one side because, with incredible luck, the
<br />
molecules all vibrated in the same direction for a few seconds should
<br />
this event be called acausal?
<br />
<br />If we are conscious in winding up direction and winding up is no less
<br />
likely to occur though interesting pathways than winding down, this
<br />
would imply that at any point, we have about an equal chance of living
<br />
in the winding up as the winding down phase: we would have no way of
<br />
knowing. This would be the case whether we are ordinary brains or
<br />
Boltzmann Brains, since in either case there has to be a winding up
<br />
before the winding down can happen. A further implication is that
<br />
there will be far more observer moments in the later stages of the
<br />
universe than in the earlier stages. This is because unlikely as it is
<br />
that the universe will wind up all the way to January 1st 2009, it is
<br />
even less likely to continue winding up to 31st December 2008 (it is
<br />
far more likely of course to only wind back to a state near the heat
<br />
death end times, but there are less likely to be observers there). If
<br />
you support the ASSA, that would imply that you are near your last
<br />
moment of consciousness, since OM's later in your life have a much
<br />
higher measure than earlier ones. Under the RSSA or if you take into
<br />
account Boltzmann Brains that would not be a problem.
