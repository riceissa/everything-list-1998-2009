<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why is it wrong? Didn't you say earlier that in a theory with no free

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; parameters all possible courses of action must occur? Why do you now

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; say only one decision is possible? I'm having a lot of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; trouble understanding this reply.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I did say that.  But it's not really the relevant issue,
<br />
more of a red herring.  Remember, when I said that, I was still toying
<br />
with the notion of subsystems, which are now clearly seen as irrelevant.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although some me-like beings will make each of the
<br />
possible decisions, it is true that in this particular case, that is,
<br />
considering only the very me-likest cases, I will only make one.  (In
<br />
terms of computations, that is, computations that are exactly identical to
<br />
mine have the same outcome.)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But really, you don't need to get that specific if you just
<br />
substitute the idea that the effective probability of making each
<br />
decision is determined by me-like mental processes.  Hopefully this will
<br />
become clear to you.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 	I'll say it again: my mental processes *are* the laws of physics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in action, and *do* have consequences.  My choice *does determine* the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; actual utility, which is to say, the laws of physics determine it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 	I can't overemphasize the above point.  Stop and think about it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; if you feel tempted to just keep reading.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 	Forget I said anything about subsystems.  I'm sorry; I was wrong
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to have done so.  Utility functions are defined over any hypothesized
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; state of the universe.  It is redundant to say it is defined over a global
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; state: that is true by definition.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 	In general, they only depend on the (unnormalized) measure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; distribution of consciousness, since why should I care about anything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; else?  Any hypothesized situation where I can calculate how many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; computations of each type would be implemented should give me the utility
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; function for that situation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm with you so far.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 	Even if a hypothesis is not truly self consistent, an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; approximation to that hypothesis can be, and is the best I can do.  Since
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; we know I won't be able to show which decisions are unphysical a priori,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; my most accurate approximate calculated utility for that hypothesis is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; well defined quantity.  It is however a function of who I am.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 	It is also true that, assuming I pick the choice with the highest
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; utility, and that my calculations are correct, that the actual utility
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; will be that highest value.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 	So another way to look at it is that to calculate the actual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; utility, I have to also calculate a bunch of other values as an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; intermediate step.  Then I should decide to do what I've just shown that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the laws of physics make me do under those assumptions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now I'm lost. I have no idea what the above three paragraphs mean.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why not?  It is should be clear why I said that in a theory with
<br />
no free parameters, a scenario in which I make a decision other than the
<br />
one I really will make is unphysical.  This is assuming I make only one
<br />
decision - outcome.  The two next paragraphs refer to that as well.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to consider the case where I have an effective
<br />
probability to make each decision, that works too, though I couldn't
<br />
calculate the actual utility then.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The important point is that I make decision A instead of decision
<br />
B, that does (partially) determine the true utilty.  If there are 100
<br />
copies of me, and 90 others choose A and 9 others choose B, the decision
<br />
that the 100th copy - or me myself, if you want - makes does have an
<br />
effect.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The confusing issue - and I don't blame you, I didn't realize it
<br />
immediately either - is that an external observer might calculate and say
<br />
'there are 100 copies of him, and according to the laws of physics, which
<br />
have no free parameters, 90 copies choose A and 10 copies choose B.'
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This creates the temptation to say to myself, that I can't really
<br />
affect the utilty, I can only choose which camp to place myself into in
<br />
that predetermined vote.  BUT THAT IS NOT TRUE.  The laws of physics
<br />
determine the utilty, and my mental processes are the laws of physics in
<br />
action, and to say that the vote could not have been otherwise is merely
<br />
to say that my mental processes, or the 100 variations of it (effective
<br />
probability distribution), could not have been otherwise.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever computation my mental processes correspond to, they will
<br />
produce the result of that computation.  That is true regardless of
<br />
whether the computation is the result of the laws of physics alone, or the
<br />
laws of physics + particular free parameters.  There is no reason that the
<br />
identical computation, or identical effective probability distribution of
<br />
such computations, could not occur for both of those possibilities.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To say that I affect the outcome is to say that my mental
<br />
processes, or computation, determines the result, which is still true.
<br />
And the utility function, for my decision making, must be calculated by me
<br />
with different scenarios for each possible decision-outcome, because I do
<br />
not know what my own computation is.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 	I'm not sure how to define it in a language-independent way.  It
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; probably can't be done, which would pretty much guarantee the truth of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; my belief that it can't have a well defined value that is equal to zero.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now that I think about, it doesn't make sense to have a theory with zero
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information content. It should be the universe that has zero information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; content. The theory should define what information content means, and then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simply state that the actual universe is the unique universe that has zero
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information content.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would such a theory be unique?  If so, and I doubt it but would
<br />
like it to be true, it would make sense to speak of information content as
<br />
a well defined quantity.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we would have a mathematical theory of information content,
<br />
as well a theory of physics.  The theory of physics, however, would have
<br />
zero information content, as defined by the other theory.
