<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From Osher Doctorow osher.domain.name.hidden, Tues. Dec. 3, 2002 1326
</em><br />
<br />Tim May gives a very detailed account of his ideas on category and topos
<br />
theories, and I will only comment on a few of his ideas and some of Ben
<br />
Goertzel because of space and time limitations.
<br />
<br />I think that Tim and I, and hopefully Ben, do not differ on the extreme
<br />
usefulness of being able to generalize concepts across many different fields
<br />
and subfields.  MacLane and Lawvere's category theory TRIED to do that, and
<br />
the effort is certainly commendable.   Perhaps it is more than commendable.
<br />
As one who seldom receives commendations, I may tend to give them less often
<br />
to others than I did when I started out in mathematics/science.
<br />
<br />Nevertheless, I perceive or understand what Ben refers to as a certain lack
<br />
of deep results in category theory as compared with my Rare Event Theory for
<br />
example - although Ben understands it relative to his own experiences.  The
<br />
theorems that Tim has cited are one counterexample class to this, but where
<br />
are the great predictions, where is there anything like the Einstein Field
<br />
Equation, the Schrodinger Equation, Newton's Laws, Fermat's numerous
<br />
results, Maxwell's Equations, the Gauss-Bonnet Theorem and its associated
<br />
equation that ties together geometry and topology, Non-Euclidean/Riemannian
<br />
Geometry, Euclidean Geometry, the Jacobsen radical, Gauss-Null and related
<br />
sets in geometric nonlinear functional analysis, Godel's theorems, or even
<br />
Hoyle's Law or the Central Limit Theorems or the almost incredible theorems
<br />
of Nonsmooth Analysis and Kalman filters/predictors and Dynamic Programming
<br />
and the Calculus of Variations and Cantor's cardinals and ordinals and
<br />
Robinson's infinitesimals and Dirac's equations and Dirac's delta functions
<br />
and Feynmann's path history integrals and diagrams and the whole new
<br />
generation of continuum force laws and on and on.
<br />
<br />Sure, category theory can go in to many fields and find a category and then
<br />
take credit for the field being essentially a category, and I can go into
<br />
many fields and find plus and minus and division and multiplication analogs
<br />
and declare the field as an example of Rare Event Theory [RET] or Fairly
<br />
Frequent Event Theory [FFT or FET] or Very Frequent Event Theory [VFT or
<br />
VET] or a plus field or a minus field or a division field or a
<br />
multiplication field.   And both Category and RET-FET-VET theories can show
<br />
that many of their concepts cross many fields.   This is very commendable,
<br />
although to me it is old hat to notice that something like a generalization
<br />
of a group crosses many branches of mathematics, whereas RET-FET-VET classes
<br />
such as GROWTH, CONTROL, EXPANSION-CONTRACTION,
<br />
KNOWLEDGE-INFORMATION-ENTROPY tend to cross not only branches of mathematics
<br />
but branches of physics and biology and psychology and astrophysics and on
<br />
and on.
<br />
<br />But string and brane theory are suffering from precisely what category
<br />
theory is suffering from - a paucity of predictions of the Einstein and
<br />
Schrodinger kind mentioned in the second paragraph back, and a paucity of
<br />
depth.  Now, Tim, you certainly know very very much, but how are you at
<br />
depth [question-mark  - my question mark and several other keys like
<br />
parentheses are out].
<br />
<br />I will give an example.  Socrates would rank in my estimation as a Creative
<br />
Geniuses of Maximum Depth.    The world of Athens was very superficial,
<br />
facially and bodily and publicly oriented but with relatively little depth,
<br />
and when push came to shove, rather than ask what words meant, it preferred
<br />
to kill the person making the inquiries.   What it was afraid of was going
<br />
deep, asking what the gods really were, why so-called democracy ended at the
<br />
boundaries of Athens and even was inapplicable to all people in Athens, what
<br />
democracy really was, why the individual and the group/humanity were not
<br />
equally important, when the Golden Mean and the Golden Extreme as I would
<br />
call it [for example, valuing Knowledge rather than compromising between
<br />
Knowledge and Ignorance] applied.
<br />
<br />You mentioned, Tim, that the Holographic Model is still very hypothetical.
<br />
Are we to understand that G. 't Hooft obtained the Nobel Prize for a very
<br />
hypothetical idea [question-mark] among others.   I have actually
<br />
generalized the Holographic Principle and it follows from RET-FET-VET
<br />
Theory.   But it happens to be an example of DEPTH of a type that Category
<br />
Theory does not know how to handle.  It says that LOWER DIMENSIONS CONTAIN
<br />
MORE KNOWLEDGE-INFORMATION THAN HIGHER DIMENSIONS - IN FACT, ALL OF IT, with
<br />
appropriate qualifications.
<br />
<br />I will conclude this rather long posting with an explanation of why I think
<br />
Lawvere and MacLane and incidentally Smolin and Rovelli went in the wrong
<br />
direction regarding depth.  It was because they were ALGEBRAISTS - their
<br />
specialty and life's work in mathematics was ALGEBRA - very, very advanced
<br />
ALGEBRA.  Now, algebra has a problem with depth because IT HAS TOO MANY
<br />
ABSTRACT POSSIBILITIES WITH NO [MORE CONCRETE OR NOT] SELECTION CRITERIA
<br />
AMONG THEM.   It is somewhat like the Ocean - if an explorer worships the
<br />
Ocean, then he will go off in any direction that Ocean seems to be leading
<br />
him, and at least half of the time he will be wrong in terms of applications
<br />
and predictions and usefulness and depth and so on.   ANALYSIS, on the other
<br />
hand, uses algebra and geometry and topology and number theory, but its core
<br />
ideas are LIMITS [ONE- OR TWO-SIDED], MEASURES, CHANGE, and a few other
<br />
things, and how these relate to geometries and topologies and algebras.
<br />
Rovelli and Smolin and Ashtekar and Schwarz and Witten are slightly
<br />
different types of algebraists - they are either ALGEBRAIC GEOMETERS or
<br />
ALGEBRAIC TOPOLOGISTS, with PHYSICS thrown in of course.   Their string and
<br />
brane and knot and loop theories have about the same depth as those of
<br />
MacLane and Lawvere in terms of not predicting new things.  Oh, they do
<br />
marvellously at REINVENTING THE WHEEL, at reconstructing QM and QFT, etc.
