<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I looked up codswallop in the dictionnary and I was very surprised to find 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that it is a recent British word coined around 1963. It means &quot;nonsense.&quot;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK. This is your opinion.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; First sentence: The comp hypothesis depends on Turing Machines which are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inherently discrete. A continuous universe would not by emulable by a Turing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Machine. Read Bruno's latest post. He has a much better grasp of this issue 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then me.
</em><br />
<br />Why do you think the only possibilities are that the universe is
<br />
either discrete or continuous? For example, the space Q^4 (4-D space
<br />
built from rational numbers) is neither.
<br />
<br />What is interesting about this exchange is that I've been embroiled in
<br />
a remarkably similar exchange in the NECSI lists over the last few
<br />
days!
<br />
<br />OK - lets start from the beginning:
<br />
<br />COMP is the hypothesis that I can survive the replacement of my brain
<br />
by some Turing emulation (this seems to be the most consistent
<br />
statement of this hypothesis).
<br />
<br />Now assuming that I am some Turing emulation in the first place, then
<br />
COMP is obviously satisfied. If we further assume that the emulation
<br />
actually emulates my &quot;observer-moments&quot; in monotonic order (ie the
<br />
emulation computes each observer moments in time order) then my
<br />
perception of the universe will be discrete. This does not imply that
<br />
the universe is actually discrete however.
<br />
<br />However, there is no need to compute observer moments in temporal
<br />
order. If one computes say every second timestep for a certain time
<br />
interval, then goes back and computes the odd timestep (backfilling),
<br />
the results of the computation are identical (the emulated observer
<br />
will not sense a difference). Now consider the following possibility:
<br />
do a discrete simulation for a certain number of timesteps, then
<br />
backfill the half timesteps, then the third timesteps, and so on. In
<br />
this case, the observer moments will be perceived to lie on the set of
<br />
rational numbers - most definitely not discrete.
<br />
<br />This is with COMP. The same is true of Schmidhuber's
<br />
plenitude. However, with Schmidhuber, the universe cannot be a
<br />
continuum, as each state must be computable. However, the universe can
<br />
be indistinguishable from a continuum. The same applies to Tegmark,
<br />
who assumes all finitely describable consistent formal axiomatic
<br />
systems (fc-FAS appears to be the acepted abbreviation).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Second sentence: To prove that if physical constants are to take any definite 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; value, the universe must be quantized.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let us say that there exist a TOE based on one single physical constant X 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (for example Planck's constant). Without loss of generality, we can say that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the value of X is 1, since there is no other constant to compare it to. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Assuming that a Turing machine is used to apply this TOE to solve poblem and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; calculate any quantity in the world then any quantitiy derived from this TOE 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would have to belong to the set of integers -- including space time and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; energy. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We can extend this reasonning to TOE's that include n arbitrary physical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constants.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; George Levy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />This argument is incorrect for precisely the same reasons as
<br />
above. The Turing machine can compute pi from within this TOE, and
<br />
unless you happen to live in Kansas, Pi is most definitely not an
<br />
integer.
<br />
<br />It seems quite a few people are labouring under this misunderstanding
<br />
that Turing emulations (or equivalently fc-FASes) imply that the
<br />
emulation must be discrete. I shall return to this theme in some
<br />
subsequent posts. Of course there is nothing wrong intrinsically with
<br />
assuming the universe is discrete, however, it is an extra and special
<br />
assumption. It also appears to have some experimentally testable
<br />
consequences (such as Lorentz invariance can never be true in a
<br />
discrete universe).
<br />
<br />My main objection to the discrete universe idea, is that I can't see
<br />
any obvious anthropic reason why the universe should be discrete, and
<br />
surrounding each discrete universe is a dense swarm on nondiscrete
<br />
universes that are Turing emulable - thus it seems unlikely we'd live
<br />
in a discrete universe by chance alone.
