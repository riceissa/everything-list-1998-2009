</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have of it&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; B:&gt; the possibility to simulate the universe at any level of accuracy. &lt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; First I wanted to ask what is intuition, but let us stay with common sense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (however divergent that may be). I don't have your intuition and you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't have mine.
</em><br />
<br />There is an assumption here which is that however divergent
<br />
these intuition or common sense views of it might be, there
<br />
exist (in some sense) something that we can refer to as
<br />
&quot;the universe&quot;. By the way, this is not the first series of
<br />
post with that title and though I am not sure I went through
<br />
all of them this is the first time I see this issue discussed
<br />
here. This is indeed a good question but why me ? And how do
<br />
other participants define what &quot;the universe&quot; could be ?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now if A is true, I wonder upon WHAT can you simulate?
</em><br />
<br />I don't understand the question.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Your reply points to first person processes.
</em><br />
<br />Yes but this is onky in one sense. There might exist a lot
<br />
of other universes. Among all possible universes, I mean I
<br />
am talking about the one I feel I live in. This is just a
<br />
way to designate one specific universe (not to mean that I
<br />
am not interested in the computability of others but I have
<br />
a special interest in that one).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I like better a 'mixed' way:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MY 'interpretation' of something to which I have access only through such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interpretation - but there must be a basis for the inter[retation both as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my way of doing it, but more importantly the 'thing' to interpret. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (common sense) intuition comes into the 'my way'.
</em><br />
<br />Do we really disagree ont that ?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; C. (universe:)&quot;the smallest independent piece that does include myself&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; First I object to &quot;independent&quot; which would lead to a multiple existence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of parallel natures (all of them singularities for the others) and we cannot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; gain information from them - which would connect in some ways. Existence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as  we can reasonably speak about it, is interconnected - nothing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; independent.
</em><br />
<br />I think we agree here. I gave indication of what I meant by
<br />
dependence (and therefore by independence) as: &quot;space-time
<br />
continuity, particle interaction and this kind of things&quot;
<br />
and I feel that everything in the universe is interconnected
<br />
in that way (this makes my definition of universe a tautology
<br />
but it can be linked in some way to the common sense) even
<br />
when considering &quot;causally isolated regions of space-time&quot;
<br />
(because these would be connected in some future and they
<br />
cannot be considered as isolated from that future).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you make concessions to that and accept 'relative' independence, then the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; smallest 'unit'  including you is you. I don't think you want to go
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; solipsistic.
</em><br />
<br />I don't believe I can isolate something like 'me'.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you expand further - well, I did not find a limit.
</em><br />
<br />I am not sure of that. If many universes do exist, they might
<br />
well be considered independent of each other (because of lack
<br />
of spatio-temporal continuity or particle interaction or the
<br />
like).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is why I concocted a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; narrative about a 'plenitude' (undefined, not Plato's concept) FROM which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distinct 'universes' occur (in timeless and countless fulgurations, callable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; BigBangs) with some INTERNAL history - in 'ours' including space and time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So I have a 'universe to talk about' - within my intuition &lt;G&gt;. And many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more 'universes', obscured by ignorance (no info) - not excluded. I don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; restrict 'them' to our logic, math, system, not even causality.
</em><br />
<br />This sounds very speculative (not to say mystical) to me.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I like your metaphor of the dominos. It pertains to a view we may have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in our (exclusively possible) reductionist ways about the world: THIS
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ONE is the cause of an event (one side of the domino) while the rest of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the system (all of it) is also influencing - whether we consider it in our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; limited model (within our chosen boundaries) or not.
</em><br />
<br />I have two views of causality. In the first one, causality
<br />
is a local and macroscopic (and mesoscopic) emergent property
<br />
linked to the fact that the universe would be more ordered on
<br />
one side that on the other. In the second, events continuously
<br />
trigger other events. The second view seems to be some kind of
<br />
idealisation of the first one that will always be no more than
<br />
a convenient simplification/approximation. Considering that
<br />
everything occurs or must occur according to the second view
<br />
sounds like an error to me. This error tends to make the
<br />
universe viewed as somthing evolving through time while it
<br />
should be viewed as a static (intemporal) object within which
<br />
(the flow of) time emerges from its structure as a local
<br />
property. This is also why views in which universes continously
<br />
fork as events occur in one way or the other does not make
<br />
much sense for me.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This list goes many times beyond the reductionist ways of thinking.
</em><br />
<br />I don't think that the first view is beyond the reductionist
<br />
ways of thinking. Both views are compatible with a completely
<br />
mathematic (and even arithmetic) structure of the universe.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Math logic is beyond models, it only becomes reductionistic, if applied to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'things/events': when limited models are quantitatively characterized in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comparison with other models and an ( = ) sign (or similar) is applied to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them within the selected boundaries.
</em><br />
<br />Regards
<br />
<br />Georges Quénot.
