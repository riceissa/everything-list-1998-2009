</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; That's true, from the pure OM perspective &quot;death&quot; doesn't make sense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; because OMs are timeless.  I was trying to phrase things in terms of

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the observer model in my reply to Stathis.  An OM wants to preserve

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the measure of the observer that it is part of, due to the effects of

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; evolution.  Decreases in that measure would be the meaning of death,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in the context of the multiverse.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I will keep reading your posts hoping to make sense of it. Still I was=20=
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about asking you if you were assuming the &quot;multiverse context&quot; or if=20
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you were hoping to extract (like me) the multiverse itself from the=20
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OMs. In which case, the current answer seems still rather hard to=20
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; follow.
</em><br />
<br />I was trying to use Stathis' terminology when I wrote about the
<br />
probability of dying.  Actually I am now trying to use the ASSA and I
<br />
don't have a very good idea about what it means to specify a subjective
<br />
next moment.  I think ultimately it is up to each OM as to what it views
<br />
as its predecessor moments, and perhaps which ones it might like to
<br />
consider its successor moments.
<br />
<br />Among the problems: substantial, short-term mental changes might be
<br />
so great that the past OM would not consider the future OM to be the
<br />
same person.  This sometimes even happens with our biological bodies.
<br />
I can easily create thought experiments that bend the connections beyond
<br />
the breaking poing.  There appears to be no bright line between the
<br />
degree to which a past and future OM can be said to be the same person,
<br />
even if we could query the OM's in question.
<br />
<br />Another problem: increases in measure from a past OM to a future OM.
<br />
We can deal with decreases in measure by the traditional method of
<br />
expected probability.  But increases in measure appear to require
<br />
probability &gt; 1.  That doesn't make sense, again causing me to question
<br />
the whole idea of a subjective probability distribution over possible
<br />
next moments.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then in another post you just say:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It's a bit hard for me to come up with a satisfactory answer to this=20=
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; problem, because I don't start from the assumption of a physical=20
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; universe at all--like Bruno, I'm trying to start from a measure on=20
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; observer-moments and hope that somehow the appearance of a physical=20
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; universe can be recovered from the subjective probabilities=20
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; experienced by observers
</em><br />
<br />Actually I didn't write this, Jesse Mazer did.  But I do largely agree
<br />
with this approach, and I wrote the reply:
<br />
<br />I have a similar perspective.  However I think it will turn out that the
<br />
simplest mathematical description of an observer-moment will involve a Big
<br />
Bang.  That is, describe a universe, describe natural laws, and let the
<br />
OM evolve.  This is the foundation for saying that the universe is real.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And this answers the question. I am glad of your  interest in the=20
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possibility to explain the universe from OMs, but then, as I said I=20
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't understand how an OM could change its measure. What is clear for=20=
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; me is that an OM (or preferably a 1-person, an OM being some piece of=20
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the 1-person) can change its *relative* measure (by decision, choice,=20
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will, etc.) of its possible next OMs.
</em><br />
<br />The OM can change the universe, and this will include changing the measure
<br />
of many people's future OMs.  Wei Dai, in whose footsteps I largely
<br />
travel, finally decided that *any* philosophy for an OM was acceptable,
<br />
and its only task was to optimize the multiverse to suit its preferences.
<br />
This does not require that we introduce a subjective probability for
<br />
measure of next OM, but it can allow OMs to think that way.  If the
<br />
current OM has an interest in certain OMs, the ones it chooses to call its
<br />
&quot;next OMs&quot;, and it wants to adjust the relative measure of those OMs to
<br />
suit its tastes, that can be accommodated in this very general model.
