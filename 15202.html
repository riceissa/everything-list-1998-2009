</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Bruno, this was the item I was asking (or at least had meant to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ask) you about several days ago.  But it was phrased differently,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; something like &quot;If I am the universe and the universe is not  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; turning emulable then comp is false&quot;  Here you are saying the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; universe is not turning emulable, so if comp is true that implies  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;I != universe&quot;.  I look forward to your explanation of why the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; universe is not Turing emulable.  BTW: Does this apply to just the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Everett Universe, or are there other conceivable universes which  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; are emulable in addition to the observers they might contain?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hmmm... Normally, once you grasp all the steps up to 8, or grasp  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; UDA(1...7) and accept provisorily #8 for the sake of the argument,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you should worry if the notion of universe still make sense at all.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; How can you be sure all the computation going through your current  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; state glues into a coherent physical reality? If you grasp 1...8 or  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1...7, you should understand it is up to you to justify why a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe makes sense, or exists at all, and in case it makes sense,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; why should it be computable. If it was shown to be computable, it  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would mean the white rabbits have been evacuated already.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't consider myself or any observer glued to any single reality,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; yet I still believe coherent realities exist.  See below.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; How does the computability of the universe relate to the evacuation  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of white rabbits?
</em><br />
<br /><br />In the sense that if the white rabbits are computable, then it is hard  
<br />
to see why to call them white rabbits at all. In the worst case they  
<br />
will be called complex unknown, like the shape of the clouds, or far  
<br />
away galaxies ...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you agree that comp entails white rabbits, you already know that  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the comp physics is non computable. We cannot evacuate any of those  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; white rabbits, they are there in &quot;arithmetic&quot;. We can only hope (if  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we want keep mechanism and the appearance of naturalism) that there  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is an explanation why the white rabbits are *relatively* rare.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And I am not assuming Everett in any way, nor even QM. On the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contrary, what I try to explain, is that, IF you take seriously the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mechanist Hypothesis into account, THEN you can no more assume the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence of a physical universe. If you still believe in lawful  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ways to predict and anticipate our neighborhoods' behaviors, you  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have to extract an explanation of those predictions from a theory of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (gluing) computations. IF QM is true (which I tend to believe), then  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you have to justify QM entirely from computations or numbers.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Including the geometrical and topological background.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The role of QM and especially through Everett's formulation of QM,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is that QM is a witness that the empirical observations already  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; confirm some of the most startling prediction of comp, like the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indirect many evidences for the many histories, and (with AUDA) the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quantum logical behavior of the certain propositions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The universal dovetailer does dovevtail on  the quantum Universal  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; solutions of the SWE, and thanks to Feynman (and Everett, Deutsch)  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we know how those Universal Quantum solutions do evacuate the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *quantum white rabbits*. But if we assume mechanism, we can no more  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; postulate the SWE, we have to extract it from all computations,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaning evacuate vaster sets of white rabbits. We cannot, by 1- 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inedtermincay in front of the UD, localize ourselves in any  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computational histories, we belong to all of them, and nothing a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; priori indicates that the result is a computable things.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think we are in general agreement regarding the idea that a first  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person experience belongs to many (perhaps infinite) computational  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; histories.
</em><br />
<br />First person experience belongs to many (necessarily infinite)  
<br />
computational histories (from UDA), but OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I think the confusion may have come down to language, in particular  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; how we defined &quot;universe&quot;.  I see now you take &quot;universe&quot; to mean  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the perceived environment that appears as a first person experience  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to observers.  I also see how this collection of possible histories  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can be incomputable/unknowable.  Whereas, I was defining &quot;universe&quot;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to mean a single consistent computational/mathematical history which  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; may implement computations that form first person experiences.
</em><br />
<br />Hmmm... Such a &quot;universe&quot; cannot exist, unless you are willing to call  
<br />
the Universal Deployment itself a universe. Then OK, and the  
<br />
&quot;universe&quot; is a tiny part Arithmetical Truth.
<br />
A computation is enough to have a consciousness, once it has the  
<br />
relative environment which &quot;survive&quot; the universal dovetailing, but  
<br />
the you cannot attach that consciousness to your &quot;universe&quot;, but to  
<br />
all possible &quot;universe&quot; already in the deployment.
<br />
It seems you still believed that you can force consciousness to stay  
<br />
in some particular computation, when the UD argument shows that  
<br />
consciousness is indetermined on the set of *all* computations.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; These first person view points, by mechanism, would not be unique to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any particular history, but belong to all histories which implement  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the same computations.  Individual histories, as I see it, may or  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; may not be computable, but both can implement computational  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; histories/information patterns that are the basis of consciousness.
</em><br />
<br />All right, but then the &quot;universe&quot; again has to be given by the UD,  
<br />
and in fact any UD. It remains possible, plausible and probable that  
<br />
some sub-UD could play some role, but they can be used (if we want to  
<br />
solve the mind body problem, or not loose its comp explanation) only  
<br />
internal justification (based on measure, or on defining arithmetical  
<br />
version of the first and thirs points of view, etc.).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To me the non-existence of white rabbits might be explained by the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; much higher frequency of &quot;histories&quot; ...
</em><br />
<br /><br />Right. I agree.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; ... that have simple rules,
</em><br />
<br /><br />This is ambiguous. I agree, given that the &quot;universe&quot; is just a tiny  
<br />
part arithmetic. The simple rule are mainly the law of addition and  
<br />
the law of multiplication, modus ponens, etc. We don't need induction  
<br />
rule nor lobianity for the &quot;universe&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and randomized initial states.
</em><br />
<br />This I don't see at all.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  A mathematical object is defined out there where the initial  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; condition is this universe exactly as it is now, only a giant white  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rabbit is standing before you, but such mathematical objects that  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; start at such a highly ordered state that contains all life on  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Earth, and brains with consistent memories would be very rare.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes but they appear an infinity of times, and have continua of  
<br />
consistent extensions. If we want keep comp, we have to justify why  
<br />
they are rare, and this without postulating any special little program  
<br />
(special means here different from the UD). Keep in mind that we  
<br />
cannot be aware of the delays made by the UD, (or of the lenght of  
<br />
proof of Sigma_1 proposition in a tiny part of arithmetic (cf the  
<br />
arithmetical hypostases).
<br />
No doubt little programs and little numbers plays key role, but big  
<br />
numbers are there, and we cannot just decide they can't influence our  
<br />
consciousness because they do, only we have to justify why their role  
<br />
is rare, or annihilate itself, etc.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Much more common would be histories that began with simple unordered  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; initial conditions but with the right properties for life to evolve.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Perhaps, but if true, that has be to be justified the way mentioned  
<br />
above.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The moral is this. Mechanism provides a cute theory of mind, roughly  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; speaking it is computer science/mathematical logic. But then there  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is a big price, we have to (re)explain all what we know and observe  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about the body and the apparent universe. We can no more invoke the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence of a lawful structure, we have to explain it from the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory of mind/numbers.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Do you are completely aware of the 1-3 distinction when doing the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seven step of the thought experiment/experience?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think I so, perhaps my response above would better clarify whether  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or not there is something I am missing.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I think you have a very good understanding of many important things  
<br />
here, notably concerning the relation between consciousness and  
<br />
physicalness, but you have still, perhaps, a rest of physicalist  
<br />
conception of the &quot;physical universe&quot;. With comp, physics emerges,  
<br />
although logically, not temporally, from the stable coherent  
<br />
conceptions of reality machines (numbers) can build relatively to each  
<br />
other. It may be that your conclusion is right, and that some sub-UD  
<br />
wins the &quot;the battle for the right measure&quot;. I am ok with that, but  
<br />
that's out of topic I would say. The fact is that if you are true, you  
<br />
have to justify it by an internal measure defined on the universal  
<br />
deployment. No program, but the UD itself can prevent consciousness to  
<br />
escape continuously toward the work of the big numbers, and the very  
<br />
big numbers, and the very very big numbers.
<br />
Only a strict ultrafinitist, like Torgny Tholerus perhaps, can escape  
<br />
the infinitiy of those big numbers, but then he has to abandon comp  
<br />
for other reasons. Do you see this? It is really a consequence of the  
<br />
step 2 already: the impossible awareness (first person knowledge) of  
<br />
the many ---very long--- delays intrinsic to the working of the UD. We  
<br />
belong to *all* stories which access our computational states.
