<em class="quotelev1">&gt; -----Original Message-----
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; From: George Levy [mailto:GLevy.domain.name.hidden]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sent: Wednesday, 12 September 2001 7:48 a.m.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't know if there is an accepted formulation for QTI and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conservation of memory, however, the only constraint that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seems logical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to me is that the consciousness extensions should be logically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consistent, because logical consistenty is a prerequisite for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness.
</em><br />
<br />I think the only constraint is that the extensions should be physically possible, i.e. possible outcomes of the schrodinger wave
<br />
equation. If those are also logical outcomes then fine, but the SWE is the constraining factor.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I can imagine certain branches in which memory is totally lost, (the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; null case so to speak - because there is really no consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; continuation) and other branches where memory is totally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conserved, yet
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other cases where memory is transformed to reflect a different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; past....All these will come true as long as there is a logical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explanation for them to happen. You must keep in mind as Jacques
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mentionned, that memory is not necessary identical with the past. It
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only represents the present brain state which reflects in a consistent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fashion more or less precisely what the past was.
</em><br />
<br />Memory represents the past, basically, because matter is (semi) stable and because the arrow of time only operates in one direction.
<br />
Obviously there will be errors of recording (our senses and our interpretation of them are not perfect) plus errors in storage
<br />
(memories degrading with time, false associations being created, etc). This isn't necessarily so. Presumably an advanced AI,
<br />
assuming such a thing can exist, would be able to have perfect recall.
<br />
<br />Whether memory is continuous in the QTI depends on what continuations the SWE allows for a given situation. The SWE might allow you
<br />
to survive being shot through the head, for example (people *have* survived having objects propelled through their heads
<br />
occasionally) but the most likely continuation might well include you losing part of your memory and undergoing a personality
<br />
change.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In some branches you will experience increasing old age
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; without limit...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all ou need is the logical explanation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For example upon dying as a human, you may wake up as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; billion year old
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ten arm octopus living in a 30 dimensional space realizing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that you were
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just dreaming in 3-Land. The number of explanations seems limitless.
</em><br />
<br />This assumes that identical quantum states can be generated in different parts of the multiverse WITHOUT having evolved from
<br />
identical previous states. I don't see that this is impossible (and if it isn't impossible it will happen - that's what the
<br />
multiverse is all about). You are ALSO assuming that identical quantum states - no matter how they might be separated along
<br />
spacelike, timelike or other-dimension-like intervals - can experience continuous consciousness. To assume that you need a theory
<br />
which explains how we manage to experience continuous consciousness from instant to instant - of IF we do, or just (heh heh) think
<br />
we do.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In this list, we are what we are, our age probably ranging
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from 20 to 80
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because of our surrounding, because of anthropic reasons. Had
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we been a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; billion year old group (with the corresponding historical-anthropic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reasons for being 1 billion year old), God knows what we would be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; talking and worrying about, but we would certainly not be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; debating this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (F)allacious (I)nsane (N)onsense. :-)
</em><br />
<br />(Again assuming QTI is true for a moment . . . ) we couldn't be a billion year old group unless advanced technology has enabled
<br />
everyone to live &quot;forever&quot; (and we've tidied up the solar system, or found a quieter neighbourhood to live in...!) - I mean, you
<br />
can't have a billion year old GROUP according to QTI, only billion year old individuals in different (and &quot;thermodynamically
<br />
unlikely&quot;) branches of the multiverse. One of the cunning features of the QTI is that it can only be &quot;proved&quot; from the 1st person
<br />
perspective (and in an incredibly small proportion of universes - maybe the Queen Mother is doing it in our one?). From the 3rd
<br />
person perspective, i.e. your perspective on everyone else, QTI still predicts death at the normal sort of age. Hence by definition,
<br />
according to QTI a discussion group will always be composed of people very near the start of their worldlines (in QTI terms), except
<br />
in an infinitesimal proportion of universes.
<br />
<br />I'm not putting the arguments for QTI because I believe it but because I've yet to see a good counter-argument. So far the only
<br />
counter argument I've seen is the SSA one, which doesn't take into account what we might call the &quot;anthropic principle&quot; that leads
<br />
to people who are able to have discussions being in 99.9999999999999999999....% of cases &quot;QTI-young&quot;.
<br />
