<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;This is the ''white rabbit'' problem which was discussed on this list a

few

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;years ago. This can be solved by assuming that there exists a measure

over
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;the set of al universes, favoring simpler ones.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't believe there are any grounds for assuming that, so the problem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; isn't solved for me.
</em><br />
<br />This can be motivated in a number of ways. I think Hall Finney made this
<br />
argument some time ago, and it is my favorite argument. Suppose you identify
<br />
a universe with the program specifying it. The probability that you find
<br />
yourself in a universe X will be proportional to the priori probability of X
<br />
multiplied by the number of times you will be computed in X. It is possible
<br />
to define universes Y_{n} that are defined by executing X n times. The
<br />
probability that you find yourself in Y_{n} is thus proportional to the
<br />
prior probability of Y_{n} times n. To have a well normalizable probability
<br />
distribution Y_{n} has to go to zero faster than 1/n. Now, the size of
<br />
program Y_{n} depends linearly on Log(n) (because you have to specify the
<br />
number n in the program). So, asuming that the prior probability only
<br />
depends on program size, it must decay (at least) exponentially as a
<br />
function of program size.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Once you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;consider the whole of Platonia all you have is a probability distribution
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;over the set of all possible states you can be in (because you can't
</em><br />
define
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;time in a normal way anymore).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't agree with this. I can imagine an infinite 2D lattice of cells,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seeded with the binary digits of pi, and ask the following question: if
</em><br />
the
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rules of Conway's Life were applied to this lattice, what would it look
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like after a million ticks of the clock? There's an objective answer to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this question, and that answer exists in Platonia. I believe that this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implies that the universe I just described (and all other possible CA
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universes, and much more) exists in Platonia. I define &quot;time&quot; as the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;ticking of the clock&quot; in such computational worlds, so I believe time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exists in Platonia. (Of course, in another sense, Platonia exists in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; timeless &quot;all at once&quot;. This is similar to the way that time exists in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;block universe&quot; of relativity theory.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />I agree. I was refering to the whole of Platonia which is timeless.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;There is no conditional probability for your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;next experience given what you have experienced now. A valid question is:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;What is the probability that you will be in a state P that contains the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;memory that you have been in a state P'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I find this way of looking at things very confusing. What do you mean by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;you&quot; in this formulation? Is &quot;you&quot; a thing that jumps from state to
</em><br />
state?
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If so, then we have some form of time. If not, what is this &quot;you&quot;?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Obviously it is something that can be said to be &quot;in a state P&quot;
</em><br />
(otherwise,
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you wouldn't consider your above question valid). But what does it mean
</em><br />
for
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;you to be in a state P&quot;? If it's true that &quot;you are in a state P&quot;, are
</em><br />
you
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just timelessly in state P, or what? How can you even talk about something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;being&quot; without talking about time?
</em><br />
<br /><br />It's confusing, but it has a big advantage over the more intuitive point of
<br />
view. This is how I see it (I know that others on thius list disagee with
<br />
me):
<br />
<br />Clearly there exists a program that represents me. If you know exactly how
<br />
my brain works, you can run me on a computer. I thus have to identify myself
<br />
with that program. Note that if you run this program it will change itself
<br />
(I would have a notion of time even if simulated without any external
<br />
environment). So, by program I mean the program plus the exact computational
<br />
state it is in.
<br />
<br />Then, I like to get rid of the concept of personal identity. The idea that
<br />
Saibal yesterday is the same as Saibal today cannot be made precise. You can
<br />
try to identify programs p and p' by saying that they represent the same
<br />
person if by running p you eventually obtain p'. But what about external
<br />
influences changing a person? There are other reasons too (see my input in
<br />
the the quantum suicide debate).
<br />
<br />To see how it works (in principle) consider Saibal doing an experiment. Let
<br />
S1 denote the program specifying me just before I start the experiment and
<br />
S2 the program after I observe the result (taking seriously what I wrote
<br />
above, I couldn't write the sentence like this...).  Suppose that there are
<br />
many possible outcomes, and I want to know the probability that I will
<br />
observe a particular outcome. According to the intuitive view there exists a
<br />
conditional probability that you are in state S2 given that you were in
<br />
state S1, and that is what you should try to compute using some theory.
<br />
However, since S2 and S1 are strictly speaking different persons this is
<br />
difficult, as I wrote above. Instead, one should compute quantities that
<br />
refer to single persons (programs) only. In this case I could, using a prior
<br />
probability over all possible universes, compute the probability
<br />
distribution over the set of all programs that remember being in S1 and have
<br />
observed the outcome of the experiment. This strictly refers to single
<br />
programs and is thus well defined. Note that this remains well defined in
<br />
cases where a particular experimental outcome would kill you (so-called
<br />
(quantum) suicide experiments).
