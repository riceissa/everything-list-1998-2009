Jacques:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You guys are going about it all wrong.  Sure, some computers seem 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simpler than others.  But there's no one way to pick the simplest.
</em><br />
<br />Why not?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The set of all is the simplest possibility, rather than choosing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one &quot;simple&quot; program.  (Joel's 3 dimensional cellular automata 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are particularly ridiculous to me.  How could he think the 3-d is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not anthropically chosen?)
</em><br />
<br />I struggle very much with the reasons why the automaton should be 
<br />
three-dimensional. And at this time, I have no adequate answer for 
<br />
you.  Perhaps it is not.
<br />
<br />But... let me say this:
<br />
<br />We do not claim that this magic automaton needs to be three-
<br />
dimensional.  We only claim that it is minimal (generates all 
<br />
finite configurations) and computationally universal (can perform 
<br />
any computation).
<br />
<br />It is the latter part (computational universality) that may require 
<br />
three dimensions.  But honestly this is just a hunch.
<br />
<br />At this time, none of the elementary one-dimensional minimal 
<br />
cellular automata appear capable of universal computation.  
<br />
<br />Certainly it would seem that there might be a two-dimensional 
<br />
automaton that is both minimal (generates all configurations) and 
<br />
also computationally universal.
<br />
<br />But what if there isn't?  Most computer scientists seem to agree 
<br />
that computational universality requires crossing signals paths - 
<br />
to get information from one place to another without disrupting the 
<br />
flow of other information streams.
<br />
<br />Maybe three dimensions is the minimum needed to do this 
<br />
successfully. ?
<br />
<br />Note: Some of you will point to the Game of Life as an example of a 
<br />
two-dimensional universal computer - using gliders as information 
<br />
channels.  
<br />
<br />But it is not clear to me that such an automaton could actually be 
<br />
made to compute the workings of a minimal celllar automaton (one 
<br />
that generates all configurations).  Yes, I have seen the examples 
<br />
of the Game of Life working as a Turing Machine.  But let me just 
<br />
say I'm not convinced it will work for infinite computational 
<br />
processes like the minimal CA.  And as I said before, 
<br />
The Game of Life itself is almost certainly not minimal, 
<br />
(definitely not reversible) so this would seem to rule it out as 
<br />
&quot;The Automaton&quot; that runs everything.
<br />
<br />What we need is something that is minimal (generates all 
<br />
configurations) AND computationally universal (capable of 
<br />
performing any computation)... thus generating ALL programs.
<br />
<br />Maybe three dimensions is the only way to do this. ?  I don't 
<br />
know.
<br />
<br />But I do know this...
<br />
<br />We'll never know if we don't look!!  =)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; All possible algorithms should exist: TMs, CAs, etc.  
</em><br />
<br />As we know, from a computational point of view, Turing Machines are 
<br />
equivalent to cellular automata.
<br />
<br />But from an abstract point of view, it may be difficult to implement 
<br />
a Turing Machine with no ad-hoc assumptions about time and space  
<br />
(e.g. the moving read-write head) and infinite slow-down.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The typical machine on the bottom should therefore be of huge 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dimension, with a huge number of states, etc.  
</em><br />
<br />That's going to be a very difficult thing to study.  
<br />
<br />But let me look at your paper, as this is new to me.
<br />
<br />Joel
