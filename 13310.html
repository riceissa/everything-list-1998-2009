<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hi Max,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in this particular universe it's going well, thank you!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As promised, I had a look at your paper. I think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it is well written and fun to read. I've got a few comments
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; though, mostly on the nature of math vs computation,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and why Goedel is sexy but not an issue
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; when it comes to identifying possible mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structures / universes / formally describable things.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think some of the comments are serious enough to affect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the conclusions. Some come with quotes from papers in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/computeruniverse.html">http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/computeruniverse.html</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where several of your main issues are addressed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Some are marked by &quot;Serious&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am making a cc to the everythingers, although it seems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they are mostly interested in other things now - probably
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nobody is really going to read this tedious response which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; became much longer than I anticipated.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />Don't worry, we are used to some long posts in this list. I am not sure 
<br />
you follow the list because the &quot;other things&quot; you are mentioning are 
<br />
just the follow up of the search of the theory of everything, except 
<br />
that since you leave the list, denying the 1-3 distinction, some years 
<br />
ago, most people who continue the discussion now are aware of the 
<br />
necessity to take into account that distinction between first and third 
<br />
person points of view, and more generally they are aware of the mind 
<br />
body problem (or of the 1-person/3-person pov relations). I think most 
<br />
of them, except new beginners, have no more any trouble with the first 
<br />
person indeterminacy in self-duplication experiments, etc.
<br />
<br />I have already made this clear: the hypothesis that there is a physical 
<br />
computable universe (physicalist-comp) is just untenable.
<br />
Let me recall you the reason: obviously physicalist-comp entails what 
<br />
we are calling comp in this list, that is, the hypothesis that &quot;we&quot; are 
<br />
locally emulable by a digital universal machine. I will call it 
<br />
&quot;indexical comp&quot; to insist on the difference. So:
<br />
<br />PHYSICALIST-COMP =&gt; INDEXICAL-COMP
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Universal Dovetailer Argument shows that comp entails that 
<br />
the physical appearances have to be justified *exclusively* by a 
<br />
self-duplication like first person (plural) indeterminacy: see the pdf:
<br />
<a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/SANE2004MARCHAL.pdf">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/SANE2004MARCHAL.pdf</a>
<br />
<br />The main idea is that INDEXICAL-COMP entails that we don't know which 
<br />
computations support our local states, and that they are a continuum of 
<br />
computational histories (computations + possible &quot;real&quot; oracles) going 
<br />
through those states. It can be argued that the first person &quot;physical&quot; 
<br />
appearances does emerge from a &quot;sum&quot; on all those computational 
<br />
histories, but only *as seen from those 1-person views*. But this 
<br />
entails that &quot;apparent physical universe&quot; are not necessarily 
<br />
computable objects. Actually, indexical comp entails it exists 
<br />
&quot;exploitable&quot; internal indeterminacies. A priori:
<br />
<br />INDEXICAL-COMP entails NOT PHYSICALIST-COMP.
<br />
<br />It gives to physics a more key role than in Tegmark's idea that the 
<br />
physical universe is a mathematical structure of a certain type. Comp 
<br />
(indexical comp) relate somehow physics to almost all mathematical 
<br />
structures (in a certain sense).
<br />
<br /><br />This constitutes the main critic of both your approach and Tegmark's 
<br />
one in the search of a TOE.  You still talk like if the mind body 
<br />
relation was a one-one relation, when the mind can only be associated 
<br />
to infinities of states/worlds. With indexical-comp there is no obvious 
<br />
notion of &quot;belonging to an universe&quot;. This has been discussed many 
<br />
times on the list with different people.
<br />
<br /><br />And then, once you realize the fundamental importance, assuming comp, 
<br />
of keeping distinct the possible views that a machine has to have about 
<br />
arithmetical or mathematical reality, and that physics emerges from one 
<br />
such points of view, then it is hard not to take into account the fact 
<br />
that any universal machine looking inward cannot not discover those 
<br />
points of view; indeed  they appear as inevitable modal or intensional 
<br />
variant of the godelian provability predicate. This makes Godel's 
<br />
theorems (and Lob's generalization, and then Solovay's one) key tools 
<br />
for extracting physicalness from number's extensions and their (lobian) 
<br />
intensions. And, and this is a major technical point, it makes this 
<br />
form of comp testable, by comparing the comp-physics with the empirical 
<br />
physics.
<br />
<br />Now I have discovered that those modal variant offer a transparent 
<br />
arithmetical interpretation of Plotinus hypostases. You are welcome in 
<br />
Siena in June where I will present my paper &quot;A purely Arithmetical, yet 
<br />
empirically falsifiable, Interpretation of Plotinus' Theory of Matter&quot;:

<br />
<br /><br /><br />Max, Juergen, you are still under the Aristotelian physicalist spell, 
<br />
and you are still putting the &quot;mind-body&quot; problem under the rug, I'm 
<br />
afraid. But I am aware it is a tradition since about 1500 years, when 
<br />
scientists, without much choice alas, did abandon theology to 
<br />
&quot;politicians&quot; ...
<br />
(scientific theology = theology done with the usual doubting procedure 
<br />
of the modest interrogating scientist).
<br />
<br /><br />Juergen, are you still denying the 1-3 distinction (like in our old 
<br />
conversations)?  Are you still thinking  that there is no 1-first 
<br />
person indeterminacy, or that such an indeterminacy has no role in the 
<br />
emergence of the physical laws?  Could you tell me at which step of the 
<br />
UDA you are stuck? (cf the UDA version of the SANE paper, ref above).
<br />
<br />I will asap try to explain the arithmetical version of the UDA, the one 
<br />
based on Godel and which can be seen as an arithmetical interpretation 
<br />
of Plotinus' main &quot;hypostasis&quot; (in case you prefer to read Plotinus 
<br />
instead of doing the duplication thought experiment, UDA, ...).
<br />
Some people asks me to do this without too much technics and I have to 
<br />
think about how to do that. I recall the UDA is already the &quot;non 
<br />
technical&quot; (yet rigorous) argument. The interview of the machine is of 
<br />
course formal and technical, and its only need (beside illustrating the 
<br />
UDA) comes from the desire to *explicitly*extracts the physical from 
<br />
numbers.
<br />

<br />
<br />PS This list, wisely unmoderated by Wei Dai, welcomes, for obvious 
<br />
reason giving the hardness and originality of the subject,  both 
<br />
professional and non professional. By professional I just mean people 
<br />
submitting theses, papers or books from time to time, even rarely. So, 
<br />
don't hesitate to send us &quot;call of paper&quot; related with comp and or 
<br />
everything-like or Everett-like TOEs. Thanks. And don't hesitate to 
<br />
participate, 'course!
