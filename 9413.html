<em class="quotelev1">&gt; achieved by passing through functional brain structures (all the

</em><br />
<br />I don't see why you are so sure about the necessity of passing through
<br />
non-functional brain structures going from you to Napoleon. After all,
<br />
there is a continuous sequence of intermediates between you and a
<br />
fertilized ovum, and on the face of it you have much more in common
<br />
mentally and physically with Napoleon than with a fertilized ovum.
<br />
However, technical feasibility is not the point. The point is that *if*
<br />
(let's say magically) your mind were gradually transformed, so that your
<br />
thoughts became more and more Napoleonic and less and less Standishian,
<br />
then by this process, you would become Napoleon. It is analogous to the
<br />
situation where the old man remembers being a young man, the young man
<br />
remembers being a child, but the old man does not remember being a
<br />
child. Although the old man has no recollection of being a child, he
<br />
still identifies as being the same person as that child because there is
<br />
a continuous series of intermediates each of whom recalls the one
<br />
immediately prior, if not the ones several stages earlier. This is what
<br />
people actually believe and act on, for example if a person is found
<br />
guilty of a crime which he has since genuinely forgotten committing. The
<br />
whole thrust of Parfit's philosophizing involves taking such normative
<br />
definitions of personal identity and, by trying them out in various
<br />
irregular situations and thought experiments, showing up their
<br />
deficiencies.
