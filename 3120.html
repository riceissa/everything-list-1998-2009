</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     The problem comes when some people consider death in this context.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I'll try to explain the insane view on this, but since I am not myself 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;insane I will probably not do so to the satisfaction of those that are.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I have mixed feelings about this line of reasoning, but I can offer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;some arguments in favor of it.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess you mean in favor of FIN.  How about against it too, since you 
<br />
have mixed feelings?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     The insane view however holds that the mind of the &quot;killed&quot; twin 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;somehow leaps into the surviving twin at the moment he would have been 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;killed.  Thus, except for the effect on other people who might have known 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the twins, the apparent death is of no consequence.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It's not that the mind &quot;leaps&quot;.  That would imply that minds have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;location, wouldn't it?  And spatial limits?  But that notion doesn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;work well.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Mind is not something that is localized in the universe in the way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that physical objects are.  You can't pin down the location of a mind.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Where in our brains is mind located?  In the glial cells?  In the neurons?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The whole neuron, or just the synapse?  It doesn't make sense to imagine 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that you can assign a numerical value to each point in the brain which 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;represents its degree of mind-ness.  Location is not a property of mind.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A computationalist would say that the mind is due to the functioning of 
<br />
the brain, and thus is &quot;located&quot; where the parts that function are.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is totally irrelevant.  Suffice it to say that a mind is 
<br />
associated with that brain, while a different mind would be associated with 
<br />
a different brain.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Hence we cannot speak of minds &quot;leaping&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remind you that _I_ never said they leap, could leap, or that such a 
<br />
thing is logically possible at all.  I said only that the insane hold such a 
<br />
view, which many posters on this list do.  Whatever they may mean by what 
<br />
they say, the effect is best described as saying they think minds leap.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;It makes more sense to think of mind as a relational phenomenon, like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;greater than&quot; or &quot;next to&quot;, but enormously more complicated.  In that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sense, if there are two identical brains, then they both exhibit the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;same relational properties.  That means that the mind is the same in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;both brains.  It's not that there are two minds each located in a brain, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;but rather that all copies of that brain implement the mind.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nope.  That make no (0) sense at all.  Sure, you could _define_ a mind 
<br />
to be some computation, as you seem to want, rather than being a specific 
<br />
implementation of that computation.  But that's a rather silly definition, 
<br />
since it's a specific implementation that would be associated with conscious 
<br />
thinking of a particular brain, and thus with measure.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, even a twin who dies could never have the same computation as 
<br />
one that lived, since &quot;HALT&quot; is obviously a significant difference in the 
<br />
computation.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Further support for this model can be found by considering things from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the point of view of that mind.  Let it consider the question, which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;brain am I in at this time?  Which location in the universe do I occupy?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;There is no way for the mind to give a meaningful, unique response to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this question.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's no way to know for sure, you mean.  OK, I agree with that.  You 
<br />
can still guess with high confidence.  In any case, there's still a fact of 
<br />
the matter, regardless of whether you know that fact.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Any answer will be both wrong and right.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That makes no sense.  The answer will be either wrong XOR right, for a 
<br />
particular mind; but you can't know for sure which of those minds is you.  
<br />
Hence you use indexical Bayesian reasoning or &quot;SSA&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;In this model, if the number of brains increases or decreases, the mind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;will not notice, it will not feel a change.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surviving minds won't notice a change.  Dead minds won't feel a thing, 
<br />
which is the reason death sucks.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;No introspection will reveal the number of implementations of itself that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;exist in a universe or a multiverse.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True, although with the SSA you can make some reasonable guesses.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;This is only dangerous if the belief is wrong, of course.  The contrary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;belief could be said to be dangerous in its way, if it were wrong as well.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(For example, it might lead to an urgent desire to build copies.)
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even supposing the logical belief to be wrong - what's so dangerous 
<br />
about building copies?  In any case, that would require a lot more tech than 
<br />
we have.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;    I have repeated pointed out the obvious consequence that if that were 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;true, then a typical observer would find himself to be much older than the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;apparent lifetime of his species would allow; the fact that you do not find 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;yourself so old gives their hypothesis a probability of about 0 that it is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the truth.  However, they hold fast to their incomprehensible beliefs.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This is a different argument and has nothing to do with the idea of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;leaping&quot;, which is mostly what I want to take issue with.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure it has to do with it, because it proves &quot;leaping&quot; doesn't happen.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;All this argument shows is that measure or probability decreases with time.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exactly right.  Thus no FIN.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The implications of this for how minds should regard changes in their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;numbers of implementation are complex and IMO unresolved.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nope, sorry, you're wrong again.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Measure decreases with time.  2) Number of implementations decreases 
<br />
with time.  3) Independently of that, logic says measure = # of 
<br />
implementations.  Are facts 1, 2, and 3 unrelated?  I think not.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;(For example, is adding a new implementation to be desired as much as the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;destruction of one implementation is to be avoided?
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That depends on your feelings (utility function).  Personally I'd say 
<br />
no.  In any case, having a baby is less important than not killing someone, 
<br />
I would say.  Human rights and all that, American of me.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;What about size, are big implementations better than small ones?
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't see why that would matter.  However, it might be argued that 
<br />
since a brain can mathematically implement a computation more than one way, 
<br />
a large brain might have more implementations than a small one does.  I hope 
<br />
that can be proven false.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;How about speed, does it matter if the implementations get out of phase, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;how much does it affect probability and measure?)
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I see no reason why that might matter.  If one brain is sped up, 
<br />
its measure per unit time will of course increase, but the total measure 
<br />
will only depend on how many computational steps the brain is eventually 
<br />
able to make before stopping.
