Hi Benjamin,
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno, list,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I've looked over Bruno's recent replies and, though I don't understand 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; much about Bruno's work or modal logic, etc., I wish to attempt a few 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; general remarks.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If Bruno is, as he puts it, &quot;[searching for] a general name for a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; field which studies fundamental type of faith, hope, fear, bets, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; etc.,&quot; then there are set of Ancient Greek words like _pistis_ (faith, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; belief, confidence), _pistos_ (confident, faithful), _pisteuticos_ 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (deserving of faith or belief), etc. So he could call it Pistics 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (sounds awful in English, though, because of that to which it sound 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; similar) or Pisteutics, etc. Or maybe there's some form of this word 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with a prefix which would make it sound less like, well, um, &quot;piss&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; plus a suffix, and, having considered it, I do think that that's an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; issue. Ancient Greek is too unfamiliar to me, otherwise I'd try to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; come up with such a word myself, keeping in mind the next paragraph:
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Well thanks. Pistology perhaps? I must say I like to use already 
<br />
existing terms, but I am still trying to understand why people seems so 
<br />
negative for the term &quot;theology&quot; ... I do think, perhaps unmodestly, 
<br />
that my approach belongs to the Classical Platonic Theology from 
<br />
Pythagoras to Proclus. (Of course Pythagoras comes before Plato but can 
<br />
be considered as its one of its main important precursor.)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What kind of belief? The focus in religion and theology on faith, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; belief, etc., seems (e.g., in &quot;Credo quia absurdum&quot;) to arise from a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stubbornness in the belief despite resultant seemingly contradictory 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or inadequate interpretations and understandings, and despite 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seemingly contradictory or inadequate confirmations, corroborations, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; knowledge (&quot;knowledge&quot; in the everyday sense).
</em><br />
<br /><br />Even just with the quantum hyp., or more deeply (I think) with just the 
<br />
comp hyp. I would say that we can say the same things about the notion 
<br />
of matter, or the notion of a primitive or primordial universe.
<br />
... Except that it is far more &quot;easier&quot; (cf UDA) to explain the 
<br />
epistemological contradictory nature of &quot;matter&quot; than of &quot;God&quot;, which I 
<br />
take as being PERHAPS just a more general notion of reality, like our 
<br />
common (with comp) unnameable ignorance, or even the 
<br />
Platonico-Aristotelian notion of Self, etc.
<br />
Today's physics take for granted implicitly a major part of Aristotle 
<br />
theology: the religious idea of Nature, and the idea of linking souls 
<br />
to bodies in some one-one manner.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is a special kind of belief, not the most general kind, and we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tend to distinguish it in English by calling it &quot;faith&quot; though &quot;faith&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does have other meanings. It tends to be motivated by valuations not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pertaining primarily to investigating and establishing the character 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the world. For Bruno, the question is, does he mean a kind of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; belief which, howsoever motivated, is stubborn? (in the face of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; resultant contradictory or inadequate understandings and in the face 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of contradictory &quot;knowledge&quot; or inadequate knwledge). For what it's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; worth, I think that the name most suitable will have the meaning!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   of this kind of belief.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You don't need to be stubborn to belief (or hope) in God, especially if 
<br />
you are willing to take seriously pre-christian theology. Of course if 
<br />
you define God by a white male senior sitting on a cloud, it seems to 
<br />
me reasonable to suppose some level of stubbornness indeed.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Are religion and theism just about belief? Maybe I'm wrong, because 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there's a lot of background here on the everything-list threads that I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't understand, so maybe I'm interpreting things in the wrong light, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but there seems to be a tendency here to regard religion as if it were 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fundamentally a cognitive discipline -- as if it consisted in a set of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cognitive beliefs about facts.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Not at all. I would say the driving force is just truth, or even Truth. 
<br />
Then the theology of machine is entirely dependant of the gap between 
<br />
proof and truth, which you can seen as a gap between cognitive ability 
<br />
and the Truth.
<br />
Perhaps I am just talking in a premature way, and I should explain more 
<br />
on the Godel-Lob provability-truth gap (G* \ G).
<br />
Note that the &quot;Truth About-a-Lobian-Machine&quot; is an unnameable notion BY 
<br />
the lobian machine, and it verifies my favorite axiom of &quot;...&quot;  which 
<br />
is that it has no name.
<br />
Note that I am not identifying God with Truth or with the Self. But in 
<br />
the whole family of Platonic thought, such notion are frequently 
<br />
related.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Religion has been many things and in some societies has taken many 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; forms in being involved in every aspect of life. But the core toward 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which it seems sometimes to retrench, seems to be affectivity and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; valuing with regard to decision-making, power, submission, governance 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and self-governance -- including valuing with regard to the greatest 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; powers in one's life and in the universe.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Science too, including affectivity, at least in practice.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (All the same, I fully admit that religion can get involved quite 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; widely, in valuings with regard to competence and work, and with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; regard to feelings and gratifications, and with regard to cognition 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and knowledge -- and, also, it can get involved in a variety of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cognitively based disciplines with regard to those just-listed 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subjects, so as to influence, e.g., education and community planning, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; productive arts, affective arts {painting, literature, music, drama, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cinema, etc., etc.} and, among the maths and sciences, cosmology, as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; well; and religion can get involved in the arenas -- political, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; economic, cultural, discussional, and in non-conflictual practices of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; corresponding kinds.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why do we associate religion especially with stubborn beliefs and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certain disputed issues of fact?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Because in our civilisation religion has been jeopardised by the state 
<br />
and politics.  From something which is supposed to free your mind, it 
<br />
has become a tool for manipulating anybody. But this for me  is a 
<br />
reason to come back to the original questioning and faith/hope, and 
<br />
then the comp theology (G*) can explain why the &quot;Truth&quot; can only be 
<br />
find in ourselves, and why the Lobian machine is 100% allergic to any 
<br />
form of authoritative argument.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; At the core of most of those things which we'd call religion in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; strict sense, the sense in which the word &quot;religion&quot; is usually meant 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; when the context is vague, are claims of miracles, miraculous powers 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in impassioned settings. Civilization tends to ask of religion that it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; renounce compulsion, tampering and interference, and provocation, but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has tended in some cases to leave the improbable unsupported claims 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about facts more or less alone.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Well, I do agree, except that this is not really theology or religion, 
<br />
it is &quot;theology or religion&quot; betrayed by &quot;politicians&quot; in the context 
<br />
of a complex human history.
<br />
Imagine a country-civilisation where anyone daring to say that the 
<br />
diagonal of a square is incommensurable with the sides of that square 
<br />
is exiled if not tortured, and this during centuries. I can imagine 
<br />
people being tired with the very idea of mathematics, but is that a 
<br />
reason to abandon mathematics, or even the term &quot;mathematics&quot;? I would 
<br />
say such an abandon would be a victory for the dishonest manipulating 
<br />
politicians.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; For one thing, many of us who are not religious tend to recognize that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we really don't know much about religion and society, we really don't 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; know that much about how religion may be needed in society -- we look 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at all the bloody religious history and at all the civilizing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; influence which major religions have exerted as well and don't know 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quite what to make of it all. Those of us who live far from academic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; communities are well aware that !
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  religion has roles in filling gaps in in the everyday lives of many 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; around us. That's us non-religious types. Most people in civilization 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are more or less religious. Anyway, this variously hesitant, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ambivalent, and belligerent confrontation with religion's ill 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; supported claims about facts may tend to create the impression among 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some that this is what religion is about -- those cognitive beliefs 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; standing unconquered by, and outside of and sometimes opposed to, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; science.
</em><br />
<br /><br />The idea I would like to develop is that G is (self) -science, G* is 
<br />
(self)-theology. At least G* warns us that if we put G* in science, 
<br />
that would make us inconsistent, and that would lead us to many 
<br />
problems, most probably of the bloody type.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But it's not at all everything that religion, or theism, monotheism, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; polytheism, etc. are about. (There is a kind of philosophical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;panpsychism&quot; which tends to be more cognitive in aim, but that's the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exception). And in fact the secularist-religious conflicts ongoing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; today are about all that further stuff, and not just about the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particular factual issues which sometimes are made their arena.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I think this comes from the use of religion as collective identity 
<br />
labels. That is why 99% of religious pseufo-beliefs are just 
<br />
inheritated by children from their parents. We got a religion like we 
<br />
got an identity cart almost. This is contingent.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So, again, I think that Bruno needs a name that carries the meaning of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a kind of belief, and not one that just says &quot;God.&quot;
</em><br />
<br /><br />But I just say &quot;theology&quot;. Then most people say that &quot;theology&quot; is 
<br />
related to God, but I take it as related to Truth, whatever it is. In 
<br />
Plato it is the science of Gods, and eventually of form of 
<br />
transcendence. With the comp hyp, the diagonalizations lead to a 
<br />
precise form of transcendence incarnated into the gap between G 
<br />
(provable provability logic) and G* (true provability logic).
<br />
Perhaps I should talk in term of a &quot;toy theology&quot;, but then, remember 
<br />
it is testable.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One added note: &quot;Agnosticism&quot; originally meant holding that it can't 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be known whether God exists -- &quot;un-knowledge-ism&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I would be interested if you could give me some links or references. I 
<br />
was using &quot;agnosticism&quot; in what I think is the modern sense of the 
<br />
world (to distinguish it from atheism). Plotinus has been confronted 
<br />
with a sceptical school pretending that human cannot pretend to access 
<br />
to true knowledge (including possible knowledge of God). That school is 
<br />
called &quot;Gnosticism&quot;, curiously enough.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is still used, I think, by some in that sense. Anyway, earlier in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; philosophical and theological traditions it was used in that sense. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Many also use it to mean that one is simply unsure -- I don't know 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whether God exists, but maybe you do, etc. There one simultanously 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suspects and doubts that God exists, i.e., neither believes nor 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; disbelieves, but has some awareness of the question and treats it as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suitable for belief-attitudes.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes that's it. And it is transparent with the use of modal logic.
<br />
The &quot;religious&quot; believer:   Bg    (He believes in the existence of God)
<br />
The &quot;atheistic believer&quot;:  B~g  (He believes in the non-existence of 
<br />
God)
<br />
The &quot;agnostic&quot;:   ~Bg &amp; ~B~g  (He does not believes in the existence of 
<br />
God and he does not believe in the non existence of God).
<br />
<br />Of course in that sense you can be agnostic for many reasons:  because 
<br />
you don't care, because you are waiting for more (positive or negative) 
<br />
evidences, or because nobody explains you in what sense the term God 
<br />
could possibly be used, etc.
<br />
I do think that the scientific attitude is agnostic, not only 
<br />
relatively to God notions, but to anything big, like universe(s), or 
<br />
... &quot;everything&quot;.
<br />
<br />Bruno
