<em class="quotelev1">&gt; how could you think acting &quot;good&quot; change anything in this matter ? And also 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what is &quot;good&quot; and what is not &quot;good&quot; and how you classify these ?
</em><br />
<br />I'm not sure I understand exactly what you are getting at, but here are
<br />
a couple of ideas that may help improve our communication.
<br />
<br />One issue with a multiverse concept is that since &quot;everything will happen&quot;
<br />
then it seems that we do not really make choices.  We don't have free
<br />
will.  When we choose between A and B, even if we take a long time to make
<br />
the choice, there will still be universes where we choose A and universes
<br />
where we choose B.  So it seems that we did not make a choice after all.
<br />
<br />To this I make two responses.  The first is that even though
<br />
everything will happen, not everything happens with equal measure,
<br />
or equal probability.  For a multiverse model to make sense we must
<br />
(in my opinion) include the notion that some universes are more likely
<br />
and have greater measure than others.  Otherwise we cannot explain why
<br />
natural laws continue to work and our universe does not degenerate all
<br />
around us into chaos.
<br />
<br />Given that different universes in the multiverse have different measure,
<br />
this puts a different light on choice.  Although it may be true that
<br />
we will make both choices in some universes, by our process of careful
<br />
thought and consideration, we do make a difference.  We change the
<br />
measure of the possible universes.
<br />
<br />If we just flip a coin to make the choice, then both outcomes will
<br />
happen with equal probability and both universes will have equal measure.
<br />
But if we think about it carefully and then decide to do A, that gives
<br />
more measure to the universe where A happens.  If we consider all versions
<br />
of ourselves, most of them will make that same decision, and most measure
<br />
will go into the universes where that is the choice.
<br />
<br />So the nature of choice in a multiverse is that it is a matter of changing
<br />
the measure of the universes where the consequences happen.
<br />
<br />The second point related to this is that some people may object that even
<br />
the appearance of making a choice is an illusion, because our thoughts
<br />
are determined by events and causes outside of ourselves.  This is an old
<br />
argument and is not specific to multiverse models.  Suffice it to say
<br />
that there is an extensive philosophical literature, and in particular
<br />
the doctrine of &quot;compatibilism&quot; describes how we can think of making
<br />
meaningful choices even though we may live in a deterministic universe.
<br />
<br />Hopefully these ideas will help you see how it does make sense to make
<br />
choices and take actions even in a multiverse.  This is not specific
<br />
to my thought experiment, it relates to everyday, ordinary action.
<br />
Every breath we take is a choice to live.  Even in a multiverse it makes
<br />
sense to think of our actions in this way.
<br />
<br />As far as your final question about what I meant by &quot;good&quot; in my
<br />
experiment, it's not very important what the details are.  I just
<br />
want to distinguish relatively pleasant events from those which are
<br />
not so pleasant.  The main point was to shed light on the question of
<br />
how we can reconcile two models of experience: a linear model where
<br />
we pass through life in a straight line from birth to death; or a
<br />
random-sampling model where every moment of every person's life exists
<br />
somewhat independently, and we could imagine a probability distribution
<br />
over those observer-moments which determines how likely they are to
<br />
be experienced.  My thought experiment was an attempt to describe a
<br />
situation where the two views would seem to give different answers
<br />
about what we would do, to help us understand how they differ.
<br />
