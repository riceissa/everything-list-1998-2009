<br />In my opinion, computation universality is the *only* prerequisite for the 
<br />
possibility of SASs, so I agree that the correct question to ask is &quot;can a 
<br />
CA with bi-directional time be computation universal?&quot; I think that the 
<br />
answer is almost certainly &quot;yes&quot;. Let me explain why.
<br />
<br />First, lets get a really clear picture of what we're talking about. I want 
<br />
to consider a CA with only 2 spacial dimensions, because I find it easy to 
<br />
picture the resulting 3D block universe. (It's too hard for me to picture 
<br />
the 4D block universe that results from a 3+1D CA.) Lets imagine that the 
<br />
spacial planes of this CA are stacked on top of each other, so that the 
<br />
block universe looks like a tall tower, with the time dimension being the 
<br />
&quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot; directions.
<br />
<br />Now, the state of any particular cell of this block universe is determined 
<br />
by the 3x3 square of cells directly below it, as well as the 3x3 square of 
<br />
cells above it. For the rest of this discussion, lets refer to any 
<br />
particular chosen cell as the &quot;center cell&quot;, and the 18 cells below and 
<br />
above it as the &quot;neighborhood&quot;. For every possible combination of states of 
<br />
those 18 cells, the rules of the CA dictate what state the center cell must 
<br />
be in.
<br />
<br />Now, lets imagine that the cells in this particular CA have three possible 
<br />
states - lets call them &quot;black&quot; (empty), blue, and red. Lets set up the 
<br />
rules of the CA in the following way. First of all, lets consider a &quot;center 
<br />
cell&quot; whose neighborhood contains nothing but blue cells and empty cells. 
<br />
Lets define our CA rule so that, in such a case, the state of the center 
<br />
cell will either be blue or black, and this will be determined only by the 
<br />
3x3 square of cells below it. In fact, lets go ahead and use Conway's life 
<br />
rule here. So, if the lower 9 cells are all blue and the upper 9 cells are 
<br />
any combination of blue and black, the center cell must be black. And so on.
<br />
<br />Now lets imagine the exact same thing for the red cells, except this time 
<br />
the state of the center cell is determined by the 9 cells *above* the 
<br />
center cell. For any 18-cell neighborhood that contains *only* red cells 
<br />
and black cells, the center cell will either be red or black, as determined 
<br />
by the upper 9 cells.
<br />
<br />Basically, what we have so far is a universe which contains blue &quot;matter&quot; 
<br />
which moves &quot;forward&quot; in time (i.e. upwards along the tower), and red 
<br />
&quot;anti-matter&quot; which moves backwards in time (downwards along the tower). 
<br />
Each kind of matter, in isolation, will follow the old familiar rules of 
<br />
Conway's life. If you were to &quot;grow&quot; an instance of the universe containing 
<br />
only red matter or only blue matter, it would be indistinguishable from 
<br />
Conway's life. And of course, we know that Conway's life is computation 
<br />
universal. So this universe is capable of containing SASs.
<br />
<br />Now, of course, we need to define what happens when matter and anti-matter 
<br />
interact. In other words, for every possible combination of 18 neighbors 
<br />
that contains both red and blue cells, we need to specify what the state of 
<br />
the center cell should be. It should be clear that there is a Vast number 
<br />
of possibilities here, each representing a unique universe. We can consider 
<br />
the simplest possible rule, which is that the center cell is always empty 
<br />
for any neighborhood which contains both red and blue cells. Perhaps under 
<br />
that rule, matter and anti-matter will tend to obliterate each other. I can 
<br />
imagine a whole range of other possible rules, some of which cause red and 
<br />
blue gliders to bounce off of each other, etc. Clearly we can imagine 
<br />
universes which contain large, isolated chunks of blue matter or red 
<br />
matter, and those portions of the universe would be capable of containing 
<br />
SASs. We can imagine stray red gliders occasionally wandering into realms 
<br />
of blue space, and vice-versa, causing subtle changes, but not necessarily 
<br />
destroying any of the SASs there. It seems to me that this is enough to 
<br />
show that it must be possible for CAs with bi-directional time to contain 
<br />
universal computation, and therefore, potentially, SASs.
<br />
<br />After saying all of this, I'm realizing that I don't really need to 
<br />
consider these bi-directional CAs to make the original points I was trying 
<br />
to make. I can just as easily consider a &quot;normal&quot; CA like Conway's life (or 
<br />
some other hypothetical CA that's more conducive to life). We can still do 
<br />
the trick of running through all the possible &quot;block universes&quot; of a given 
<br />
size, and discarding all of those that don't represent a valid evolution of 
<br />
the rule in question. If our universes are big enough, some of the 
<br />
remaining ones will contain patterns that look like SASs. Are these 
<br />
patterns really conscious? At what point in the testing process did they 
<br />
become conscious? And so on. However, it does sort of tighten the screws on 
<br />
the question to recognize that there are some kinds of universes which 
<br />
can't be computed in the &quot;normal&quot; way at all.
