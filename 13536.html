<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;save&quot; the notion of consciousness, free will, responsibility, qualia,

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; (first)-persons, and many notions like that.  Tthe &quot;only&quot; price: the

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; notion of matter looses is fundamental character, and we have to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; explain matter without postulating it as usual ...). We have to come
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; back (assuming comp) to Plato, or better Plotinus, Proclus, ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; How is assuming comp any better than believing in the personal God?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Because in general it is hard to make third person testable statements
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on personal God.
</em><br />
<br />Here you are appealing to the same thing as I was:  It's hard!
<br />
Life is a journey.  You don't get the answers all at once.  But the
<br />
joy is in the discovering.
<br />
More below on my statement about comp being a lot of work.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Also, with comp, machines HAVE TO be &quot;theological
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine&quot;. That is, comp does not prevent some &quot;mystical&quot; (true but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unprovable) beliefs:  on the contrary, comp makes them obligatory (at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; least for the ideally correct machines).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; With comp we can argue that consciousness is already such a mystical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; state. It is a state such that  you have &quot;visions&quot; making you belief in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;a reality&quot;. Even cats can believe in invisible mouse, when hunting!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />The mystical is very much what God is about.  It is actually anti-God
<br />
to proclaim (as religious fundamentalists do) that we (as a very small
<br />
subset of reality) have all knowledge.  If such a claim were true,
<br />
then such a &quot;knower&quot; would be in a static state, rather UNlike
<br />
consciousness.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The closer thing to consciousness for the lobian machine is the &quot;state
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of being consistent&quot;. With machine talking first order arithmetics, &quot;to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be consistent&quot; can be identified (actually by 1930 Godel Completeness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theorem) with &quot;having a unameable reality&quot; capable of satisfying your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; set of beliefs. and &quot;to be consistent&quot; belongs to machines' corona [G*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; minus G]. Indeed, by Godel second theorem, the machine statement &quot;to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consistent&quot; is true (as we can know for simple machine) but unprovable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by the machine. After Godel we know that machine can understand/infer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that any of their beliefs in a reality has to be theological, even the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; belief in a physical reality, or whatever.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Few people seems to realize the immensity of impact of Godel's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discovery (to begin by Godel himself as compared to Emil Post or Alan
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Turing, ...). Before Godel, after the work of Cantor, mathematicians
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; were hoping to secure the many use of infinities in math by the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; finistic use of their names in finistic theories. After Godel, we know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that we cannot secure the finistic realm itself and that we have to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; invoke higher infinities just to talk on those finite things. Before
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Godel we could have believe that the infinite can be secure by the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; finite. After Godel we know we have to rely on the infinites just to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; get a tiny scratch idea of what the finite things are capable of. This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has given rise to the branch of logic known as &quot;model theory&quot;, for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; example, where infinite objects are used to give clues on finite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theories.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />Recalling my comment about &quot;a lot of work&quot;, this all is very
<br />
interesting (I am also reading Torkel Franzen's book), but I'm betting
<br />
that (as it happens a lot) when you get to the top of the mountain you
<br />
will find that the theists have already been there, and that there is
<br />
yet another higher peak in the distance.  The theists will have been
<br />
there through faith, not the anti-evidential &quot;faith&quot; of the
<br />
fundamentalists, but the faith that is believing what is not seen,
<br />
being able to &quot;see&quot; the whole without having to put it together from
<br />
parts like the Tower of Babel.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Note that I am not equating consciousness and consistency. But I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; open to the idea that consciousness is related to unconscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (automatic, preprogrommed) self-interrogation of self-consistency. This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; makes possible to interpret Helmholtz theory of perception (as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unconscious bet) in the lobian self-referential discourses.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Because we got that &quot;mystical state&quot; at birth since most probably
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; billions years, we tend to be a little blase about it, and this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explains why we have to do some work to abstract from long-time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prejudices, but then that is what science is all about (as Plato and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Descartes have seen).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (For the &quot;modalist&quot;, consciousness is not &quot;Dt&quot;, but &quot;Dt?&quot;. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interrogation mark remind that Dt belongs to G* minus G.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have to go by now and I will try to explain soon why such an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inference of &quot;Dt?&quot; gives some advantage relatively to some very general
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relative survival goal (mainly it gives a relative speed-up) ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />Is not &quot;Dt?&quot; equal to &quot;the search for truth&quot;?  But the weakness of
<br />
simple consistency is the unanswered question, &quot;What is truth?&quot;  Truth
<br />
is not found simply through consistency when we reject the truth that
<br />
is all around.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Comp seems like a lot of work.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes indeed. Two times more work than materialist are used to think. We
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have to isolate a &quot;theory of mind&quot; AND then, it remains to test the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical laws forced by that theory of mind, as the UDA and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arithmetical UDA justifies (or should justify).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But the scientific attitude always asks for &quot;lot of works&quot;,as I just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; said above.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />Perhaps you should use a different word than &quot;scientific&quot; for your
<br />
*good* &quot;attitude&quot; of open-mindedness, modesty and humility, searching
<br />
for truth, since the word &quot;scientific&quot; tends to be still connected
<br />
with the pre-Godelian reductionism.  I would not put up a dichotomy
<br />
between this attitude and a belief in God.  But perhaps your use of
<br />
the word &quot;scientific&quot; is based on your conviction to use the word as
<br />
you think it &quot;should&quot; (assuming comp? ;) be used, rather like your use
<br />
of the word &quot;theology&quot;.  Actually I'm starting to think that you
<br />
really aren't that far off in your use of the word &quot;theology&quot; for the
<br />
search for truth.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<br />&quot;Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you

rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and

easy and my burden is light.&quot; -- Jesus
