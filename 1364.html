From: Russell Standish &lt;R.Standish.domain.name.hidden&gt;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) As you say yourself, a non-wff is just a meaningless string of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; symbols, i.e. one of the bitstrings making up the Schmidhuber
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; plenitude. As pointed out, the Schmidhuber plenitude does seem to have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a natural measure defined on it through K-complexity and Turing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interpretability. The non-wff strings, as simple the K-incompressible,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or random ones, however, they are still formal entities, and so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contribute to the discussion of issues related to measure. I also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; belief that they are interpretable as well, just as Rorschach plots
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are interpretable, even when they have no information content at all.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The reason that they're interpretable, is that they are close to a wff
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that has information.
</em><br />
<br />This appears to me to be some kind of conflation of (at least) the two
<br />
schemes discussed earlier (my axiom-based one, and our earlier bit-based
<br />
one) - it is certainly distinct from the basic axiom-based one that you have
<br />
been criticising. Since this (axiom-based) scheme is not bit-based as it
<br />
stands, the 'Schmidhuber plenitude' assumption does not apply to it, and so
<br />
I can legitimately dismiss non-wffs as irrelevant to the dragon analysis as
<br />
far as my scheme is concerned.
<br />
<br />However, let me follow your route (as best I can) for a little. I presume
<br />
you must be choosing a particular interpretation of bits corresponding
<br />
simply to symbols. Some such strings lead to wff's, theories, and, for a
<br />
minority of these, (the specification of) universes. Others are meaningless
<br />
strings (non-wffs). I think you would need to clarify:
<br />
1) How any *additional* interpretation of bits (over and above that leading
<br />
to symbols) could lead to actual universes.
<br />
2) What actual role (if any) TM's play.
<br />
3) Whether bitstrings could be immediately interpreted as anything other
<br />
than symbol strings.
<br />
4) How K-complexity (if relevant) could be compatible with nonsense bits.
<br />
(I must say I also have a severe problem with a bitstring corresponding to a
<br />
non-wff being interpretable as anything other than the non-wff itself.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) There is a curious duality here relating the Tegmark plenitude with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Schmidhuber one, that I've not yet figured out. On one hand, all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consistent mathematical systems are based on a finite set of axioms,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and a finite set of transition rules for deriving theorems. These can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be encoded as a bitstring and a UTM, so all members of the Tegmark
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ensemble must be contained within the Schmidhuber one.
</em><br />
<br />Note that many other systems (for example pre-programmed microchips, brains,
<br />
other mathematical mappings) can implement transitional rules - there is
<br />
nothing special about UTM sequential processors.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; There is no 'defining away' of the white rabbit problem. It sounds to me
</em><br />
as
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; if you are confusing white rabbit universes with logically inconsistent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; universes (the latter should not be able to exist in anyone's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; book).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I guess this is the contentious point. Dreams appear to be examples of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logically inconsistent universes. I would explain them in terms of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain's capacity to interpret meaningless data streams generated in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the brain during sleep. I guess you would need to explain either that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dreams are in fact logically consistent, or that somehow this example
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doesn't count.
</em><br />
<br />I can only think that we have fundamentally differing conceptions of what
<br />
constitutes a logically inconsistent universe. For me, a logically
<br />
inconsistent universe would be one where (P AND (NOT-P)) is true somewhere
<br />
within it (and from which *any* statement is derivable); this would
<br />
presumably have to fall out from some logically inconsistent theory. Unless
<br />
we are straying beyond the realms of science here, dreams are quite
<br />
comfortably compatible with physics (apart conceivably from the 'qualia'
<br />
problem - which would apply at least as much to the waking state and
<br />
shouldn't be relevant to logical consistency anyway). If physical laws can
<br />
accommodate dreams there is not even physical inconsistency, let alone
<br />
logical inconsistency. (If by chance you are referring to dream *content*,
<br />
these can hardly be considered as universes, but dream images anyway are
<br />
logically consistent, though dreamed flying rabbits obviously don't have to
<br />
conform to our physical laws.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; a) The dragon universe is the outcome of a mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; description. In the sense we use dragon here of being non-lawlike, we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; may suppose that they are the outcome of a very complex mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; description. As we well know, the measure of such universes is much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; smaller than the very lawlike universe we inhabit.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; We don't know this unless we can find a proof. In fact the analysis that
</em><br />
we
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; developed earlier can provide a strong indication of the small measure
</em><br />
of
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; dragon universes. (See my web pages.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This result follows directly from the universal measure or universal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prior employed in the Schmidhuber plenitude.
</em><br />
<br />If you are referring to our earlier derived explanation for the paucity of
<br />
dragons, that was what I was referring to as well. If not, please elucidate.
<br />
<br />Thanks
<br />
<br />Alastair
