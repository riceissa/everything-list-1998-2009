</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; somewhere near the answer.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Not really. You can have a two-way causal interdependene between two
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; systems without them both having th esame structure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think you are assuming a separateness of structure that does not exist.
</em><br />
<br /><br />It obviously does exist , up to a point. I am separate form this
<br />
keyboard.
<br />
(and let's not confuse separateness and difference...)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is one and one only structure.
</em><br />
<br />If you want ot look at it that way. But it is no
<br />
undifferentiated within itself.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; We are all part of it. There is no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concept of 'separate' to be had.
</em><br />
<br />yes there is: spatial separation.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Absolutely everything is included in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure. No exceptions. Space, atoms, scientists, qualia. All
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interactions at all 'scales' (scale itself) are all interactions between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different parts of the one structure. To interact at all is to interact
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with another part of the structure.
</em><br />
<br />&quot;another&quot; in what sense ? You just said there is *no* concept
<br />
of separation.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  The idea of there being anything else
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ('not' the structure) is meaningless. If there is any 'thing' in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure then the balance of the structure expressed a perfect un-thing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is nothing else. That is the coincept I am exploring.
</em><br />
<br />None of that has anything to do with your claim that there is
<br />
a single *type* of structure, and that everything is composed of
<br />
recursive combinations of its instances.
<br />
<br />It may be the case that everything is ultimately part of one strucutre,
<br />
but
<br />
that does not imply that everything within the Great Strucutre is
<br />
self-similar.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Note that we don't actually have to know what S(.) is to make a whole pile
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; of observations of properties of organisations of it that apply regardless
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; of the particular S(.). It may be we never actually get to sort out the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; specifics of S(.)! (I have an idea, but it doesn't matter from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; view of understanding qualia as another property of the structure like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; atoms).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; In Bruno's terms the structure of S(.) is what he calls 'objective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; I would say that in science the first person view has primacy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Epistemic or Ontic ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; These are just words invented by members of the structure.
</em><br />
<br />So is &quot;structure&quot;.
<br />
<br />That wasn't a problem before, why should it be now.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I'll try.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The structure delivers qualia in the first person. Those qualia are quite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; valid 'things' (virtual matter)..organisation/behaviour of structure.
</em><br />
<br />Qualia are not ust organisation and behaviour, or there
<br />
would be no hard problem.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Their presentation bestows intrinsic knowledge as a measurement to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; embedded structure member called the scientist. This is knowledge as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intrinsic intentionality.
</em><br />
<br />Are yu saying that qualia are marked by intentionality ?
<br />
That would be novel.
<br />
<br />&quot;,, qualia are intrinsic, consciously accessible, NON-INTENTIONAL
<br />
features of sense-data and other non-physical phenomenal objects that
<br />
are responsible for their phenomenal character.&quot;
<br />
<br />S.E.P, my emphasis.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Within the experiences is regularity which can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then be characterised as knowledge attributed to some identified behaviour
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the structure. This attribution is only an attribution as to behaviour
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the structure, not the structure. These attributions can be used by a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; another  scientist in their 'first person' world.
</em><br />
<br />I still think &quot;strcuture&quot; is an unhappy term for soemthign which
<br />
cannot be reduced to abstract relations and behaviour.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; All of this is derived from a first person presentation of a measurement.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ergo science is entirely first operson based.
</em><br />
<br />The fact that science happens to be performed by persons
<br />
doesn't make it irreducibly first-personal. That would
<br />
depend on whether persons can remove themselves from
<br />
scientific descriptions. As it happens they can. That
<br />
is still true with much-misunderstood issue of
<br />
quantum &quot;observer&quot; involvement, since
<br />
that is really apparatus-involvement. No observer
<br />
ever influenced an experiment without changing the settings of some
<br />
apparatus.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Epistemic and Ontic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; characters are smatter throughout this description. I could label them all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but you already know and the process adds nothing to the message or to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sorting out how it all works.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;  I'd say that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; we formulate abstractions that correlate with agreed appearances within
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; first person view. However, the correspo0ndence between the underlying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure and the formulate abstractions is only that - a correlation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; models are not the structure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; *Could* they be the structure ? if it necessarily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the case that the &quot;structure&quot; cannot be modelled, then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; it is perhaps no strcuture at all.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Which is the simpler and more reasonable basis upon which to explore the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe:
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) The universe is literally constructed by some sort of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'empirical_law_in_ a_certain_context embodiment machine' by means unknown
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that has appearances that cannot be predicted by empirical laws.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (logically equivalent to &quot;the laws of nature are invoked by the purple
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; baloon people of the horsehead nebula&quot;)
</em><br />
<br />????
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) The universe is a structure of which we are a part and which also has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the property of delivering appearances of itself to us within which is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; regularity that can be captured mathematically.
</em><br />
<br />This is a combination of two claims:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;2a) The universe is a structure properly-so-called of which we are a
<br />
part and
<br />
&nbsp;which also has the property of delivering appearances of itself to us
<br />
within which is
<br />
regularity that can be captured mathematically, with no residue, so
<br />
that
<br />
everything is full expressible in mathematical, structural and
<br />
relational
<br />
terms. (ie eliminative physicalism)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;2b) The universe is a &quot;structure&quot;  which we are a part and, but
<br />
contains
<br />
irreducibly non-relational and non-functional aspects (and is therefore
<br />
not a structure in the strict sense of the term)
<br />
&nbsp;which also has the property of delivering appearances of itself to us
<br />
within which is
<br />
regularity that can be captured mathematically and also aspects that
<br />
cannot
<br />
be so capture, leading to a Hard Problem. (property dualism)
