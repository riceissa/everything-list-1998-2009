</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno, I was wondering if there are anyn concrete examples to help
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; clarify what you mean by numbers studied by numbers.  Are there things
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for example, that 31 could know about 6, or are such things only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible with or between very big numbers?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />Do you remember that the partial computable functions are recursively  
<br />
enumerable?
<br />
Do you remember the phi_i: computing partial functions from N to N.
<br />
<br />phi_1, phi_2, phi_3, phi_4, ....
<br />
<br />You can associate a computation to a proof in Robinson Arithmetic of a  
<br />
statement like phi_31(6) = 745.
<br />
The idea is to use the original Robinson Arithmetic as the basic  
<br />
universal machine.
<br />
<br />A description of a computation would be a representation of that  
<br />
computation in arithmetic. And Robinson arithmetic is already Sigma_1- 
<br />
complete and thus, if there is a computation of phi_31(6) = 745, there  
<br />
will be proof of that fact in Robinson Arithmetic.
<br />
<br />The difference is really a question of level, and is basically  
<br />
(simplifying a little bit) the difference between the fact that
<br />
<br />phi_31(6) = 745, is true and provable in RA, and the fact
<br />
<br />provable(phi_31(6) = 745) is true and provable in RA
<br />
<br />The numbers involved will not be so great, but can hardly be very  
<br />
little.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I still have a confusion as to what you label a computation and a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; description.
</em><br />
<br />A computation is an abstract object. It is what is usually described  
<br />
by a description of a computation. It is a sequence of step of a  
<br />
universal machine. Remember that you can also enumerate the partial  
<br />
computable functions from NXN to N, noted with P capital:
<br />
<br />Phi_1, Phi_2, Phi_3, Phi_4, ....
<br />
<br />Let me say that a number u is universal if   Phi_u(x,y) = phi_x(y) for  
<br />
all x and y. x is the number-program, and y is the number-data. By  
<br />
chosing RA as basic system, all those numbers are well defined. It can  
<br />
be shown that there will be an infinity of such universal number u1,  
<br />
u2, u3 ... (enumerable but not recursively enumerable!).
<br />
<br />A computation is a finite or infinite sequences of step of some u_i on  
<br />
some input x.
<br />
A description of a (finite piece of) a computation is a nummber code  
<br />
for an arithmetical description of such a computation.
<br />
<br />The difference between computation and description of a computation is  
<br />
similar to the difference between 1+1=2, and the Gödel number of the  
<br />
formula &quot;1+1 =2&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Do you believe if we create a computer in this physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe that it could be made conscious,
</em><br />
<br />But a computer is never conscious, nor is a brain. Only a person is  
<br />
conscious, and a computer or a brain can only make it possible for a  
<br />
person to be conscious relatively to another computer. So your  
<br />
question is ambiguous.
<br />
It is not my brain which is conscious, it is me who is conscious. My  
<br />
brain appears to make it possible for my consciousness to manifest  
<br />
itself relatively to you. Remember that we are supposed to no more  
<br />
count on the physical supervenience thesis.
<br />
It remains locally correct to attribute a consciousness through a  
<br />
brain or a body to a person we judged succesfully implemented locally  
<br />
in some piece of matter (like when we say yes to a doctor).  But the  
<br />
piece of matter is not the subject of the consciousness. It is only  
<br />
the &quot;abstract person&quot; or &quot;program&quot; who is the subject of consciousness.
<br />
To say a brain is conscious consists in doing Searle's'mistake when he  
<br />
confused levels of computations in the Chinese room, as well seen  
<br />
already by Hofstadter and Dennett in Mind's I.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; or do you count all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appearance of matter to be only a description of a computation and not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; capable of &quot;true&quot; computation?
</em><br />
<br />&quot;appearance of matter&quot; is a qualia. It does not describe anything but  
<br />
is a subjective experience, which may correspond to something stable  
<br />
and reflecting the existence of a computation (in Platonia) capable to  
<br />
manifest itself relatively to you.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Do you believe that the only real
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computation exists platonically and this is the only source of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious experience?
</em><br />
<br />Computations and their relative implementations exist only in  
<br />
platonia, yes. But even in Platonia, they exist in multiple relative  
<br />
version, all defined eventually through many multiple relations  
<br />
between numbers.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  If so I find this confusing, as could there not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be multiple levels?
</em><br />
<br />But they are multiple levels of computations in Platonia or  
<br />
Arithmetic. Even a huge number of them. That is why we have to take  
<br />
into account the first person indeterminacies.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; For example would a platonic turing machine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simulating another turing machine, simulating a mind be consicous?
</em><br />
<br /><br />A 3-machine is never conscious. A 3-entity is never conscious. Only a  
<br />
person is. First person can only be associated with the infinities of  
<br />
computations computing them in Platonia.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so, how does that differ from a platonic turing machine simulating a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical reality with matter, simulating a mind?
</em><br />
<br /><br />You will have to introduce a magical (assuming comp) selection  
<br />
principle for attaching, in a persistent way, a mind to that &quot;physical  
<br />
reality&quot; simulation. The mind can only be attached to an infinity of  
<br />
such relative simulations, and this is why if that mind look at itself  
<br />
below its substitution level he will find a trace of those  
<br />
computations. Comp says you have to make the statistic on all the  
<br />
computations. So the Physical has to be a sum on all those computations.
<br />
That such computations statistically interfere is not so difficult to  
<br />
show. That the comp interference gives the apparent quantum one is not  
<br />
yet discarded.
<br />
<br />I think you are not taking sufficiently into account the first person  
<br />
(hopefully plural) indeterminacy in front of the universal dovetailer,  
<br />
(or arithmetic) which defined the space of all computations.
<br />
<br />Does this help a bit?
<br />
