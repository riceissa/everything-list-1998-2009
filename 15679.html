Hi Ronald,

</em><br />
<br /><br />Your remark is a bit &quot;out of the reasoning&quot;, and as such is a bit  
<br />
unclear to me. The reasoning start from the mechanist hypothesis,  
<br />
which I take as the willingness to accept an artificial digital brain,  
<br />
with all the usual local sense of the world. It is a quasi-operational  
<br />
definition. Strictly speaking this does not presuppose your  
<br />
immateriality, still less the immateriality of the physical universe,  
<br />
this will appear in the conclusion of the reasoning.
<br />
I suggest that you follow the KIM thread and that you interrupt when  
<br />
anything seems unclear to you. Meanwhile I sketch (only) basic  
<br />
explanation below.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; How is there any mathematics with nothing to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conceive of it?
</em><br />
<br /><br />I am afraid that, Like Einstein and some other physicists, you have a  
<br />
&quot;conventionalist&quot; view of mathematics. This explain probably why  
<br />
Einstein never commented on the work of Gödel (despite their  
<br />
friendship in Princeton). The work of &quot;modern&quot; logician is just NOT  
<br />
understandable by any &quot;mathematical-conventionalist&quot;. I could argue  
<br />
that many results by logicians, including the incompleteness  
<br />
phenomenon, sign the end of the very possibility of conventionalism.
<br />
<br />So, to answer your question, now we have very good reason to believe  
<br />
that mathematics has something to conceive of it: a mathematical  
<br />
reality.
<br />
The clearer way to see this is probably the discovery that the realm  
<br />
of the natural numbers, conceived together with their additive and  
<br />
multiplicative structure, escapes the power of any (axiomatizable)  
<br />
theory. There is just no complete theory of everything capable of just  
<br />
enumerating the truth about numbers. The reality of numbers escape our  
<br />
theoretical power, and provably so if we add the hypothesis that we  
<br />
are machines (or even super-machines or super...super-machines: the  
<br />
result is quite general).
<br />
<br />So mathematics has a proper field of study that we can aptly call the  
<br />
mathematical reality. Now we know that such a reality is an infinite  
<br />
reservoir of surprises. Even the apparently less rich arithmetic is  
<br />
such an infinite reservoir.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What are the computations running on, where did the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; program come from and still what is it running on. It should still
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; take a net amount of enegry to run computations.
</em><br />
<br /><br />If we abstract from the fact that in practice we have to write program  
<br />
and data, and read the results, it can be shown that computation per  
<br />
se does not need energy. There exist purely reversible universal  
<br />
computer. They compute without dissipating any energy. For example  
<br />
they never erase information, because it has been shown that this  
<br />
necessarily dissipate heath.
<br />
<br />But of course this is a physicalist answer, and has nothing to do with  
<br />
the fact that, if we assume comp, eventually energy itself is an  
<br />
emergent phenomenon, and that energy, as time and space will emerge  
<br />
from the mind, and the mind itself emerges from the computations.
<br />
<br />So, where does those computations come from? The computations are  
<br />
encoded, in many different ways, in the additive and multiplicative  
<br />
relations which exists among the natural numbers. So if you agree that  
<br />
a truth like &quot;34 is an even number&quot; or &quot;17 is a prime number&quot; is an  
<br />
atemporal truth not depending on anything contingent, the I could show  
<br />
to you that all the propositions having the shape of &quot;the machine with  
<br />
number X stop on input Y after 3456655409812228 steps&quot; are true or  
<br />
false and this independently of us in the same sense as above. Those  
<br />
truth are atemporal, even &quot;aphysical&quot;, yet, machine will develop many  
<br />
growing set of &quot;beliefs&quot; about time, space and actuality (and  
<br />
discourses about things like that), albeit such development itself is  
<br />
atemporal and aspatial if I can say.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps, if not, just follow the slow explanation to Kim.  
<br />
Those explanations are slow because I am willing to work on any  
<br />
infinitesimal details, so please feel free to ask anything. Well, to  
<br />
be sure, the explanations are also slow because Kim and me appreciate  
<br />
to digress, also, but that's part of the fun.
<br />
<br /><br />Bruno
