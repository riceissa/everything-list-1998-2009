<br />
Hi everyone:
<br />
<br />Below is a simplified version of the approach I have been working on 
<br />
for so long.
<br />
<br />I would appreciate comments.
<br />
<br />Thank you.
<br />
<br />-----
<br />
<br />Definitions:
<br />
<br />1) Object: That which has/represents/expresses a set of properties.
<br />
<br />2) List of all properties: The list of all possible properties 
<br />
objects can have.  The list can not be empty since there is at least 
<br />
one object: A Nothing.  A Nothing has at least one property - 
<br />
emptiness.  The list is most likely at least countably infinite and 
<br />
is assumed herein to be so.  Any list can be divided into two 
<br />
sub-lists - the process of defining two objects - a definitional 
<br />
pair.  The set of all possible subsets of the list is a power set and 
<br />
therefore uncountably infinite.  Therefore there are uncountably 
<br />
infinite objects.  The list is itself a property of an object =&gt; 
<br />
Property: expresses all properties; Object: the list.  Thus the list 
<br />
is a member of itself.  It is a self booting, infinitely nested self reference.
<br />
<br />3) Physical Reality: Logically objects should be allowed to interact 
<br />
because there is no logical reason to preclude this 
<br />
possibility.   Interaction means that they change each others 
<br />
properties thus transforming into two different objects by such 
<br />
interaction.  The simplest way for some objects to interact is to 
<br />
mutually alter just one property.  Call this property Physical 
<br />
Reality.  It would have many degrees [why not?].
<br />
<br />4) Existence: A non zero degree of Physical Reality.
<br />
<br /><br />----------------------------
<br />
<br /><br />Proposal: The existence of our universe and other universes and their 
<br />
dynamics are the result of unavoidable definition, incompleteness, 
<br />
and inconsistency.
<br />
<br />Justification:
<br />
<br />1) Using definition 1 and 2 the presence of unavoidable definition 
<br />
can be established by noting that a Nothing and a Something are a 
<br />
definitional pair and at least one of this pair must have a high 
<br />
degree of existence - definition 4.
<br />
<br />2) Since the list is infinitely nested there are infinitely many 
<br />
Nothing:Something pairs.
<br />
<br />3) The simplest way for these two objects to interact is for each to 
<br />
have the property of some degree of Physical Reality - definition 3 - 
<br />
and to interact by mutually altering each other's degree of this property.
<br />
<br />4) A Something is actually a collection of all objects except a Nothing.
<br />
<br />5)  The objects in a Something can be divided into self consistent 
<br />
and self inconsistent objects.  Thus we have the inconsistency factor 
<br />
in the proposal.
<br />
<br />6) A Nothing is self consistent since it can not settle any 
<br />
meaningfull question about itself.  A Nothing must answer at least 
<br />
one meaningful question about itself - the question of its own 
<br />
duration - but it can not.  Thus we have the incompleteness factor in 
<br />
the proposal.
<br />
<br />7) A Nothing must eventually begin to resolve its incompleteness.  It 
<br />
can only do this by randomly interacting with an object in its 
<br />
companion Something by a mutual alteration [exchange] of their degree 
<br />
of Physical Reality - the dynamic factor in the proposal.  It is 
<br />
unlikely that this object will be complete so the interaction process 
<br />
between successive objects will continue until completeness is achieved.
<br />
<br />8) Logically self inconsistent objects have no logical way to 
<br />
interact with self consistent objects.  Therefore this cascade of 
<br />
objects that receive enhanced degrees of physical reality will all be 
<br />
self consistent.  In order for the incompleteness to be progressively 
<br />
resolved the successive objects will contain progressively more information.
<br />
<br />9) Since a Something contains inconsistent objects it is itself, in a 
<br />
sense, inconsistent.  Any dynamic within it must inherit some 
<br />
component of this inconsistency.
<br />
<br />10) A somewhat inconsistent [unpredictable] succession of self 
<br />
consistent objects with increasing information content having 
<br />
successively altered degrees of Physical Reality [existence] and an 
<br />
infinite number of such chains of succession taking place seems to 
<br />
provide a reasonable venue for our universe and the notion that it is 
<br />
a member of an infinite set of such universes.
<br />
<br />11) As to the list I see it as just possibility.  I see its power set 
<br />
as being the Everything.  So this approach just postulates the 
<br />
Everything.  If the Everything contains all information then this 
<br />
information must be packaged in packets of all sizes - divisions of 
<br />
the list =&gt; objects.  I do not see that one can logically propose 
<br />
that the Everything is static.  So it has a dynamic.  The above 
<br />
proposes a mechanism for this dynamic.
<br />
<br />12) As to what is consciousness it is not logical to propose that the 
<br />
succession of objects given a degree of Physical Reality in this 
<br />
dynamic works by giving non zero Physical Reality to just one object 
<br />
at each stage of the succession.  Rather it is more logical to allow 
<br />
a spectrum of functioning such that adjacent objects can have various 
<br />
degrees of Physical Reality.  The Physical Reality function would 
<br />
have various pulse widths and pulse shapes spanning a cluster of 
<br />
objects in the succession.  This allows objects and sub-components of 
<br />
such objects to experience a &quot;flow&quot; of existence.
<br />
