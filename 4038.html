From: Osher Doctorow osher.domain.name.hidden, Fri. Sept. 6, 2002 8:36AM
<br />
<br />After my discouragement of yesterday, I have decided to give myself one more
<br />
chance to try to be compatible with everything-list.   I have just
<br />
downloaded J. Schmidthuber's *A computer scientist's view of life, the
<br />
universe, and everything,* (1997), and it is well enough written that I
<br />
apparently will be able to understand it.   I also have one of the other two
<br />
papers that were available on the everything-list site, which I understood
<br />
fairly well several weeks ago.
<br />
<br />I will take this opportunity to write/type a few words about Knowledge (K
<br />
for short) rather than information (I), distinguishing between them as the
<br />
semantic (meaning) part of that whose syntactic part is information vs
<br />
information itself.
<br />
<br />There are several directions in which I have developed K, but the simplest
<br />
way is to consider that K contains primitive pointlike or stringlike
<br />
elements which may have fuzzy truth values (on a scale between 0 and 1 for
<br />
the non-trivial cases) or probabilities or both assigned to them.  Let us
<br />
call these K-points for brevity.   Each K-point has MEANING, and I will
<br />
regard this as a primitive undefined concept in this presentation, although
<br />
one can develop things from several other viewpoints.    The word *MEANING*,
<br />
however, is to be used in practice rather similarly to its dictionary
<br />
definition(s) and intuitively is like ideas, thoughts, cognitions, provided
<br />
that they are accompanied by *understanding* rather than merely regarded as
<br />
sounds or sights or perceptions with nothing that can be specified behind
<br />
them.   I do relate it here at all to the computational linguistics idea of
<br />
*meaning*.
<br />
<br />Knowledge (K) is regarded as continuous or piecewise continuous and
<br />
connected or piecewise connected, and could theoretically either increase or
<br />
decrease or remain constant, although in fact I postulate somewhat
<br />
analogously although apparently not structurally related to entropy in
<br />
thermodynamics that K increases in time in the universe.   In fact, letting
<br />
E symbolize entropy, I postulate that the rate of increase of K in time
<br />
exceeds the rate of increase of E in time, symbolically:
<br />
<br />1)  Dt(K - E) &gt; 0
<br />
<br />where Dt is the partial derivative with respect to time, although I am open
<br />
to generalizing it to covariant or gauge derivatives and so on.   Equation
<br />
(1) has an interesting interpretation, namely, that instead of disorder
<br />
increasing overall in the universe with time, the ordered part of Knowledge
<br />
increases with time - possibly by matter converting to radiation in whole or
<br />
in part, or possibly by some other scenario.   Even the notion of a
<br />
radiation form of life is not excluded in these considerations - in fact, it
<br />
may be indicated.   It might be in some places combined with material form
<br />
of life, as in the human brain, where the global aspects may relate more to
<br />
radiation and the local aspects more to matter.   There is a well accepted
<br />
physical theory of the initial radiation-dominated era of the universe
<br />
succeeded by a matter-dominated era in which radiation still plays an
<br />
important part, and several theorists consider that a radiation type of era
<br />
will eventually constitute a third era.
<br />
<br />Does this mean that digital computes do not do anything?    No.   They
<br />
calculate very fast.  They store discrete steps and discrete Knowledge
<br />
representations (or attempted representations via syntax) and discrete
<br />
syntax.   When they calculate very fast, they sometimes produce numerical
<br />
approximations to solutions of differential or integral equations which we
<br />
do not know how to produce otherwise, and this helps increase Knowledge,
<br />
although I think that is it qualitatively somewhat inferior to CAUSAL
<br />
KNOWLEDGE.   There is factual knowledge (details) about the real world,
<br />
there is causal knowledge about what causes or influences what in the real
<br />
world, and there is speculative or even fictional or fantasy *knowledge*
<br />
about things or events or processes that are not considered to be real or to
<br />
have real analogs in the real physical or even psychological worlds.
<br />
Digital computers can help factual knowledge, but so far they have not
<br />
helped causal knowledge much.
<br />
<br />Does K (Knowledge) relate to multiple universes, multiple histories, etc.?
<br />
This is a more advanced question than I can deal with here.   I think that
<br />
multiple universes and multiple histories are interesting ideas, but that at
<br />
the present time their logical and physical and philosophical structures
<br />
have not been well established.   If they exist, then I have no doubt
<br />
intuitively that K applies to them as well.
<br />
<br />Finally, the mathematical formulation of Causal Knowledge in my Rare Event
<br />
Theory (RET) resides in fuzzy multivalued logical x--&gt;y or its
<br />
probability-statistics analogs or proximity function - geometry-topology
<br />
analogs.    There are 3 types of x--&gt;y, which correspond respectively to
<br />
Rare Events (Lukaciewicz and Rational Pavelka fuzzy multivalued logics (FML)
<br />
in the non-trivial case), Fairly Frequent Events (Product/Goguen FML), and
<br />
Very Frequent Events (Godel FML).   Here Events is short for Events and/or
<br />
Processes.   I spent about 23 years showing the correspondence here since
<br />
1980 with my wife Marleen.   Some of it is in my paper in B. N. Kursunuglu
<br />
et al (2000), Kluwer Academic: N.Y. 89-97, and references therein.
