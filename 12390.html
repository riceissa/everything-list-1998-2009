Le 29-déc.-06, à 10:57, Tom Caylor a écrit :
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Just to clear this up, my above statement was not meant to be an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argument. I purposefully used the word &quot;entail&quot; rather than &quot;imply&quot;.  I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wasn't saying that you cannot believe in some kind of truth without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; believing in the personal God.  However is makes sense *from my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perspective* (of belief in the personal God) that you do not have a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; basis for any truth on which personhood can be based, which *from my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perspective* (which I *have* been arguing for in general) needs more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than the impersonal core.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK. Now, if you accept, if only just for the sake of the argument, the  
<br />
mechanist hypothesis, then you will see there could be an explanation  
<br />
why you feel necessary to postulate such a personal God. But then I  
<br />
must agree this explanation is more coherent with  
<br />
&quot;theories/philosophies&quot; in which that &quot;God&quot; is so much *personal* that  
<br />
it looks like the &quot;first person&quot; canonically associated to the machine.  
<br />
In that case your &quot;personal God&quot; would be the &quot;machine third hypostase&quot;  
<br />
or &quot;Plotinus universal soul&quot;. It is the unameable self (re)defined by  
<br />
Bp  &amp;  p.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The card records facts. To judge them historical is already beyond my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; competence. Why the bible? Why not &quot;the question of king Milinda&quot; ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My approach on the Everything List has been to argue for the necessity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the personal God as the ultimate basis for Everything.
</em><br />
<br /><br />See just above.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If someone
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wants to research the historical record sufficiently to convince
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; themselves one way or another about the Bible or Jesus' resurrection,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that's great, and I can give them some sources, but it's probably too
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contingent for this List.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Perhaps. The problem is that I just cannot take an expression like  
<br />
&quot;Jesus is the Son of God&quot; as a scientific proposition. It could be  
<br />
true, it could be false without me seeing a way to resolve it. On the  
<br />
contrary, I can find in the talk by Jesus general pattern which makes  
<br />
sense, and, indeed, 2/3 of Christian theology is probably compatible  
<br />
with the comp hyp. Somehow, any literal interpretation of *any* text  
<br />
(even PA's axioms !) should be considered with systematic suspicion.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I do have response to your comment on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universal-ness below.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &lt;snip&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree I was too loose in my use of hypercomputation as an analogy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Actually the direction of the &quot;spanning&quot; was downward, going from G*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (celestial) to G terrestial, described by the Greek work kenosis
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (emptying).  This does not mean that God the Father (the personal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fulfillment of the first hypostase), or the Holy Spirit (...second
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hypostase) discontinued to exist, but that the Logos became flesh and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dwelt among us, so that we could see his grace and truth.  Again, this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does not mean that we cannot believe and seek truth, and have a feeling
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that we are on the right track, without a relationship with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; personal God.  This means that the ultimate source of all truth made
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; himself known to us on a human level and solved the problem of evil.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Again this can have some symbolic sense. Literaly it is enough I know  
<br />
just one suffering Dog to feel uneasy with the idea that the concrete  
<br />
(not the theological) problem of evil is solved.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Death itself is the ultimate effect of evil: separation/isolation from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everything and everyone.  Jesus proved his divinity by raising
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *himself* from the dead.
</em><br />
<br /><br />A very big advance in modern and serious parapsychology is that humans  
<br />
are easily fooled by humans. How could you say Jesus has proved  
<br />
something? Even if someone appear and can change water in wine and  
<br />
makes miracles etc. I would not take this as a proof. Remember I even  
<br />
think there is just no proofs concerning any reality. Proofs belongs to  
<br />
theories. Facts does not prove. Facts confirms or refute beliefs  
<br />
(theories).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; For any belief I have I try to figure out if I would have had that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; belief in completely different context. &quot;Jesus&quot; or &quot;Nagarjuna&quot; does  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; survive such a test. For example I would not have believed in Jesus in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the case I would have born in the time of Plato, nor would I believed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; in Euler would I have born on a different planet, but it make sense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that I would have believed in the content of their message. This  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; forces
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; us to make the argument the most universal possible, the less
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; culturally influenced.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am not saying that God's communication is an exhaustive communication
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of all truth, i.e. all facts (scientific, historic, etc.) that it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible for us to know.  It was a message saying, &quot;I am here. I love
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you. I am your source of meaning. Here is my hand to rescue you from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; darkness/meaninglessness and death/isolation.  Your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaning/relationships are actually, ultimately, based on something:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Me.&quot;
</em><br />
<br /><br />But how could I know if jesus was not refering to the universal &quot;me&quot;,  
<br />
in which case I can make sense of what he said both relatively to Plato  
<br />
or Plotinus theory and with the comp hyp. If Jesus meant literally  
<br />
himself, then, well I wait someone can even address a theory in which  
<br />
such literal truth can make sense.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am not building an argument from the ground up to everything (see my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; last comment below).  This thing has been handed down to me, I admit,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but it can be investigated by anyone interested.  So I can't make the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argument up the way I want it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Accordingly, regarding universal-ness, the personal God would have to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; communicate this message to us with a means specific to this planet.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (I don't know what he has done for other planets.)
</em><br />
<br />During a very long time people have been burned alive for daring to  
<br />
talk on other planet.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; We would not really
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be able to believe him if he did not become one of us (we would just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; say, &quot;You don't know about my experience as a human&quot;).  To truly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; communicate with a human, you have to be a human.  He became one human,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; took on human death, and proved his divinity by raising himself from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; death, and then the message was spread by those who believed in him.
</em><br />
<br /><br />It is a cute story, but how could we be *sure* it was not a collective  
<br />
hallucination? I recall that I take already the appearance of a  
<br />
physical universe as a sort of collective (all machine) hallucination.
<br />
I am not saying that Jesus' resurrection was such an hallucination, but  
<br />
are you willing to be scientific on this, meaning are you prepared to  
<br />
doubt any axiom of your theory?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In a similar manner as &quot;I don't know about other planets&quot;, I would say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I ultimately don't know about other people (first person pov and all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that), what it means for them to believe in the personal God's love for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them.  All I know is the way I've heard it (Jesus being the personal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; God's hand to us).  To try to worry and orchestrate how all of that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; works for everyone would be going way above my competence.  But this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doesn't negate the truth of the personal God.
</em><br />
<br /><br />To be clear, with comp there is a personal God, which is the unnameable  
<br />
self all enough correct machine have in themselves.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; To the last question, yes.  However, I think that Godel's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; axiomatization also applies to an impersonal god.  The axioms for a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; personal God would have to include all three persons as I outlined with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the four hypostases.  This is for reasons similar to the reasoning of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the hypostases, with the added axiom that the ultimate One is personal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and that the three persons somehow communicate and love one another.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is the basis on which there can be communication and love among
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other persons.  In a way, communication and love are on a par with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; truth on the ontological scale.  This is an important point.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree, but it is even because I agree that I am afraid your  
<br />
interpretation of Jesus and &quot;witness&quot; interpretation sound too literal  
<br />
and could help those who want to abandon the theological baby with the  
<br />
criminogenic human pseudo religious behavior.
<br />
Influence by comp I would add that the &quot;personal God&quot; is so much  
<br />
personal that the enlightened person will never mention It. Personal  
<br />
God are personal. Of course we can talk about such &quot;personal things&quot; in  
<br />
a list where the very notion of person is addressed. personal stuff are  
<br />
not scientific, but this does not forbid 3-talk on such &quot;personal  
<br />
things&quot;, once we agree enough on some axioms etc.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; I agree, words are not enough.  Here again, the primary  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; communication
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; of love was not words e.g. a command to love, but the actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; expression by the action of incarnation and giving his life and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; death.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; In a story. I can appreciate symbolically.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; If you want Jesus playing a personal role in our 3-person approach,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; just pray Him to make a 3-person communicable sign.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This goes back to his death and resurrection, which opened up the way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; again for our relationship with the personal God.
</em><br />
<br /><br />... as far as &quot;I&quot; am Jesus. If not, I could argue that the message has  
<br />
not even been delivered to me. Got an atheist education ... I stop  
<br />
believing in Santa Klaus and Jesus the same day in my early childhood.  
<br />
I was astonished that my cousins stop to believe in Santa Klaus but  
<br />
kept they belief is Jesus.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I am not sure, because we can bet. We can make act of faith. We can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; learn from our mistakes, we can change our minds and still keeping
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; faith, faith corrected by reason and experiences can only grow.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;bad or wrong faith&quot; (generally based on wishful or fearful  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; thinking)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; can fear to be &quot;corrected&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; A bit like it is more easy for a parent to &quot;punish&quot; his child when  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; parent &quot;truly&quot;  loves it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; But this hope is without an ultimate basis.  Real hope has an  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ultimate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; basis.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; All the lobian point is that as far as the word &quot;real&quot; means  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; something,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; we cannot use it and still keep the scientific attitude (humility,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; modesty).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This goes back to comp's taking arithmetic truth as the basis for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;reality&quot;.  I am saying that this kind of truth is not broad enough for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Everything.
</em><br />
<br />This is coherent with &quot;non-comp&quot;. No machine can be sure &quot;arithmetical  
<br />
truth&quot; is not broad enough. After Godel we know that we cannot unify  
<br />
completely arithmetical truth in any axiomatizable theory. It *is* big.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; Knowledge is personal.  Without an ultimate personal basis, we  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; cannot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; expect or hope for more, because we have nothing to begin with.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I make it plain that S4Grz1, alias the arithmetical first person (the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; solipsist topos of &quot;conscience &amp; m canisme), alias the third  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; hypostase,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is a good candidate for the ultimate personal basis. Here you should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; appreciate. In a way it vindicates both Nargarjuna and Jesus, with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; same proviso that their &quot;stories&quot; (Jesus resurection, Nagarjuna
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; reincarnation) should not be taken literally (by adults).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, because for instance if Jesus' story is taken literally, and he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; claimed to be the Son of God and proved it by raising himself from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; death, then this would contradict the impersonal basis of comp.
</em><br />
<br /><br />If this annoy you just put the third hypostase (the first person, the  
<br />
universal soul) &quot;above&quot; the 0-person. This is just a tiny nuance,  
<br />
unless you are sure by your literal interpretation of Jesus.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Also, Nagarjuna did not claim to be God in human form, and he did not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prove it.
</em><br />
<br /><br />And that is the reason I am able to trust him.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; Again, the &quot;sacred text&quot; by itself is not sufficient.  The proof is  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; God's actual act of love toward us.  For us, love is expressed in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; meeting our need, which was our being lost and dead, separated (by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; evil, by definition) from truth, meaning and life.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; You refer to personal things. If you are lucky enough to be blessed by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Love, it is ok, especially if it inspire you to work toward a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; communciable theory. But nobody can use such reference in a theory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Even, and I would say especially in a &quot;theological&quot; theory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Bruno
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is just my argument again: Without a personal God, we don't have a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; basis for these personal things.  I am not trying to develop a theory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from the ground up (upward emanation).  My argument is just presenting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the problem and lack of solution, and then saying that the answer has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; been given from the top down (downward emanation).  St. Paul reasoned
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with the Greeks about the problem (meaninglessness, evil, etc.) in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; same way, and then simply proclaimed the &quot;good-news&quot; answer.  The only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way he could proclaim it from their context was by saying that he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; noticed they had an altar with the inscription: TO AN UNKNOWN GOD.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This reminds me of the One or 0-person.  He then said, &quot;Now what you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; worship as something unknown I am going to proclaim to you.&quot;  Then he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; went on to tell them about the personal God.  You can read what he said
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in Acts 17:24-31 here:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2017:22-31">http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2017:22-31</a>; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &amp;version=31;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In this configuration of Everything, our part is not to build
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everything from the ground up (which is required if there is no one &quot;up
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there&quot; to give us anything), but to just look at the evidence for what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; God did to show us he exists and has solved our problem of inescapable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaninglessness and death, and believe.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This doesn't mean that, if we believe that God is our ultimate source
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of meaning, we don't need to do anything for any purpose whatsoever.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; On the contrary, it gives both *consistent* and *complete* meaning to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what we do and it takes away our need to spend our lives in fear of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaninglessness and isolation/death.
</em><br />
<br /><br />If that helps you it is ok. But, as others have illustrated, it seems  
<br />
such believes are not necessary. Now the main the point is that if you  
<br />
don't allow *possible* (re)interpretation of you theory, it would  
<br />
prevent progress. Science = Doubt.  Factual things like &quot;Jesus is the  
<br />
son of God&quot; or &quot;there is a primary physical universe&quot; are scientific  
<br />
statement only as far as we can conceive them as being false (or better  
<br />
refutable, but I am not sanguine about this).
<br />
