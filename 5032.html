<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;I am far from sure however that this does not involve a

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Indeed. It needs an infinite act of faith. But I have no problem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; with that ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Unfortunately, it seems that some people do.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />It seems, but it isn't. Well, actually I have known *one* mathematician,
<br />
(a russian logician) who indeed makes a serious try to develop
<br />
some mathematics without that infinite act of faith (I don't recall
<br />
its name for the moment). Such attempt are known as &quot;ultrafinitism&quot;.
<br />
Of course a lot of people (especially during the week-end) *pretend*
<br />
not doing that infinite act of faith, but do it all the time implicitly. You
<br />
know an ultrafinitist cannot assert that he is an &quot;ultrafinitist&quot; without
<br />
going beyong ultrafinitism. So perhaps only animals do not do that
<br />
infinite act of faith, but IMO, most mammals does it in a sort of
<br />
passive and implicit way. If you pretend to understand a statement
<br />
like:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;N   =    {1, 2, 3 ...},  or  N =  {l, ll, lll, llll, 
<br />
lllll, llllll, lllllll, ...},
<br />
<br />then you do it. Words like &quot;never&quot;, &quot;always&quot;, &quot;more&quot;, &quot;until&quot;, &quot;while&quot;, etc.
<br />
have intuitive meaning relying on it. I have worked  with highly mentally
<br />
disabled people, and only with a few of them I have concluded that there
<br />
was perhaps some evidence in their *non grasping* of the &quot;simple&quot;
<br />
potential infinite. All finitist and all intuitionnist accept it. Second order
<br />
logic and any piece of mathematics rely on it.
<br />
Some people would like to doubt it but I think they confuse Arithmetical
<br />
Realism with some substancialist view of number which of course I reject.
<br />
(I reject substancialism even in physics, actually I showed it logically
<br />
incompatible with the comp hyp).
<br />
Fearing the death in the long run (as opposed of fearing some near catastroph)
<br />
also rely on that faith in the infinite, at least implicitly.
<br />
Some people believe that human are religious because they fear death, but
<br />
it is the reverse which seems to me much more plausible: it is because
<br />
we are religious (i.e. we believe in some infinite) that we are fearing death.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I am not sure how much I share that faith. As I mentionned,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I am willing to but since I could not find some ground to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;support that willingness, I might be a bit agnostic too.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />No problem. The point is that it is a nice and deep hypothesis
<br />
which makes comp fun and extremely powerful. It is definitely
<br />
among my working hypotheses.
<br />
<br /><br />&lt;snip&gt;
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Why there is no FAQ? Because we are still discussing the meaning of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a lot of terms ....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I saw some posts on tentative glossaries of acronyms. Maybe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;before complex terms, we should focus on &quot;basic&quot; ones like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;universe&quot;. I would not be upset to encounter definitions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;for several possible senses of that word.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I don't think the word &quot;universe&quot; is a basic term. It is a sort
<br />
or deity for atheist. All my work can be seen as an attempt to mak
<br />
it more palatable in the comp frame.
<br />
Tegmark, imo, goes in the right direction, but seems unaware
<br />
of the difficulties mathematicians discovered when just trying to
<br />
define the or even a &quot;mathematical universe&quot;.  Of course tremendous
<br />
progress has been made (in set theory, in category theory) giving
<br />
tools to provide some *approximation*, but the big mathematical
<br />
whole seems really inaccessible. With comp it can be shown
<br />
(first person) inaccessible, even unnameable ...
<br />
<br />Bon week-end,
<br />
<br />Bruno
