Hi John,
<br />
<br />Le 25-janv.-06, à 04:07, John M a écrit :
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thanks.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I can't wait for your writing about Plotinus I could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not read even about him any reasonable text.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I can understand. Somehow, like the words &quot;God&quot; and &quot;theology&quot;, 
<br />
Plotinus has been in part appropriated by the Christians. For example 
<br />
in the little popular book on Plato, Plotinus is sum up in three 
<br />
sentences saying that Plotinus was the founder of Neoplatonism 
<br />
(actually Plotinus was just saying that he was a Platonist and &quot;neo&quot; is 
<br />
just used by historians for its period: 200-300 century) and that it 
<br />
combines Plato's philosophy with a heightened emphasis on God and 
<br />
Salvation, and that the Enneads of Plotinus foreshadowed the great 
<br />
Augustinian Synthesis of Plato and Christianity.
<br />
This is somehow correct but put the fundamental differences between 
<br />
Plotinus and the Christians under the rug.
<br />
I bought and read the penguin Plotinus book. It is an abridged version 
<br />
of the whole Enneads of Plotinus. I first realised the missing of its 
<br />
proof of the &quot;immortality of the soul&quot;, a quite important thread of the 
<br />
Everything List, then I realised the missing of its treatise on Number, 
<br />
which is the interface with comp and with the Pythagorean and with the 
<br />
list. What is striking is that it gives the whole Fifth Ennead (the 
<br />
main one which introduces the basic metaphysics/theology), except for 
<br />
one chapter, the one which, according to another commentator, is the 
<br />
more in opposition with Aristotle and the Christians. Indeed for the 
<br />
Christian God, or the ultimate TOE's object if you want, is a thinker. 
<br />
With Plotinus there is a second God, and a third, and Plotinus insists 
<br />
quite a lot that the first God cannot be a thinker, only the second and 
<br />
a part of the third.
<br />
<br />My problem now is that I am not sure I should use Plotinus to explain G 
<br />
and G*, or to use G and G* to explain Plotinus. I make an attempt 
<br />
below. It is clear that seeing the relationship between both can help 
<br />
to understand the main fundamental differences between Plato and 
<br />
Aristotle, and how they will evolve toward very different view of the 
<br />
&quot;Everything&quot;. To put it roughly, with Plato-Plotinus: matter is 
<br />
secondary and mind is primary, or even: physics is secondary and math 
<br />
is primary. With Aristotle and the Christians it will be the inverse, 
<br />
leading to some schizo ontology: a willing God related to a material 
<br />
non thinking naturalist framework, a sort of super mind-body problem.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What you write about 'experimentally testable&quot; (I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not a Popperian) ...
</em><br />
<br />*as* a communicating scientist, I am. But during the research phases I 
<br />
am not.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; ... raises the question: is it not some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; misunderstood - primitive observation with those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; restricted model-based instruments we use and some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (similarly narrow-vision) sweated out explanation in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our math based &quot;science&quot;?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Here I do have a problem with you. I agree so much with you on this 
<br />
point that it is my basic starting point. But then I use our 
<br />
terrestrial math to build upon that idea, at some higher level.
<br />
This is something made possible by the discovery of (modern) logic and 
<br />
its many logics.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; We think in figments, observe and explain figments,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; built a world of science on figments and call the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; errors a paradox, a given, an axiom, chaos, or just an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emergence.
</em><br />
<br /><br />... if not a universe or a multiverse. Certainly so with comp, and with 
<br />
&quot;we&quot; being the lobian entitities.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is why I picked up the expression &quot;perception of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality&quot;. I rather spend my available time in some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; accepted ignorance and leave mosre smarts to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; grandkids of our grandkids.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I definitely do not base contemporary thinking on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ideas generated upon a cognitive epistemic inventory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of millennia ago, not even 50 years ago. We learn and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should not dismiss it. I am younger now at 84 than a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; graduate student who knows all the obsolete wisdom.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I like to find or intuit what is common between us now and us millennia 
<br />
ago.
<br />
With comp (or much weaker) there is something common to any 
<br />
self-observing honest entity, and which is beyond time and space: 
<br />
indeed time and space *appears* from that.
<br />
<br />That is what the UDA should convey in some intelligible way. And that 
<br />
is what G and G* can mathematically describe, i.e. the discourse(s) of 
<br />
the self-observing honest entity.
<br />
<br />Let me describe an audacious, probably, arithmetical (even Pythagorean, 
<br />
I think) interpretation of Plotinus' hypostases.
<br />
The word &quot;hypostase&quot; is a nice word to avoid the word &quot;god&quot; or &quot;gods&quot; 
<br />
in serious talk, I mean in &quot;rational theology&quot;. &quot;hypostase(s)&quot;  means 
<br />
basic(s) or fundamental(s).
<br />
<br />Plotinus introduces three primary &quot;divine&quot; hypostases: the One, the 
<br />
(divine) Intellect, the All-souls, or Soul. He talks also about a non 
<br />
divine terrestrial intellect, which can participate in discursive 
<br />
reasoning and get opinions. The One is arguably Plato's Good from the 
<br />
Parmenides.
<br />
<br />Now Godel's theorem has shown that for any proving machine (which will 
<br />
play the role of the discursive terrestrial intellect) there is an 
<br />
unavoidable gap between &quot;Truth on the machine&quot; and &quot;Truth provable by 
<br />
the machine on the machine&quot;. At the elementary mathematical 
<br />
propositional level, the &quot;provability of p&quot; (Bp) obeys to the modal 
<br />
logic G, as far as we ask the machine to be able to justify its 
<br />
opinion, and obeys to G*, as far as we only ask the machine to intuit 
<br />
in some way or another the true proposition, including the non-provable 
<br />
one.
<br />
<br />There is still a problem to get Plotinus Hypostases from that, which is 
<br />
that the notion of truth is not definable in the language of the 
<br />
Loebian entity (Tarski theorem). But there is a trick which is due also 
<br />
to Tarski, and whixh consist to define the truth of some sentence 
<br />
directly by the proposition itself: like in saying that the string &quot;the 
<br />
snow is wite&quot; denote a truth because actually the snow is white. More 
<br />
generally &quot;p&quot; is true when p.
<br />
Now Plotinus' three primary hypostases can be described in the 
<br />
following way:
<br />
<br />p
<br />
Bp
<br />
Bp &amp; p
<br />
<br />You recognize perhaps my &quot;theaetetical variants&quot; in the last two lines, 
<br />
as you will recognize them in the &quot;secondary hypostases&quot; (although 
<br />
Plotinus would not express it like that). Note that what is different 
<br />
is the presence of the &quot;indeterminate factor Dp (diamond p):
<br />
<br />Bp &amp; Dp
<br />
Bp &amp; Dp &amp; p
<br />
<br />Now, it is the gap between G and G* which makes all those &quot;person point 
<br />
of views&quot; in general differents. They define different logics. And not 
<br />
only that: each hypostases can be seen through G* or through G. That 
<br />
is, from the true and provable respective points of view. So there is 
<br />
two logics per hypostase, the terrestrial (G) and the divine (G*). In 
<br />
the detail: the &quot;truth&quot; hypostasis, represented by p and which plays 
<br />
the role of the unameable One (Plato's Good), is not sensible to the 
<br />
gap between G and G*, given that it is independent of the Intellect 
<br />
(Platonism).
<br />
You got the Theaetetus from G. And what I learned in Plotinus, is that 
<br />
you get the &quot;Parmenides&quot; from G*.
<br />
The second hypostase, Bp, which plays the role of the intellect, will 
<br />
split into a terrestrial and celestial version. Indeed it is the one 
<br />
responsible for the gap between G and G* (by Godel, Lob, Solovay 
<br />
theorem). The intellect is Bp as seen by G*. It is the truth ON the 
<br />
entity.
<br />
The third hypostase is a combination of the two preceding one. Bp &amp; p. 
<br />
At the terrestrial (provable) level it corresponds to the main 
<br />
definition of knowledge by Theaetetus. At the celestial (level) it 
<br />
corresponds to the same thing! That is, the knower is a fixed point of 
<br />
the Earth-Heaven transformation (the function SOL programmed in Lisp 
<br />
here:
<br />
<a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/G.html">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/G.html</a>
<br />
for those who want play with it). The second hypostase is the first 
<br />
person, it does not distinguish truth and provability.
<br />
The secondary hypostase, Bp &amp; Dp, corresponds to some first plural 
<br />
person point of view, with explicit interrogation on others and on 
<br />
indetermination/matter, captured by the possibility (consistency) modal 
<br />
connector Dp (which is just ~B~p). G and G* distinguish them. The same 
<br />
for Bp &amp; Dp &amp; p.
<br />
You see that G and G* does not only distinguish the loebian logics 
<br />
given by Bp &amp; Dp and Bp &amp; Dp &amp; p. But G and G* describe for each such 
<br />
nuances (hypostases) two logics, again a terrestrial and a celestial.
<br />
Than, Plotinus' Matter, despite his contempt for it, and despite the 
<br />
fact his theory is mainly an abstraction of Aristotle matter theory 
<br />
(minus Aristotle reification of particulars) appears in the celestial 
<br />
(G*, truth) level of last three hypostases, and indeed it is there that 
<br />
the quantum logics appear.
<br />
Note that (by tarski theorem) the first, the second, and the fifth 
<br />
hypostates are &quot;ineffable&quot;, not descrpitibe or definable by the loebian 
<br />
machine. But then by the Tarski trick we can talk about them, and 
<br />
lobian machine can show that a stronger machine can prove the theology 
<br />
of some weaker machine, and even prove its own, but then without 
<br />
conveying any persuasion.
<br />

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; thanks for your approval to my post on 'belief'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; To
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; this one, however, I think you mix up &quot;evidence&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;assumption&quot;. The beautiful sunshine is &quot;assumed&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; be God's gift for us, it is a 1st person idea if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; like it, or find it burning, to assign it as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; gift or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; a curse. It is our &quot;perception of reality&quot; anyway.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; I stand with my Popperian example - which you did
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; address in my post - about 'proof and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; falsification'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I did elsewhere. Also I think we could have perhaps
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; some vocabulary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; problems.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I agree that some believer in God does assume that a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; beautiful sunshine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is a God's gift to us. Here I was more alluding to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Plato's view of God
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; as &quot;the Good&quot;, and I was talking about someone who
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; makes such a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; personal experience of beauty, in front of that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; sunshine, that he takes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; it as a, personal or first person for sure,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; experience of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Good/God/whatever (sort of mystical experience if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; you want).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Of course it is not a proof (as in pure math), nor
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; an evidence in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Popper sense of confirmation. Nor can a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; reconstitution of oneself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; during a teleportation be a proof of comp, nor can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; quantum suicide
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; provides any proof that QM, or Everett, or comp are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; true. First Person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Knowledge is just incorrigible and unfalsifiable,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and as such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; unscientific. Science is concerned only with third
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; person discourses,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; or, arguably, with first person plural discourses
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (the one which I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; defined explicitly through duplication of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; populations of individuals).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Now I don't think it is really important to be so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; precise in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; beginning. At some point I will be obliged to say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; counter-intuitive propositions and explain how in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; some important cases
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; first person truth can indirectly lead to 100%
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; falsifiable third person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; propositions, but it is not easy to explain. Well, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; wouldn' t have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; believe myself a large part of what I want to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; explain if that wouldn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; have been confirmed by the Lobian interview.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Nevertheless, I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; realizing now  that many &quot;rational mystics&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (including the Neoplatonist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; pagan theologians) are closer to the lobian machine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; than I would have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; thought before reading Plotinus. I am still
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; searching more confirmation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; because if this is confirmed (I have some criteria)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; it would put some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; new light on the discussion.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I will try to sum up this in a new thread on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Plotinus (and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; neoplatonism, more generally).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; At some point I will explain how I am getting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (apparently) an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; arithmetical interpretation of Plotinus, and on some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; part of Plato's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Parmenides. My work would make Plotinus theory of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; matter 100%
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; experimentally testable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Of course there is nothing miraculous that honest
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; introspector converge
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; toward the lobian discourse, given that this is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; discourse of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; self-referential correct machine.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I don't know if that relation with Plotinus will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; help me selling my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; stuff, but this is another problem (for a future
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; different thread).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; What some Christian theologians dismissed in Plato,

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; they will dismiss
