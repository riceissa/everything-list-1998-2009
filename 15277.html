Hi,
<br />
<br />Those who dislikes introduction can skip up to &quot;THE FIRST THOUGHT  
<br />
EXPERIMENT AND THE FIRST QUESTION&quot;.
<br />
---------------------
<br />
<br /><br />INTRODUCTION
<br />
<br />MGA is for Movie Graph Argument (like UDA is for Universal Dovetailer  
<br />
Argument).
<br />
<br />By UDA(1...7), the seven first step of the UDA, we have a proof or  
<br />
argument that
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(COMP + there is a concrete universe with a concrete universal  
<br />
dovetailer running forever in  it)
<br />
<br />implies that
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;physics is emerging statistically from the computations (as seen  
<br />
from a &quot;first person points of view&quot;).
<br />
<br />Note: I will use &quot;computationalism, digital mechanism, and even just  
<br />
mechanism, as synonymous.
<br />
<br />MGA is intended to eliminate the hypothesis that:
<br />
<br />there is a concrete universe with a concrete universal dovetailer  
<br />
running forever)
<br />
<br /><br />Leading to:  comp implies that physics is a branch of (mathematical)  
<br />
computer science.
<br />
<br />Some nuances will have to be added. But I prefer to be slightly wrong,  
<br />
and understandable, than to make a long list of &quot;vocabulary&quot; and  
<br />
pursuing in some obscur jargon.
<br />
<br /><br />But in case you have not read the UDA, there is no problem. MGA by  
<br />
itself shows something independent of the UDA, indeed it shows (is  
<br />
supposed to show) that the physical supervenience thesis is false.  
<br />
Consciousness does not supervene on the *physical activity* of the  
<br />
brain/computer/universe. This shows that mechanism is incompatible  
<br />
with materialism (even weak form) or naturalism or physicalism,  
<br />
because they traditionally assume the physical supervenience thesis.
<br />
<br />It is more subtle than UDA, and I expect possible infinite  
<br />
discussions. (Zombies will come back!)
<br />
<br /><br />Now a preliminary remark for clarifying what we mean by MECHANISM.  
<br />
When the mechanist says &quot;yes&quot; to the doctor, it is because he believes  
<br />
(or hopes) he will survive QUA COMPUTATIO (sorry for the latin). I  
<br />
mean he believes that he will survive because the computational device  
<br />
he will get in place of its old brain does the &quot;right&quot; computations  
<br />
(which exists by hypothesis). he does not believe something like this  
<br />
(although he could!). I believe that there is God who will, by its  
<br />
magic means,  pull out my soul, and then put it back in the new  
<br />
computational device.
<br />
A mechanical theory of consciousness, as well explained by Dennett,  
<br />
should rely of the fact that we don't attribute knowledge or  
<br />
consciousness, still less prescience, to the neurons, or elementary  
<br />
logical gates, or quarks, ... that is to the elementary part of the  
<br />
computational device. (The elementary parts depends of course of the  
<br />
substitution level choice).
<br />
<br />This means, assuming both mechanism and naturalism (i.e. the physical  
<br />
supervenience thesis), that when consciousness supervenes on the  
<br />
physical activity of a brain, no neuron is aware of the other neurons  
<br />
to which they are related. Each neuron is &quot;aware&quot; only of some  
<br />
information they get of the neurons, not of the neurons themselves. If  
<br />
that was not the case, so that some neurons have some prescience of  
<br />
the identity of the neurons to which they are connected, it would just  
<br />
mean, when keeping the mechanist hypothesis, that we have not chosen  
<br />
the right level of substitution, and should go down further.
<br />
<br />Now come the first thought experiment and the first question.
<br />
-------------------------
<br />
<br />THE FIRST THOUGHT EXPERIMENT AND THE FIRST QUESTIONS   (MGA 1) : The  
<br />
lucky cosmic event.
<br />
<br />One billions years ago, at one billion light years away, somewhere in  
<br />
the universe (which exists by the naturalist hypo) a cosmic explosion  
<br />
occurred. And ...
<br />
<br />... Alice had her math exam this afternoon.
<br />
&nbsp;From 3h to 4h, she solved successfully a problem. She though to  
<br />
herself, &quot;oh, easy, Oh careful there is trap, yet I can solve it&quot;.
<br />
<br />What really happened is this. Alice already got an artificial brain,  
<br />
since a fatal brain tumor in her early childhood. At 3h17 pm one  
<br />
logical gate did broke, (resp. two logical gates, three, 24, 4567,  
<br />
234987, ... all).
<br />
<br />But Alice was lucky (incredibly lucky). When the logical gate A did  
<br />
break, and for example did not send a bit to logical gate B, an  
<br />
energetic particle coming from the cosmic explosion, by pure chance,  
<br />
did trigger the logical gate B at the right time. And just after this  
<br />
happening another energetic particle fixed the gate problem.
<br />
<br />Question: did this change Alice's consciousness during the exam?
<br />
<br />I ask the same question with 2440 broken gates. They broke, let us say  
<br />
during an oral exam, and each time a gate broke, by sending a wrong  
<br />
info, or by not sending some info, an energetic particle coming from  
<br />
that cosmic explosion do the job, and at some point in time, a bunch  
<br />
of energetic particle fix Alice's brain.
<br />
<br />Suppose that ALL the neurons/logical gates of Alice are broken during  
<br />
the exam, all the time. But Alice, I told you, is incredibly lucky,  
<br />
and that cosmic beam again manage each logical gates to complete their  
<br />
work in the relevant places and times. And again at the end of the  
<br />
exam, a cosmic last beam fixed her brain. In particular she succeed  
<br />
the exam, and she can explain later to her mother, with her sane  
<br />
(artificial) brain, that she thought  tp herself, during the oral  
<br />
exam: &quot;oh, easy, Oh careful there is trap, yet I can solve it&quot;.
<br />
<br />The last question (of MGA 1) is:  was Alice, in this case, a zombie  
<br />
during the exam?
<br />
<br />I let you think.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Bruno
