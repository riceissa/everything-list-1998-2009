<em class="quotelev1">&gt; situation is reversed:

<br /><br />Stathis' &quot;the copy and the chair&quot; is here
<br />
<a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m7117.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m7117.html</a>
<br />
<br /><br />You made your point. Let me give you an argument showing (incorrectly) 
<br />
that the notion of probability is not applicable in the duplication 
<br />
situations. I let you find where is the error. The argument is of 
<br />
course (*) a thought experiment and I present it through an imaginary 
<br />
story. In the &quot;copy and the chair&quot; you reverse the situation. Here I 
<br />
show it to be completely arbitrary.
<br />
<br />It is the story of my friend Jack. Jack is a computationalist 
<br />
practitioner, and he is also fond of the planet Mars. Unfortunately he 
<br />
married Jeanne who was anti computationalist. Nevertheless he promised 
<br />
to never leave her. And Jack is as honest as possible.
<br />
Today, classical teleportation and duplication were common, but Jeanne 
<br />
just believes that those who are reconstituted are sort of &quot;impostors&quot;, 
<br />
and that each time an &quot;original&quot; is scanned and annihilated, well, he 
<br />
just dye.
<br />
One day Jack, who is a little bit tired arguing with Jeanne, found a 
<br />
proposition for a nice Job on Mars. He decides to duplicate itself, by 
<br />
being scanned, and then send on Mars and be reconstituted on it. All 
<br />
this without annihilation of the original, so as to be able not feeling 
<br />
guilty in front of Jeanne, and hurt her feeling in case she would know.
<br />
Jack, who bet on comp, thought that he has a chance of 1/2 to &quot;be the 
<br />
one who will enjoy working on Mars&quot;
<br />
After having done the experience. Jack-original was a little bit sad. 
<br />
Jack-1, the copy, was delighted: it has worked!
<br />
Soon after, his news paper was offering even more jobs on Mars, 
<br />
actually 64 jobs. He decided to reiterate the &quot;copy and paste&quot; (no cut) 
<br />
64 times. He thought that the probability he remains the original was 
<br />
1/2^64 (= about 1/1,84 10^19) so that he would be rather unlucky to be 
<br />
the one feeling remaining the original!
<br />
But as tautologies are tautologies, the original remains the original, 
<br />
so he was, as a computationalist, quite astonished failing again. He 
<br />
did even begin to doubt comp. On Mars, Jack-2, Jack-3, ..., Jack-65 
<br />
were delighted and were thinking that they knew that trick could hardly 
<br />
fail!
<br />
And then new jobs on Mars were still offered, dirty dangerous one. Jack 
<br />
(who is Jack-0)  was beginning to doubt comp, and was thinking that 
<br />
Jeanne was perhaps right about the reconstituted people being &quot;other&quot;. 
<br />
Still, its relation with Jeanne were bad enough he really wants to 
<br />
leave her, and its frustration not being on Mars was growing and 
<br />
growing. And perhaps Jack was not so honest, and he makes up the 
<br />
following plan: &quot;I will just LET THE ORIGINAL GO ON MARS&quot;. And Jack 
<br />
promises to himself that, would he acknowledge to be the copy, he would 
<br />
stay with Jeanne.
<br />
He even decides to delay the reconstitution, following that anti-comp 
<br />
superstition that being scanned, and reconstituted with a delay makes 
<br />
you sure to remain the original.
<br />
So he scanned himself, with a program activating the reconstitution 
<br />
with a delay of one hour (say), and then, he was going on MARS, by 
<br />
usual 2 years trip by rocket (he was doubting! Note the irony here: he 
<br />
feels to leave Jeanne at the time he feels to get her point! ).
<br />
You can imagine the disappointment of the copy on earth. &quot;What! it 
<br />
fails again! Come on Please! Will I ever successfully quit earth? 
<br />
Jeanne did not see Jack was a copy, and Jack did not despair finding a 
<br />
way to go on mars, letting a copy or &quot;an original&quot; of him with Jeanne.
<br />
In new attempts, he decides to select the one among copy/oiginal with a 
<br />
coin, among the original and the copy. It failed! He decides to use the 
<br />
decimal of PI written in binary as selector. It failed! He decides to 
<br />
use ieratively a quantum OR gate making the decision &quot;arbitrarily 
<br />
sure&quot;: it still failed!
<br />
This explains why my friend Jack was rather depressed the last time I 
<br />
saw him. Obviously, anyone on Earth will find eself with a necessarily 
<br />
disappointed &quot;Jack&quot;, given that from our point of view the tautology 
<br />
alluded above is now:  &quot;the one who has been chosen to stay on Earth 
<br />
will have with certainty the experience of staying on Earth&quot;. For any 
<br />
strategy of choice (original/copy) we could suggest to Jack, we know, 
<br />
that the &quot;Jack&quot; who will stay on earth and come back to the bar will 
<br />
say: &quot;it failed&quot;.
<br />
That day in the bar, my friend Jack was feeling being incredibly 
<br />
unlucky.
<br />
Was he right?
<br />
<br /><br />Bruno
<br />
<br /><br /><br />(*) Those who believe that we cannot argue or prove proposition through 
<br />
thought experiment can read the mathematical part of my SANE paper 
<br />
where I show how to translate similar argument in arithmetic and/or 
<br />
computer science. In SANE I say that I substitute the FOLK or 
<br />
GRAND-MOTHER psychology (of the philosopher of mind) by a 
<br />
self-referentially correct (universal) machine (correct with respect to 
<br />
provability and inductive inference).
