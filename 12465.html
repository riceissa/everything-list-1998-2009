SP: 'So given months or years, you really are like a car in which every 
<br />
single component has been replaced, the only remaining property of the 
<br />
original car being the design'
<br />
<br />MP: Yes, indeed. For the word design here, I prefer to use 'structure', 
<br />
with the proviso that the structure/s we are interested in is/are not 
<br />
just static but some are dynamic. I like to use the word 'construct' 
<br />
[noun] to refer to these things. The kinds of changes occurring may be 
<br />
summarised in a very general sense as of three types:
<br />
1/   apparent non-change, which might be really invariant down to the 
<br />
smallest level of measurement, but might also be cases of just 
<br />
oscillation about some average length or volume [say] with no 
<br />
significant topological, charge or mass changes,
<br />
2/   cyclical changes in which topology, charge, charge distributions, 
<br />
or mass, whatever, vary in some significant repeating way, and
<br />
3/   non-repeating changes which might be manifestations of growth and 
<br />
development, creation of memories, damage from disease or just 
<br />
entropy-the passage of time.
<br />
<br />I have many times participated in discussions of what can be classed as 
<br />
a 'thing' in the real world, including persons in a purely categorical 
<br />
sense, but very often the simple idea of 'thing' is dismissed just as I 
<br />
am in the process of pointing out that there is every good reason to 
<br />
take thoughts and perceptions, plans and memories as all being things in 
<br />
the brain. As far as I am concerned I have never seen any killer 
<br />
argument as to why it is not valid for me to do so.
<br />
<br />Just recently I made the assertion that Rene Descartes was wrong to say 
<br />
that mental things have no extension. Somebody responded with something 
<br />
like&quot; Oh yeah! And how long is my idea of a ..... something or other 
<br />
...?&quot; [I have lost track of which message, indeed which list, this took 
<br />
place on but 'Pink elephant' would do for an example.] Well I think the 
<br />
evidence accruing from all the studies of brain imaging and so forth, 
<br />
shows fairly clearly that active constructs span many regions within the 
<br />
brain: cortex, cerebellum, limbic system, and so forth, and it is the 
<br />
topographic and temporal features of the activity which endow each 
<br />
construct with its figurative identity and function. These things which 
<br />
simply ARE the mental content of our brains, exist as explicit, active 
<br />
dynamic logical entities when invoked, and exist only implicitly at 
<br />
other times as the components of structural particularity in synapses, 
<br />
dendrite length and location, etc. which came about when the constructs 
<br />
came into existence in the brain in question.
<br />

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Brent: 'However, all that is needed for the arguments that appear on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; this list is to recreate a rough, functioning copy of the body plus a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; detailed reproduction of memory and a brain that functioned 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; approximately the same.  That much might not be too hard.  After all, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; as Stathis points out, you're not the same atoms you were a week ago'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; MP: Well! I'm not going to let YOU pull the levers or press any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; buttons if I have to be faxed anywhere soon! You make  philosophers' 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; copy-machines sound like props for Frankenstein's  Monster or that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; movie 'The Fly'. Furthermore &quot; ... memory and a brain that functioned 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; approximately the same&quot; would seem to be rather less than what 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Bruno's arguments about copying require. But my point is that, whilst 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the ideas are cute, they are also nonsense any way. Most people have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; problems enough living from day to day, and the only time that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'copying' of a person really has any relevance is where surgery or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; prosthetic augmentation of some kind really should be done to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; alleviate suffering or prevent premature death.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; As for Stathis's assertion about seemingly minor changes which 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; commonly occur to people's brains as they get older, like the odd 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; little stroke here and there, it is always a question of the facts in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; each case. Some deficiencies turn out to be crucial in terms of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; quality of life: loosing the use of one or two fingers could be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; annoying, embarrassing and on occasion quite dangerous. Losing the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ability to remember the names of all the people you know, would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; likewise not be nice. On the other hand, losing the ability to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; recognise things on the left side of your world, or losing the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ability to see the people you knew before as being THOSE people such 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that you become convinced that the person you are with is a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; substitute, now that could be very dysfunctional and very 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; distressing. I have seen it written that in fact most people who 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; survive past middle age, do in fact suffer from 'micro' strokes quite 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; often but usually the perceived experience is that of progressively 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; weakened memory. Not Alzheimer's which is a league of its own, but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; just difficulty remembering certain things.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Our bodies, including all neural tissue, are constantly falling apart 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and being rebuilt. Experiments with radiolabeled amino acids in mice, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for example, suggest that the half life of protein in the brain is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about 10 days. The turnover at synapses is even faster, a matter of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; minutes. So given months or years, you really are like a car in which 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; every single component has been replaced, the only remaining property 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the original car being the design.
