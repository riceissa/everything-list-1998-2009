<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Or of a Platonia
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />Call it Platonia, God, Universe, or Glass-of-Beer, we don' t care. But 
<br />
we have to bet on a &quot;reality&quot;, if we want some progress.
<br />
<br />Now, here is what I do. For each lobian machine I extract a &quot;theology&quot; 
<br />
from her personal discourses. The discourses of the machine refers to 
<br />
something NOT describable in its language (actually &quot;truth&quot;). That is, 
<br />
each correct lobian machine refers to a reality which has no name for 
<br />
her.
<br />
Now, it happens that a very-rich machine, like ZF, *can* refer and give 
<br />
name to the unnameable reality of a simpler correct lobian machine. So 
<br />
the machine ZF can name and prove the whole theology of a simpler than 
<br />
herself correct lobian machine. For example ZF can define &quot;arithmetical 
<br />
truth&quot;, which is just the &quot;Platonia/God/Universe...&quot; of the (rather 
<br />
simple) lobian machine PA. If you add to the machine ZF (seen as any 
<br />
reasonable theorem prover of the ZF theory) a very simple (trivial) 
<br />
inductive inference ability, she can bet/hope that she is, not only 
<br />
lobian, but &quot;correct&quot;, and so she can lift (but NOT PROVE, 'course) 
<br />
PA's theology to herself, and &quot;knows&quot; (relatively to her hopes!) that 
<br />
her &quot;big reality&quot; has no name.
<br />
<br />Note this: everyone (human) know that PA is correct. Everyone (human) 
<br />
can name PA's Platonia. This is enough to prove that as a lobian 
<br />
machine every human is more rich than PA. Now, I don't know if I am 
<br />
richer than ZF. Not only ZF cannot name &quot;set-theoretical truth&quot;, but I 
<br />
am not sure human can do that. A case can be given that ZF is already 
<br />
too much rich. Set theoretical truth, unlike arithmetical truth *is* a 
<br />
bit problematic.
<br />
<br /><br />Note this: all the theologies of all consistent lobian machines and 
<br />
even of all consistent lobian entities (like &quot;angels&quot;, those 
<br />
generalized NON-machine provability system like Analysis+omega-rule) 
<br />
are isomorphic. They are all described by G and G* and the intensional 
<br />
variants: the 8 hypostases (with Plotinus' vocabulary). But the modal 
<br />
connector &quot;B&quot; is an indexical: it is a notion of third-person &quot;I&quot;. It 
<br />
means ZF when B is the provability in ZF, and it means PA when B 
<br />
represents the provability in PA (like &quot;I&quot; = Bruno when asserted by 
<br />
Bruno, and John when asserted by John). But all third-person &quot;I&quot; obeys 
<br />
the same hypostase-logics,  where  &quot;I&quot; refers to any correct lobian 
<br />
entity (machine or not).
<br />
<br /><br />Remark: I say that PA is simpler than ZF. By this I mean that 1) you 
<br />
can translate any theorems of PA in ZF, and 2) ZF can prove those 
<br />
theorems. Put in another way, it means that ZF contains PA, modulo that 
<br />
translation.
<br />
Now ZF is not simpler that PA: this means the reverse is not true: 
<br />
there are theorems of ZF that either you cannot translate in PA's 
<br />
language, and there are proposition of ZF that you can translate in PA 
<br />
but that PA cannot prove. Example: PA cannot name its &quot;platonia&quot;, but 
<br />
ZF can name PA's platonia. PA can name its own consistency, but cannot 
<br />
prove it. ZF can name PA's consistency and prove it (but 'course, 
<br />
cannot prove it).
<br />
<br />Last and absolutely important remark: I have just said that ZF can 
<br />
prove the consistency of PA. And PA cannot prove the consistency of PA, 
<br />
making ZF more powerful than PA. The point is that PA can prove that! 
<br />
That is, PA can prove that ZF can prove the consistency of PA.  But PA 
<br />
has no reason at all to trust or even just &quot;understand&quot; ZF.
<br />
This means that PA can simulate ZF, like the non-chinese in Searle's 
<br />
room can &quot;talk&quot; chinese, actually without any understanding. Like I can 
<br />
solve Einstein's Gravity Equation, if you give me a correct description 
<br />
of its brain and the time to process it (!).
<br />
So the distinction between computability/emulabity and PROVABILITY is 
<br />
already enough for preventing us to do &quot;Searle's fundamental error&quot;: 
<br />
its confusion between genuine personal understanding of chinese by the 
<br />
emulated chinese, and the non understanding of the simulator itself.
<br />
Searles' error is a fundamental error to meditate on. Usually I don't 
<br />
insist because I tend to consider that Hofstadter and Dennett, in 
<br />
Minds'I, are quite good and sufficient on it.
<br />
(Please, note that when I say a philosopher is wrong, this should be 
<br />
taken as a compliment; and sometimes the error is fundamental, I will 
<br />
probably refer a lot of times to that &quot;Searles' Error&quot;). Science is 
<br />
just philosophy made refutable.
<br />
<br />As computer/simulator, both PA and ZF are universal and equivalent. As 
<br />
believer or theorem prover, ZF is far more powerful (although 
<br />
incomplete and necessarily so by Godel II) than PA. The price of 
<br />
universality in computation/simulation (Church Thesis) is the lack of 
<br />
universality in theorem proving, belief systems, etc. cf the Fi and Wi: 
<br />
I'l come back on this.
<br />
<br />Note that PA is described here as &quot;simple&quot;, but actually PA is rather 
<br />
gifted, and I could argue that 98% of today math, including 98% of 
<br />
Ramanujan's work, belongs to its discourse. It is possible to build or 
<br />
define lobian machine much simpler than PA, but PA is more easy to 
<br />
describe, and so I take her as a simple example of simple machine, but 
<br />
this should be relativize a little bit. See any texbook in mathematical 
<br />
logic for a description of PA, or click here:
