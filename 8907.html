</em><br />
<br />This formulation is known to be problematic. The second part &quot;rather
<br />
than nothing&quot; is at best redundant and at worse meaningless or
<br />
contradictory. As far as I know, all alternative formulations are
<br />
also problematic for some reason (but everybody is welcome to
<br />
propose its own). It might be that there exist no sound formulation
<br />
for the question. This does not means that the problem it is
<br />
supposed to &quot;points to&quot; does not exist or is meaningless. I imagine
<br />
that all of us for which the question is not meaningless share a
<br />
common intuition about it even if it cannot be clearly spoken of.
<br />
I like the formulation &quot;question of existence&quot; which simply refer
<br />
to such a common intuition while it leaves completely open many
<br />
issues otherwise closed or biased (just like in &quot;Who created the
<br />
world?&quot;).
<br />
<br />I am not sure that the semantic disctinction between &quot;nothing&quot; and
<br />
&quot;no thing&quot; helps much. For instance, it brings in the concept of
<br />
&quot;thing&quot; which might not be necessary and lead us in a wrong direction.
<br />
<br />I have followed only a small part of discussions in this group and
<br />
the following idea might have been proposed and commented many times
<br />
but what about arithmetical realism? Answers to the question of
<br />
existence often involve some kind of &quot;necessary being&quot; (usually
<br />
called &quot;God&quot;). What about the idea that &quot;natural numbers&quot; *have to*
<br />
in some way &quot;float around&quot; (in an intemporal sense)? &quot;Being 2&quot;
<br />
could make sense even if nobody/nothing exists to figure out that.
<br />
An answer to the question of existence would then simply be:
<br />
something exists because &quot;this&quot; has to exist (and this is something).
<br />
I understood that it is a quite common idea in this group that
<br />
&quot;we could be the sons of natural numbers&quot;. So, not only the natural
<br />
numbers could &quot;have to&quot; exists but it could also be that nothing more
<br />
needs to exist for all what we see also exist.
<br />
<br />Something wrong? Comments? I would also appreciate references about
<br />
the first appearances of these ideas.
<br />
<br />Georges.
