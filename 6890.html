<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ...I think we may basically agree, but there are some differences. If 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; look at it from a third person perspective, continuity of personal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;identity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; over time is not only a delusion but a rather strange and inconsistent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; delusion.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I'm not quite sure I understand why you say this.  Do you only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mean that *continuity* can be manipulated, e.g., on the one hand
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;we suffer a discontinuity every night when we fall asleep;  on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the other, in the future it will be possible to record your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Monday experience, your Tuesday experience, etc., and then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a few months later play them back in reverse sequence? (We might
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;even give the latter replays tremendous measure, so that so far
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;as the parameter *time* is concerned, almost all of your Mondays
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;occurred after your Wednesdays.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Or do you mean more?
</em><br />
<br />The OM's are straightforward empirical observation: &quot;I'm now having the 
<br />
experience of typing this sentence&quot;. How this experience comes about, 
<br />
whether there really is a physical keyboard in front of me, and so on, may 
<br />
be in question, but not the fact that I am having the experience. Stringing 
<br />
the OM's together to construct an individual who persists through time, 
<br />
however, is not straightforward:
<br />
<br />I believe that tomorrow I will become one of the people in the multiverse 
<br />
who believe they are me and share my memories. When I think about this, I 
<br />
hope that my future selves will have good experiences, and I fear that they 
<br />
might have bad experiences. Once tomorrow comes, I no longer care about the 
<br />
other versions, because they aren't me even though they think they are me. 
<br />
Looking back, also, I believe that I was only one of the possible versions 
<br />
in the multiverse, and I no longer care about bad experiences that person 
<br />
might have had in the same way that I care about bad experiences I am having 
<br />
at present or one of the versions of me might have in the future.
<br />
<br />We normally take all this for granted, but if you think about it, it is 
<br />
quite arbitrary. Why should I believe I will &quot;become&quot; another person who 
<br />
thinks he is me? Why should I identify with multiple versions of me in the 
<br />
future, but not the present or the past? Why should I worry about what might 
<br />
happen to my future self but not my past self? The answer is, because that 
<br />
is the way human minds have evolved. But that is the only reason. It would 
<br />
be no logical contradiction to imagine a person whose mind functioned very 
<br />
differently; for example, a person who had no fear of the future because he 
<br />
considered the idea absurd that he could &quot;become&quot; someone with different 
<br />
spacetime coordinates to his present ones.
<br />
<br />It is the failure to take into account this rather complex scheme we use to 
<br />
create individuals that leads to mistakes in the application of OM measure, 
<br />
for example in criticising the QTI.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I still feel that there is a 10%
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; chance I will be tortured, and I still feel relieved that I am one of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; lucky copies when tomorrow comes and I am not tortured. There is an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; inconsistency here in that today I identify with all the copies and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;tomorrow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I identify with only one, but so what? As you say, that is how our minds
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; have evolved.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Yes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; If the experiences of the copy who is to be tortured will eventually be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; merged with those of the non-tortured copies, that changes the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;situation,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; because then it is *guaranteed* that I will eventually experience the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; torture.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Good point. To be precise let's say that tomorrow you will split into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the ten copies, one of which will be tortured. Then one *year* from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;now merging is scheduled to occur. Therefore you behave differently?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I don't think you should.  (You may *have* to because that's how we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are built, but you still shouldn't.)
</em><br />
<br />Given this information before the split occurs, it makes it more likely that 
<br />
I will experience torture: the 1/10 chance initially, then the certainty of 
<br />
merging in a year - although the merging may result in memory of the torture 
<br />
rather than the first hand experience.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;As I like to say &quot;just because you are not (locally) experiencing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;something, doesn't mean it isn't happening to you&quot;. Suppose that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you don't know whether any merging is to ever happen. How should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that change the way you feel about your copy being tortured? Now,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I grant that you don't get the sweaty palms if there won't be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;any merging, but to me that's just a base animalistic reflex action.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The truth is that *you* are in two places at the same time, and in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the other place you are hurting a lot.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The point is that *now* your duplicate is in pain. For purely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;selfish reasons, this should be a big deal to you, I contend.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Whether or not eons from now some merging does or does not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;take place shouldn't change your approval or disapproval of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physical events taking place now.
</em><br />
<br />I have to disagree with you here. Why should I care about the suffering of 
<br />
some guy in another universe who thinks he is me, and whom I can never meet? 
<br />
I would be more concerned about the suffering of strangers in third world 
<br />
countries in my own universe.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I would worry similarly if I were to inherit the experiences of any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; unrelated third person; the fact that it is other copies of me who are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; suffering does not in itself make any selfish difference.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Two points. First, if it's an &quot;unrelated third person&quot;, it becomes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;very unclear what merging would mean. We ran into a little of that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with trying to obtain memories of having been a bat.
</em><br />
<br />The recording of actual feelings so that the person playing them back 
<br />
through some kind of neural interface experiences the feeling as if first 
<br />
hand is a common device in science fiction, and may well become a reality 
<br />
one day.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Second, I don't think that the sudden acquisition of memories is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;nearly as big a deal as the actual, first-time-though gaining of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;an experience. I would vastly rather be given the memories of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;having been tortured than to actually experience it (and retain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the memory).  (Some very nice thought experiments obtain when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;one plays off experience vs. memory-acquisition.)
</em><br />
<br />Yes.
