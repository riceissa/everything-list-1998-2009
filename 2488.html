Well here is a first try with some proposed questions for the FAQ list:
<br />
<br />I have filled in some responses here and there to illustrate the ideas of

<br />
<br />a) A pattern is a geometric structure that could vary in at least one 
<br />
characteristic from location to location within the pattern.  Patterns that 
<br />
individually contain information must consist of at least a set of more 
<br />
than two zero dimensional isolated discrete points.  Patterns are 
<br />
representable by N-bit binary strings.  Patterns need not be mathematical 
<br />
systems or computable.

<br />
<br />QUESTIONS
<br />
<br />SECTION 1
<br />
<br />How much information should the Everything itself contain?
<br />
<br />a) None
<br />
<br />b) Some
<br />
<br />Should the basic fabric of the Everything allow for universes with 
<br />
space-times that are continuous, granular, discrete, all three as separate 
<br />
types, blends?
<br />
<br />a) Granular.
<br />
<br />b) Granular and discrete.
<br />
<br />c) Discrete Granular.
<br />
<br />d) All of the above.
<br />
<br />Can there be &quot;motion&quot; without &quot;time&quot;?
<br />
<br />Can there be &quot;time&quot; without &quot;motion&quot;?
<br />
<br />SECTION 2
<br />
<br />What are the currently proposed models of the Everything itself or of its 
<br />
related concepts exclusive of any TOE each might support?
<br />
<br />a) The set of all mathematical structures:
<br />
<br />b) The set of all Turing machines:
<br />
<br />c) The set of all patterns.
<br />
<br />What is the relative information content of these models?
<br />
<br />a) The set of all mathematical structures is a selection out of all 
<br />
structures mathematical or not and so contains information.
<br />
<br />b) The set of all Turing machines is even more selective and thus contains 
<br />
even more information.
<br />
<br />c) The set of all patterns is absent selection and thus may contain no 
<br />
information.
<br />
<br />What concepts of space, time, and motion do they support?
<br />
<br />SECTION 3
<br />
<br />What are the basic expected features of an Everything TOE?
<br />
<br />What dimensionality should SAS supporting space-times have?
<br />
<br />What are the current models of physics in a discrete space time universe?
<br />
<br />What is the evidence the a &quot;Random Oracle&quot; and or &quot;true noise&quot; is necessary 
<br />
in at least some universes?
<br />
<br />a) If a universe is a theorem cascade in an N-bit, fc-FAS then Chaitin's 
<br />
incompleteness dictates that the cascade must stop.  There are no more than 
<br />
2^[N + c] theorems in the FAS.  But theorem cascades produce monotonically 
<br />
more AIT complex theorems.  For the cascade to stop it must end on a 
<br />
theorem that has no consequent under the configuration of the 
<br />
cascade.  This is a low AIT complexity theorem since I just described 
<br />
it.  The initiating axiom of the cascade is already more complex than 
<br />
this.  Thus we have a contradiction.  A random oracle can provide new 
<br />
information to the FAS [say new alphabet elements] as necessary and thus 
<br />
increases N eliminating the contradiction.  Further while the FAS is fixed 
<br />
the cascade is still producing ever more AIT complex theorems.  To satisfy 
<br />
this the successive theorems must eventually increase the number of 
<br />
alphabet elements they contain.  Some universes of this type may upon 
<br />
occasion use their random oracle to add this new information to a theorem 
<br />
making a new axiom [Godelian style incompleteness resolution] and using 
<br />
this new axiom to initiate a new cascade.   Such universes may more easily 
<br />
model the idea of &quot;self&quot;.
<br />
<br />Is consciousness necessary in a SAS?
<br />
<br />How does &quot;comp&quot; apply to an Everything TOE?
<br />
<br /><br />SECTION 4
<br />
<br />What are the currently proposed TOE models within the context of the 
<br />
various Everything models?
<br />
<br />a) A universe is a particular mathematical structure:
<br />
<br />b) A universe is a particular Turing machine:
<br />
<br />c) A universe is a self sequencing set of patterns:
<br />
<br />SECTION 5
<br />
<br />What can the various Everything TOE models predict?
<br />
<br />What can the various Everything TOE models retrodict?
<br />
