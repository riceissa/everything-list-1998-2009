Hi,
<br />
<br />Doug, regarding what you said about mind-body issue, do you consider the
<br />
&quot;mind&quot; an element of reality or just a result of brain cell operations?
<br />
<br />On another issue I do agree with Searle's statement about comparing human
<br />
behaviour with machines. Man cannot be identified only by the material part
<br />
(body). I don't think an Eliminative materialism would give a true
<br />
identity. The Man's world is built by the &quot;mind&quot;, with Thoughts.
<br />
As an example lets consider a student. When he goes to school for the first
<br />
time his world is nothing more than he saw at home, still very primordial
<br />
in terms of social behavior, science, etc. By the &quot;training&quot; that he is
<br />
subjected to he will change his world by the &quot;Thoughts and ideas&quot; that are
<br />
transmitted to him by the teacher. His world now is bigger, though his body
<br />
hasn't change much (only new brain &quot;nervous circuits&quot;). If eliminated the
<br />
mind on this little example, we would had a small percentage of the real
<br />
change.
<br />
<br />Does this makes any sense to you all?
<br />
<br />Cheers,
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;If what you suggest is true, then your conclusion would follow.  I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;claimed, though, that the reductionist thesis is in trouble, and you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;asked why. There is a huge literature on emergentism and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;reductionism, but let me just stick with the so-called mind-body
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;issue that Hal also alluded to.
</em><br />
<br />There have been two main reductionist strategies to deal with mental
<br />
states, and they both -- to say the least -- have stalled.  The two
<br />
strategies are:
<br />
<br />1.  Eliminative materialism
<br />
2.  Identity theory
<br />
<br />Eliminative materialism argued that human behavior could be explained
<br />
scientifically without reference to the mental states of folk
<br />
psychology.  S-R behaviorism -- as in Skinner -- was the great effort
<br />
here, and it is now largely judged a failure.  We seem to need mental
<br />
states to explain human -- and even lower animal -- behavior.
<br />
<br />So then there is the identity theory, the attempt to show that each
<br />
mental state is identical to some (or finitely many) physical states.
<br />
Well, this has not panned out either.  At worst, we may be in for
<br />
some many-to-many correspondence between mental states and physical
<br />
states, which spells doom for identity theory and reductionism.
<br />
<br />I probably have not said enough to convince anyone here. This is a
<br />
big issue, and much more could be said.  I am just trying to
<br />
summarize the current status of the mind-body debate.  At the very
<br />
least, the reductionist argument has been stalemated -- and there are
<br />
good reasons, having to do with the role of language, for thinking it
<br />
is false.
<br />
<br />Norman suggests the upshot for the Tegmark thesis:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;Thoughts&quot; are therefore NOT
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;infinite because they can be conceptually defined in terms of particles
</em><br />
and
<br />
quantum states, and there are not an infinite number of these permutations.
<br />
<br />Well, only if reductionism succeeds.  If reductionism fails, then,
<br />
unlike universes, which, on my reading of Tegmark, are discrete and
<br />
countable, thoughts are not only infinite but uncountably infinite.
<br />
In that case, thoughts -- and persons -- comprise an even larger
<br />
infinity than universes.  And -- although this is another argument --
<br />
at least a part of the universe would not behave deterministically.
<br />
<br />If you tend to resist what I am suggesting, consider three things:
<br />
<br />1.  How do you even individuate thoughts so as to count them or
<br />
correlate them with physical states?  Is the belief that Mark Twain
<br />
wrote Huckleberry Finn the same as or different from the belief that
<br />
Samuel Clemens wrote Huckleberry Finn?  Would that be one physical
<br />
state you would seek to correlate with it or two?  There are lots of
<br />
well-discussed conceptual problems here.
<br />
<br />2. The mind-brain relation has sometimes been compared to the
<br />
relation between software and hardware in computers.  A certain
<br />
software function might be endlessly realizable by different physical
<br />
(hardware) configurations in different computers. Similarly, I
<br />
suppose, the same hardware configuration might realize different
<br />
software functions in different computers.  The analogy might break
<br />
down, but this is the idea.
<br />
<br />3.  The denial of reductionism does not necessarily entail belief in
<br />
what is called &quot;a ghost in the machine,&quot; i.e., a soul or other
<br />
mystical something.  The denial of reductionism may instead imply
<br />
that not only is there no ghost, there also is no machine (i.e., we
<br />
don't behave in machine-like ways). (This is a point made by Searle.)
<br />
<br />John, I am not sure I understand everything you said. One thing I
<br />
would say along lines I think you suggest:  Determinism suggests a
<br />
closed system.  If you don't have a closed system, you don't get
<br />
deterministic predictiveness.  Human thought is both holistic and
<br />
unclosable.  Those features do not preclude mental causality, but
<br />
they do preclude deterministic, causal laws.
<br />
<br />Well, I hope I have not bored you all, but I do think that there are
<br />
considerations from the social sciences that bear on -- and possibly
<br />
challenge  -- Tegmark's thesis.
<br />
<br />Thanks for your responses.
<br />
<br />doug
