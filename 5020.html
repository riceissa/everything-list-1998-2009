<br />Because a universe whose space-time was subject to different physical 
<br />
laws in different regions would not have
<br />
been able to generate you and sustain you, or more precisely I suppose 
<br />
would only be able to generate
<br />
and sustain you with infinitesimal probability.
<br />
<br />And it would be even more highly unlikely that should you have been 
<br />
magically conjured by this
<br />
inconsistent-or-inconstant-physical-laws universe, that you would 
<br />
observe any other people (or rabbits, white or otherwise)
<br />
because they themselves would  have only infinitesimal probability of 
<br />
being magically, coincidentally conjured into
<br />
that universe.
<br />
<br />It's better to find the all of the essential constraints (all the way 
<br />
back to 10^-43 seconds after the big bang) which made it highly probable
<br />
that you (or something like you) would exist in the universe, and then 
<br />
explain how those constraints are
<br />
all consistent with each other and with information theory,
<br />
and then to realize that a set of constraints HAS TO BE consistent with 
<br />
(all of) each other and with information theory
<br />
and with making your (or equivalent creature's) existence highly 
<br />
probable, in order for you to actually exist with any
<br />
high probability. By the argument de facto, I think it's safe to say 
<br />
that &quot;things in the universe are such&quot; that people
<br />
(or functional equivalents) are highly  probable to exist  on a small 
<br />
but significant set of planets
<br />
(those with the right temperature ranges and  proportions of different 
<br />
elements) in the galaxies in our observable
<br />
portion of the universe.
<br />
<br />It is ONE HELL OF A DETAILED SET OF CONSTRAINTS that made all of this 
<br />
(us) highly probable,
<br />
White talking rabbits with watches are inconsistent with those 
<br />
constraints, in ways too boring perhaps to get into.
<br />
Ok, since we're way down here in the post, I'll get into it. General 
<br />
intelligence of human-like level (involving
<br />
ability to hypothesize, abstract flexibly, construct a wide variety of 
<br />
functional, purposeful constructions out of
<br />
raw materials, and plan actions and consequences in detail), only 
<br />
evolves by natural selection
<br />
in critters that are physically equipped to DO SOMETHING with their 
<br />
intelligence. For a rabbit, it's pretty
<br />
much limited to hopping about in more complex patterns to avoid being 
<br />
eaten, based on some kind of vastly
<br />
intelligent psyching out of where its preditor is going to strike next, 
<br />
and to determining where to find the
<br />
very best places to find the most nutritious and tasty grass. This is 
<br />
too limited a domain to require or select
<br />
for a general, long-range constructing and planning mind-firmware to 
<br />
develop in a rabbit brain..
<br />
<br />Another favorite of mine is why dolphins and whales are KIND OF 
<br />
intelligent (like a poodle or parrot is)
<br />
but not extremely...    So what, we're going to develop more complex 
<br />
tricky ways to bump things with
<br />
our snouts? I don't think so. Group hunting (in a too-easy, too uniform, 
<br />
too
<br />
acceleration-constrained-because viscous fluid habitat)
<br />
is as complex as dolphin brains ever need to be.
<br />
<br />Cheers, Eric
