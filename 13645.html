<br />
<br />DN:  Yes, in the biosphere, the physical structures and capabilities on
<br />
which behaviours supervene must indeed be presumed to be products of
<br />
evolution.  Then if the functionalist account is correct, this in effect
<br />
'selects' the unique corresponding interpretation from the infinite set
<br />
attributable in principle to the physics of such structures, relegating all
<br />
the others to 'imaginary' status at the level of this account of physical
<br />
evolution.
<br />
<br />This doesn't AFAICS present any knock-down proof of functionalism as the
<br />
correct account of consciousness, which presumably remains an open empirical
<br />
question.  Some quite different 'emergence paradigm' for consciousness -
<br />
which may or may not entail a unique and distinguishable bottom-up
<br />
correlation between physical and 1-person events - may win out; or we may
<br />
never know.  But in the case that functionalism pans out, a type of
<br />
correlation with physical causality seems at least comprehensible to me now,
<br />
as far as I've been able to think it through.
<br />
<br />Here's what's still not completely clear to me - perhaps you can assist me
<br />
with this.  We don't know *which* set of physical events is in effect
<br />
selected by the functionalist account, even though it may be reasonable to
<br />
believe that there is one.  Given this, it appears that should we be finally
<br />
convinced that only a functional account of 1-person phenomena uniquely
<br />
survives all attempted refutation, we can never in that case provide any
<br />
'distinguished' bottom up physical account of the same phenomena.  IOW we
<br />
would be faced with an irreducibly top-down mode of explanation for
<br />
consciousness, even though there is still an ineliminable implication to
<br />
specific fundamental aspects of the physics in 'instantiating' the bottom-up
<br />
causality.  Does this indeed follow, or am I still garbling something?
