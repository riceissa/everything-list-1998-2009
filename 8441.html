Yes, well I'm not prepared to go to that much effort, when I don't
<br />
know whether it will be good for me :)
<br />
<br />I turned to Wikipedia (collective groanings from the list I hear?),
<br />
which has this to say on the subject of self-identity (which I guess
<br />
is the relevant bit of Parfit):
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Self identity
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Parfit uses many examples seemingly inspired by Star Trek and other
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;science fiction, such as the teletransporter, to explore emotions and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;feelings regarding self-identity. He is a Reductionist, believing that
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self-identity can be reduced to a set of criteria that need not
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;suppose that people do exist. To Parfit, Identity can be fully
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;described impersonally: there need not be a determinate answer to the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;question &quot;Will the person that continues to exist remain to be me?&quot; We
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;could know all the facts about an entity's continued existence and not
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be able to answer the question of whether or not the persisting person
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;possesses a continual identity. He concludes that we are mistaken in
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assuming that personal identity is what matters, but rather that
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relation R does: psychological connectedness (namely, of memory and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;character) and continuity (overlapping chains of strong
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;connectedness).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;In Parfit's system, individuals are nothing more than our brains and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our bodies, but identity cannot be reduced to either, for identity, in
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the classical sense, is not what matters. Rather, Relation R is the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;point around which Parfit's theories turn. Parfit concedes that his
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;theories conflict with rival Reductionist theories rarely in everyday
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;life, and are only brought to blows by the introduction of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;extraordinary examples. However, he defends their usage in that they
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seem to arrouse genuine and strong feelings in many of us. Identity is
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not as determinate as we often suppose it is, but instead, such
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;determinacy owes itself mainly to the way we talk. People exist in the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;same way that nations or clubs exist (which may be raised as support
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the existence of corporations and corporate law).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A key Parfitian question is: given the choice to maintain your
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;personal identity or your psychological continuity, which would you
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;choose? Would one prefer to die (a loss of character but a persistence
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of personal identity), or instead have one's personal identity
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fragmented, but retain one's personality?  
<br />
<br />In the Multiverse most of us everythingers inhabit, a lot of this
<br />
makes sense. Identity, ie what is or what is not me, is a problematic
<br />
question. It brings to mind the discussion between Bruno and was it
<br />
Jesse? (can't seem to find it in the archive) that they couldn't
<br />
really separate their identities in the Multiverse, as there would be
<br />
some continuous path from someone called Bruno to someone called
<br />
Jesse.
<br />
<br />Clearly the relationship R is crucial - I believe its is essentially
<br />
equivalent to my &quot;TIME assumption&quot;. Perhaps there is no choice to
<br />
Parfit's question above - ones identity melds, but one's psyche is
<br />
continuous - this is QTI, and also explains why reincarnation is
<br />
effectively a solution to QTI (the good old &quot;Amoeba croaks&quot; thread).
<br />
<br />PS - I'm still in the dark re gaol and hypnogic myoclonus...
