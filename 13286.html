<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hi Russell,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I wanted to let you know that I read your book &quot;Theory of Nothing&quot;, it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was a nice read and had a lot of interesting ideas.  I espeacially
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; liked the comparison of the empty set to it's disjoint set containing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everything.  Perhaps the idea I had the most objections to was the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sections regarding passing mirror test -&gt; self awareness -&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious.  I agree that this relationship is true, if one passes a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mirror test they must be conscious, 
</em><br />
<br />I don't know of any reason why self awareness =&gt; consciousness, and
<br />
certainly don't claim this in the book. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; but I disagree with the reverse
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relationship that consciousness -&gt; passing mirror test.  Or that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness -&gt; self awareness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />self-awareness =&gt; passing mirror test is probably not true. I give the
<br />
example of dogs for whom the world of scent is far more important than
<br />
the visual world. That image in  the mirror doesn't smell a bit like
<br />
them, so it is obviously another dog. :) We don't know whether dogs
<br />
are self-aware, only that they don't pass  mirror tests.
<br />
<br />The reason why I assert that consciousness =&gt; self awareness has to do
<br />
with the Occam catastrophe argument. My book is not uniformly well
<br />
founded and does mix some speculation with with better known
<br />
results. The Occam catastrophe argument is somewhat speculative. My
<br />
only hope is that I've been sufficiently clear to allow others to
<br />
understand and criticise the arguments. So of course if you can come
<br />
up with an argument that avoids the Occam catastrophe without
<br />
necessity of self awareness for consciousness, I'd be very
<br />
interested. I'll read on to see what else you say.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I liken passing the mirror test to a creature having an epihany
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recognizing the movements in their reflection to their own movements.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For example Jean Piaget's theory of cognotive development specifies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different stages marked by some limitation in thinking or reasoning.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; At the Preoperational stage, if you pour liquid from a narrow cylinder
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; into cylinder with a greater radius the child will always say there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was more liquid in the narrow cylinder.  The inability to recognize
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and associate one's movements with a reflection could be a similair
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mental block and failing the mirror test in itself shouldn't discount
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-awareness.
</em><br />
<br />Apparently human children do not pass the mirror test until age 18
<br />
months or so. I regret that I didn't think to try this on my son when
<br />
he was that age, although I suspect I would have found him
<br />
developmentally advanced in this aspect.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have more objections to consciousness -&gt; self awareness, perhaps we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just have a different concept of the word conciousness but I hold
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness to have the same meaning as awareness.  Awareness of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anything implies conciousness, as to imply otherwise would allow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; philosophical zombies.  If cats (which are mostly anti-social
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; creatures) are not consciouss then all cats are zombies.  Cats
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; however, can see, if they are zombies than it should be logically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible for a person to report being able to see and act in all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; respects as a seeing person yet be a &quot;sight-zombie&quot; not truly and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousnessly experiencing vision like you and I do.  Perhaps you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mean conscioussness to be an internal voice of thought and reasoning,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if that is the case then I agree with you that most animals lack this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ability.
</em><br />
<br />Actually, I do not use either of those meanings. What I mean by
<br />
consciousness is the ability to be something, in the sense of Thomas
<br />
Nagel in &quot;What is it like to be a bat?&quot;. This may seem like the most
<br />
useless definition, however one can easily see that it can be applied
<br />
to anthropic reasoning. To be conscious is to be a member of the
<br />
equivalence class of observers (or observer moments) used in anthropic
<br />
arguments. This then feeds into the Occam catastrophe argument, and
<br />
why I assert self-awareness is necessary for consciousness. 
<br />
<br />It is true, in a sense, that this allows the possibility of
<br />
philosophical zombies. However, adding the additional assumption of
<br />
functionalism (which I do), we can rule out zombies, at least in the
<br />
human case.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Another theory that I had some issues with was that true randomness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; provided by quantum mechanics is necessary for intelligence.  Tegmark
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has shown that quantum effects have no direct effects on the brain,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; neurons operae on a scale much larger than quantum noise.  
</em><br />
<br />Tegmark's argument is not directed at the sort of mechanism I was
<br />
suggesting, but rather the sort of mechanism that Roger Penrose
<br />
suggested. What Tegmark demonstrated was that brains could not
<br />
maintain coherent quantum states long enough for realistic quantum
<br />
computing.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If physics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was deterministic I don't think the chemistry and functioning of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain would be effected in a way that precluded intelligence.  Also as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you mentioned, using psuedo random numbers vs. true random numbers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; didn't effect the evolution of the alife creatures,
</em><br />
<br />At least I have the courage to report the (so far) negative results of
<br />
experiments that were partly designed to test this hypothesis.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  and state of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; art psuedo random number generates have more output than the amount of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information contained in any single branch of this multiuniverse so it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should be possible to algorithmically create strong AI which uses
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; PRNG.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />How so? The amount of information generated by a PRNG is less than the
<br />
number of bytes required to encode it. That is a simple consequence of
<br />
algorithmic information theory.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Overall though it was very insightful and did a great deal to help me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand some of the terminology used on the Everything List.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />Thanks.
