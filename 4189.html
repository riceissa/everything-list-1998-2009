TCM challenges me on the claim that we seem to be living through
<br />
an algorithmic revolution or paradigm shift, instead apparently
<br />
preferring a big ho, hum, shrug as more apropos.
<br />
<br />I dont really know what the disagreement
<br />
is yet, it seems to be artificial/manufactured. 
<br />
in one sense I am referring to nothing other than what KK outlined in his
<br />
wired article I posted.  
<br />
<br />unfortunately for TCM I think he's
<br />
barking up the wrong tree, I could cite huge piles of evidence.
<br />
also, I would credit TCM as being one of the earlier commentators
<br />
on key aspects of this revolution.
<br />
<br />unfortunately, it is difficult to realize one is living in the
<br />
middle of a revolution, and historically most revolutions are only 
<br />
identified in retrospect.
<br />
<br />I would take all of TCMs own citations and turn them around in my
<br />
favor. I would classify all the following as occurring under
<br />
the heading &quot;algorithmic revolution&quot; (not the greatest moniker I admit..
<br />
a provisional one for me right now)
<br />
<br />- advent of cyberspace, web, email, browsers etcetera
<br />
- advent of mass software
<br />
- PC revolution
<br />
- microsoft &amp; intel from zero to billion dollar companies in short decades
<br />
- quantum computing is on the way
<br />
- fractals. could not be discovered without algorithms. a new metaphor
<br />
for not only nature but all reality.
<br />
- complexity theory. again, not possible before the algorithmic metaphor
<br />
and mass computational capabilities
<br />
- simulation, &quot;in silico science&quot;
<br />
- moore's law
<br />
- photorealistic rendering
<br />
- (relational) databases
<br />
- mass economic shift into information technology as driving force..
<br />
&quot;bits versus atoms&quot;.. (negroponte)
<br />
- video games
<br />
- etcetera!!
<br />
<br />its difficult to discriminate the distinction between 3 revolutions that
<br />
cross pollinate each other: revolution in computing power (including
<br />
storage &amp; access of data), revolution
<br />
in communication (cyberspace), and the algorithmic revolution. 
<br />
<br />I think it is fair to say the former two are subsumed into 
<br />
the latter. the fastest chips are completely valueless unless 
<br />
there is something to do with them (run software).  moreover, we dont
<br />
care which chips or technology our software runs on. (it may all be
<br />
quantum computers in not-so-distant future).
<br />
<br />cyberspace is stitched out of software, such as internet protocols,
<br />
web servers, email servers, etcetera; it is in
<br />
fact a sort of &quot;real-time algorithm&quot;.  tim berners lee invented a
<br />
set of **protocols** (&quot;communication algorithm&quot;).
<br />
<br />this fact becomes clearer
<br />
as the algorithmic aspects of that communication system are enhanced.
<br />
for example, ebay is not merely a communication system, its a complex
<br />
cyberspatial-algorithmic system for auctions. google is a complex
<br />
algorithmic system for traversing web pages &amp; serving them up in
<br />
a search engine, and worth billions because they do it more effectively
<br />
than anyone, i.e. have the best and most finely tuned &quot;algorithms&quot;. 
<br />
etcetera .. 
<br />
<br />we see that the most valuable aspects of
<br />
cyberspace are not about passive communication but active algorithmic
<br />
enhancements and optimizations of information flow.
<br />
<br />lately I have been tracking the mass commoditization of video games.
<br />
recently video game industry revenue for the 1st time just outdistanced 
<br />
hollywood box office receipts.
<br />
<br />&quot;the sims&quot; has sold 18 million copies. new video games are starting to
<br />
replace movies as a core entertainment venue. this will all pale in the
<br />
future as mass group games are invented that run over cyberspace, 
<br />
inciting further cultural shifting. the human race is getting married
<br />
to its algorithms, so to speak.
<br />
<br />note that we still dont know the full implications or possibilities
<br />
of algorithms. new breakthrough ones are waiting to 
<br />
be devised. for an example of an amazing
<br />
embodiment, look at what genetic algorithms are capable of. and its still
<br />
an open question whether true AI is an algorithm.
<br />
<br /><br />ahem!!! what is the relevance to a TOE??? well historically it is clear
<br />
our perception of reality is based on our favorite metaphor of the times.
<br />
in recent ages it was (a) the clock, &quot;clockwork universe&quot;, (b) the
<br />
steam engine. and now it is (c) computer/algorithm/information.  clearly
<br />
it is no coincidence whatsoever that new TOEs are essentially algorithmic.
<br />
its the human race's latest-and-greatest metaphor for reality.
<br />
<br />scientists have been slow to adopt to this shift, and I would argue they
<br />
are still underutilizing simulation to some extent. science &amp; physics
<br />
is still yet to be influenced fully by the algorithmic revolution. one
<br />
striking example I think will happen-- I believe billion 
<br />
dollar particle accelerators
<br />
may be downgraded in importance in favor of extremely effective simulations.
<br />
<br />(besides-- does anyone fully realize how much software plays already such a
<br />
crucial, foremost role in existing accelerators??)
<br />
<br />now, Ive veered into some wild stuff, but I propose that a new TOE
<br />
will fully embody the &quot;algorithmic revolution&quot; Ive outlined above, it will
<br />
be just another natural &quot;spinoff&quot; ensuing from it.
<br />
<br /><br />there are now many nice books on the subject
<br />
<br />&quot;the bit &amp; the pendulum&quot; --esp recommend this for people here based
<br />
on its physics focus.
<br />
the author proposes that after the clockwork revolution, and the
<br />
energy revolution (steam engine), we are now using the computer &amp; information
<br />
as the new metaphor in physics and science.
<br />
<br />&quot;complexification&quot; by casti
<br />
<br />&quot;would be worlds&quot; by casti. on the new foremost role of simulation in
<br />
science
<br />
<br />&quot;advent of the algorithm&quot;. by berlinsky. berlinsky is a very good
<br />
mathematical writer and makes the compelling case in his book that
<br />
the algorithm is the 2nd most important
<br />
intellectual invention of the human race after calculus.
<br />
<br /><br />I have many more links Ive collected in the theory-edge FAQ which
<br />
I can post if there is more interest.
