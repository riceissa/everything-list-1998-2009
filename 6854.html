<br />
There is a particularly interesting and surprising difference that I
<br />
am aware of between the MWI (many-worlds interpretation of quantum
<br />
mechanics) and more general multiverse models like Tegmark's and
<br />
especially Schmidhuber's.  Even though the MWI is much better known and
<br />
better accepted, it has a major unsolved problem that is actually dealt
<br />
with much more successfully in larger multiverse models.  That is the
<br />
question of probability or measure.
<br />
<br />The MWI is basically modern quantum theory minus the concept of wave
<br />
function collapse.  Instead, the universal wave function is considered
<br />
to just evolve as a single mathematical whole under a deterministic
<br />
physical rule that is the generalized Schrodinger equation.  In fact
<br />
Everett's original work can be thought of as an attempt to investigate
<br />
the question of what the world would look like if we didn't have random
<br />
collapse and just had the smooth, deterministic evolution.  Of course
<br />
what he found was that even though there is no collapse, the universe
<br />
would in a sense *appear* to have random collapses.
<br />
<br />Measurement-like interactions lead to effective &quot;splits&quot; in the
<br />
mathematical expression of the wave function, separate branches that
<br />
have essentially no more causal interactions between them.  For all
<br />
practical purposes the wave function can be split into pieces which
<br />
evolve separately.  Each piece corresponds to one possible outcome of
<br />
the measurement.  Each piece has an observer who &quot;thinks&quot; he sees that
<br />
particular outcome.  To him, the transition was discontinuous and random,
<br />
exactly like what is called wave function collapse in the conventional
<br />
interpretation.
<br />
<br />This is the amazing feature of the MWI, that by removing wave function
<br />
collapse and simplifying the assumptions of the theory, we recover the
<br />
prediction of an illusion of wave function collapse.  It is IMO one of
<br />
the most amazing philosophical results of the century.
<br />
<br />However, one piece is missing.  Although Everett showed that the
<br />
universe would, in effect, split and create separate observers who would
<br />
observe separate outcomes, the question remains of how that relates to
<br />
probability.  The traditional quantum wave function collapse postulate
<br />
not only says that we will observe a random outcome, it also tells what
<br />
the probability of each possibility will be, based on what is called
<br />
Born's rule.
<br />
<br />Deriving Born's rule from Everett's analysis has been difficult.  In fact,
<br />
it has been &quot;solved&quot; many times over the years, but none of the proposed
<br />
solutions has really been satisfactory, which is why it keeps getting
<br />
solved all over again.  It is easy to show that the universe will split
<br />
and observers will appear to observe random outcomes; it is hard to show
<br />
that the most likely outcomes are the ones most likely to be observed.
<br />
<br />It is this problem, ironically, which is solved much more easily
<br />
in the multiverse models we discuss.  For example, in Schmidhuber's
<br />
picture we see the multiverse as an ensemble produced by all possible
<br />
computer programs.  Each program produces output which is considered to
<br />
be a universe.
<br />
<br />In this model, there is an easy and attractive argument for why some
<br />
universes should have higher measure than others.  If we consider only
<br />
finite-sized programs, then an n-bit program is associated with a fraction
<br />
of 1/2^n of all infinite bit strings.  This means that if we imagine all
<br />
such bit strings as the programs which are creating universes, shorter
<br />
programs will occupy a greater fraction of the total space of universes.
<br />
This leads to the most important (and perhaps only!) prediction of
<br />
multiverse models: the universe we live in should be described by a
<br />
relatively short and simple program (or mathematical description, in
<br />
Tegmark's formulation).
<br />
<br />In principle, if we knew the program for our universe, we could calculate
<br />
its measure (at least approximately).  And likewise for the programs
<br />
for other universes.  And we have this simple and powerful argument
<br />
that explains why certain programs should have much higher measure,
<br />
and hence higher probability, than others.
<br />
<br />Yet no such argument appears to exist for the MWI.  There, we have
<br />
to rely on a variety of different assumptions to prove the Born rule,
<br />
none of which have been widely accepted.
<br />
<br />It's interesting that these two conceptions of a multiverse have
<br />
such different properties.  Of course the branches in the MWI have a
<br />
much closer mathematical relationship than the separate universes of a
<br />
Schmidhuber multiverse, so the problem is more complicated with the MWI.
<br />
It would be nice if there were a simple, information-based argument
<br />
similar to the one used for the multiverse, that would produce the Born
<br />
rule in the MWI.
