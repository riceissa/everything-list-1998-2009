<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; It is hardly nonsense. The predictions can easily depend of the

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; example:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; In one picture, observer A decides to measure the spin of an electron

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; spin of the electron in the y direction. Observer A will see the spin
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; of the electron aligned with x axis, and Observer B will see it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; aligned with the y axis. Both observations are correct in the first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; person picture of that observer. A &quot;person&quot; with the third person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; perspective, sees observers A and B as inhabiting separate `worlds' of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; a multiverse, each with appropriate measure that can be computed from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Quantum Mechanics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 	On the contrary, this is a textbook example of the way I said it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; works.  The theory predicts some measure distribution of observers; an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; individual observer sees an observation drawn from that distribution.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; There are no different sets of predictions for different pictures, just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the measure distribution and the sample from it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It sounds to me like you don't think the prediction changes according
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to what the observer chooses to observe? An electron cannot have its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; spin aligned with the x axis and the y axis at the same time. Once the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experimenter has chosen which direction to measure the spin, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; history of that particular is observer is constrained by that fact,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and the predictions of QM altered accordingly. This is true both in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MWI and the Copenhagen interpretation, and is the &quot;spooky&quot; nature of QM.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's no different from the situation in classical mechanics.  Of
<br />
course an observer does not really have free will; he will do what he does
<br />
because that's what the equations of physics say for his initial
<br />
conditions.  The only &quot;spooky&quot; thing about QM was the alleged collapse of
<br />
the wavefunction upon &quot;observation&quot;, which in Copenhagen seems to give the
<br />
&quot;observer&quot; a special physical power.  This is not the case for the MWI,
<br />
and the MWI is not &quot;spooky&quot; unless you count the fact that other you-like
<br />
beings must exist.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The predictions of QM do of course depend on the initial
<br />
conditions, which determine what the observer will look at.  (Or more
<br />
generally, the measure distribution of observations.)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In QM, of course, it's certainly true that if an observer or other
<br />
object becomes entangled with a system in a specific way, the time
<br />
evolution would be different than if a different entanglement had
<br />
occurred.  Trivial and unrelated to your previous fallacy, which involved 
<br />
not different physical observations but different ways of analyzing the
<br />
SAME physical situation.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 	A theory predicts some measure distribution on the space of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; conscious observations.  From the point of view of an observer, you see
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one observation drawn from that measure distribution.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 	If measure were conserved for a particular individual as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; function of time, you immediately have 2 problems:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -	How to define a particular individual?  You need to, or else the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; measure of other people would count too, and would stay relatively
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; constant as opposed to the rapidly diminishing measure of &quot;you&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; This is a furphy. I have no problem whatsoever in knowing that I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; who I am. If you are unsure of your identity, then that's your problem.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 	Nature must have a mathematical criterion for it, if it is going
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to figure in a theory of physics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Quite agreed. However, I don't believe this to be much of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem. Most mathematical treatments of such take it to be some kind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of projection operator.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then &quot;most mathematical treatments&quot; are not computationalist.
<br />
There is in fact no reason to suppose that individual identity is at all
<br />
well defined, and the closest that computationalism could come would be to
<br />
define it as an implementation of a computation - which would NOT lead to
<br />
immortality, since the number of implementations of a given computation
<br />
decays with time.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -	The expected value of your age would be infinite, contrary to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; observations which indicate no unusual age on your part.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This para still indicates that you are falling for this rather absurd
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sampling assumption mentioned above. Give me one good reason why you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would expect conciousness to sample randomly from the set of all such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;concious points&quot;, rather than in an ordered (and potentially
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unbounded) sequence of self-consistent points (ie a history).
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you aware of this entire so-called history?  I don't know
<br />
about you but I only have one moment of observation to go on - now.  Your
<br />
talk of random vs. ordered sampling is total nonsense - of course there is
<br />
no 'jumping around in time'.  It is not a random sampling, it is an
<br />
effectively-random sampling, since all the moments of observation exist.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that when you have a limited set of information, you
<br />
must use the Bayesian proceedure for extropolation.  There is no mystery
<br />
about it.  If you open your door and see a long string lying in the
<br />
street, you are unlikely to be right near one end.  This in no way implies
<br />
that the string has to be chopped up into little pieces.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I do indeed think it is as obvious as, say, 1+1=2.  And the so
<br />
called 'history', to work as you say, would have to be defined in a way
<br />
such that individual identity had a mathematical definition and had
<br />
special dualistic laws of physics such that measure was conserved on it as
<br />
a function of time, which is ridiculous.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Computationalism, by contrast, suggests that measure is
<br />
proportional to the number of implementations of each conscious
<br />
computation, which is not conserved.
<br />
