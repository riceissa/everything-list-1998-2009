<br />
<br />OK, I will give you a completely different explanation why, for any 
<br />
proposition p, Bp is true in any cul-de-sac world. But first I explain 
<br />
a fundamental duality in modal logics.
<br />
<br />In modal logic there is an important duality, which has been discovered 
<br />
by Aristotle (the founder of modal logic), and which is encapsulated in 
<br />
the Aristotelian Square:
<br />
<br />Read Bp as &quot;p is true in all (accessible) world&quot;. What I will say holds 
<br />
both for the Leibniz multiverse (= a collection of observer-moments or 
<br />
worlds), and Kripke multiverse (the same but with a accessibility 
<br />
relation among observer-moments).
<br />
<br />To make it concrete read B by &quot;everywhere in Belgium&quot;, and p by &quot;it 
<br />
rains&quot;.
<br />
<br />For someone (in Belgium or not)  we can distinguish the following four 
<br />
nuances, which I put in the Aristotelian square:
<br />
<br /><br />1.  Bp      2.   ~Bp
<br />
<br />3.  B~p    4.  ~B~p
<br />
<br /><br />&quot;1.&quot;  (Bp) means &quot;p is true in all (accessible) worlds&quot; (here: it rains 
<br />
everywhere in Belgium)
<br />
&quot;2.&quot; (~Bp) means &quot;it is false that p is true in all (acc.) worlds 
<br />
(here: it is false that it rains everywhere in Belgium). That means 
<br />
that there is a (acc.) world where p is not true. Here:there is a place 
<br />
in Belgium where it does NOT rain.
<br />
&quot;3.&quot; (B~p) means &quot;~p  is true in all (accessible) worlds&quot;, which is the 
<br />
same as &quot;p is false in all (accessible) world&quot;, or &quot;there is no (acc.) 
<br />
worlds in which p is true. Here: &quot;there is no place in Belgium where it 
<br />
rains&quot;, or &quot;nowhere does it rain in Belgium&quot;, or &quot;good wether 
<br />
everywhere in Belgium&quot;
<br />
&quot;4.&quot; (~B~p) means &quot;it is false that ~p is true in all accessible 
<br />
worlds&quot;. This is the same as saying that there is an accessible world 
<br />
where p is true. In our example: it is false that [it does not rain] 
<br />
everywhere in Belgium, or &quot;there is a place in Belgium where it rains.
<br />
<br />~B~p is called the dual of Bp.
<br />
Bp means p true in all accessible world, more precisely (Kripke) Bp is 
<br />
true in some world \alpha if p is true in all world \beta such that 
<br />
\alpha reaches \beta (which we could write \a R \b).
<br />
Thus, ~B~p true in \a, means &quot;it is false that ~p is true in all world 
<br />
accessible from \a&quot;, but this means (by classical logic again) that 
<br />
there is a world accessible from \a where p is true.
<br />
<br />Let us write Dp for ~B~p. D can be seen as a new modality defined from 
<br />
B.
<br />
Not that ~D~p, the dual of D, is the same as (by definition) 
<br />
~(~(B~(~p))), but that is Bp (in classical logic p is equivalent with 
<br />
~~p). So B and D are duals of each other. If you read the B as a Box, 
<br />
read D as a diamond. B = [], and D = &lt;&gt; (with the previous notation)
<br />
<br />Now, the &quot;pedagogical&quot; problem, linked to the truth table of the 
<br />
implication, has reappeared just above, when I mention &quot;by classical 
<br />
logic again&quot;.
<br />
<br />I want explain you how I could have manage to hide it (which could be, 
<br />
or not,  a good pedagogy).
<br />
<br />The idea is to take at once the D modality as primitive.
<br />
In that case it is enough to define the meaning of Dp in a world \a by 
<br />
saying that Dp is true in \a when there exists an accessible world 
<br />
(from \a) where p is true. It is the equivalent of the &quot;KRIPKE 
<br />
IMPORTANT LINE&quot; from the preceding posts.
<br />
<br />Now take, in some multiverse, a dead-end world (terminal world, 
<br />
cul-de-sac world, etc.), i.e. a world from which you can access NO 
<br />
worlds (not even itself).
<br />
<br />In that case it is obvious that, in such dead-end world, any 
<br />
proposition of the form ~D~p are true, because if ~D~p was false then 
<br />
D~p would be true (because all worlds obey classical logic, so all 
<br />
propositions are either true or false). But then, D~p being true, it 
<br />
means there would be an accessible world where ~p is true. In 
<br />
particular there would be an accessible world, but that cannot be the 
<br />
case given that we have consider a dead-end world.
<br />
<br />So it is obvious (it should be obvious) that in any dead-end world, the 
<br />
proposition of the form ~D&lt;whatever&gt; are always true. They literally 
<br />
assert the non existence of an accessible world.
<br />
Now we can define Bp by its dual ~D~p, and this entails, without going 
<br />
trough the logical difficulty (of the implication) that Bp, whatever p 
<br />
is, is always true is dead-end world.
<br />
<br />If you read Bp as &quot;necessary p&quot;, and &quot;Dp&quot; as &quot;possible p&quot;, you see that 
<br />
dead-end world are not particularly funny: in dead-end world everything 
<br />
is necessary and nothing is possible! Caution!
<br />
<br /><br />Here is the Aristotelian Square in term of the D modality:
<br />
<br />1.  ~D~p      2.   D~p
<br />
<br />3.  ~Dp         4.  Dp
<br />
<br />You should see that ~Dp is the same as B~p, and ~Bp is the same as D~p.
<br />
<br />I give you the duality for well known modalities:
<br />
<br />B = obligation;   D = permission
<br />
B = everywhere;  D = somewhere
<br />
B = always;   D = once
<br />
B = necessary;    D = possible
<br />
B = for all;  D = it exists
<br />
B = provable;  D = consistent
<br />
<br />Please verify. For example if Bp = &quot;p is obligatory&quot;  Dp = ~B~p = it is 
<br />
not obligatory that ~p = p is permitted. Also, if ~p is not permitted, 
<br />
it means p is obligatory.
<br />
<br />To sum up, if you have a difficulty to grasp that Bp is true in 
<br />
dead-end world, just take the diamond D as primitive modality, remember 
<br />
its Kripke meaning, i.e. Dp is true in \a if there is a world \b with 
<br />
both \a R \b and p true in \b.
<br />
And then define Bp by ~D~p. D&lt;wathever&gt; is always false in dead end, 
<br />
and so B&lt;whatever&gt; is always true in dead-end.
<br />
<br />Obviously the proposition (Bp -&gt; p) is false in dead-end. If it where 
<br />
true, then we would have Bf and Bf-&gt;f, so by the rule of modus ponens 
<br />
(worlds obey classical logic) we would have f in dead-end, but f is 
<br />
false in all world!
<br />
<br />Note that a characteristic formula of the &quot;near death&quot; multiverse was 
<br />
&quot;(~Bf  -&gt;  ~B(~Bf))&quot;, with the D modality, you can write it Dt -&gt; DBf, 
<br />
which you can read &quot;if I am alive then I can die&quot; (or: if I am in a 
<br />
transient world then I can reach a dead-end world).
<br />
<br />Hope that helps,
<br />
<br />Bruno
