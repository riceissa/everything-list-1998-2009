<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I think the difference (and confusion on my part) arises from the fact
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that you are not using the measure suggested by Schmidhuber. Instead you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are looking at all infinite computations and 'peek' into the state of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the machine. And I agree this will probably give an additional shift
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;towards 'large' numbers and concepts involving limits towards infinity,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;like the reals. And perhaps it's not a bad idea. It is, after all, a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;larger set than the set of turing machines that come to a halt - i.e.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;all halting turing-machines can be implemented by your set by simply
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;adding an 'infinite loop' at the end, so to say.
</em><br />
<br />I agree.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;So, how is that measure defined? One shot at a semi-formal definition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would perhaps be something like this;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;O(p,i)=The i:th string the program p chooses to expose.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I~(O)=An interpretation of O.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I(p)=lim( I~(O(p,i)), i-&gt;inf )
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;M(I´,N)=(number of programs p of length N whose I(p)=I´ ) / 3^N
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;M(I´)=lim( M(I´,N), N-&gt;inf )
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Or do you have a better suggestion? (Note that this definition gets rid
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of 'internal' UD:s since they don't have an interpretation in the limit)
</em><br />
<br />I will think about it. I'm not sure it is so easy. My own way to search
<br />
a measure is based on the Godelian modal logics of self-reference. 
<br />
With my UDA (Universal Dovetailer Argument, also cited as PE-omega in this
<br />
discussion) I show that comp implies that physics is a branch of 
<br />
machine's psychology. Then I use the Godelian self-reference logic to
<br />
redefine notion like first person and third-person and also a notion
<br />
of observation. I conjecture that one of these logics should give the skeleton of the space of &quot;physical&quot; propositions, and eventually I showed that this skeleton is (quasi)-isomomorph to the Birckhoff-von Neumann
<br />
Quantum logic.
<br />
This is the way I hope to extract the Hilbert Space structure and quantum- like measure from the logic of self-reference.
<br />
I'm sorry of pointing to such a weird field which is apparantly far from physics and metaphysics, but I really think it provides, for those willing to accept the computationalist hypothesis, a formidable shortcut. 
<br />
For exemple, your present little attempt is only able to define a third
<br />
person measure where I need (this is shown by the UDA) first person
<br />
notions.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Well, that was a mistake on my part that I tried to correct in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;followup; 
</em><br />
<br />I got the follow-up just a little to late. No problem I see your point.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I didn't actually mean 'linear differential equation'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But I did make an assumption. And I frequently do just to see what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;happens, even though I don't even believe these assumptions to be true.
</em><br />
<br />That is what I call doing science. Reasoning on assumptions.
<br />
BTW nobody in this list should infer that I believe in comp.
<br />
Of course I will not hide the fact that I am utterly fascinated by
<br />
comp's consequences. But I am still open that my or similar 
<br />
works would lead to a refutation of comp.
<br />
Mmh... To be honest I begin to doubt that too :-)
<br />
I *do* find comp more and more plausible, thanks to the quantum
<br />
experimental weirdness.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Unfortunately I don't understand a word of french :-(.
</em><br />
<br />There is someone translating it. So it's a question of time ...
<br />
I am also writing two papers in English. I will also put some old
<br />
english papers in my URL, but these are very concise and
<br />
computer-science minded, and ..., well old, I say. 
<br />
But I can send you copies if you want.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Third person physical time and first person subjective time 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; are internal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; modalities (infered by machines entangled with deep 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; computations, ...).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; They have nothing to do with the 'time step' of the DU. In my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'ultimate 
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Heh, no, I didn't think so. And I feel that I somewhat unjustly accused
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you. Perhaps I should have accused Schmidhuber instead, whose first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;assumption of his paper is &quot;Each universe evolves on a discrete time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;scale&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />Good idea, to accuse Schmidhuber instead ;-) 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I also feel that the concept of MWI splitting promotes this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;picture (and should therefore be banned :-).
</em><br />
<br />Yes, but note that here Schmidhuber is rather coherent. There are
<br />
many computations and these computations differentiates. 
<br />
I do not believe (with comp assumption!) that there is even one 
<br />
objective universe. There is a 'phenomenology' of many universes.
<br />
In 'fact' there are only dreams (computations seen from the 
<br />
machine's first person point of view). And the laws of mind, or the
<br />
machine's psychology shows that some dreams are sharable among
<br />
vast collection of machines. This makes it possible
<br />
for machines to project and believe in universes and still be
<br />
approximatively correct.
<br />
(a little like Newton's absolute time is approximatively correct
<br />
in our neighborhood).
<br />
<br />To compare still with Schmidhuber, it seems to me that he links
<br />
our &quot;real&quot; universe or multiverse with one computation. Then he
<br />
try to find prior for the program generating that computation.
<br />
I give an argument (UDA) showing that, although such prior
<br />
could be (and plausibly is) necessary, our consciousness' flux
<br />
cannot be attach to a single computation. So as you say we must
<br />
take into account the collection of our infinite computational
<br />
continuations as well.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Personally, I could just as well look at the universe as 'evolving in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the x-direction'. Or, simply, looking at e.g. the Maxwell equation, that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the program has a 4-dimensional array that is successively expanded and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;refined to reach an infinite extent and infinite resolution in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;limit.
</em><br />
<br />That is quite possible with comp. Nevertheless something like
<br />
&quot;the x-direction&quot; (in fact the notion of space) is very hard to
<br />
justify. Not to speak of Maxwell equation, nor even F=ma !
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />
