<br />
I think the problem is that folks are assuming that
<br />
the only way you can tell whether you are awake or
<br />
dreaming is by sensory input limited physical senses,
<br />
ie., 5 senses.
<br />
<br />If one pays attention, one can be aware of a number of
<br />
senses that are not quantified by popular
<br />
understanding. 
<br />
<br />One of these is the awareness of the passage of time.
<br />
<br />One can remember *typically* which memories come
<br />
before or after another. Not always, but a sense of
<br />
temporal organization exists for most people within
<br />
the ability to manipulate memories.
<br />
<br />Another more difficult *burried sense* is one that
<br />
allows to ask the question: where do our words come
<br />
from?
<br />
<br />If one concentrates, one can be somewhat aware of the
<br />
flow of words from the depths of their consciousness
<br />
as they *feel* a meaning, and turn that meaning into
<br />
the spoken word. How is that one has the ability to
<br />
explore this awareness? Is it a journey through some
<br />
kind of n-space? Is focus something that can be moved?
<br />
How does one point to an abstract space? I've just
<br />
explained how one might explore the *where do my words
<br />
come from* thing. But how do you locate this space?
<br />
I've not provided the address, just a description of
<br />
how one might concentrate in a way to illustrate this
<br />
concept.
<br />
<br />Another would be minds-eye thinking. How one
<br />
visualizes something. How do we do this? How do we
<br />
even know we can do it? One could argue the ability
<br />
just apeared and we found some kind of tag/button we
<br />
could toggle to manipulate this space. How does one
<br />
know the difference between visualization and physical
<br />
seeing? There are some that can visualize things so
<br />
powerfully they are more real than what we would call
<br />
*real*. So what kind of tag or label do we have to
<br />
tell which space we're in?
<br />
<br />All of these things I mention illustrate or point to
<br />
what I would call buried-senses. They seem to be
<br />
abstract senses we can form as we wish. We can create
<br />
new one as we can create new burried features of
<br />
thinking.
<br />
<br />All of these and many more I don't even know how to go
<br />
about describing would form a composite that would
<br />
grant us situational-awareness. This situational 
<br />
awareness is how one tells when one is in dream space.
<br />
<br />At some point you'd have to ask yourself, what's more
<br />
real?, that which I see through physical eyes, or
<br />
things I create and put my own rules and senses on.
<br />
<br />We have a common ground for which we interact. We see
<br />
other people and things and can model their behavior
<br />
well enough that we can be confident that these rules
<br />
will hold as long as we choose to participate. We have
<br />
a sense of what is *us* and what is not. Is this
<br />
learned? Or is it built in?
<br />
<br />The question of animals morphing to other things is
<br />
only meaningfull statistically. We've grown up in a
<br />
world where things like that don't happen. Not many
<br />
people claim to have seen such things, so we accept
<br />
that as a-typical behavior. It does'nt fit our model
<br />
of *reality*. I submit that if people relied on this
<br />
kind of defintion of reality that they set themselves
<br />
up for a kind of weirding-out, lost feeling when life
<br />
then throws us a curve. If one day rabbits do develop
<br />
the ability to morph, I think most science types could
<br />
be found wandering around in a stupor and babbling
<br />
meaningless phrases.
<br />
<br />To get an idea of this, one might recall a movie or
<br />
experience like culture-shock that caused a person to
<br />
feel out of place and lost. For me this is easily
<br />
accomplished with a really strange movie. I saw a
<br />
program on WWII where an interviewed paratrooper
<br />
mentioned mentioned that after puting on all his gear,
<br />
and while waiting to board the aircraft amidst all the
<br />
noisy aircraft in preperation for the D-Day invation,
<br />
he felt a kind of disconnected, surreal feeling.
<br />
<br />I've felt this as well when some time ago on board a
<br />
small aircraft wearing a headset and voice activated
<br />
mike. It seems just the loss of something familiar
<br />
like aural echos and hearing one's own natural voice
<br />
can be enough to leave one in a dreamlike state.
<br />
<br />I think just the loss of the ability to model enough
<br />
of one's sensory input would cause this loss of
<br />
connection to reality.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; To summarize:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; White rabbits are inconsistent by definition. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; issue is &quot;inconsistent with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; respect which frame of reference?&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; If we dream of a real world white rabbit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (inconsistency as seen from the real
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; world point of view) then it may be perfectly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consistent in the dream world. If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; it is consistent in the dream world, no problem.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No paradox in the dream world.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; No paradox in the real world..
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; If we dream of a dream world white rabbit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (inconsistency as seen from the dream
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; world point of view), then we realize the dream
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world is a fake and we wake up.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; No more dream world. No more paradox.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; We can resolve the white rabbit paradox if we take
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relativity seriously.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; George
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let's say you are dreaming of a nice little pussy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cat. Suddenly the pussy cat morphs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (white rabbit?) into a hungry lion who goes straight
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for you with bared fangs and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; drooling saliva.with anticipation of a good meal.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The first consistency test is whether you believe in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the morphin process or you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you do believe that the cat morphed into a lion,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then your world is consistent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and you are having a bad nightmare.The lion will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tear you to pieces and you'll die
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in your dream. At that point you meet the second
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consistency test.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Either you believe you are dead and then you must
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stop dreaming and therefore stop
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; believing you are dead... This is impossible. Your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dream world therefore becomes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inconsistent and comes to an end. You either switch
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to a deep theta sleep state or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you wake up... unless you go to a dream heaven...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but then you are not really
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dead....and the whole pussycat/lion nightmare could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arise again... Death in a dream
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; leads to infinite heavenly regression or to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inconsistency.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now if you don't believe that the cat morphed into a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lion, you realize that your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world is a dream world. You then have two choices.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Either wake up (end of the dream
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world) or continue to enjoy your dream with the full
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; knowledge that it is only a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dream not the reality (end of real dream) and that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no matter what the lion does to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you, it's only a dream and nothing bad could really
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happens. So you let the lion eat
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you. In fact you are really enjoying the process.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Finding yourself in the stomach of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the lion.... becoming the lion.... what fun!!! A
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dream that you know is a dream is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; called a lucid dream. Lucid dream are fun! You can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; jump from a huge cliff and not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; get hurt, stand in front of a speeding locomotive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and see it go right through you.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In a lucid dream, you are immortal.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not let's take a step back and look at science in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interpreting our world. The role
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of science is to expose inconsistencies and reveal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the old perception of the world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world for the dream it is....Our set of beliefs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; affects how we perceive the world.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Way back before Copernicus, we were living in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dream world where the earth was at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the center of the universe etc... But there were
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inconsistencies... Copernicus,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Galileo, Newton, Einstein etc.. resolved the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inconsistencies. They showed us that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the old set of beliefs were just dreams, not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality.  Our horizon has been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; expanding. We have been waking up, and waking up
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; again, and again. We are now faced
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with the ultimate expansion of our horizons: the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; plenitude. Quantum immortality is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like lucid dream immortality. Yes, our world is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dream. But what a magnificient
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dream! Let's be like the lucid dreamer and enjoy it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the fullest!
</em><br />
