<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK, but the point is that the basic definition of &quot;bad&quot; is arbitrary.


</em><br />
Perhaps, but honestly I am not sure. In acomp, we can define a (very 
<br />
platonist) notion of &quot;bad&quot;. The simpler and stronger one is just the 
<br />
falsity &quot;f&quot;. Then Bf, BBf, BBBf, BBBBf, BBBBBf, etc. gives a sequence 
<br />
of less and less badness, which translated in the Z (material) 
<br />
hypostases gives the Df, DDf, DDDf, DDDDf, DDDDDf ... which are better 
<br />
candidates for that notion of badness.
<br />
(recall that G does not prove Bf -&gt; f, and that G* proves DBf (the 
<br />
astonishing godelian consistency of being inconsistent).
<br />
(note also that G* *does* prove Bf -&gt; f).


<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It might seem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that there would be some consensus, for example that torturing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; innocent people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is an example of &quot;bad&quot;, but it is possible to assert without fear of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logical or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; empirical contradiction that torturing innocent people is good.

</em><br />
I disagree. Mainly for the reason alluded above. Please note I 
<br />
understand that there is no purely logical contradiction (f) in 
<br />
asserting that &quot;torture&quot; is good, but the purely logical operates at 
<br />
the third person level, in which there is no &quot;pain&quot; at all. Once you 
<br />
take incompleteness into account this should be much less evident, and 
<br />
much more fuzzy. There is nothing illogical with an altimeter (in a 
<br />
plane) giving a wrong information (like the plane is at altitude = 
<br />
1000, instead of the correct 500), but you can understand this can lead 
<br />
to a catastrophe. Any BB...Bf can be seen as a promise for a 
<br />
catastrophe.


<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There are people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the world who do in fact think there is nothing wrong with torture 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and although
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they are not very nice peopel, they are not as a result of having such 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a belief deluded.


</em><br />
Honestly I doubt it. Of course some people can believe that torture can 
<br />
be good for their own life, in case torture can prevent the enemy to 
<br />
drop some bomb. Of course some people are cynical and can, like Sade, 
<br />
defend torture with the (wrong imo) idea that nature &quot;defends&quot; the 
<br />
right of those who have the powers and thus that they have the right to 
<br />
follow their sexual perverse compulsion, but this could mean that they 
<br />
are inconsistent (they have some BBB...Bf as implicit belief). Then 
<br />
from the divine (starred G*) pov, they are (globally) inconsistent 
<br />
(although cannot know it).




<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Recall that even the (although very familiar) notion of natural 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; numbers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; or integers cannot be defined unambiguously in science. Science asks 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; us
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; only to be clear on primitive principles so that we can share some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; reasoning on those undefinable entities.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But there is a big difference between Pythagoras saying 17 is prime 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and Pythagoras
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; saying that eating beans is bad. You can't say that &quot;prime&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are equivalent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in that they both need to be axiomatically defined.


</em><br />
Hmmm... &quot;prime&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; cannot be equivalent in that sense. But 
<br />
&quot;being a natural number&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; can. The nuance is that I grant the 
<br />
notion of natural number before defining &quot;prime&quot;. But my belief in 
<br />
natural numbers (my belief in the standard model of Peano Arithmetic, 
<br />
Arithmetical truth) is as hard, even impossible, to define than is the 
<br />
notion of truth, good, etc.
<br />
Defining &quot;Prime&quot; is easy: (~(x = 1) &amp; Ay(y divides x) -&gt; (y = 1 v y = 
<br />
x)) where (a divides b) is a macro for Ez(az = b).
<br />
Defining &quot;number&quot; is just not possible actually. Even with a richer 
<br />
theory or second order logic you will have to rely implicitly on the 
<br />
standard model of the higher theory, which is less palatable than the 
<br />
&quot;standard model&quot; of PA.



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The problem is that some people think &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; are on a par 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; descriptive terms that every sentient species, regardless of their 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; psychology,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could agree on. They are not.


</em><br />
Not in any normative sense. But once we bet on a theory (like comp), 
<br />
then we get mathematical tools which can provide general explanation of 
<br />
what is bad, and also explain why such definition cannot be normative, 
<br />
making the bad/good distinctions an ideal goal for complex sufficiently 
<br />
self-sustaining machines societies.




<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Every sentient species would agree that a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nuclear bomb going off in your face will kill you,


</em><br />
Bad example for this list!  (CF quantum immortality or comp 
<br />
immortality!). But ok, this is besides the point.



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but some would say this was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; good and others would say it was bad.

</em><br />
Yes, but unless people are insane, most will give or try to give a 
<br />
ratio. In such case it is a question of utility with respect of some 
<br />
notion of good and bad. It is not related with the hardness to define 
<br />
completely what is good and what is bad. Like killing. Killing can be 
<br />
considered as bad but can be accepted in self-defense.



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think a message spelt out across the sky by stars simultaneously 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; going
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nova would probably do it for me.

</em><br />
I would bet I'm dreaming instead ... :)


<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would at least believe that these were
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; beings with godlike powers responsible, but would reserve judgement on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whether they had also created the universe. Can't shake of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; skepticism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; completely...

</em><br />
Well, I would define &quot;God&quot; by what is responsible for the existence of 
<br />
anything. If physicalism is correct then God *is* the physical 
<br />
universe. But physicalism is not compatible with classical (platonist) 
<br />
comp so God has to be something else. I have some problem with Caylor's 
<br />
idea that God is &quot;good&quot;, despite the use of &quot;good&quot; for the second god 
<br />
by the neoplatonist. The problem is just that discoveries by themselves 
<br />
change the meaning of the words ... making sometimes hard to 
<br />
communicate those discoveries. Sometimes ago just saying that 3d space 
<br />
could be curved was enough to be considered ready for the asylum ....
