Hi Mark,

<br />
(To the other: I will read and comment the remaining posts after next 
<br />
wednesday; I am very busy).

<br />
Le 08-janv.-07, à 18:31, Mark Peaty a écrit :

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	1 	Thank you for responding. Of course I have no right to expect a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; response from anybody, but I was starting to just wonder if I HAD been 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a bit rude! :-) And of course now it serves me right if I can't 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand some of what you have written ...


</em><br />
To be sure I have not find your post particularly rude, compare to some 
<br />
others sometimes. No problem with rudeness as far as there is a 
<br />
conversation along with the insults :)


<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	2 	'Assuming the digital mechanist thesis, ...  least there could be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an ultimate *partial* sort of meta-answer.'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Hmmmmm, and is there a plain English version accessible to anyone 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with far less than a degree in mathematics?


</em><br />
I have explained a lot on the list, but my links have changed. I don't 
<br />
insist because I am willing to explain all details again. Few people 
<br />
realize how quick it is possible to grasp the main math in theoretical 
<br />
computer science. In few steps you can access to very amazing truth 
<br />
about machines. It is the contrary in mathematical logic where the 
<br />
beginning are harder.



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [ En Francaise tres simple, c'est aussi possible pour mois avec 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; l'assistance des services Google de traduction. Mais il faut que mes 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; responses fut en Anglaise par ce que detruir la lange Francaise a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cause de mois fut tellment triste a tois et n'aurais pas d'utilite. ]


</em><br />
So you can perhaps peruse in my french theses ....  One half of my work 
<br />
does not need anything very technical except some passive understanding 
<br />
of Church thesis, and well, some imagination for the thought 
<br />
experiments. Some people in the list seems to arrive to similar 
<br />
conclusion, although I take full responsibility for the complete 
<br />
reversal physics/theology-biology-psychology-comp.science-number 
<br />
theory.




<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	3 	Me here, you there. You are an other to me.


</em><br />
Here and now, OK. I would not take this as an absolute statement.



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And I assume, in light of the 'Tit for Tat' strategy and its intrinsic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simplicity and empirically tested/modelled effectiveness, that acting 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ethically towards you and [other] others is the approach most likely 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to facilitate the creation of value accessible to us both.


</em><br />
Nice.




<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In plain English I like to put that now as: My vocation is that I help 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; others. My preferred method is to Enquire, Inform, Empower and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Entertain.


</em><br />
To be honest I always fear a bit those who want to help me or others,
<br />
but thanks anyway for the good intentions (which pave the way to hell 
<br />
... :)



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	4 	We will all die. There is no good evidence to support any other 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assertion about how we ultimately end up.


</em><br />
I think you are confusing the first and third person point of view, 
<br />
like *many* since Aristotle made us believe in a physical primitive 
<br />
reality.
<br />
This reifies a good animal's instinctive local strategy, but that's all.
<br />
Honestly an expression like &quot;we will all (1-personaly) die&quot; is an open 
<br />
problem. We have not yet solved the mind/body problem, so we cannot 
<br />
conclude. Then I can explain you with all details why the proposition 
<br />
&quot;we will all 1-die&quot; is provably &quot;put in doubt&quot; once we assume either 
<br />
just comp or even just quantum mechanics. With QM this is not wishful 
<br />
thinking but &quot;terrorful&quot; thinking: a priori the QM immortality is not 
<br />
fun: each time we die clinically (in a relative third person way), from 
<br />
our personal point of view we survive in the closer normal comp. 
<br />
history. A case can been made that this entails a sort of eternal 
<br />
agony. Of course this can be nuanced too. With comp some weird gap 
<br />
seems to exist ...
<br />
Have you an opinion on QM interpretation?




<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	5 	' ... say also that there was nothing before birth. In that case I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (the first person &quot;I&quot;) would have emerge from nothing. ...'  Yep! In 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; plain English, rough and ready terms that's it! But actually we can of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; course quibble about what is 'nothing', because 'nothing' isn't 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anything. So a more sophisticated assertion is that each of us is an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emergent property of, well, the universe. I can be romantic and say: 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this experience of being here now is what it is like to be the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe looking at itself from a particular point of view. It works 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or me, probably because I now know how to not take myself too 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seriously.  [Sh*t a brick! One look in the mirror makes that one clear 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; -] But I have been disappointed at the number of people who have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quibbled at the idea.


</em><br />
You seem to take a &quot;basic physical universe&quot; for granted. I don't take 
<br />
&quot;a physical universe&quot; as an explanation. Worst, I do believe this 
<br />
assumption is contrary to both logic+arithmetic (and comp) and with the 
<br />
empirical data. I'm ready to argue.



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	6 	That 'I' might 'come back again' ... DOESN'T RING TRUE! To put it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; succinctly, all these ideas of human awareness being related to some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non-physical entity and possibly being able to endure beyond the death 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the body are all from the pre-scientific universe: the time before 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this.


</em><br />
Actually I do believe that science has begun when we have stop to 
<br />
confuse &quot;provable or observable&quot; with &quot;true&quot;.
<br />
And science has ended when we did come back to the idea that reality = 
<br />
what we measure (+/- Aristotle). (I exaggerate just a bit).
<br />
I know that believing in non-physical entities does not look serious. 
<br />
But beyond aristotelian brainswashing it is the contrary which is 
<br />
probably correct. I meet and live non-physical things 24h on 24h 
<br />
(consciousness, pain, games, numbers, programs, etc.), and since my 
<br />
birth I have not yet seen a basic physical entity, although I did many 
<br />
research of that. And then, with comp, it happens that physical 
<br />
entities are empty of any explanation power. Indeed I can show you that 
<br />
comp is epistemologically incompatible with the physical supervenience 
<br />
thesis. I am not pretending this is obvious, and I can understand it 
<br />
looks weird for those who have never doubt about the primacy of 
<br />
physics.





<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is nothing amongst all of the new knowledge discovered about the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world through the application of scientific method that lends support 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to any of these soul or disembodiable spirit based ideas concerning 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our awareness.


</em><br />
I disagree there are a lot.
<br />
Of course a soul is never disembodied, given that the body is a mental 
<br />
construct to begin with, as I can argue (it is not obvious, sure).



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The only reason these kinds of ideas still have some kind of general 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; currency is ignorance concerning the mind blowing efficacy of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scientific method and the fruits of its application. 


</em><br />
I appreciate and (try to follow) the scientific method. But the 
<br />
&quot;existence of physical entity&quot; does only belong to science as far as we 
<br />
are open to doubt it, i.e. as far as we can accept this *can* be 
<br />
refuted.




<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ......................... I will now dismount from that soap box, but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not before reminding readers that the effect that scientific method 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has had on the human species is of the same order of importance as the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; acquisition of versatile grammar. Before true grammar people had the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ability to refer to things not present but only in the very simplest 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of terms, and to use a limited vocabulary and simple two-item 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; juxtapositions to associate a subject with a simple predicate with no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recursions. That state of affairs may have lasted several hundred 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thousand years. The advent of versatile grammar allowed the creation 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of complex predicates with multiple recursions ie phrases, clauses and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sub-clauses. This allowed the telling of stories and thus discussion, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in principle at least, of absolutely anything.


</em><br />
I can agree with this.



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	7 	Ask the question: Why would anybody want to reconstitute and let 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; loose a person from the distant past?


</em><br />
Could you elaborate a bit. Take your time I will be super-busy until 
<br />
the middle of next week.



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	8 	It does not seem particularly coherent to say: 'There is no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe' because this is equivalent to saying that nothing exists


</em><br />
I do believe in a &quot;universe&quot;. I do even believe in something very 
<br />
similar to a physical multiverse. I just don't believe such a thing is 
<br />
composed of primitive matter. Actually I begin to have evidence that 
<br />
the comp-physics allows sort or &quot;elementary particles&quot;, but they emerge 
<br />
from &quot;numbers dream&quot; (to be short). Physical reality emerges from 
<br />
something deeper. I have a thoroughly testable theory, which, albeit 
<br />
still in infancy compared to QM, already can explain the nature of both 
<br />
quanta and qualia (unlike QM).



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	9 	People who are completely paralysed depend on others whose muscles 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ARE in working order and properly connected to their brains/CNS. Maybe 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this dependency may be mitigated in the future by the creation of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implants and prosthetic attachments which allow the direct reading of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain states to control other prosthetic machinery.


</em><br />
My point was theoretical. You admit that someone can be paralysed, and 
<br />
according to the existence of some technology, can be able or not to 
<br />
manifest his consciousness relatively to the environment. But this is 
<br />
just a point among others. We will have to come back on this in details 
<br />
if you are really interested in the consequence of the comp thesis.



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	10 	'...except when you are witnessing what I would call a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reductionist view of numbers and machine...' I am not clear about what 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you mean here.


</em><br />
OK, this is a technical point, and it is related to the incompleteness 
<br />
phenomenon in computer science, and mathematical logic. The part 
<br />
concerning computer science is readily accessible (even without degree 
<br />
in math). The part concerning mathematical logic is harder (alas).



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I see numbers as human constructs;

</em><br />
I expected this from what you are saying. It is possible that comp is 
<br />
wrong, and for the benefit of the discussion I can discussed like if I 
<br />
was believing that my reasoning could be wrong. The fact is that I have 
<br />
rational grounds to believe the contrary: with comp, humans are numbers 
<br />
constructs. In a nutshell, reality is a video game emerging locally 
<br />
from the &quot;ever existing&quot; arithmetical truth.



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical objects embodied in the logico-mathematical language 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; system.


</em><br />
but note that there is a local (first person) sense in which you are 
<br />
correct. This is why I am glad that when we interview an introspective 
<br />
machine she is already able to describe many different points of view 
<br />
explaining those &quot;metaphysical conflicts&quot; between global and less 
<br />
global (more local) view.




<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  As I see it, mathematical objects derive their existence and power 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from the way they are defined. Because of their clarity and fixed 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meanings numbers and other math. objects have allowed people to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; express summarised and succinct descriptions of processes in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world, where the world has manifested groupings and recursively 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generated properties amenable to algorithmic analysis. This almost 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certainly indicates that the universe is made of parts or processes 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which are constituted at their smallest levels by existents  which are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; many, small, and relatively simple.


</em><br />
I doubt this. To be sure I am stuck on mathematical difficulties and 
<br />
the existence of &quot;atomic&quot; physical stuff is still an open problem in 
<br />
the comp theory.



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However the fact that so many apparently completely arbitrary numbers 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [such as ratios and constants] are needed to describe the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relationships between physical things indicates I think that the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ground base of physical reality may not be constituted by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relationships equivalent to integers. Perhaps it is that the true 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constituents of nature are more akin to bundles of connections with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fractal dimensionality because they are not in anyway static.


</em><br />
Here we could be eventually rather close. I can explain why the &quot;static 
<br />
arithmetical reality&quot; appears to be dynamic when viewed from inside. 
<br />
Even without comp we can be amazed by the relationships between &quot;pure 
<br />
number theory&quot; and physical theories. I will give reference later.



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Our concept and perception of apparent enduring structures and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; identity of things in the world being entirely emergent properties.


</em><br />
... including worlds ....



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	11 	'I could even argue (as I do from times to times) that modern 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (post-godelian) mechanism is a sort of very powerful vaccine against a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; vast class of reductionist view of both human and machine' -------  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What does that mean?   :-[


</em><br />
It means that the truth about numbers and/or machines cannot be unified 
<br />
in any complete theory. Both machines and humans can overcome any 
<br />
normative theory which would concern them.
<br />
It means that as far as we are consistent machine we have to be modest 
<br />
about what we can prove and disprove about numbers and machine.
<br />
This is related to the discovery of the universal machine (Babbage, 
<br />
Post, Turing, Markov, ...) and to Godel's completeness and 
<br />
incompleteness theorems, and their use and misuse in computer science.
<br />
Ok, it is a bit technical (but more easy than QM though). I can explain 
<br />
more if you are interested. I am finishing a paper on that, but perhaps 
<br />
I should suggest some books before ... The book on &quot;Godel's use and 
<br />
misuse&quot; by Torkel Franzen is rather good (I will send a &quot;review&quot; once I 
<br />
got the time).

<br />
Best Regards,

<br />
Bruno
