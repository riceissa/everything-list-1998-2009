<br />
I posted this today on the Fabric of Reality Yahoo Group, but would like 
<br />
to get responses to it over here as well.
<br />
<br /><br />First, regarding the idea of magical universes or quantum immortality
<br />
for that matter, doesn't this assume a truly infinite number of
<br />
universes?  However, if you start with the idea that the reality we
<br />
experience is being created by a mechanical/computational process,
<br />
isn't it more likely that the number of universes is just extremely
<br />
large?    Why should we assume the &quot;creator&quot; (however you choose to
<br />
define that) has access to infinite resources?   Also, everything that
<br />
makes up our universe appears to have finite characteristics (per QM),
<br />
so it seems like every possibility within the parameters of the
<br />
multiverse could be covered by an enormous, but not infinite range of
<br />
possibility.
<br />
<br />My understanding of QM is that it describes possibilities (even if
<br />
vanishingly small) of bizarre things occurring in our everyday world.
<br />
For instance, I once read a book in which the author calculated the
<br />
possibility(incredibly small obviously) that our planet would suddenly
<br />
appear in orbit, fully intact, around another star.  He argued that QM
<br />
allows for this possibility.
<br />
<br />I think we are overlooking something here.  It seems like there should
<br />
be a quanta of probabilty, just as there is (apparently) with time,
<br />
space, and matter.  In other words, once the probability of something
<br />
happening falls below a certain threshold, it is not realized.  Could
<br />
there be a Planck scale of probability?  Does decoherence somehow keep
<br />
these strange events from occurring on a macro scale?
<br />
<br />Also, it seems to me that the violation of other physical laws comes
<br />
into play in preventing many scenarios from taking place.  For
<br />
instance, with quantum immortality, I understand the concept that if
<br />
there are infinite copies of me, there will always be one more
<br />
universe in which I survive another second.  But the reality is that
<br />
there would seem to be a rate of diminishing return here.  The
<br />
probability curve would have a point where it approaches zero, even as
<br />
the number of alternatives approached infinity. 
<br />
<br />Another way to resolve the immortality issue is to presume
<br />
consciousness survives death, but I will not remark on that further.    
<br />
<br />One thing that I think hurts the MWI as a theory is the misconception
<br />
among many that everytime a choice is made, the entire universe splits
<br />
in two, and there is a proliferation of all of these virtually
<br />
identical copies of universes out there somewhere.  In reality there
<br />
is only one universe, and there is a proliferation of differences
<br />
being created.  The only thing that matters are the recorded
<br />
differences, everything else remains unchanged. If you view our
<br />
reality as a virtual reality it is much easier to understand this
<br />
concept.  For instance a program that predicts the weather doesn't
<br />
have to create an entirely new simulation for each outcome it
<br />
predicts- it can overlap the various possibilities in one simulation.
