<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Let me propose a conjecture and let us see how far we can go with it:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;Morality is the creation, protection and preservation of information.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Immorality is the destruction of information.&quot;
</em><br />
<br />I agree very much. Even threat of destruction is immoral. I think
<br />
pain is linked with anticipation of the destruction of information.
<br />
Hidding information can be immoral too in some situation.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;In classical religious terms this fits pretty well with the Ten
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Commandments. Lying, killing, bearing false witness destroys
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;information. Adultery messes up social order (information). Honoring
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;parents, protect and preserves their wisdom and  honors them as creator
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(of information). Meta Commandments include observing the Sabbath which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;honors creation itself and the first three Commandments which honor the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Creator (of world information). 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;As an aside, let me say that in the modern context the destruction of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the environment is immoral because it results in a decrease in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;biodeversity (world information). Conversely, work that generates
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;information is very moral. I like to think that engineers are very moral
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;individuals (I am one :-)) because they create new thing that do not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;exist in nature.  But if you really think about it, any work that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;generates a desirable service or product of benefit to society is in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;fact adding information to the world and is therefore moral.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In response to Spudboy, we could define murder as killing that results
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in the destruction of information. Killing that results in the creation,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;preservation or protection of information is not murder. For example, A
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;lion killing an antelope does so to survive. This action preserves
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;biodiversity, allows the lions to continue as a specie and shapes the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;evolution of lions and antelopes (faster running, better senses of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;hearing, sights etc...) In short this action is necessary for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;creation (evolution) of the fauna.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The Taliban destruction of the statues of Buddah, on the other hand was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;evil because its aim was to reduce cultural diversity in Afghanistan.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree. Making women mute is also a way to destroy or hide information.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The Taliban operate within a very inflexible system. Bruno would call it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;G. Our system on the other hand is much more flexible and adaptable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Because our way of life allows a continuous adaptation we cannot be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;described as a G. -- WE ARE THE TRUE REVOLUTIONARIES! Clearly we present
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a threat to the terrorists: OUR WAY OF LIFE SHOWS THAT THEIR G IS
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;INCONSISTENT! In an evil attempt to restore their consistency, they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;attempt to eliminate our way of life. They won't succeed. We shall
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;adapt. The world will end up better with more information.
</em><br />
<br />In term of G/G* the two enemies of the UTM I described were those
<br />
machines which communicates they are consistent ([]&lt;&gt;t), the
<br />
machines which communicates they are inconsistent ([][]t). 
<br />
And then there are the traditional communicator of the false ([]t).
<br />
Among those are the &quot;mad machine&quot;, &quot;the wrong machine&quot; the &quot;dreaming
<br />
machine&quot;, and the lier. Your expression &quot;their G&quot; is ambiguous.
<br />
Of course any machine or entity feeling free to ask and talk is a
<br />
threat for totalitarian power.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now, how does this conjecture fits with the MWI?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The Plenitude contains zero information. No matter what you do, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;total amount of information will not change. For example, performing a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;good action, merely means that you allow your consciousness NAVIGATES
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the plenitude to a world where you have performed a good action. Other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;branching to counterfactual &quot;bad action worlds&quot; also exist but YOU have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not NAVIGATED there. Other you's  (Yoush) have navigated there. As you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;can see, making decision in the plenitude can be reduced to the concept
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of NAVIGATION. You choose a branch, but yoush choose all branches.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Thus the ABSOLUTE information of the world does not change NO MATTER
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;WHAT YOU DO!
</em><br />
<br /><br />I am not sure. Locally: I think that making a good action 
<br />
augment the probability you and your relative will live in
<br />
a branch benefiting the action. From an absolute 3-pov you are right,
<br />
but we are not really living at that level.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;It seems therefore that just like everything else in our world (all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physical entities) the only type of morality that matters is morality as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;seen by the first person. We now enter the realm of first person and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;third person perception and relativity.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Ah! OK then.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;To go any further I must now define the concept of objective world in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;relative terms. Objective worlds are worlds which share frames of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reference &quot;close enough&quot; to the first person world as to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;indistinguishable from it. 
</em><br />
<br /><br />This is an interesting idea which could help us for defining
<br />
the first person plural. I interpret your &quot;worlds&quot; as histories though.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;First and third person perceptions are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;identical when the third persons live in such objective worlds. First
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and third person perceptions differ (as in Quantum Suicide QS or FIN)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;when the frames of reference are too far apart.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I am not sure there could be third person perception. May be I miss
<br />
something. Perhaps you mean the first person plural which indeed
<br />
is localy third person and is linked to continua of very similar
<br />
histories (which interfere from the 1-plural point of view). OK then.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I would like to make a distinction between absolute morality and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;objective morality. As I explained above absolute morality does not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;exist - absolute information remains at zero no matter what. Objective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;morality on the other hand does because objective worlds do exist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Objective information can change.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK if you still interpret &quot;objective worlds&quot; as shared continua of
<br />
near computational histories (with comp, sorry).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Thus insofar as there are objective worlds, there is objective morality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Destroying a specie or a person to reduce diversity in the world is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;objectively immoral. 
</em><br />
<br /><br />Transforming information is immoral too, for then it can loose
<br />
referential correctness (relatively to the most probable computational
<br />
histories) and this reduces into a sort of lie.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;QS or FIN however does not fall within the scope of objective morality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;because, in this case, the first and third person worlds are very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;significantly different. The only type of morality that applies is first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;person morality. It appears that the action of QTI or FIN actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;creates first person information! Since I believe that measure does not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;change with QS it appears that QS or FIN is actually moral! This is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;disturbing but IMO an inescapable conclusion!!!
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes. And that explain why there is nothing wrong with suicide, a priori,
<br />
at least once your relative agrees and you are prudent not wounding or
<br />
killing others in the process.
<br />
<br />Now as I said, comp is not normative and admit quite incompatible
<br />
philosophical extensions, some bearing on moral questions. 
<br />
The main difference is between those who accept teleportation with
<br />
delayed *annihilation*, and those who doesn't.
<br />
What do you think of the people of the planet Ixbul? They fear
<br />
the non success of the reconstitution so that they made themselves
<br />
annihilated only after a conversation with their own doppelganger.
<br />
Is that a form of suicide? 
<br />
Some on Ixbul accepts to do the following: to duplicate themselves
<br />
and then killing randomly, with a coin, one of them. They repeat
<br />
the trial 64 times. They do not impose the 
<br />
tribulation to any other, and that test is available for adult only.
<br />
Is that immoral? (I suppose they have found a way of killing themselves
<br />
absolutely, which does not necessarily exists with comp!).
<br />
