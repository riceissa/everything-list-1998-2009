<em class="quotelev1">&gt;surprised by your following comment, because it seems to me that I

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;solved the WR problem in first person only. (Not that I started out

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;trying to do this). Maybe I'm solving a different WR problem :)
</em><br />
<br />Well, your &quot;error&quot; (with comp, IMO), is that you still attach the
<br />
first person to a third person body/universe. This is why you
<br />
think that the universal prior are enough to solve the WR (white 
<br />
rabbit problem). 
<br />
By comp we survive multiplication of oneself, and our experience
<br />
doesn't depend of the time we are reconstituted. That is why,
<br />
concerning our first person experiences, we must quantify the domain of
<br />
indeterminacy (due to the &quot;natural&quot; multiplication given by universal 
<br />
dovetailing) on the set of all relatively consistent extension or 
<br />
computational continuation of oneself.
<br />
There is 2^aleph_0 such computational continuations.
<br />
In that case universal prior are not enough, and, as I was saying to
<br />
Wei Dai, the littleness of the &quot;originel explanation&quot; is not enough.
<br />
Two other phenomena must occur and be explained: the depth of the
<br />
computation and the explosion of the number of relative parallel 
<br />
universe (computation). Note that MWI + decoherence theory&quot; solve 
<br />
that problem, because decoherence is essentially a 
<br />
(super)entanglement of the object with environment including the 
<br />
(third person) observer, and that explain the big numbers of very similar 
<br />
worlds we can expect to be. 
<br />
But with comp the fact that [MWI + decoherence
<br />
theory&quot; solve that problem] does not solve the (WR) problem unless
<br />
we explicitely derived QM from the set of relatively 
<br />
consistent computational extensions of oneself. 
<br />
It seems Schmidhuber does not realise that QM is a confirmation of comp.
<br />
He seems to be glad having a computational interpretation/view of MWI.
<br />
He does not realise that comp by itself implies the communicable 
<br />
observable
<br />
indeterminacy and the relativeness of states.
<br />
Now comp implies a priori a much more big indeterminacy, especially if 
<br />
you include the &quot;pure&quot; observable-but-not-communicable indeterminacy, 
<br />
so...
<br />
... we must explain the absence of third person white rabbit + the
<br />
absence of first person white rabbit.
<br />
Universal prior make the disappearance of the first person view of the
<br />
third person rabbits, and it explain why white rabbits does neither appear
<br />
in our sharable collection of experiences nor in our scholar manuals.
<br />
But universal prior still doesn't explain why I, personally, should not
<br />
expect departing slowly and continuously from these laws and observing
<br />
personal and first-person-only white rabbits.
<br />
Note that with a strong NON-comp axiom you can &quot;solve&quot; that problem
<br />
easily by attaching (ad-hoc-ly) the first person to the 
<br />
&quot;material and univoquial &quot; third person. (But what would that mean ?).
<br />
<br /><br />Russell Standish wrote also to Alastair:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I'm glad you [Alastair] understand, because it is a subtle point. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Tegmark is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;embedded in Schmidhuber, 
</em><br />
<br />If by the whole mathematics, you mean A whole set of consistent 
<br />
mathematical theories producible by (consistent) machines, I can agree.
<br />
(The problem is that there are a lot of such sets, including 
<br />
orthogonal one which are mutually exclusive).
<br />
So this embedding is difficult to make precise.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;but Schmidhuber is but one element of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Tegmark. 
</em><br />
<br />Yes, sure. And whith Church Thesis this embedding can be made precise
<br />
independently of the mathematical fuzziness of &quot;Tegmark's Whole Math&quot;.
<br />
I.e the embedding is formalism independant.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;This naturally implies an infinite recursion of Tegmark's ensemble
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;containing an element which generates whole ensemble over again, just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;as Schmidhuber's ensemble contains the &quot;Great programmer&quot; generating
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the whole ensemble again.
</em><br />
<br />Yes. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;There doesn't appear to be any problems with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this remarkable fact though.
</em><br />
<br />I hope so. Nevertheless, that remains to be seen.
