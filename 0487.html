Wei Dai, &lt;weidai.domain.name.hidden&gt;, writes, regarding whether we should
<br />
identify with exact copies of ourselves:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think the following thought experiment shows the latter is more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appropriate. Suppose you are one of two people in a prisoner's dilemma
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; type game, where if you push button A both players will get 4 dollars, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if you push button B you will get 5 dollars and the other player will get
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nothing. The twist is that both players are given temporary amnesia and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are put into identical rooms so you don't know what your identity is.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you identify with both players, then you should press A. However I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think most people under the circumstances will press B.
</em><br />
<br />This is similar to the question of &quot;super-rationality&quot; discussed by
<br />
Douglas Hofstadter in his Scientific American column in the 1980s.
<br />
He set up a similar thought experiment and he found that most people he
<br />
asked would in fact push B.
<br />
<br />However in his case he simply had everyone be in roughly the same
<br />
situation, that is, they had their individual personalities intact
<br />
but they were presented identical scenarios, and they knew that each
<br />
person was presented an identical scenario.
<br />
<br />Wei sharpens the situation so that the players have temporary amnesia
<br />
and don't remember who they are.  This would make it more plausible that
<br />
each would do the same thing.  But still they might have different
<br />
personalities, tendencies, reasoning abilities, etc.
<br />
<br />Wouldn't the situation most relevant to the question of identity be one
<br />
where the two people in the room are both copies of you?  Where you can
<br />
know that each would do exactly the same thing?
<br />
<br />If you knew that each would do the same thing, I think you would push A.
<br />
As I recall, if Hofstadter set up different scenarios to try to get
<br />
people to push A.  The other fellow is your identical twin, etc.  When he
<br />
finally got to where the &quot;other player&quot; was just the player in a mirror,
<br />
then finally people would push A.  With two instances of the same person,
<br />
I think it would be as certain as myself in the mirror.
