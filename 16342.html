Thanks, m.a.
<br />
<br />At least Cantor has been lucky to have respectful adversaries like  
<br />
Kronecker. I am still criticized in my back on work I have never done  
<br />
by people I have never met. The years 1977 and 2008 have been the  
<br />
worst, and I ask myself if I should make some move.
<br />
<br />Also,  there has been three people who told me they have abandoned  
<br />
their PhD thesis, or change their subject when they have been asked  
<br />
for not referring to my work, or just my name. My work will be given  
<br />
its due, perhaps without my name: it is not so important. Or is it?
<br />
My work in the seventies were just theoretical computer science, and  
<br />
were just slightly visionary, but even then, and especially at that  
<br />
time, the problems were not related to some work of mine: it is really  
<br />
the contrary. It is because I am ignored, for stupid bad and  
<br />
contingent facts which I have been unluckily witnessing,  that I have  
<br />
pushed a little bit more the obvious revolutionary aspect of the comp  
<br />
hyp. It is because I am ignored about simple mathematical facts (that  
<br />
any patient scientist can verify, and actually have verified), that I  
<br />
have decided to single out the theologiical aspect, I have tried  
<br />
diplomacy during 20 years without success, so that the strategy,  
<br />
changed by itself. Time is running, not for me but for everyone,  
<br />
locally and nowadays.There is no economical crisis, you know, only a  
<br />
deep ethical crisis. Soon or later this will be clear, if not already.
<br />
<br />It is not a coincidence:  I am fighting for the listening of the first  
<br />
person internal to a theory, against person who practice the  
<br />
elimination of person, in the scientific inquiry. But they just  
<br />
confuse a genuine simplifying methodology, with a scientific statement  
<br />
(generally more neutral) And this is just not working, obviously in  
<br />
the human sciences.
<br />
<br />On another level; It is easy to hate &quot;my work&quot;, or to make people  
<br />
hating such work, because it is above all a remind that &quot;science&quot; has  
<br />
not yet solved the &quot;mind-body problem&quot;. The opportunity of the  
<br />
computationalist hypothesis comes from the fact that it gives a  
<br />
mathematical formulation of the problem, or of many subproblems.
<br />
I am just asking a question, like, - look with comp I am duplicable  
<br />
there is something weird, no?. Because this *seemed* to be unclear, I  
<br />
have made it clearest through paradoxes, and then argument. and  
<br />
eventually the math and the computer science. It is a question like,  
<br />
do you see where matter comes from when machines, betting they are  
<br />
machine, asks themselves?
<br />
<br />Don't worry for me, I am dead since a long time. This gives me  
<br />
infinite power and patience.
<br />
In the worst case I could come back next millenium:)
<br />
In the very long run I am optimist, if the humans does not take the  
<br />
opportunity, the spiders will. In any case we will see. With comp, as  
<br />
far as we are divine; we are hypotheses ourselves. We are divine  
<br />
hypothesis.
<br />
<br />And then, what makes me rather optimistic right now, for the future of  
<br />
comp, is the discovery of Salvia Divinorum. It looks like she can  
<br />
teach  &quot;my work&quot; in less than four minutes!  We can't stop the  
<br />
progress, isn't? Take this with some degree but I got many  
<br />
confirmations through reports by others. I will say more later asap,  
<br />
in response to Johnathan. Not that those people does suddenly discover  
<br />
that reality is different, but that reality *can* be different.
<br />
<br />We are living an incredible and wonderful period, m.a., we are living  
<br />
the discoveries (and development) of the Universal Machine, the other  
<br />
Universal Machine,  and then that plant.  That plant helps, like  
<br />
remembering your dream can help. Philosophizing on video-game based  
<br />
movies and novels can help too. Simulacron III and Matrix can help.
<br />
<br />The only thing which I have to explain for those who already get  
<br />
clearly UDA1-6, that is the main difficulty of UDA7-8, is the  
<br />
understanding of the difference between a computation, and a  
<br />
description of a computation, it is really the difference between a  
<br />
number and a relation between the numbers.
<br />
<br />Thanks for your kind attention, and best wishes,
<br />
<br />Bruno
<br />
<br />PS I participate to a little colloquium now, and I will find time to  
<br />
comment other posts probably only monday. Have a good week-end.
