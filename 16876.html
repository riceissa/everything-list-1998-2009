<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The only OM's you can experience are those in which your

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; present OM is in the subjective past.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So you are saying that - given my 'current' OM - sampling is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; restricted to the set of OM's you define above?  Why?  This seems to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; presuppose some pre-determined temporal ordering of experience
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; regardless of the measure of OM's over my total life-histories.  That
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is, a 'flow of time' broadly equivalent to our 'common sense' view (in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; its MWI guise).
</em><br />
<br />The illusion of a flow of time is created by the fact that
<br />
subjectively later OM's remember subjectively earlier OM's. Today is
<br />
Tuesday, and I remember yesterday, which was Monday, and look forward
<br />
to tomorrow, which will be Wednesday. It could be that in real time,
<br />
Wednesday occurred yesterday and Monday will occur tomorrow, but this
<br />
can make no subjective difference to me experiencing the illusion of
<br />
continuity from one day to the next. Even if a trillion copies of the
<br />
Monday me are run tomorrow, that cannot possibly cause me to wake up
<br />
in my subjective future and find, to my great surprise, that it is
<br />
Monday rather than Wednesday. Or to put it differently, I *will* wake
<br />
up tomorrow (per real time) and find that it is Monday, but that
<br />
version of me will have no memory of Tuesday, whereas the Wednesday
<br />
version of me that was actually run yesterday will have this memory.
<br />
<br />The subjective temporal ordering of experience has nothing to do with
<br />
the actual temporal ordering of OM's and will also occur in the
<br />
absence of any actual temporal ordering, i.e. in a block universe.
<br />
Only OM's with a particular content are candidates for inclusion in my
<br />
subjective future. Of those candidates, which one I will experience
<br />
depends on their relative measure.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Does this mean that you disagree with the notion that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we can draw conclusions (a la Bostrom) about measure from the OM we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happen to be experiencing?  IOW, the fact that I am &quot;a human OM of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particular age in the 21st century on Earth&quot; is of no particular
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; significance in determining whether this represents some point of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; maximal conscious measure in my life-histories?
</em><br />
<br />The self-sampling assumption is useful if I am trying to guess what
<br />
group I am in. If I don't know whether it is Monday or Tuesday but I
<br />
know that there are a trillionfold as many copies of the Monday me,
<br />
then I should bet on it being Monday. But if I already know that it's
<br />
Tuesday, then the probability that it is Monday is zero and the
<br />
probability that I will experience Monday in the future is also zero.
<br />
You might say that it very unlikely that it would be Tuesday if there
<br />
are a trillionfold as many Monday copies, but we come up against this
<br />
all the time in everyday life. It is far more likely that a person
<br />
will be born in China than in Lichtenstein, but given that he was born
<br />
in Lichtenstein, he stays born in Lichtenstein.
