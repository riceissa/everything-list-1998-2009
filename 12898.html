This has been a long discussion between Jason and Mark. How do I get into it
<br />
is
<br />
by Mark's remark:
<br />
&quot;I don't think I go anywhere as far as John M. in this but then maybe that
<br />
is just because I fear to let go of my sceptical reductionist walking stick.
<br />
&quot;
<br />
--Stop half-way: when the guy received $10,000  in the bank in 100s and
<br />
counted
<br />
them ....37,38,39, - then stopped and said: well. so far it was a match, let
<br />
me believe that the rest is also OK.
<br />
We are much earlier into the completion of what we know about our existence.
<br />
<br />Then again you both wrote about simulations (even: emulations) horribile
<br />
dictu:
<br />
&quot;The key point is that a wilful entity or conspiracy seeks to emulate all or
<br />
part of another wilful entity's world to the extent that the latter can't
<br />
tell the difference when the change is made.&quot;
<br />
Untold: &quot;restricted to details known&quot;  Nobody can simulate or look for
<br />
unknown details. Of course &quot;the latter&quot; can't tell whether 'simulated' if
<br />
looking only at the  portion that matches.  (I am not clear about &quot;wilful
<br />
entity&quot;.)
<br />
The fallacy of the simulational business is more than that: you (get?)
<br />
simulate(d?) HERE and NOW and continue HERE under these conditions, while
<br />
THERE the simulacron lives under THOSE conditions and in no time flat
<br />
becomes different from you original. That the world of THERE is also
<br />
simulated? Just add: and lives exactly the life of THIS one? then the whole
<br />
thing is a hoax, a mirror image, no alternate.
<br />
*
<br />
Jason: &quot; A reversible computation is one that has a 1 to 1 mapping between
<br />
input
<br />
and output. &quot; Going up in the $100 bills to #45, the map may change. Don't
<br />
tell me please such &quot;Brunoistic&quot; examples like 1+1 = 2, go out into the
<br />
'life' of a universe (or of ourselves).
<br />
How can you reverse the infinite variations of a life-computation? You have
<br />
got to restrict it into a limited model and work on that. Like: reductionist
<br />
physics (QM?) .
<br />
It seems to me like a return to Carnot, disregarding Prigogine, who improved
<br />
the case to some (moderate) extent from the classical reversible even
<br />
isotherm thermodynmx,
<br />
from which I used to form the joke (as junior in college) that it shows how
<br />
processes would [theoretically] proceed, wouldn't they proceed as they do
<br />
proceed.
<br />
We can reverse a closed model content, all clearly known in it.  Not life.
<br />
Just count into the simulations and reversals the constantly (nonlinearly!)
<br />
changing world not allowing any 'fixing' of circumstances/processes. No
<br />
static daydreams.
<br />
*
<br />
Jason: &quot;Quantum mechanics makes the universe seem random and uncomputable to
<br />
<br />those inside it, but according to the many-worlds interpretation the
<br />
universe evolves deterministically. &quot; - right on. I just wonder why all
<br />
those many worlds are 'emulated' after this one feeble universe we pretend
<br />
to observe. In my 'narrative' I allowed 'universes' of unrestricted variety
<br />
of course 'nobody' can ever continue in a totally different 'universe' a
<br />
life from here. With e.g. a different logic.
<br />
*
<br />
&quot;Are you saying that a perfectly efficient computer could not be built or
<br />
that the physics of this universe are not computable? &quot;
<br />
You mean: with unrestricted, filled memory banks working on the limitless
<br />
variations nature CAN provide? A perfectly efficient computer could then
<br />
compute this universe as well. Maybe not these binary embryos we are proudly
<br />
using today. Indeed: you ask about the physics of this universe, is it the
<br />
reductionist science we are fed with in college? That may be computed.
<br />
Discounting the randomness and indeterminism shown for members of this
<br />
quantum universe of ours.
<br />
<br />Sorry for the length and my unorthodoxy.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; elastic collision of particles, the decay of a nucleus, burning of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hydrogen, it would be impossible for you to tell if that recording were

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interaction to occur as it does in either direction of time.&quot;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  MP: This is only true for 'individual' reactions on the micro scale, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even then the 'truth' about the reversibility can only really be maintained
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by hiding the truth about the context. For example, it is logically possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for certain atomic nuclei to collide at just the right velocities and fusion
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will occur. In reality however the probability of what are normally fission
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; products coming together to make a uranium nucleus is so close to zero you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are never going to see it. [I don't know much about the physics but my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; casual believe is that heavy elements are created through various long and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; complex 'ratchet' accretion pathways in which nuclear isotopes of H or He
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; enter heavier nuclei.] Like wise the burning of hydrogen; it seems simple
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; enough and yes it is 'reversible', but does the reverse occur? Not where you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and I can see it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Jason: &quot;Quantum mechanics makes the universe seem random and uncomputable

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; level where the universe is being simulated (assuming many-worlds). &quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MP: I don't think I can accept this. Maybe I sound arrogant in saying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this, but I think the idea of simulation is used a bit too loosely. I know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there are those lurking on the Mind &amp; Brain list and JCS-online who would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; say I am 'the pot calling the kettle black', because I am always asserting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what I call UMSITW [pronounced um-see-two for English speakers] - updating
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the model of self in the world - is the basis of consciousness. But they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; misunderstand me, because I do not say there is anyone else doing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simulation, merely that we experience being here because the universe has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evolved self sustaining regions within itself which maintain their structure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by means of dynamically modelling themselves and their local region so as to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; avoid fatal dangers while obtaining everything they need from their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; environments. My point here is simply that the universe is its own best
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simulation and that any ideas of something greater, such as a Matrix type
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; operation, are science fiction only. Why? Because for a feasible universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like the one we seem to inhabit to be deterministic does not require that it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is predictable nor that it can be repeatable. Nobody knows to what extent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quantum level events are intrinsically random as opposed to being _pushed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from 'behind' or 'below'_ so to speak.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is one thing. Another thing is that no entity or set of entities
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could know if their 'simulation' attempt was doing what they wanted in every
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; detail because to attempt to find this out would interfere irreversibly with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the unfolding of the world. This latter objection can be sidelined by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; accepting that there are no entities with any such intention therefore it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; irrelevant. For those who would be 'believers' in Sky God, as well sceptics,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this puts divine intervention pretty much off limits.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK, that leaves the concept of pseudo-emulation: another hidden 'level' of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure embodied in calculation. I guess this can be represented by either
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1/ the movie '13th Floor' - which I think much better than 'Matrix' 1, 2,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and 3 in terms of its encapsulation of interesting philosophical questions -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2/ Bruno's 'Yes Doctor' hypothesis.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; These might seem to be very different but I don't think so. The key point
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is that a wilful entity or conspiracy seeks to emulate all or part of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; another wilful entity's world to the extent that the latter can't tell the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; difference when the change is made. Doubtless Bruno has a far more exacting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definition and sets of caveats, but I insist on plain-English. As far as I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can see, the assertion that this MUST be possible in principle because 'we'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can imagine a mathematical implementation, just begs the question. I do not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think there is anything shameful in 'reifying' physics, because if we exist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and know that we do it has to be because we BELIEVE in ourselves and our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world. Believing in something IS reifying it. When we understand that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; basic mechanism underlying this process is the activation of a model of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whatever it is, the whole question of mind and consciousness is demystified.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This does not remove the wonder, or the challenges, of living in the amazing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe. It should mean that we spend less money on snake oil though!

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computations done on that computer are logically reversible.'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MP: Surely 'logically reversible' does not necessarily imply no entropy,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just that for the purposes of the concerned observer, the computing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; system can return to a state that is sufficiently close to the original
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; state so that the inputs can be discovered. More or less by definition,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entropy increases and manifests as deterioration of the substrate and as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the need to supply more energy to travel through the system than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; otherwise is calculated to be necessary to obtain the minimum changes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; needed to embody the changes of state in the calculating system.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Right, logically reversible computations on their own do not imply no

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; increase in entropy by the computing system, but for a computing system
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to operate with no net increase in entropy, the computations it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; performs must be logically reversible.  This is because: &quot;For a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computational operation in which 1 bit of logical information is lost,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the amount of entropy generated is at least k ln 2, and so the energy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that must eventually be emitted to the environment is E   kT ln 2.&quot; (

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversible_computing#More_on_Landauer.27s_principle">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversible_computing#More_on_Landauer.27s_principle</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; )  Note that the computing substrates needed to implement such an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; efficient computer are well beyond our current level of technology and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are only theoretical.  However there is as of yet, no known reason why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an arbitrarily efficient computer could not be built.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A reversible computation is one that has a 1 to 1 mapping between input
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and output.  For example if if I compute x=x+3, every input has a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unique output, given the function and the result it is possible to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; determine the input.  However the same could not be said of a function
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; defined as x=x modulo 3, or x=0, where there are a finite number of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; outputs.  These computations are not reversible because it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inpossible to get the input given function and the output.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Jason: 'The physical interactions that occur in this universe are also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reversible.  e.g. An electron can accept a photon and move to a higher

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; energy state or an electron can emit a photon and move to a lower
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; energy state.  Does reversible physics imply that a computational model

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of said physics would involve entirely reversible computations? '
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MP: This concept of 'reversible' is very useful, but to how great an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; extent is it just a convenient fiction? My understanding is that you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can't fire *a particular* photon at a particular atom and guarantee that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your favourite electron will rise to the predicted level. I mean it

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; either will or it won't.
</em><br />

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Conversely as I understand it [AIUI] the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subsidence of an electron to a lower orbital is only predictable in a

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; statistical sense. Once again is it not that the real world entities

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; must be dealt with in a statistical manner, either as bulk substances,

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; symbols denoting the real world physics and there is no guarantee that

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any such computing system could overcome the limits imposed by entropy

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm not sure what you are saying here.  Are you saying that a perfectly

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; efficient computer could not be built or that the physics of this

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe are not computable?
