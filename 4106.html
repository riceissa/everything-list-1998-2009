<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shows

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Formal Systems&quot; as the foundation for all mathematical structures.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And the discussion in his paper is entirely in terms of formal systems

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and their properties.  He does not seem to consider the implications if

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any of Godel's theorem.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I still think it is an interesting question whether this is the only

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible perspective, or whether one could meaningfully think of an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ensemble theory built on mathematical structures considered in a more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intuitionist and Platonic model, where they have existence that is more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fundamental than what we capture in our axioms.  Even if this is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what Tegmark had in mind, it is an alternative ensemble theory that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; worth considering.
</em><br />
<br />I think this is exactly so, that Reality nearly certainly has more that 
<br />
what we have captured (or perhaps can _ever_ capture)  in our axioms.
<br />
<br />Godel's results can be recast in algorithmic information theory terms, 
<br />
as Greg Chaitin has done, and has Rudy Rucker has admirably explained 
<br />
in &quot;Mind Tools.&quot;
<br />
<br />For example, a few excerpts (out of a full chapter, so my excerpts 
<br />
cannot do it justice):
<br />
<br />&quot;It turns out that there's a real sense in which our logic cannot reach 
<br />
out to anything more complicated than what it starts with. Logic can't 
<br />
tell us anything interesting about objects that are much more complex 
<br />
than the axioms we start with.&quot; [p. 286]
<br />
<br />&quot;Now we may reasonably suppose that the world around us really does 
<br />
contain phenomena that code up bit strings of complexity greater than 
<br />
three billion [Tim note: Rucker had earlier estimated that the 
<br />
complexity of all of modern math and science is reasonably explained 
<br />
and axiomatized in a thousand or so books, or about 3 billion bits, 
<br />
give or take]. Chaitin's theorem tells us that that our scientific 
<br />
theories have very little to say about these phenomena. On the one 
<br />
hand, our science cannot find a manageably short &quot;explanation&quot; for a 
<br />
three-billion-bit complex phenomenon. On the other hand, our science 
<br />
cannot definitively prove that such a phenomenon _doesn't_ appear to 
<br />
have a short, magical explanation.&quot; [p. 289]
<br />
<br />Discussion:
<br />
<br />It seems plausible that we ourselves will eventually have a knowledge 
<br />
base of more than 3 billion bits, perhaps hundreds of billions of bits 
<br />
(I expect diminishing returns, in terms of basic theories, hence an 
<br />
asymptotic approach to some number...just my hunch). Some 
<br />
&quot;Jupiter-sized brain&quot; may have a much richer understanding of the 
<br />
cosmos and may be able to understand and prove theorems about much more 
<br />
complicated aspects of reality.
<br />
<br />It seems likely that the current limits on our ability to axiomatize 
<br />
mathematics are not actual limits on the actual universe!
<br />
<br />(Unless one adopts a weird &quot;Distress&quot;-like model that future 
<br />
hyperintelligent beings will bring more and more of the mathematical 
<br />
structure of the universe into existence merely through their increased 
<br />
ability to axiomatize.)
<br />
<br />Personally, for what's it's worth, I vacillate/oscillate between a 
<br />
Platonist point of view that Reality and the Multiverse/Universe/Cosmos 
<br />
actually has some existence in the sense that there appears to be an 
<br />
objective reality which we explore and discover things about and a 
<br />
Constructivist/Intuitionist point of view that only things we can 
<br />
actually construct with atoms and programs have meaningful existence. 
<br />
(I believe in the continuum in the axiomatic sense, in the sense of the 
<br />
reals as Dedekind cuts, in the ideas of Cauchy sequences, limits, and 
<br />
open sets, but I don't necessarily always believe that in any 
<br />
existential sense there &quot;are&quot; infinities. The real universe does not 
<br />
appear to have an infinite number of anything, except via abstraction.)
<br />
<br />The two views--Platonism vs. Constructivism--are not necessarily 
<br />
irreconcilable, though. Paul Taylor's book, &quot;The Foundations of 
<br />
Mathematics,&quot; discussed the reconciliation.
<br />
<br />Lastly, the Schmidhuber approach, as I understand it, is closer to the 
<br />
Chaitin/Rucker point above than the Tegmark approach is. By considering 
<br />
all outputs of UTMs as string complexity increases, one is including 
<br />
ever-richer axiom systems. (Chaitin talks about Omega, which Rucker 
<br />
also discusses.)
<br />
<br />I don't want to &quot;diss&quot; Tegmark, but as I said when I first started 
<br />
posting to this list, Tegmark seems to have a fairly simple view of 
<br />
mathematics. His famous chart showing the branches of mathematics and 
<br />
then his hypothesis that perhaps the multiverse has variants of all of 
<br />
of the axioms of these branches, isn't terribly useful except as a 
<br />
stimulating idea (hence this list, of course). Naturally Tegmark is not 
<br />
claiming his idea is _the_ theory, so stimulation is presumably one of 
<br />
his goals. In this he has succeeded.
