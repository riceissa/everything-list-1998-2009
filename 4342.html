<br />Whoops, I've heard of the P=NP problem but I guess I was confused about what 
<br />
it meant. But there are some problems where candidate solutions can be 
<br />
checked much faster than new solutions can be generated, no? If you want to 
<br />
know whether a number can be factorized it's easy to check candidate 
<br />
factors, for example, although if the answer is that it cannot be factorized 
<br />
because the number is prime I guess there'd be no fast way to check if that 
<br />
answer is correct.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Since Moravec's machine uses time travel, or at least information transfer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;into the past, it is obviously extremely speculative.  But given that,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I think your idea does make sense in theory, that if there were an

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;infinite amount of computing power possible in the future, and we sent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a signal into the past if a given program ever halted, then the absence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of such a signal would imply that the program did not halt.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Of course any kind of practical engineering that involves infinities
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is even more speculative than time travel.  You have to assume that a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;signal can be sent an infinite distance through time, that the future
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;calculation goes on forever and never ends, and so on.  It seems difficult
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to imagine such a degree of consistency and reliability in the imperfect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;universe where we live.
</em><br />
<br />But whatever the degree of risk that the machine will malfunction over any 
<br />
set amount of time, it seems to me that one could always make that risk 
<br />
smaller and smaller over time by building more and more backup machines, so 
<br />
that in the limit the accumulated probability of a malfunction could still 
<br />
be kept small. I haven't thought this through too carefully though.
<br />
<br />Anyway, however far-fetched the proposal is, if it could work even in 
<br />
principle it would be relevant to the question of whether quantum gravity 
<br />
allows uncomputable functions to be realized. General relativity does have 
<br />
solutions in which backwards time travel is possible, although I don't know 
<br />
how likely it is that this will remain true in a theory of quantum gravity 
<br />
(is it known if this is true in string theory?) But if it did, and if the 
<br />
theory also did not in principle forbid computing power to increase without 
<br />
limit (perhaps it would forbid it--for example, I'm not sure if Tipler's 
<br />
proposal would work if spacetime were quantized), then this would suggest 
<br />
the laws of physics are uncomputable, even if such a scheme is never 
<br />
actually realized in our universe.
<br />
<br />This is also somewhat relevant to &quot;theories of everything&quot; since we might 
<br />
want to ask if somewhere in the set of &quot;all possible universes&quot; there exists 
<br />
one where time travel is possible and computing power increases without 
<br />
bound. If the answer is yes, that might suggest that any TOE based on &quot;all 
<br />
possible computations&quot; is too small to accomodate a really general notion of 
<br />
all possible universes. But it might be possible to arrange things so that 
<br />
one would experience living in such a universe from a first-person POV while 
<br />
your TOE is still based on some notion of all possible computations (as with 
<br />
the universal dovetailer)--one could start out computing different histories 
<br />
in which different possible &quot;messages from the future&quot; are recieved, and 
<br />
then continually spit out copies of the histories where no inconsistency has 
<br />
yet appeared while not doing the same for histories where an inconsistency 
<br />
does crop up, so that in the limit as time goes to infinity the first-person 
<br />
probability of finding oneself in an inconsistent history becomes 
<br />
vanishingly small compared to the probability of finding oneself in a 
<br />
consistent one.
