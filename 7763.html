<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the calculation ? Is it a physical process ? Obviously a calculation need

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time... what is the difference between an abstract calculation (ie: one which 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is done on a sheet of paper or just in your head) with an &quot;effective&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; calculation ? What is the meaning of &quot;instantiating&quot; in a block universe 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; view ?
</em><br />
<br />I am generally of the school that considers that calculations can be
<br />
treated as abstract or formal objects, that they can exist without a
<br />
physical computer existing to run them.
<br />
<br />The goal is to model the universe (among other things) as such a
<br />
calculation.  If we demand that a calculation exists in a universe, and
<br />
a universe is also a calculation, then we have an infinite regression.
<br />
One might postulate a God who is infinite himself and is the endpoint
<br />
of the regression, but absent such supernatural entities, the model
<br />
otherwise doesn't work.
<br />
<br />Why model the universe as a calculation?  Well, for one reason, because it
<br />
seems to work.  It appears that physical law is essentially mathematical,
<br />
implying that it should be feasible in principle to construct a program
<br />
which could simulate the entire universe to any degree of accuracy.
<br />
It would seem odd, given that the universe can be a calculation, if it
<br />
weren't a calculation.
<br />
<br />If it seems objectionable to have a calculation without a calculator,
<br />
perhaps simpler examples can support the intuition.  You can imagine a
<br />
triangle without a triangulator.  You can imagine a number without someone
<br />
who counts.  Perhaps you can even imagine a mathematical proof without
<br />
a prover.  Mathematical objects may have virtually unlimited complexity
<br />
and internal structure, and can be said to exist independently of anyone
<br />
who thinks about them or discovers them.  Computations seem to fit very
<br />
comfortably into this framework.
<br />
<br />If we allow ourselves to imagine calculations as having mathematical
<br />
reality, and further to imagine that our universe is such a calculation,
<br />
then we have unified mathematical and physical reality.  There is no
<br />
longer a difference.  Things which are physically real are merely a
<br />
subset of the things which are mathematically real.
<br />
<br />If we don't take this step, we have two kinds of reality, mathematical
<br />
and physical, which makes for a more awkward (IMO) philosophical position.
<br />
<br />However I certainly understand that all these arguments are only
<br />
persuasive and indicative and certainly do not amount to a proof.
<br />
Nevertheless it is my hope that by pursuing these ideas we can construct
<br />
testable propositions which, if verified, will add weight to the
<br />
possibility that this is the nature of reality.
