<em class="quotelev1">&gt;regard relationships between observer moments with equal ontological

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;status.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;With my TIME postulate, I say that a conscious observer necessarily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;experiences a sequence of related observer moments (or even a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;continuum of them). To argue that observer moments are independent of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;each other is to argue the negation of TIME. With TIME, the measure of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;each observer moment is relative to the predecessor state, or the RSSA
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is the appropriate principle to use. With not-TIME, each observer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;moment has an absolute measure, the ASSA.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;On this postulate (which admittedly still fails rigourous statement,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and is not as intuitive as one would like axioms to be), hinges the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;whole QTI debate, and many other things besides. With TIME, one has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the RSSA and the possibility of QTI. With not-TIME, one has the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ASSA,and Jacques Mallah's doomsday argument against QTI is valid. See
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the great &quot;RSSA vs ASSA debate&quot; on  the everything list a few years ago.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now I claim that TIME is implied by computationalism. Time is needed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;for machines to pass from one state to another, ie to actually compute
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;something. Bruno apparently disagrees, but I haven't heard his
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;disagreement yet.
</em><br />
<br />I don't see how you could get anywhere if you disregard the relationship 
<br />
between observer moments. It is this relationship which allows grouping of 
<br />
different observer moments to give the effect of a continuous stream of 
<br />
consciousness. The human brain is a machine which produces just such a 
<br />
sequence of observer moments, which bear a temporal relationship with each 
<br />
other consistent with your TIME postulate. But I would still say that these 
<br />
related observer moments are independent of each other in that they are not 
<br />
necessarily physically or causally connected. I base this on real life 
<br />
experience (the fact that I feel I am the same person as I was 10 years ago 
<br />
even though I am now made up of different atoms, in an only approximately 
<br />
similar configuration, giving rise to only approximately similar memories 
<br />
and other mental properties), and on thought experiments where continuity of 
<br />
identity persists despite disruption of the physical and causal link between 
<br />
the earlier and the later set of observer moments (teleportation etc.).
<br />
<br />Another question: what are the implications for the TIME postulate raised by 
<br />
certain mental illnesses, such as cerebral lesions leading to total loss of 
<br />
short term memory, so that each observer moment does indeed seem to be 
<br />
unrelated to the previous ones from the patient's point of view? Or, in 
<br />
psychotic illnesses the patient can display what is known as &quot;formal thought 
<br />
disorder&quot;, which in the most extreme cases can present as total 
<br />
fragmentation of all cognitive processes, so that the patient speaks 
<br />
gibberish (&quot;word salad&quot; is actually the technical term), cannot reason at 
<br />
all, appears unable to learn from the past or anticipate the future, and 
<br />
reacts to internal stimuli which seem to vary randomly from moment to 
<br />
moment. In both these cases, the normal subjective sense of time is severely 
<br />
disrupted, but the patient is still fully conscious, and often bewildered 
<br />
and distressed.
