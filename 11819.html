<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I don't know the names of the fallacies.  My brother has a law degree,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; but my mathematical mind can at least recognize a fallacy when I smell
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; one.  So here's an analogy.  The laws of physics etc. that we deduce
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; from empirical data give us models with which we can predict the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; behavior of &quot;nature&quot; (being defined by that which we can predict).  It
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is like we deduce that all of nature is like rolling hills of grass.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Perhaps we aren't able to predict the grass down at the blade-by-blade
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; level, but we've come up with probabilitistic models that predict the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; statistics of the blades (a la quantum mechanics).  Now we can imagine,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and we've been told stories, that there is such a thing as a forest,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; made up of trees.  Based on our grass behavior models, we conclude that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; such a thing is impossible, and therefore does not exist.  Why, a pine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; tree going up instantaneously 100 feet just defies all of our grass
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; behavior models, producing impossible singularities.  But then someone
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; comes along and says, let's have an open mind and admit that it's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; possible that our grass models don't fit the entire reality, and it's a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; mistake to forever be decided otherwise.  Perhaps every once in a while
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; there really is a forest, even though we can't predict where these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; forests are.  Perhaps people in the past have actually seen these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; forests and passed on the word that they exist.  Then your torturing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; magical Daddy argument would be like saying, &quot;But surely there can't be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; forests, because it would be a mistake to assume the existence of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; torturing magical Daddy unicorn tree.&quot;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The problem with religious beliefs is not that they are bizarre (after all, many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scientific theories at first glance are just as bizarre) but that there is no reasonable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; basis for deciding whether they are true. People usually choose religious beliefs because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they would like them to be true or because their parents brought them up that way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It may be interesting to know if a religious belief makes a person happy, has inpired
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; good deeds or great art, and so on, but the specific question I want answered is whether
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it is true. For example, it is true that the smallpox virus causes a severe illness which has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; killed million of people over the centuries, and this is true regardless of whether it is good,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bad, interesting or whatever. I would like to know whether it is the case that Jesus rose from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; his tomb after being crucified or Athena sprang from Zeus' head after Hephaestus struck it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with an axe, and I would like to know this independently of whether it makes an interesting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or inspiring story.

<br />I assume that your &quot;problem with religious beliefs&quot; also has to do with
<br />
the religion's claim that the object/subject of belief is an important
<br />
key to something, for instance the solution of the problem of evil.  If
<br />
the bizarreness is not an issue, then simply the belief that some
<br />
contingent event happened thousands of years ago is not preposterous.
<br />
I would agree with you that whether something is true is of sole
<br />
importance to whether it is worthy of being believed.  The task at hand
<br />
then would be to use our finite resources to come to a decision about
<br />
whether or not we will believe an event occurred.  I agree with your
<br />
implied thought that it seems that if something key to our
<br />
understanding of the &quot;universe&quot; is tied to a contingent event in
<br />
history, then it would seem only fair that sufficient evidence of this
<br />
event should be accessible to us.  I have found that there is.  Again,
<br />
the specifics of this topic (Christianity) are probably too contingent
<br />
to get into on this List.  However, in this thread, I am talking about
<br />
the fact that such a configuration (a key to understanding our
<br />
&quot;universe&quot; and living in it is tied to contingent events in history)
<br />
cannot be ruled out by any &quot;proof&quot; at the Everything level.
<br />
Furthermore, I claim that the Everything level cannot solve all of the
<br />
problems.
