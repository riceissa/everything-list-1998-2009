Here is an interesting post by Jesse. Curiously I have not been able to find it
<br />
in the archive, but luckily I find it in my computer memory.
<br />
<br />Is that normal? I will try again later.
<br />
<br />Jesse's TOE pet is very similar to the type of TOE compatible with the comp
<br />
hyp, I guess everyone can see that.
<br />
<br />Jesse,  imo, that post deserves to be developed. The way you manage to save
<br />
partially the ASSA (Absolute Self-Sampling Assumption) is not very clear to me.

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; In your definition of the ASSA, why do you define it in terms of your next

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; observer moment?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;The ASSA and the RSSA were historically defined as competing views.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I am not 100% sure that I have the ASSA right, in that it doesn't seem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;too different from the SSSA.  (BTW I have kept the definitions at the end
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;of this email.)  (BTW, BTW means By The Way.)  But I am pretty sure about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;the RSSA being in terms of the &quot;next&quot; moment, so I defined the ASSA the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;same way, to better illustrate its complementary relationship to the RSSA.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;The real difference between these views was not addressed in my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;glossary, which is that the RSSA is supposed to justify the QTI, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;quantum theory of immortality, while the ASSA is supposed to refute it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;That is, if you only experience universes where your identity continues,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;as the RSSA implies, then it would seem that you will never die.  But if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;your life-moments are ruled by statistics based on physical law as the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;ASSA says, then the chance that you will ever experience being extremely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;old is infinitesimal.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Personally I think the ASSA as I have it is somewhat incoherent, speaking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;of a &quot;next&quot; observer moment in a framework where there really isn't any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;such notion.  But as I said it has been considered as the alternative
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;to the RSSA.  I invite suggestions for improved wording.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I think that proponents of the type of ASSA you&#x2019;re talking about would say 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that the experience of consciousness passing through multiple 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observer-moments is simply an illusion, and that I am nothing more than my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;current observer-moment. Therefore they would not believe in quantum 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;immortality, and they also would not define the ASSA in terms of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;next&quot; observer-moment, only the current observer-moment. I think you&#x2019;d be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;hard-pressed to find any supporters of the ASSA who would define it in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;way you have.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But as I say below, I think it is possible to have a different 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interpretation of the ASSA in which consciousness-over-time is not an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;illusion, and in which it can be compatible with the RSSA, not opposed to it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; Wouldn't it be possible to have a version of the SSA where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; you consider your *current* observer moment to be randomly sampled 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; set of all observer-moments, but you use something like the RSSA to guess
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; what your next observer moment is likely to be like?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;That seems contradictory.  You have one distribution for the current
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;observer-moment (sampled from all of them), and another distribution for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;the next observer-moment (sampled from those that are continuous with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;the same identity).  But the current observer-moment is also a &quot;next&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;observer-moment (relative to the previous observer-moment).  So you can't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;use the ASSA for current OM's and the RSSA for next OM's, because every
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;next is a current, and vice versa.  (By OM I mean observer-moment.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Well, any theory involving splitting/merging consciousness is naturally 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;going to privilege the current observer-moment, because it&#x2019;s the only 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;thing you can be really sure of a la &quot;I think therefore I am&quot;&#x2026;when talking 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;about the past or the future, there will be multiple pasts and multiple 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;futures compatible with your present OM, so you can only talk about a sort 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of probabilistic spread.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;That said, although some might argue there&#x2019;s a sort of philosophical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;contradiction there, I think it is possible to conceive of a mathematical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;theory of consciousness which incorporates both the ASSA and the RSSA 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;without leading to any formal/mathematical contradictions. There could 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;even be a sort of &quot;complementarity&quot; between the two aspects of the theory, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;so that OM&#x2019;s with the highest absolute probability-of-being would also be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the ones that have the most other high-absolute-probability OM&#x2019;s that see 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;them as a likely &quot;successor&quot; in terms of relative probability-of-becoming. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In fact, an elegant solution for determining a given OM&#x2019;s absolute 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probability-of-being might be to simply do a sum over the probability of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;becoming that OM relative to all the other OM&#x2019;s in the multiverse, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;weighted by their own probability-of-being.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Here&#x2019;s a simple model for how this could work. Say you have some large set 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of all the OM&#x2019;s in the multiverse, possibly finite if there is some upper 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;limit on the complexity of an OM&#x2019;s, but probably infinite. You have some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;theory of consciousness that quantifies the &quot;similarity&quot; S between any two 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;given OM&#x2019;s, which deals with how well they fit as the same mind at 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;different moments, how many of the same memories they share in common, how 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;similar are their causal patterns, and so on. You also have some absolute 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;measure on all the OM&#x2019;s, a &quot;probability-of-being&quot; B assigned to each 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;one&#x2014;this is basically just my idea that the self-sampling assumption could 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be weighted somehow, so that the ideal way to use the ASSA is to assume 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that your current OM is randomly sampled from the set of all possible 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observer-moments, weighted by their own probability-of-being B.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Then, to determine the relative probability-of-becoming various possible 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;OM&#x2019;s, I could just multiply their similarity S to my own current OM by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;their absolute measure B representing each one&#x2019;s probability-of-being. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This would insure that even though a version of me observing a dragon 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;popping out of my computer screen may be have just as much similarity S to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;my current mental state, in terms of memories and the like, as a version 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of me who&#x2019;s watching the computer screen behaving normally, if one OM is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;objectively less probable (lower B) due to the laws of nature, I will have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a higher relative probability of becoming the OM who sees 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;business-as-usual. This would also insure that if I step into a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;teleportation machine and the machine reconstructs two people, one whose 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;brain is close to identical to mine and one who has a very different 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;personality and memories, then even if the OM&#x2019;s of both these people have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;about the same absolute probability-of-being B, I am far more likely to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;become the one who&#x2019;s more similar to me because his similarity S to my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;current OM would be much higher.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;And as I suggested earlier, it would be neat if the probability-of-being B 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;could itself be derived by something like a sum over the S&#x2019;s between me 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and all the other other OM&#x2019;s, each one weighted by their own B-rating. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This idea could be summed up by the slogan &quot;the most probable present 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;experiences are the ones that are high-probability successors to other 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;experiences that are themselves highly probable present experiences&quot;. In 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this way it might even be possible to bootstrap a unique B-rating for all 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;OM&#x2019;s, starting with only a knowledge of the similarity ratings between 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;them. Consider the following simple universe with only three observers X, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Y, and Z, and a known matrix of similarity ratings S between each pair:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    X       Y        Z
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;X1.00    0.60    0.35
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Y 0.60   1.00    0.25
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Z 0.35    0.25   1.00
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In this case, if the B-ratings for each one were determined by a sum over 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the S-ratings for the others weighted by their own B-ratings, and you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;represent X&#x2019;s B-rating by the variable x, Y&#x2019;s B-rating by the variable y, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;etc., then you&#x2019;d have some simultaneous equations that&#x2019;d actually allow 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you to find a unique self-consistent solution for x, y, and z:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;x = (0.60)y + (0.35)z
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;y = (0.60)x + (0.25)z
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;z = (0.35)x + (0.25)y
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I haven&#x2019;t actually planned these numbers out, so the solution probably 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;leads to some variables being negative or greater than one, which doesn&#x2019;t 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;really make sense if the B&#x2019;s are supposed to be probabilities, but the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;basic idea here is that you can bootstrap the B&#x2019;s just by knowing the S&#x2019;s.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now keep in mind, this is all a very cartoonish sketch, I don&#x2019;t really 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;think whatever theory of consciousness is used to determine relative 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probabilities would be as simple as multiplying a &quot;similarity rating&quot; by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;an absolute probability; among other things, &quot;similarity&quot; fails to capture 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the crucial issue of the directionality of subjective time, my current OM 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;might be just as similar to an OM 2 seconds ago as it is to one 2 second 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;from now, but I expect a higher probability I&#x2019;ll become the one 2 seconds 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in the future. Also, I suggested earlier that the complexity of an OM&#x2019;s 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consciousness might play a part in both the absolute probability (so my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;present experience is more likely to be that of a human than an insect) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and relative probability (so I am more likely to experience becoming a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;copy with an intact brain than one with brain damage), but the model I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;presented doesn&#x2019;t take that into account. Still, it&#x2019;s sort of a pet theory 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of mine that the real TOE will turn out to be analogous to this model in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the following ways:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;1. It will include a theory of consciousness that can take my present OM 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;along with various possible future OM&#x2019;s, and determine the relative 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probability of my experiencing each one in my future based on a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;combination of features that are inherent to each OM (analogous to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&#x2018;similarity&#x2019; rating in my model) and an external measure which assigns 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;each one an absolute probability. The relative probability on different 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;future observer-moments would be used as weights in the RSSA, and the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;absolute probability of different present observer-moments would be used 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in a weighted ASSA.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;2. Even if you don&#x2019;t know the correct absolute probability of any of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;OM&#x2019;s to start with, there will turn out to be a unique self-consistent 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;solution to what this absolute measure on OM&#x2019;s has to look like, given 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;only the theory of consciousness and the assumption that all possible OM&#x2019;s 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;exist (the &#x2018;everything&#x2019; part of the theory). This would be analogous to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the unique solution to the simultaneous equations in the cartoon model above.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This would be neat because the laws of physics we observe could hopefully 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be derived (in principle anyway) from the absolute and relative measures 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;on all OM&#x2019;s, so you&#x2019;d basically be deriving all the laws of the universe 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;from just a theory of consciousness and platonic assumption that every 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;conscious pattern that can exist, does exist. The problem with any TOE 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that incorporates a &quot;theory of consciousness&quot; is that it runs the risk of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;being a dualist theory if any aspect of first-person probabilities derives 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;from something other than that theory (like an objective measure on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;universes rather than OM&#x2019;s to explain why I don&#x2019;t experience Harry Potter 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;worlds), but this idea is nicely monist and simple.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It might seem that a theory centered on consciousness and observer-moments 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would suggest that any part of the universe that isn&#x2019;t observed by a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sentient being doesn&#x2019;t really exist, but I imagine identifying distinct 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;observer-moments&quot; with something like &quot;patterns of causal relationships&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(or finite computations, perhaps), so that all such patterns, even the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;random jostling of molecules in a cloud of gas, would qualify as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observer-moments with very low-grade levels of consciousness. That way the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;absolute probability of each such pattern, along with the probabilistic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;relationships between different patterns, might be used to derive what we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ordinarily think of as the laws of physics, especially if the laws of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physics can ultimately be stated in terms of nothing but relationships
