OOPS! I sent this reply only to Hal - instead of the list.
<br />
So here's the fwd to the list.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We gain some simplification in the QM formalism but at

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this seemingly huge expense. The second is its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; untestability, although some people have claimed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; otherwise. And the third is that it retains what we might

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; call the problem of measure, that is, explaining why we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seem to occupy branches with a high measure or amplitude,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; without just adding that as an extra assumption.
</em><br />
<br />I have always had two problems with the MWI. Initially it
<br />
was measurements that caused the splitting into different
<br />
universes, and that's apparently still the view of people
<br />
who propose tests like Plaga, but later it was realized
<br />
that there was no prinicpled way to distinguish
<br />
measurements from other interactions.  But then it seems
<br />
that the universe must split everytime a photon is emitted
<br />
by an atom anywhere in the visible universe.  Since that
<br />
atom could have interacted with some atom near us - all the
<br />
visible universe was in interaction before inflation - then
<br />
that split implies a split here &amp; now.  But to what effect?
<br />
&nbsp;MWI seems to commit us to an essentially infinite rate of
<br />
splitting; yet nobody uses it except in a QM measurement
<br />
analysis.  To take it seriously I would need to see why all
<br />
this infinite splitting can be ignored and whay I need only
<br />
pay attention to certain cases.  This seems very much like
<br />
Bohr's division into classical/quantum realms.
<br />
<br />The second problem has to do with time and casuality. At a
<br />
microscopic level QM is time symmetric.  If we say there is
<br />
no real collapse of the wave function - all evolution is
<br />
unitary (and therefore reversible) - then it seems we
<br />
should from each datum or measurement result, compute the
<br />
past as well as the future.  All that can be known of the
<br />
past, what happened within our past light cone, is
<br />
determined by the present.  So does the universe split as
<br />
we go back in time?  If not, why not?  Are we stepping
<br />
outside physics and assuming that the experimenter, as an
<br />
agent, sets up initial, but not final, conditions and so
<br />
defines the arrow-of-time by his causal action as an agent
<br />
outside of physics?
