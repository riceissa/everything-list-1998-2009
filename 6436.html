<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;From: &quot;Hal Finney&quot; [mailto:hal.domain.name.hidden]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Another way to think of it is that all bit strings
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;exist, timelessly; and some of them implicitly specify computer programs;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;and some of those computer programs would create universes with observers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;just like us in them.  You don't necessarily need the machinery of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;the computer to run the program, it could be that the existence of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;program itself is sufficient for what we think of as reality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Brent Meeker replies:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; In what sense does &quot;the program&quot; exist if not as physical tokens?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Is it enough that you've thought of the concept?  The same &quot;program&quot;,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; i.e. bit-string, does different things on different computers.  So how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; can the program instantiate reality independent of the computer?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Yes, I think it is enough that I have thought of the concept!  Or more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;accurately, I think it is enough that the concept is thinkable-of.
</em><br />
<br />Why bother with the computer at all.  Since you're just conceptualizing the
<br />
computer (it is actually going to do anything) and all the computer would do
<br />
would be to produce some other bit-string, given the input bit-string; why not
<br />
just think of all possible bit-strings. Isn't that what Bruno's UDA does -
<br />
generate all possible bit strings.
<br />
<br />But since they only have to be &quot;thinkable-of&quot;, it seems all this talk about
<br />
bit-strings and computers is otiose.  The universe is &quot;thinkable-of&quot;, therefore
<br />
it exists.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;What I mean is, a bit string plus the concept of a computer is enough
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to imply a universe with a time coordinate (or more than one!)  and all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the complexity we perceive.  In the Platonic sense both the bits and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the computer-concept exist in the abstract, as both are informational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;entities.  So in principle that should be enough.
</em><br />
<br />Actually I think that is a mistake.  Information is the (partial)
<br />
representation of one thing by another.  A bit-string doesn't represent
<br />
anything absent something to &quot;interpret&quot; it.  I put &quot;interpret&quot; in scare quotes
<br />
because I really mean &quot;to act on it&quot;; not just transform it into words or
<br />
pictures.  I don't think information exists apart from things with goals and
<br />
intentions who act on the information.  It's human concept.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now, as to the problem of which computer to use to interpret a given
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;bit string, what I think you also need to do is to imagine all possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(abstract) computers as well as all possible bit strings.  Then these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;produce all possible universes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So this exposes a weakness, which is that we seem to need a measure over
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;all the computers, in order to compute a measure over the universes they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;compute.  And if we look at this more closely, we see that I have glossed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;over another assumption, which is an implied measure over bit strings.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Robin Hanson on another list challenged me on this point: we need to know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;which bit strings are more likely in order to deduce which universes are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;more likely.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In the case of the bit strings, there is an obvious symmetric choice,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;which is that each bit has independent, equal probability of 1/2.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This is not the only possibility, though, and we might get different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probability assignments for our universes if we assume a different measure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;over bit strings.  But this measure is certainly staring us in the face
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and has an obvious appeal.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;For computers, it is much harder to come up with a natural measure which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;will tell us that some computers are &quot;more likely&quot;, have more measure,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;than others.  My hope is that with further understanding and philosophical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;exploration of this issue, we will either come up with an obvious measure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(as in the case of bit strings) or decide that it doesn't matter.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The theory of algorithmic complexity shows that, from a sufficiently
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;removed perspective,
</em><br />
<br />How do you compute complexity?  Are you saying there is some measure called
<br />
&quot;complexity&quot; whose value is a function of something about the universe?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;almost all computers compute essentially the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;same complexity for a universe.  These wiggle words &quot;almost all&quot; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;essentially&quot; do leave room for the fact that certain computers compute
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;completely different complexities for a given universe.  But that's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;only a small fraction of computers - at least, I'd like to say that,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;but that again seems to require a measure over computers.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So I do think this is an area where some work is needed, but certainly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this result from AIT gives hope for a solution.  It cannot be a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;coincidence that almost all computers work almost the same on almost
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;all universes.  That comes really close to letting us say, the computer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;doesn't matter.  Maybe future philosphers will give us better grounds for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;letting us be agnostic about the choice of computers.  And maybe we will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;even find that the question of bit string measure is similarly irrelevant.
</em><br />
<br />I don't see that computers are even relevant.
