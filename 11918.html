<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Le 24-nov.-06, à °5:48, Colin Geoffrey Hales a dit :
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I agree very 'not interesting' ... a bit like saying &quot;assuming comp&quot;
</em><br />
endlessly.....and never being able to give it teeth.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I guess you don't know about my work (thesis). I know there are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some &quot;philosopher&quot; who considers it controversial, but it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not a work in philosophy (in the current usage in europa at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; least) and nothing in it is &quot;third person&quot; controversed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; actually (to my knowledge). Comp makes the physical science
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emerging from number theory, and I show how to make the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; derivation constructively, by interviewing an arithmetically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sound &quot;platonist&quot; universal machine. The term &quot;platonist&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can be used in the formal sense that the machine asserts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (A v ~A) for any arithmetical propositions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And this makes comp (actually a weaker form of comp)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; empirically falsifiable.

</em><br />
I know your work is mathematics, not philosophy. Thank goodness! I can see
<br />
how your formalism can tell you 'about' a universe. I can see how
<br />
inspection of the mathematics tells a story about the view from within and
<br />
without. Hypostatses and all that. I can see how the whole picture is
<br />
constructed of platonic objects interacting according to their innate
<br />
rules.

<br />
It is the term 'empirically falsifiable' I have trouble with. For that to
<br />
have any meaning at all it must happen in our universe, not the universe
<br />
of your formalism. A belief in its falsifiability of a formalism that does
<br />
not map to anything we can find in our universe is problematic.

<br />
In the platonic realm of your formalism arithmetical propositions of the
<br />
form  (A v ~A) happen to be identical to our empirical laws:

<br />
&quot;It is an unconditional truth about the natural world that either (A is
<br />
true about the natural world) or (A is not true about the natural world)&quot;

<br />
(we do the science dance by making sure A is good enough so that the NOT
<br />
clause never happens and voila, A is an an empirical 'fact')

<br />
Call me thick but I don't understand how this correspondence between
<br />
platonic statements and our empirical method makes comp falsifiable in our
<br />
universe. You need to map the platonic formalism to that which drives our
<br />
reality and then say something useful we can test.You need to make a claim
<br />
that is critically dependent on 'comp' being true.

<br />
I would suggest that claim be about the existence or otherwise of
<br />
phenomenal consciousness would be the best bet.

<br />
There is another more subtle psychological issue in that a belief that
<br />
comp is empirically testable in principle does not entail that acting as
<br />
if it were true is valid. Sometimes I think that is what is going on
<br />
around here.

<br />
Do you have any suggested areas where comp might be tested and have any
<br />
ideas what the test might entail?

<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ... I am more interested in proving scientists aren't/can't be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; zombies....that it seems to also challenge computationalism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; in a certain sense... this is a byproduct I can't help,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; not the central issue.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I can have a lot of sympathy for an argument showing that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; science cannot be done without consciousness (I personaly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do believe this!). But if the byproduct is that machine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cannot be conscious, then I think it will make your argument
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; far less interesting, and, by Church thesis, necessarily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non effective (if it was a machine would be able to produce
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it). Actually, the acomp hypostases can already been used
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to explain why machines will develop argument why their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; own consciousness are special and cannot be attached to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any describable machine in a provable way (and they will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be 1-correct!!!). It is the diabolical (somehow godelian)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prediction of comp: machines will not believe in comp,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just bet on it in some circumstance.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

</em><br />
Conscious machines will happen. And it will be very very
<br />
interesting...With any luck it'll be me who does it. It's my mission. My
<br />
PhD.

<br />
What I contend is that abstract computation alone will not do it. Part of
<br />
the machine physics, apart from being able to shuffle charge around in
<br />
accordance to the symbols, is to ALSO attach the physics of experience.
<br />
(Is this what COMP is pointing to?). Then the machines will have
<br />
phenomenal consciousuness and as a result be a whole bunch more adaptable
<br />
and smart. And get seats on planes.

<br />
At that time (a few years.. 10 max?) I'll be able to test comp for real in
<br />
teeny weeny scientists. My prediction is comp is false in our universe,
<br />
but true in the platonic realm where existence and computation of
<br />
abstractions are identities. That is not our universe, IMO, where
<br />
'existence' is 'computation of/by &lt;blah&gt;' and the 'blah' is not nice neat
<br />
mathematical ideals. Depicting it with platonic ideals is very useful and
<br />
informative...but that's as far as it goes.

<br />
That's my agricultural, engineers expectation....

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In a preceding post you wrote:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Bruno: I would separate completely &quot;computations&quot; which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; is an absolute notion (at least with Church thesis),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; and &quot;proof&quot; which has sense only relatively to the choice
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; of a formal system, or theory, or machine.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; OK. It tend to mix them without thinking...The process is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; mixed in my mind. It could be because I can see reality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; as a formal system.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The distinction between computability and provability is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fundamental for the AUDA. Alas, you are not the only one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; who miss the distinction, but explanation of this has to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be a bit more technical. I have already attempted some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explanation, but it is perhaps too hard to convey in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non technical list. I don't know, presently.

</em><br />
It is something I am working on. Any light you can shed on it I'd greatly
<br />
appreciate.

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, seeing reality as a formal system ? that does not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; make sense for me. Arithmetical reality is already beyond
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all formal systems except infinite &quot;divine&quot; one like the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; An-omega angels (which in their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; analytical context suffer the same limitations, and obeys
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; too to G and G*, cf Boolos 93).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

</em><br />
I have no clue what the quotes re angels and G etc are about. However,
<br />
once you can accept 'wild-type' naturally occuring primitive &quot;objects&quot; as
<br />
available (as opposed to idealised platonic realm primitives like integers
<br />
with nice neat relationships) then their inter-relatedness is a formal
<br />
system in the same way that platonic realm objects are. An actual instance
<br />
of them is axioms. 'Computation' and theorem proving from this axiom set
<br />
is what the universe literally is...at least that is how I like to think
<br />
of it. It's just very very messy. In local descriptions from within we
<br />
scientists can map it into the idealised form - very useful to understand
<br />
things, but not saying anything about what the universe is made of. The
<br />
idealised realm helps us make conceptual sense.. but no more.

<br />
I think of it like lab mice and lab flies. You make them (phenotype them)
<br />
and then you get nice neat behaviour (idealised), which you then can use
<br />
to contrast with the 'wild-type', which is out of your control, messy and
<br />
mysterious (which is why you're doing it in the first place!).

<br />
Maybe that's a poor analogy. :-)
