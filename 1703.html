<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;It is easier to extrapolate that

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Is it the same &quot;real observer moment&quot; for each of us?

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Where does that &quot;real observer moment&quot; come from ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;And what is it ?
</em><br />
<br />If you accept that conciousness can be split up into many different observer 
<br />
moments, then the real observer moment is just the only observer moment that 
<br />
you actually experience.  All the rest are just memories of the real one.  
<br />
Of course, all possible observer moments do exist in the plentitude, but 
<br />
none are actually linked to each other.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Where does your &quot;future&quot; come from. Most of us doesn't take time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;for granted.
</em><br />
<br />Neither do I.  In fact, my entire theory suggests that time does not exist.  
<br />
My definition of the past is that which an observer moment remembers 
<br />
(conciously or subconciously), and the future is that which an observer 
<br />
moment does not remember.  This is where my linked-list structure of memory 
<br />
comes in.  The illusion of time comes from the fact that not only does an 
<br />
observer moment remember many previous observer moments, but it remembers 
<br />
which observer moments each of the remembered ones remember.  So, observer 
<br />
moment C might remember observer moment A and B, but it will also remember 
<br />
that observer moment B only remembers observer moment A, and that observer 
<br />
moment A will remember neither of them.  So, even though there is only one 
<br />
real observer moment, our future is entirely depentant upon which remembered 
<br />
observer moment you are referencing.  Our future in relation to a given 
<br />
remembered observer moment are those remembered observer moments that the 
<br />
remembered observer moment you are referencing does not remember (that is as 
<br />
simple as I can say it).  So our future is actually memories of the real 
<br />
observer moment, just like the past, except that they are observer moments 
<br />
that aren't remembered by the current one (which is also a remembered 
<br />
observer moment).  Our life 'ends' when we reach the real observer moment, 
<br />
although it never really ends because there is no such thing as time.  All 
<br />
of the real observer moment's memories happen all at once, independant of 
<br />
time, and each of these memories include a perception of where it is in 
<br />
time, based on that memory's memories.
<br />
<br />I should also add that as far as I can tell, there is no possible way to 
<br />
know which observer moment is the real one.
<br />
<br />As for, &quot;is it the same real observer moment for each of us&quot;: as I said 
<br />
before, everything in the universe, including other people, do not really 
<br />
exist, and are just memories.  So, other people are really 'zombies'.  
<br />
However, because all possible observer moments exist in the plentitude, 
<br />
there is an observer moment that correctly corresponds to everyone you see.  
<br />
So in a sense, the conciousness of everyone around you does exist, even 
<br />
though it is not actually connected to what you see.  Are all real observer 
<br />
moments the same?  Of course not.  That is like saying that all universes in 
<br />
the wave function of MW are the same.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Have you read that insightfull book by Oliver Sacks ``the man
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;who mistook his wife for a hat&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;He describes in it people who have lost their hypocampus. That is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;part of the brain which transform short term memory with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;lon term memory. The apparent effect is that they are trapped in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;one single observer moment (which is rather long, +/- 5 to 10 minutes).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;That guy at the age of 50 still believe that he was 20 age old.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;You could explain him what happened, but then after 10 minutes you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;must explain him it again, and again ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;How will you figure his experience with your &quot;theory&quot;?
</em><br />
<br />I don't really understand the condition you are trying to explain here, 
<br />
although I doubt it has much to do with my observer moments theory.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;The everything idea, or the MWI, is used to explain the universal laws, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;as they are used in the 'real world'.  The only difference is, rather 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;encapsulating the universe as the wave function as in MW, you encapsulate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;conciousness as the wave function, so that rather than having every 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;parallel universe, you have every possible parallel observer moment.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;branch in the wave function is really a branch in memory.  Because you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;exist as a single observer moment, your path is predetermined, but still
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;follows probability laws.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;OK. This is somewhat similar, at first sight, with the many-history
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interpretation of QM.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Your theory is interesting but very very vague, IMO.
</em><br />
<br />Damn.  I'm explaining it as best as I can.  I don't know how to say it any 
<br />
better.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;You could help us in comparing your approach with some most ``traditional&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;approaches among those discussed in this list (SSA, AP, Everett,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Leslie-Bostrom, Tegmark, Schmidhuber-comp, Mallah-comp, Standish's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;justification of OCCAM,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Higgo &quot;measure-less&quot; Buddhism, and others...).
</em><br />
<br />The problem is, I don't know most of these approaches.  But here goes:
<br />
<br />SSA - you can assume that you are a single sample within the entire 
<br />
plentitude of observer moments.  The reason there are physical laws is 
<br />
because of the same laws of probability that govern MWI.  BTW, I would 
<br />
disagree that the Strodinger equation is derived due to the WAP.  The WAP 
<br />
cannot explain the physical laws - only the constants within the laws of 
<br />
physics.  If the WAP governed probability alone, you would see chaos to the 
<br />
brink - but not quite to the point - of an inability to survive.
<br />
<br />AP - what is that?
<br />
<br />Everett - I've already compared my theory to MW.
<br />
<br />Leslie-Bonstrom - All I know is they talk about the doomsday argument.  The 
<br />
doomsday argument does not apply with my theory, because there is no such 
<br />
thing as death (not to you, at least).
<br />
<br />Tegmark - he suggests an expansion of the MW, I think.  My theory would 
<br />
compare here the same as in MW.
<br />
<br />Schmidthuber,Mullah-comp - I don't know the specifics of each of their 
<br />
theorys.  As for comp in general, I believe that a turing machine could 
<br />
still theoretically exist to emulate conciousness.
<br />
<br />Standish's OCCAM - don't know that.
<br />
<br />Higgo's Buddism - Higgo doesn't believe in measure, but I do.  Other than 
<br />
that, I have a feeling that we both have very similar theories.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;My feeling is that with your &quot;single observer moment&quot; you will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;miss (put under the rug?) the measure problems, like James Higgo ...
</em><br />
<br />As I said, the measure problems are the same whether you use MW or my single 
<br />
observer moment theory.
