<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But why can't it be reduced to classes of specific physical things? How
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;can you show that it is necessary for anything corresponding to this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;description to 'exist' apart from its instantiations as documented
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;procedures and actual occurrences of their application?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;David
</em><br />
<br />I did point out in my last post that there appears to be no simple way
<br />
to make such reductions (between math concepts and classes of specific
<br />
things).  For instance no one has yet succeeded in showing how math
<br />
concepts such as infinite sets and transfinite sets (which are precise
<br />
math concepts) could be converted into physical notions.  A also
<br />
pointed to David Deutsch's excellent 'Criteria For Reality':
<br />
<br />&nbsp;'If according to the simplest explanation, an entity is complex and
<br />
autonomous, then that entity is real.' ('The Fabric Of Reality', Pg 91)
<br />
<br /><br />As Detusch points out, mathematical entities do appear to match the
<br />
criteria for reality: 'Abstract entities that are complex and
<br />
autonomous exist objectively and are part of the fabric of reality.
<br />
There exist logically necessary truths about these entities, and these
<br />
comprise the subject-matter of mathematics.'
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Language, logic, and math are human inventions just as chair is, c.f. William S.
</em><br />
Cooper &quot;The Evolution of Reason&quot;.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;That chair would continue to exist even if all
</em><br />
humans were wiped off the Earth - but the concept of 'chairs' wouldn't
<br />
and neither
<br />
would '2'.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Ontology is invented too.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Brent Meeker
</em><br />
<br />I distinguish between two kinds of abstract concepts - abstract
<br />
concepts of universal applicability, which I think are objectively real
<br />
and abstract concepts of limited applicability, which are clearly human
<br />
inventions.  You don't accept the distinction.  But I pointed out that
<br />
for abstract concepts of universal applicability, there appears to be
<br />
no difference between cognitive and ontological categories, where as
<br />
for abstract concepts of limited applicability, there clearly is a
<br />
difference between cognitive and ontologic categories.
<br />
<br />So I would tend to say that the concept of '2' is clearly 'out there',
<br />
where as the concept of 'chair' is 'in our heads' and quite possibly
<br />
even the concrete instances of a 'chair' is 'in our heads' as well!
<br />
After all, is it really the case that a chair is an object 'out there'
<br />
with definite objective physical dimensions like length?  Isn't it
<br />
actually the case that all that's 'out there' is a 4-dimensional
<br />
'chair' world-time? - which I point out to you as really a
<br />
*mathematical construct* ;)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Actually, it's an arguement against doing so. If mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;terms referred to particular things, they would not be universally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;applicable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;They are universally applicable because they don't refer to anything.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;1Z
</em><br />
<br />Math concepts are super-classes or abstract classes being used to
<br />
classify *other* astract classes.  I pointed out three different
<br />
ontological catgories:
<br />
<br />(1)  Abstract entities of universal applicability (like math concepts)
<br />
(2)  Abstract entities of limited applicability (human constructs like
<br />
alphabets or a chair concept)
<br />
(3) Concrete instances (like a particular example of a chair)
<br />
<br />I'd say you can make a good case that the entities in (1) are the only
<br />
real objective reality.  It's (2) and (3) that are actually 'in our
<br />
heads'!
