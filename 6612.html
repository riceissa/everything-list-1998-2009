Dear Jonathan,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-separateness and identity are not the same thing! Your argument 
<br />
against dualism assumes that the duals are somehow separable and 
<br />
non-mutually dependent and thus lacking a linking mechanism dualism fails as 
<br />
a viable theory. On the other hand, once we see the flaw in the assumption 
<br />
that we are making, that Body and Mind - Physical existence and Mathematical 
<br />
existence (or Information!) are separable in the sense that one can have 
<br />
meaning and &quot;reason to be&quot; without the other, we can again consider how 
<br />
dualism can be viable as people such as Vaughan Pratt have done.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hard part is in overcoming the prejudice that has built up since 
<br />
Descartes' flawed theory was proposed. His failure was in assuming that Body 
<br />
and Mind are &quot;substances&quot; that have independent yet equal existence. The use 
<br />
of the assumption of &quot;substance&quot; caries with it the necessitation of a 
<br />
&quot;causal connector&quot; and barring the existence of such a connector the 
<br />
assumption leads to an inconsistency. When we consider the duality in terms 
<br />
of process or types and tokens or hardware and software, whose very meaning 
<br />
vanishes with out the other, it makes a lot more sense.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is analogous to claiming that numbers can somehow exist without 
<br />
there being any need for them to be representable in any way. How does any 
<br />
number, even a Gödel number, represent anything at all if the means by which 
<br />
to perform the act of making a distinction is not present &quot;in them&quot;? There 
<br />
is not such a thing as an &quot;action&quot; in Platonia!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is one thing to claim that any event or action or aspect of existence 
<br />
can be faithfully represented as some number, just like a movie is 
<br />
enumerated by a string of ones and zeroes in the tiny pits in  DVD disc, but 
<br />
without there being some means that is not a number to act upon that number, 
<br />
the very notion of number vanishes. Numbers, all mathematics and logics, 
<br />
necessitate some means to express themselves.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless we can somehow &quot;read each other's minds&quot;, it is impossible for me 
<br />
to communicate the difference between the number 1 and the number 2. Without 
<br />
some physical structure to act as an interface between our Minds, minds 
<br />
cannot interact or even &quot;know&quot; anything; there is no &quot;definiteness&quot;. 
<br />
Similarly, Bodies cannot ask questions or predictions or have anticipations 
<br />
or self-representations without some Mind associated. Nature has given us 
<br />
fingers with which to understand numbers...
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Platonist neglects his own brain when he demands that we believe that 
<br />
numbers are all that exist.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consciousness seems to be more of a functional relationship between the 
<br />
Physical and the Mental, the Outside and the Inside, as Chalmer's states. 
<br />
When the two dual aspects are taken to the ultimate level of Existence 
<br />
in-itself, the distinction between the two vanishes. Russell saw this long 
<br />
ago, he denoted it as &quot;neutral monism&quot;. It is too bad that he made the 
<br />
mistake of excluding non-well founded sets from consideration.
<br />

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Stathis: Can the description of the apple, or bat, or whatever
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; meaningfully include what it is like to be that thing?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My argument (which is Dennet's argument) is that &quot;what it is like to be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that thing&quot; is identical to &quot;being that thing&quot;. As Bruno points out, in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3rd
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person level (ie. the level where I am describing or simulating an apple), 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a description can not &quot;be&quot; a thing; but on the 1st person level (where a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; description *is* the thing, from the point of view of the thing, inside 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simulation, as it were), then the description does &quot;include&quot; what it is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like to be that thing. But &quot;include&quot; is not the correct word to use, since 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subtly assumes a dualism (that the qualia exist somehow separate from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mere description of the thing); the description *just is* the thing.
