<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; always going to be disagreements, I think.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is good reason why nothing simpler can give rise to consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (nothing simpler can contain information), while there doesn't seem to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any reason why binary strings can't give rise to consciousness.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You say there doesn't seem to be a reason strings can't do it, but
<br />
to me, there does seem to be one.  Like A=B and B=C implies A=C, you
<br />
either believe it, or you don't.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a big proponent of Occam's razor.  But in using the criterion
<br />
of simplicity, one must be sure not to make an explanation too simple to
<br />
explain the facts.  In this case, the fact is that we have observations
<br />
and seem to be able to make decisions.  I don't see how just plain
<br />
information could give rise to that.  Can you explain to me how it
<br />
happens that information has such a property?  Of course not, no one can
<br />
really explain consciousness.  That's a fact.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But computations seem to me to have enough structure - barely
<br />
enough - to do the trick.  After all, what could we add to computations to
<br />
give them more structure?  There's really nothing left.  (Noncomputatible
<br />
stuctures are qualitatively the same as computations in my book, unlike
<br />
laws vs. no laws.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 	There are very likely telltale signs that a neuron has recently
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; been firing, which is just as good in your proposal.  But suppose it's an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; AI with non-volatile memory.  It would still have experiences when turned
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; off, or just stored on a CD, in your proposal.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree in the AI case, the CD containing the AI's state will contribute
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to its measure. However I do not see this as more counterintuitive than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your own proposal, where something similar happens if you program a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computer to repeatly load the AI's state from the CD and then run the AI
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; algorithm for a few clock cycles.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is that a problem?  If you build a human brain, let it run a
<br />
little, then destroy it and rebuild one in the original state, it's the
<br />
same thing.  Not so counterintuitive.  But the CD alone is different - it
<br />
just sits there.  Or it could be a book, with the pattern of memory states
<br />
just printed out on the pages.  Or a sand sketch.  Wet that sand and you
<br />
get 20 years to life in prison.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 	You obviously don't need to replace proteins and DNA, just the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; neural net.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I meant what are you going to use as the evolutionary mechanism?
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been such simulations, I don't know the details.
<br />
Without limitations on time and computing power, it shouldn't be that hard.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 	So where are we going to get that authoritative estimate?  I don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; really know any computer scientists, though NYU has them of course.  It
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; would have to be someone interested, but not so interested as to take sides.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's going to be difficult to find an appropriate authority. This person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would have to be an expert in computer science, physics, chemistry,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; biology, and neurology.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or he could be assisted by one expert from each discipline.  But
<br />
how could we assemble such a panel?  I want to get those estimates.  This
<br />
is a rare case in which it is actually possible to settle a philosophical
<br />
question quantitatively.  That alone makes it important.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 	Again, I'm not seeing it the same way as you.  You still have not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; answered my question: are you proposing that the program must print out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the conscious part of the string at the beginning of the tape, then erase 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the rest of the program?  Otherwise it is still a substring.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No I'm adopting the standard definition of a prefix machine (see Li and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Vitanyi) which has seperate input and output tapes. 
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll have to look at it now that I have L&amp;V, but your proposal
<br />
seems stranger all the time to me.  Now not any string can be conscious,
<br />
just one on an official output tape?  Do you think that other types of
<br />
machines exist as well (perhaps all types), but don't give rise to
<br />
consciousness?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; What about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the fact that it is surrounded by other bits in the orthogonal direction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; from the other Turing machines?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But the concept of surround doesn't make sense if the spacial dimension in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the orthorgonal direction is continuous. You can't even give a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definition for the values of the neighboring bits of a given bit. It's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like asking what are the two real numbers surrounding PI.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you said that you were *not* using a continuous array of
<br />
machines!  You can't have it both ways.  What happened to your discrete
<br />
machine cloning scheme, with the array of machines doubling in size at
<br />
each time step?  Have you abandoned it?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time direction is discrete, right?  What about the bits
<br />
surrounding it in the time direction, which is just another dimension?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- - - - - - -
