<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Tegmark's paper is interesting, except that he still (like many physicists) puts

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the mind-body problem under the rug, and so he misses the impact of incompleteness,

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and the fact that at the level of mathematical Platonism, the physical world is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just a mathematical structure among others. With comp, although physics is secondary,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the physical world is not just a mathematical structure among others, but a very

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; special mathematical structures emerging from existing relations among a vast set

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of mathematical structures.

<br />Again, you seem to insist on your own language.
<br />
<br />First, you admitted that by &quot;COMP&quot; or &quot;comp&quot; you *meant* computationalism.
<br />
<br />Then you overlay all your own beliefs on computationalism,
<br />
which certainly confuses a lot of people.
<br />
<br />Here is what wikipedia says: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectionism">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectionism</a>
<br />
<br />&quot;Computationalism is a specific form of cognitivism which argues that mental activity is computational, i.e. that the mind is
<br />
essentially a Turing machine. Many researchers argued that the trend in connectionism was towards a reversion to associationism, and
<br />
the abandonment of the idea of a language of thought, something they felt was mistaken. On the other hand, it was those very
<br />
tendencies that made connectionism attractive for other researchers.
<br />
<br />&quot;Connectionism and computationalism need not be at odds per se, but the debate as it was phrased in the late 1980s and early 1990s
<br />
certainly led to opposition between the two approaches. However, throughout the debate some researchers have argued that
<br />
connectionism and computationalism are fully compatible, though nothing like a consensus has ever been reached. The differences
<br />
between the two approaches that are usually cited are the following:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Computationalists posit symbolic models that do not resemble underlying brain
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;structure at all, whereas connectionists engage in &quot;low level&quot; modeling, trying
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to ensure that their models resemble neurological structures.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Computationalists generally focus on the structure of explicit symbols (mental
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;models) and syntactical rules for their internal manipulation, whereas
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;connectionists focus on learning from environmental stimuli and storing
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this information in a form of connections between neurons.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Computationalists believe that internal mental activity consists of manipulation
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of explicit symbols, whereas connectionists believe that the manipulation of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;explicit symbols is a poor model of mental activity.
<br />
<br />So please, Bruno, quit trying to imply that all computationalists (e.g. me)
<br />
believe *only* on the UDist or only in mathematical structures.
<br />
<br />For many, many years whenever you wrote &quot;COMP&quot; I assumed that you meant your
<br />
own theories. Naturally that included this extremely speculative concept of
<br />
Schmidhuber's and others that that both time and our physical reality are
<br />
merely a manifestation of timeless bitstrings.
<br />

<br />
<br />&quot;(2) Philosophical AI or Computationalism&quot;
<br />
&quot;Secondly, and of more relevance to this discussion, is computationalism or philosophical AI, (sometimes also known as Strong AI),
<br />
which is the view that all human mental activities are reducible to algorithms, and could therefore be implemented on a computer.
<br />
Computationalism is an essential tenet of physicalism, which states that there is no need to assume any spiritual or non-algorithmic
<br />
aspect to existence.
<br />
<br />&quot;Computationalism  is thus diametrically opposed to Buddhist philosophy, which regards the subtle mind (that which survives death
<br />
and goes on to the next life) as a fundamental aspect of reality, not an epiphenomenon of matter. Buddhism views a sentient being,
<br />
human or animal and its mind, as a totally different kind of thing from a machine or automaton.&quot;
