space.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; In a very real way the existence of 'mysterious observer dependence'

<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is
</em><br />
<br />actually proof that the hierarchically organised S(.) structure idea must be
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; somewhere near the answer.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not really. You can have a two-way causal interdependene between two
</em><br />
<br />systems without them both having th esame structure.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />I think you are assuming a separateness of structure that does not exist.
<br />
<br />There is one and one only structure. We are all part of it. There is no
<br />
concept of 'separate' to be had. Absolutely everything is included in the
<br />
structure. No exceptions. Space, atoms, scientists, qualia. All interactions
<br />
at all 'scales' (scale itself) are all interactions between different parts
<br />
of the one structure. To interact at all is to interact with another part of
<br />
the structure. The idea of there being anything else ('not' the structure)
<br />
is meaningless. If there is any 'thing' in the structure then the balance of
<br />
the structure expressed a perfect un-thing.
<br />
<br />There is nothing else. That is the coincept I am exploring.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Note that we don't actually have to know what S(.) is to make a whole 
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; pile of observations of properties of organisations of it that apply 
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; regardless of the particular S(.). It may be we never actually get to 
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; sort out the
</em><br />
<br />specifics of S(.)! (I have an idea, but it doesn't matter from the point
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; view of understanding qualia as another property of the structure 
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; like
</em><br />
<br />atoms).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; In Bruno's terms the structure of S(.) is what he calls 'objective
</em><br />
<br />reality'.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I would say that in science the first person view has primacy.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Epistemic or Ontic ?
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />These are just words invented by members of the structure. But I'll try.
<br />
<br />The structure delivers qualia in the first person. Those qualia are quite
<br />
valid 'things' (virtual matter)..organisation/behaviour of structure.
<br />
<br />Their presentation bestows intrinsic knowledge as a measurement to the
<br />
embedded structure member called the scientist. This is knowledge as
<br />
intrinsic intentionality. Within the experiences is regularity which can
<br />
then be characterised as knowledge attributed to some identified behaviour
<br />
in the structure. This attribution is only an attribution as to behaviour of
<br />
the structure, not the structure. These attributions can be used by a
<br />
another  scientist in their 'first person' world.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />All of this is derived from a first person presentation of a measurement.
<br />
<br />Ergo science is entirely first operson based. Epistemic and Ontic characters
<br />
are smatter throughout this description. I could label them all but you
<br />
already know and the process adds nothing to the message or to sorting out
<br />
how it all works.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  I'd say that
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; we formulate abstractions that correlate with agreed appearances 
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; within
</em><br />
<br />the
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; first person view. However, the correspo0ndence between the 
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; underlying
</em><br />
<br />structure and the formulate abstractions is only that - a correlation.
<br />
<br />Our
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; models are not the structure.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; *Could* they be the structure ? if it necessarily the case that the 
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;structure&quot; cannot be modelled, then it is perhaps no strcuture at 
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; all.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Which is the simpler and more reasonable basis upon which to explore the
<br />
<br />universe:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />1) The universe is literally constructed by some sort of 'empirical_law_in_
<br />
a_certain_context embodiment machine' by means unknown that has appearances
<br />
(qualia as 1st person perception) that cannot be predicted by empirical laws
<br />
driving the machine, yet are clearly implemented by the machine. (logically
<br />
equivalent to &quot;the laws of nature are invoked by the purple balloon people
<br />
of the horsehead nebula&quot;).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />or
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />2) The universe is a structure of which we are a part and which also has the
<br />
property of delivering appearances of itself to us within which is
<br />
regularity that can be captured mathematically as empirical laws. By
<br />
considering universes of structure capable of delivering appearances we can
<br />
then insist that the structures appearances thus delivered shall also
<br />
deliver appearances that would lead us to formulate regularity as empirical
<br />
laws when made of it... this 2-sided equation with qualia the
<br />
linking/unifying/central/prime feature is dual aspect science.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Parsimony is in 2), not 1).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Yes....all these things rely on perceptual mechanisms which will
</em><br />
<br />never...repeat...never...be found in quantum mechanics....nor any other
<br />
depiction of appearances.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why not ?
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Continuing right along: sorry....
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />QM is an appearance. Trying to explain appearance with appearance is like
<br />
trying to telephone somebody a telephone (or maybe fax a real fax machine
<br />
down the line). It doesn't make sense. If you want to figure out how the
<br />
phone works then you have to start thinking about the things that comprise
<br />
something that behaves phone_system-ly to phone users. The universe is not
<br />
made of quantum mechanics. Indeed the universe is not made of Xics (where X
<br />
is any empirical law/system of laws of nature derived from appearances). It
<br />
merely behaves Xically. If X is mass then the universe is behaving mass-ly
<br />
(=inertially). This is quite general.
