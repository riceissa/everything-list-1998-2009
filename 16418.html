<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<br />Time is just the dimension of experience.  But experience is an
<br />
internal &quot;psychological&quot; concept, not an external concept.  Therefore
<br />
&quot;time&quot; is also an internal feature of subjective experience, not
<br />
necessarily an external feature of objective reality.
<br />
<br />So it seems to me that we have have no direct access to the physical
<br />
world.  Information about the physical world is conveyed to us via our
<br />
senses.  BUT, we don't even have direct conscious access to our
<br />
sensory data.  All of that sensory data is instead apparently heavily
<br />
processed by various neural subsystems and &quot;feature detectors&quot;, the
<br />
outputs of which are then reintegrated into a simplified mental model
<br />
of reality, and THAT is what we are actually aware of.  That mental
<br />
model is what we think of as &quot;the real world&quot;.  So it seems to me
<br />
that, even accepting physicalism, we can already think of ourselves as
<br />
living in a virtual world of abstract information.
<br />
<br />The same is true of time.  We experience time only because we
<br />
represent that experience internally as part of our simplified model
<br />
of the world.  If there is an external time, it could be altered in
<br />
many ways, but our internal representation (and experience) of time
<br />
will remain unchanged.   Time derives from Consciousness.  Not vice
<br />
versa.  Time IS an aspect of consciousness...and thus doesn't exist
<br />
seperately from conscious experience.
<br />
<br />And also you can go back to the computer simulation idea and think
<br />
about various scenarios.  If you and your environment were simulated
<br />
on a fast computer or a slow computer...you wouldn't be able to tell
<br />
the difference. If the computer ran for a while, then the simulation
<br />
data was saved and the computer turned off, then a year later the
<br />
computer and the simulation were restarted where they left off, you
<br />
would have no way to detect that a year had passed in &quot;external&quot;
<br />
time.  To you in the simulation, it would be as though nothing had
<br />
happened, because the computer simulation would pick up on the same
<br />
exact calculation where it had left off.  There was no interruption in
<br />
your experience of time.
<br />
<br />I agree that experience and consciousness requires changes of state,
<br />
but I don't agree that it must be change with respect to an external
<br />
physical &quot;time&quot; dimension.  The best analogy that I have heard is that
<br />
if you have a non-horizontal line, it's Y value changes with respect
<br />
to the X axis.  So some piece of information (the Y value) &quot;changes&quot;
<br />
with respect to another set of values (the X axis).  But there is no
<br />
time involved in this type of change.
<br />
<br />Your experience of the X axis will depend on how you represent the X
<br />
axis internally in your model of reality.  Maybe you will experience
<br />
the X axis spatially...maybe you will experience it chronologically,
<br />
maybe you will experience it some other way entirely.  Your experience
<br />
of it depends entirely on how it is represented internally in the
<br />
information that produces your conscious experience.
<br />
<br />I think that the Sherlock Holmes approach is the correct one for
<br />
investigating and explaining the nature of consciousness and reality:
<br />
&quot;When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however
<br />
improbable, must be the truth.&quot;
<br />
<br />I come to the conclusion that consciousness is information by way of
<br />
process of elimination.  I can think of experiments or scenarios where
<br />
you can do away with everything except information and still get
<br />
behavior that seems conscious and which therefore I assume is actually
<br />
conscious. Information is the only common factor in all situations
<br />
where consciousness seems to be in evidence.  And really, it doesn't
<br />
seem that counter-intuitive to me that information is ultimately what
<br />
makes me what I am.
<br />
<br />So, I agree with David Chalmers that the idea that some (all?)
<br />
information is conscious in some way is a fundamental aspect of
<br />
information, and not really reducible to more fundamental descriptions
<br />
or processes. Which again makes sense...how can you get more
<br />
fundamental than &quot;information&quot;?
