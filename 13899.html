<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I hope this will become clearer as we proceed.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I hope too. Perhaps it would help us if you could tell me which step of 
<br />
the UDA you find unclear.
<br />
cf the paper:
<br />
<a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/SANE2004MARCHAL.htm">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/SANE2004MARCHAL.htm</a>
<br />
<br />and the single summary slide PDF:
<br />
<a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/SANE2004Slide.pdf">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/SANE2004Slide.pdf</a>
<br />
<br />Normally the first seven steps should not be too much difficult. 
<br />
Remember that we *assume* the comp hyp. Sometimes some people does not 
<br />
understand because they (more or less unconsciously believe that I am 
<br />
arguing for comp, but that is something I am never doing since a very 
<br />
long time: I really take it as a working hypothesis with no (conscious) 
<br />
prejudice about where this can lead us.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Empirically we can expect that the 'substitution level&quot; is more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; related
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to a notion of &quot;isolation&quot; than of scaling. Nevertheless, we cannot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; really use this here, given that we have to extract quantum physics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; from the existence of that &quot;level&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't understand this yet.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I guess you have some understanding of the first sentence, given that 
<br />
this is something happening in any version of QM without collapse. 
<br />
Sometime ago, some people argued that QM is confined to the 
<br />
microscopic, and they believed that that was the reason why a 
<br />
macroscopic quantum superposition (like Schroedinger's Cat) could not 
<br />
exist. Today we have plenty of evidences that this is not correct, and 
<br />
that it is even quite easy to generate a cat in a superposition eating 
<br />
+ drinking (say). Indeed it is enough to *isolate* sufficiently well 
<br />
the cat, and then to force him/her/it to choose between drinking and 
<br />
eating according to the result of a measurement of a quantum 
<br />
superposition state state of some local photon. By linearity the cat 
<br />
will be in the superposition state. What prevent us of seeing the cat 
<br />
in that superposition state is not that the cat is macroscopic but 
<br />
comes from the fact that we cannot isolate the cat sufficiently well 
<br />
from us, so that, very quickly we will find ourselves in a 
<br />
superposition seeing the cat in such state + seeing the cat in the 
<br />
orthe state. The &quot;quickly&quot; here is not due to some magical quick wave 
<br />
collapse, but is due to the rapidity of the decoherence process, which 
<br />
mainly describes the (linear) way superposition are contagiopus to 
<br />
their neighborhood.
<br />
Now with comp, it is the same. You cannot known, by the first person 
<br />
indeterminacy, which computations support your conscious state among 
<br />
all computations that you cannot discerned. To make this clearer, I 
<br />
will wait you telling me where exactly you have some trouble in the 
<br />
UDA. OK?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 3-brain is just not a physical device for producing consciousness, it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is a local and relative &quot;description&quot; of a state making greater the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; probability that you will be able to manifest your first person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; experience relatively to some &quot;dream&quot;, itself being an infinite set of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; histories.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Do you mean here that: there exists a 'state that [increases] the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probability that you will be able to manifest....etc.' and that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3-brain 'is a local and relative &quot;description&quot;' of such a state?
</em><br />
<br /><br />A state by itself cannot change the probabilities. It is the relative 
<br />
number of possible continuations of a state, relative to the &quot;number&quot; 
<br />
of comp histories going through that state which counts, up to some 
<br />
(extraordinarily complex) equivalence relation.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Can you explain why the set of all binary sequences *is* closed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; for diagonalization
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Because any additional members generated by diagonalisation must also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be binary sequences?
</em><br />
<br />OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and why any *enumerable* set of binary sequences
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is *not* close for diagonalization?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Because new members can always be generated by diagonalisation that go
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; outside the original enumerable set (as distinct from the larger set
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of *all* sequences)?
</em><br />
<br />OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; A bit more difficult: can you show that for any set A, the set of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; functions from A to {0,1} is bigger than A?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Could you please elucidate &quot;functions from A to {0,1}&quot; ?
</em><br />
<br /><br />I recall that *a* function (without &quot;s&quot;) from a set A to a set B, is 
<br />
just any association to each member of A of a member of B, in such a 
<br />
way that no element of A is associate to more than one element of B.
<br />
It is usual to describe a function by either a table of associations, 
<br />
or by a graph, etc. I will represent them by the set of associations. 
<br />
For example, the function FACTORIAL from N to N is represented by the 
<br />
infinite set: { (0,1) (1,1) (2, 2) (3, 6) (4, 24) (5, 120) (6, 720), 
<br />
...}.
<br />
I will write sometimes FACTORIAL = { (0,1) (1, 1) (2, 2) (3, 6) (4, 24) 
<br />
(5, 120) (6, 720), ...}  instead of the more cumbersome FACTORIAL can 
<br />
be  represented by the set { (0,1) (1, 1) (2, 2) (3, 6) (4, 24) (5, 
<br />
120) (6, 720), ...}.
<br />
Here we were asking for ALL functions from one set to another.
<br />
<br />Example: let B be {0,1} like above. Let us choose A to be:
<br />
<br />1) the set  {a} which contains just one element a.
<br />
There are two functions: f_1 = {(a, 0)}   and   f_2 = {(a, 1)}
<br />
So the number of functions from A to {0,1}, when A = {a} is 2.
<br />
<br />2) the set {David, Bruno} which contains the two elements David, Bruno.
<br />
There are four functions:
<br />
The two constant functions f_1 and f_2:
<br />
f_1 =  {(David, 0) (Bruno, 0)}
<br />
f_2 =  {(David, 1) (Bruno, 1)}
<br />
The two &quot;variable&quot; functions f_3 and f_4:
<br />
f_3 = {(David, 0) (Bruno, 1)}
<br />
f_4 = {(David, 1) (Bruno, 0)}
<br />
and no more.
<br />
<br />Can you compute how many functions from A to B there are, in case A has 
<br />
n elements and B has m elements? Answer: m^n. Can you see that? If not, 
<br />
find how many functions there are from A = {a, b, c} to {0,1}, and then 
<br />
some other simple example, and then try to make a conjecture, and then 
<br />
try to find some argument which makes you think the negation of the 
<br />
conjecture has to be inconsistent (that is: find a proof of the 
<br />
conjecture). By &quot;proof&quot; here, I mean an argument which convinces you, 
<br />
or better, an argument which you have the feeling that it can be used 
<br />
to convince your &quot;little sister&quot; (which I suppose not to be a 
<br />
mathematician).
