<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Uncaused things can't be explained.  They just are.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Didn't anyone ever explain arithmetic or geometry to you?  Not every
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; explanation needs to be a causal one.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, I think that's what I'm saying.  Causal explanations are not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; really explanations, because you can never trace the causal chain back
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to it's ultimate source.  
</em><br />
<br />That's silly.  If my wife's car won't start and I explain that it's out of gas, that's 
<br />
really an explanation even if I don't know why it's out of gas.  The operational 
<br />
definition of an explanation of an event is what you would do to effect or prevent that 
<br />
event.  In general there are multiple things you could do and hence multiple causes of an 
<br />
event.  The image of a causal chain leading back to an ultimate link is misleading - it is 
<br />
more like causal chain mail that branches out as you trace it back.  But just because you 
<br />
can't trace it back to a single ur-cause doesn't nullify my advice to my wife to put gas 
<br />
in the tank.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Or if you do, the ultimate source is itself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; uncaused.  So, if you rephrase the answer in terms of ultimate causes,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you end up inserting either &quot;unknown&quot; or &quot;uncaused&quot; everywhere.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So causal explanations are subjective...only meaningful within a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; limited context.  Going back to my granite block example:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let's consider two adjacent specks of white and gray found within a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; block of granite.  Why are they adjacent?  What caused them to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; adjacent?  Well, if we consider this block of granite within the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; context of our universe, then we can say that there is a reason in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that context as to why they are adjacent.  There is an explanation,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which has to do with the laws of physics and the contingent details of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the geologic history of the area where this block of granite was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; formed (which is in turn derived from the contingent details of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; initial state of our entire universe).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; BUT if we take an identical block of granite to be something that just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exists uncaused, like our universe, then there can be no explanation.
</em><br />
<br />There can in the same way QM explains the decay of unstable nuclei.  That's what 
<br />
cosmogonists are searching for.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The two specks are just adjacent.  That's it.  No further explanation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is possible.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So in the first case, the geologic explanation makes sense in a local
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subjective way, but not in an absolute way, because the universe that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; provides the context for the geologic explanation has no reason behind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; its initial state or it's governing laws of physics.  The universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just is the way it is.  Therefore, ultimately the block of granite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just is the way it is.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; And being uncaused doesn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; prevent explanation - for example decay of an unstable nucleus is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; uncaused, i.e. it is random, but it is still explained by quantum mechanics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So you can explain it within the context of the laws of our universe,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but this just raises the question of why the laws of our universe are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what they are.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ultimately your answer is:  unstable nuclei decay because that's what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unstable nuclei do.  Tautology.
</em><br />
<br />No, it's not a tautology because there is an underlying theory that explains why some 
<br />
nuclei are stable and some aren't and exactly how unstable they are.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I think you point is better made by observing that an explanation must
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; be of something less known in terms of something better known.  Since
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; nothing can be better known than our own subjective experience, it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; cannot be explained.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, that is pretty good.  I'll file it away for future use.  Thanks!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; So I am saying that no matter how this system evolves, no aspect of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; the system can ever be given a meaningful explanation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Now you've introduced another term &quot;meaningful&quot; explanation.  If one can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; understand it, it must be meaningful.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So when people find hidden messages in the Old Testament using the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Bible Code&quot;, these are meaningful messages?  Really?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If something means something to me...that's subjective.  It means
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something TO ME.  I have a conscious experience of finding that thing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaningful.  There's something that it's like to find it meaningful.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Qualia.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm not sure where I'm going with this point, but...I think it means
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something.  To me.  Ha!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; And neither is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; there any reason to think that it won't continue it's predictable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; pattern.  The system follows it's own &quot;uncaused&quot; rules, which we may
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; be able to guess at, but which we cannot know, due to the system's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; fundamentally uncaused nature.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; You seem to take the position that because knowledge isn't certain no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; knowledge is possible.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, no.  That's not what I'm saying.  I'm saying that the conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience of knowing is somehow more fundamental and important than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what is known.
</em><br />
<br />Was the conscious experience of knowing the Earth is flat more fundamental and important 
<br />
than the fact that the Earth is spherioidal?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If conscious experience is uncaused and acausal, then in some sense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; knowledge is irrelevant.  Your uncaused experience could be of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; believing that you &quot;know&quot; something which is actually false (e.g.,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that 121 is prime).
</em><br />
<br />Why do you suppose you have uncaused experiences?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If conscious experience is caused, then knowledge is...still
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; irrelevant.  But for a different reason...in this case what you *can*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; know is determined by those external causes.  You could be caused to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; believe that you *know&quot; something which is actually false (e.g., that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 121 is prime).  But if you then trace the causal chain back, you will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; never find what ultimately caused you to be wrong
</em><br />
<br />Why do you think this?  Maybe I found 121 in a table of prime numbers that was erroneous. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe a friend told me 121 was prime.  Maybe my calculator malfunctioned due to a cosmic 
<br />
ray hit.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;...when you phrase
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your answer in terms of the ultimate causes, it will just be &quot;I was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wrong because that's the way the universe is&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />Why would I try to phrase my answer in terms of &quot;the ultimate cause&quot;?   Why would I even 
<br />
suppose there is such a thing as &quot;the ultimate cause&quot;?  And why would the absence of an 
<br />
ultimate cause have any relevance to my explanation in terms of proximate causes?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Do you see what I'm getting at with all of this &quot;uncaused&quot; stuff, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the equivalence between an uncaused universe and just an isolated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; uncaused conscious experience?  At all?  Anyone?
</em><br />
<br />Nope.
