Hi John:
<br />
<br />Sorry I did not respond earlier.
<br />
Lately I do not have time to read the list posts and respond during the week.

<br />Observer moments and states of universes I take as being identical.
<br />
<br />To say that they do not interact is a selection.  Selections create 
<br />
information and I prefer the point of view that the top level system 
<br />
should have zero net information.  The All [has many other names 
<br />
suppose] has zero net information because it contains all 
<br />
information.  I separate out of the information zero &quot;All&quot; for 
<br />
examination a list of all properties that an object can have.   That 
<br />
is I select a boundary in the All from among its infinite number of 
<br />
boundaries.  My list being a list can be countably infinite and the 
<br />
set of all its sub sets would then be uncountably infinite.  There 
<br />
are then an uncountably infinite number of objects which can be taken 
<br />
to be states of universes.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;How long is an OM? a million years (cosmology) or a msec?
</em><br />
<br />States of universes have permanent uniform existence.  The question 
<br />
is how &quot;long&quot; can they have a non zero hyper existence.  The answer 
<br />
is all values [to avoid more selection].
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Even if it is a portion of the latter, it makes the existence quite 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;discontinuous - with all the difficulties in it. If it is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;continuous, then how can we talk about 'moments'? Should we assign 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;an equal rate change to all existence (meaning: ONE selection for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the OM length)? If it can be ANY, varying from the infinitely short 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to the other extreme, it would 'wash away' any sense of the meaning 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of an Observer MOMENT concept.
</em><br />
<br />My flow of hyper existence with its possible non binary pulse shapes 
<br />
could make consciousness &quot;continuous&quot; for some sequences of 
<br />
states.  SAS might find a universe state sequence in which the pulse 
<br />
rises from zero to 1 and then back to zero in a many step stair case 
<br />
fashion user friendly.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I think the OM is the figment of us, human observers, who want to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;use an 'understandable' model. [Like: numbers (in the human logic sense).]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Then, in view of the resulting 'unfathomable', we 'complicate' these 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;models - originally created FOR comprehension - into 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;incomprehensibility. [The way as e.g. to bridge Bohm's Explicate to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the Implicate (by Nic de  Cusa's 2nd principle, left out by Bohm: 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the &quot;Complicate&quot; - what I like to assign as math).]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;That 'one' variable property you mention as needed for state- 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interaction is IMO not necessarily  o n e  within our (present) comprehension.
</em><br />
<br />I identify my list's sub sets as states of universes.  The 
<br />
interaction variable I call hyper existence could be compared with a 
<br />
UD trace.  When the trace lands on a state it gets a non zero hyper 
<br />
existence.  You could have UDs that assign a 0.1 hyper existence, UDs 
<br />
that assign a 0.2 value,  UDs that assign a 0.8 value,  UDs that 
<br />
assign a 1.0 value etc. etc.  Now all my model would ask for next is 
<br />
for a sting of universe states that look like ours is in lasting 
<br />
[infinite] compatible set of UD trace intersections.  Since all UDs 
<br />
are infinitely nested, an infinite set of such trace intersection 
<br />
sets would be obtained.  My model has a dynamic originated in the 
<br />
incompleteness of some of the list sub sets and this dynamic has a 
<br />
random content due to the internal and external inconsistency of some 
<br />
of the list's sub sets.
<br />
<br />As far as I can tell from this, my model may include Bruno's model as a subset.
<br />
<br />Yours

Subject: RE: ASSA and Many-Worlds
<br />
<br /><br /><br />One thing that I do not agree with is what seems to me to be a common
<br />
holding regarding observer moments [by this I mean discrete states of
<br />
universes [which are a sub set of possible &quot;objects&quot;]] is that they
<br />
are each so far assumed to have a set of properties that are to some
<br />
extent the same as other observer moments and to some extent
<br />
different from all other observer moments [to distinguish individual
<br />
moments] but nevertheless the properties of an individual observer
<br />
moment are fixed for that observer moment.
<br />
<br />This to me is not logical since it is a selection and why that
<br />
selection?  Why not have some blend of variable properties and fixed
<br />
properties as a possibility?  This seems more in accord with a zero
<br />
information ensemble.
<br />
<br />Further, if it is also held that observer moments can not interact -
<br />
that is also a selection.
<br />
<br />I have proposed in other posts that there should be at least one
<br />
variable property through which universe states can interact.  The
<br />
idea is that all possible universe states have a uniform existence
<br />
property, but also can have an addition property that is a variable
<br />
that one could call hyper existence through which they can
<br />
interact.  They interact by mutually altering each others hyper
<br />
existence property.  This variable property should not have just a
<br />
binary set of values as a possibility but should also have many
<br />
discrete levels as a possibility - again to avoid selection.  In
<br />
other words a universe state could experience a non square pulse of
<br />
hyper existence which could span many of the &quot;this particular state&quot;
<br />
to other state interactions.  This would be like a &quot;wave&quot; of hyper
<br />
existence propagating through some succession of universe
<br />
states.  Non binary, non square pulses of propagating hyper existence
<br />
could be a basis for what is called &quot;consciousness&quot; - a &quot;flow&quot; of
<br />
modulated awareness.
<br />
<br />Given a random component to the underlying dynamic [which I have also
<br />
discussed ] some such wave propagations with non binary, non square
<br />
pulses of hyper existence would be through infinite strings of
<br />
successive states that would all be &quot;life&quot; - and even beyond that -
<br />
&quot;SAS&quot; friendly.
