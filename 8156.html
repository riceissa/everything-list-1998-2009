My April 18, 2005 version of my Theory of Everything has recently been
<br />
published as a patent application.  You can view it at the United States
<br />
Patent Office web site by going to www.uspto.gov .  Click &quot;search&quot; then
<br />
click &quot;Published Number Search&quot; under Published Applications.  Then type
<br />
in my Patent Application Number: &quot;20050182607&quot;.  I have reproduced below
<br />
the &quot;Summary of the Invention&quot; section of my patent application.  This
<br />
theory as you will see is a work in progress that I have been working on
<br />
for 5 years and am still refining.  I also have a newer version, not yet
<br />
published correcting some of my mistakes in the April 18, 2005 version.
<br />
I would appreciate any comments, suggestions or corrections.   
<br />
<br />-SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
<br />
<br />Ross Model of the Universe 
<br />
<br />[0008] I have proposed what I believe is the simplest yet model of the
<br />
universe. I call my model the &quot;The Ross Model of the Universe&quot;.
<br />
Processes described and claimed herein can be used to describe and
<br />
explain all elements of the universe including photons, electrons,
<br />
protons, neutrons, atomic nuclei, heat, temperature, magnetism and
<br />
gravity. A preferred embodiment of the invention is a model described
<br />
below. 
<br />
<br />Tronnies, Entrons and Photons 
<br />
<br />[0009] According to this model, the entire universe and everything in
<br />
it, from photons to electrons to protons to galaxies, is comprised of
<br />
nothing but a single type of elementary charged point particle. I call
<br />
these point particles &quot;tronnies&quot;. These tronnies also carry the Coulomb
<br />
force that is the only force in the universe. A tronnie has no mass and
<br />
no volume but it has a charge equal to plus e or minus e. Also,
<br />
according to this model the only forces in the universe are Coulomb
<br />
forces produced by these tronnies. Each tronnie is repelled by the force
<br />
fields of tronnies with like charges and attracted by the force fields
<br />
of tronnies with opposite charges. Tronnies repel themselves so they
<br />
never travel more slowly than the speed of light. Tronnies tend to pair
<br />
up with a plus tronnie and a minus tronnie in relatively stable
<br />
configurations that I call &quot;entrons&quot;. An entron is a new addition to the
<br />
Ross Model. It is comprised of one plus tronnie and one minus tronnie
<br />
with each tronnie of the entron traveling in circles faster than the
<br />
speed of light (typically .pi.c/2, in the entron's reference frame). An
<br />
entron is the basic energy quantum in the universe. Entrons may be
<br />
integral parts of particles such as protons, atoms, molecules and
<br />
high-energy electrons. Entrons trapped in matter represent the matter's
<br />
heat energy. Entrons released from matter continue to circle with the
<br />
same frequency as when it was trapped; however it also speeds off at the
<br />
speed of light. It cannot however travel in a straight line. To do so
<br />
while circling at 1.57c would require it to go slower than the speed of
<br />
light during part of each cycle. As a consequence it travels in circles
<br />
with diameters 160 time larger than its own circle and this double
<br />
circling configuration does travel in a straight line at the speed of
<br />
light. It is a photon. The circling tronnies provide the energy of the
<br />
photon, hc/.lambda., where h is Planck's constant and .lambda. is the
<br />
photon's wavelength which is related to the entron's diameter, d', by
<br />
.lambda.=320d'. In my preferred photon model each photon is comprised of
<br />
one entron that orbits in a circle of diameter .lambda./2 at 1.57c in
<br />
the photon's reference frame, with the photon (and its reference frame)
<br />
traveling forward at a speed of c. The result is that the entron
<br />
oscillates with a frequency of 160 times the frequency of the photon
<br />
that the entron inhabits. 
<br />
<br />Neutrinos and Gravity 
<br />
<br />[0010] Neutrinos are very high-energy photons. Each neutrino comprises a
<br />
high-energy, high frequency entron. Neutrinos, like other photons,
<br />
travel in substantially straight lines at the speed of light with its
<br />
entron circling within the photon in circles having a diameter of
<br />
.lambda./2 where .lambda. is the neutrino's wavelength. Most neutrinos
<br />
illuminating the earth pass right through it. Neutrinos can pass right
<br />
through the nuclei of atoms and even protons. Gravity results from the
<br />
Coulomb force fields emanating from neutrinos as the neutrinos pass at
<br />
the speed of light through matter. These Coulomb force fields travel
<br />
rearward and sideways along the trail of neutrinos. The sideways
<br />
components cancel, but the rearward components add pushing the matter
<br />
through which they are passing back toward the source of the neutrinos.
<br />
Thus, neutrinos from the sun passing through the earth (about
<br />
100,000,000 per square centimeter per second) provide the &quot;gravity&quot;
<br />
holding the earth in its orbit around the sun. Neutrinos from the black
<br />
hole in the center of the Milky Way hold all the stars of the Milky Way
<br />
(including our sun) and us in our positions in our galaxy. Neutrinos
<br />
captured in the earth and later released provide the earth its gravity. 
<br />
<br />Electrons 
<br />
<br />[0011] Three entrons (together comprised of a total of three plus
<br />
tronnies and three minus tronnies), one of the entrons being a part of a
<br />
high-energy photon and having a diameter smaller than
<br />
3.2.times.10.sup.-15 m, combine in pair production to produce a pair of
<br />
electrons (a negatron and a positron). The negatron is comprised of a
<br />
plus tronnie orbiting in a tight circle of radius r at a speed of 1.57
<br />
times the speed of light with two minus tronies orbiting around the
<br />
circular path of the plus tronnie, also at radius r, one-fourth period
<br />
behind the plus tronnie. The positron is comprised of a minus tronnie
<br />
and two plus tronnies with their positions reversed from that of the
<br />
negatron. Although tronnies have no mass and as such provide no
<br />
resistance to any applied force, when a tronnie combines with two other
<br />
tronnies to form an electron, the resulting dynamic combination does
<br />
provide a resistance to applied forces. This is the creation of &quot;mass&quot;
<br />
which is substantially stationary &quot;energy&quot;. A plus or minus electrons
<br />
can capture the entron portion of a photon with the entron circling
<br />
behind the electron forming an equilateral cone. The entron propels the
<br />
electron at speeds of about one percent of the speed of light. These
<br />
captured entrons provide the electrons with its &quot;voltage&quot;. Electrons
<br />
(plus and minus) can capture the entron portions of neutrinos, greatly
<br />
increasing the electron's mass/energy. 
<br />
<br />Protons, Neutrons and Atoms 
<br />
<br />[0012] Three very high-energy electrons (one negatron and two positrons,
<br />
each having captured the entron part of a neutrino to increase their
<br />
mass several hundred times) combine to form each proton (with mass 1800
<br />
times the rest mass of an electron). A neutron is a proton with an extra
<br />
negatron with a captured entron propelling it at about one percent of
<br />
the speed of light. This entron has an energy of 0.74 mev (equivalent to
<br />
a mass of 0.0023055.times.10.sup.-27 kg the mass difference between a
<br />
neutron and a proton and an electron). The corresponding diameter of the
<br />
entron is 5.25.times.10.sup.-15 m. In my preferred model of the neutron
<br />
the two tronnies circling behind the negatron driving the negatron at
<br />
speeds of about one percent of the speed of light, also pass through the
<br />
center of the proton part of the neutron. Inside the nucleus of an atom,
<br />
such the deuterium nucleus the two tronnies of the entron pass through
<br />
both protons in the nucleus, holding them together. (The reader should
<br />
note here, no strong force is needed, just an electron and its captured
<br />
entron.) So the nucleus of an atom is (according to my preferred model)
<br />
nothing more than a combination of protons and negatrons (along with a
<br />
variety of entrons) all in dynamic equilibrium. Some specific
<br />
configurations are proposed. There is no &quot;strong&quot; force holding the
<br />
nuclei together. Coulomb forces hold them together. The Coulomb force is
<br />
the only force in the universe. 
<br />
<br />Heat, Temperature and Magnetism 
<br />
<br />[0013] Heat is nothing more than entrons (circling tronnie pairs)
<br />
trapped in matter. Temperature is a measure of that heat. When entrons
<br />
escape matter they do so as photons. Magnetism results when plus and
<br />
minus tronnies travel in large loops (such as through the earth to
<br />
produce its magnetic field or out one pole and in the other pole or
<br />
through a bar magnet or through the center of a current carrying coil of
<br />
wire). 
<br />
<br />Light Speed 
<br />
<br />[0014] Photons in a light beam slow down when passing through a
<br />
Coulombic reference frame (such as a laboratory where light speed is
<br />
being made) moving opposite the beam. And they speed up when the
<br />
reference frame is moving in the same direction of the beam. Based on
<br />
this preferred model, time does not slow down when you go fast and
<br />
things do not get shorter. Simultaneous events are simultaneous in all
<br />
reference frames. Time is absolute. When an astronaut returns to earth
<br />
he and his twin brother can have their next birthday party together at
<br />
the same time. 
<br />
<br />Ross Model Consistent with Other Experimental Results 
<br />
<br />[0015] These are merely examples. This basic model proposed here appears
<br />
to be consistent with all experimental results relating to particle
<br />
physics, chemistry, optics, fusion and fission that I have considered.
<br />
This preferred model can be used to explain radio waves, electric
<br />
current flow, the thermoelectric effects, and the beginning and end of
<br />
the universe. 
<br />
<br />Evolving Model 
<br />
<br />[0016] I admit that some of my explanations are speculative and I am
<br />
sure that people more familiar with particular technologies than I can
<br />
improve on my explanations. When they do I will just modify my model to
<br />
accommodate the better explanations. As is clearly obvious from a review
<br />
of the parent patent applications preceding this one, I have already
<br />
modified my model numerous times since I began developing it about four
<br />
years ago. The model has gotten simpler with each modification. The
<br />
primary difference between the model described in this application and
<br />
the models of the parent applications listed above is the &quot;entron&quot;. The
<br />
energy of the entron corresponds to the net Coulomb integrated forces
<br />
acting between the entron's circling tronnies and this energy
<br />
corresponds to the known photon energy hc/?. The entron also provides
<br />
electrons with their electric energy (their voltage) which they easily
<br />
give up as heat in a resister or as photons in a radio transmitterer. 
<br />
<br />Einstein's Two Major Goofs 
<br />
<br />[0017] The other important discovery disclosed in this application is
<br />
that the vacuum speed of light is not constant, but slows down or speeds
<br />
up, when passing through a Coulombic reference frame, by an amount equal
<br />
to the speed of the reference frame. For example if a Coulombic
<br />
reference frame is moving at a speed of 0.1 c in a direction opposite
<br />
the direction of a light beam, the light beam will slow down to 0.9 c.
<br />
If the reference frame is moving at a speed of 0.2 c in the same
<br />
direction of a light beam passing through it, the light beam will speed
<br />
up to a speed of 1.2 c. So that someone measuring the speed of light
<br />
with equipment moving with the reference frame will measure the speed of
<br />
light as the difference between the (1) the speed of the frame and (2)
<br />
the speed of light. In both cases the measured speed of light will be
<br />
constant at c. Einstein's first major goof was to assume that the speed
<br />
of light was constant based on the results of the Michelson--Morley
<br />
experiments that showed that the &quot;measured&quot; speed of light is always
<br />
constant. This discovery makes some of the most complicated features of
<br />
the Special Theory of Relativity unnecessary. Einstein's second major
<br />
goof was not to recognize that matter-penetrating photons (neutrinos)
<br />
are responsible for gravity. My discovery that neutrinos &quot;carry&quot; gravity
<br />
makes most of the complicated features of General Relativity unnecessary
<br />
if not wrong. Certainly, masses do not curve space. Space is merely the
<br />
emptiness between things--you can't curve it. Space is also infinite in
<br />
all three dimensions and there are only three dimensions: up and down,
<br />
left and right and forward and backwards. Time is not a forth dimension
<br />
time is a measurable period between events. Time is absolute and is not
<br />
affected in the least bit by how fast one is moving.
