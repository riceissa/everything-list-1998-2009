<em class="quotelev1">&gt;set of all possibilities.
</em><br />
<br />...and despite reading the last paragraph several times slowly, I'm afraid I 
<br />
don't understand it. Are you saying there may never be a &quot;next moment&quot; at 
<br />
the point where you are facing near-certain death? It seems to me that all 
<br />
that is required is an observer moment in which (a) you believe that you are 
<br />
you, however this may be defined (it's problematic even in &quot;normal&quot; life 
<br />
what constitutes continuity of identity), and (b) you remember facing the 
<br />
said episode of near-certain death (ncd), and it will seem to you that you 
<br />
have miraculously escaped, even if there is no actual physical connection 
<br />
between the pre-ncd and the post-ncd observer moment. Or, another way to 
<br />
escape is as you have suggested in a more recent post, that there is an 
<br />
observer moment somewhere in the multiverse in which the ncd episode has 
<br />
been somehow deleted from your memory. Perhaps the latter is more likely, in 
<br />
which case you can look forward to never, or extremely rarely, facing ncd in 
<br />
your life.
<br />
<br />It all gets very muddled. If we try to ruthlessly dispense with every 
<br />
derivative, ill-defined, superfluous concept and assumption in an effort to 
<br />
simplify the discussion, the one thing we are left with is the individual 
<br />
observer-moments. We then try to sort these observer-moments into sets which 
<br />
constitute lives, identities, birth, death, amnesia, mind duplication, mind 
<br />
melding, multiple world branchings, and essentially every possible variation 
<br />
on these and other themes. No wonder it's confusing! And who is to judge 
<br />
where a particular individual's identity/life/body/memory begins and ends 
<br />
when even the most detailed, passed by committee of philosophers set of 
<br />
rules fails, as it inevitably will?
<br />
<br />The radical solution is to accept that only the observer-moments are real, 
<br />
and how we sort them then is seen for what it is: essentially arbitrary, a 
<br />
matter of convention. You can dismiss the question of immortality, quantum 
<br />
or otherwise, by observing that the only non-problematic definition of an 
<br />
individual is identification with a single observer-moment, so that no 
<br />
individual can ever &quot;really&quot; live for longer than a moment. Certainly, this 
<br />
goes against intuition, because I feel that I was alive a few minutes ago as 
<br />
well as ten years ago, but *of course* I feel that; this is simply reporting 
<br />
on my current thought processes, like saying I feel hungry or tired, and 
<br />
beyond this cannot be taken as a falsifiable statement about the state of 
<br />
affairs in the real world unless recourse is taken to some arbitrary 
<br />
definition of personal identity, such as would satisfy a court, for example.
<br />
<br />Let me put it a different way. Situation (a) life as usual: I die every 
<br />
moment and a peson is reborn every moment complete with (most) memories and 
<br />
other attributes of the individual who has just died. Situation (b) I am 
<br />
killed instantly, painlessly, with an axe every moment, and a person is 
<br />
reconstituted the next moment complete with (most) memories and other 
<br />
attributes of the individual who has just died, such that he experiences no 
<br />
discontinuity. Aside from the blood and mess in (b), is there a difference? 
<br />
Should I worry more about (b) than (a)? This is of course a commonplace 
<br />
thought experiment on this list, but I draw from it a slightly different 
<br />
conclusion: we all die all the time; death doesn't really matter, otherwise 
<br />
we should all be in a constant panic.
