No(-)Justification Justifies The Everything Ensemble
<br />
Youness Ayaita
<br />
<br /><br /><br />In this message, I present my &quot;no-justification&quot; of the hypothesis
<br />
that everything exists. The no-justification argues that no
<br />
justification at all is needed to accept the hypothesis. This provides
<br />
a new and very satisfying approach to the Everything ensemble.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />1 Hitherto proposed justifications
<br />
<br />In this first section I give a brief overview of some existing
<br />
justifications for the Everything ensemble. The reader familiar with
<br />
the topic  may skip this section.
<br />
<br />Several thinkers have come independently to the hypothesis that---in
<br />
some sense or another---everything exists. The justifications they
<br />
have found in favor of this hypothesis vary as do their intellectual
<br />
backgrounds (philosophy, computer science, mathematics or physics).
<br />
When I myself developed the hypothesis, I found three
<br />
justifications which I call respectively the 'metaphysical approach',
<br />
the 'generalized Copernican principle' and the 'no-justification'. The
<br />
main justifications supported by contributors to the everything-list
<br />
are the 'zero information principle' and 'arithmetical realism' (also
<br />
called 'mathematical Platonism'). Another justification is due to the
<br />
analytic philosopher David Lewis:
<br />
<br />&quot;Why believe in a plurality of worlds?---Because the hypothesis is
<br />
serviceable, and that is a reason to think it is true.&quot;
<br />
<br />For most philosophers Lewis's justification was not convincing. Much
<br />
more attractive to many thinkers is arithmetical realism, assuming the
<br />
objective existence of all mathematical objects. The zero information
<br />
principle bases upon the observation that the Everything has no
<br />
information content. Russell Standish writes:
<br />
<br />&quot;There is a mathematical equivalence between the Everything, as
<br />
represented by this collection of all possible descriptions and
<br />
Nothing, a state of no information.&quot;
<br />
<br />This justification is impressive since it shows that Everything is---
<br />
in some sense---not more than Nothing. It thus provides a striking
<br />
argument against the critics' objection that supporters of the
<br />
Everything ensemble postulate too much additional ontology.
<br />
<br />As a last example, I mention the generalized Copernican principle. The
<br />
idea is to give up the categorical difference between our world and
<br />
all other possible worlds: Everything is equally real.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />2 Remarks on new fundamental theories
<br />
<br />Before starting to explain my no-justification of the Everything
<br />
ensemble, I want to summarize some important statements in advance
<br />
which concern all new fundamental theories. Taking seriously the
<br />
approach given by the no-justification, it will turn out that the term
<br />
&quot;Everything exists&quot; is logically meaningless. Nonetheless I'll still
<br />
use the term without questioning its outstanding significance. The
<br />
only thing that changes is the term's role within our thinking. It
<br />
will no longer be an integral part of the fundamental theory, but
<br />
merely a link from the fundamental theory to our 'everyday theory'.
<br />
<br />As a typical example of such a relation may serve Einstein's theory of
<br />
general relativity. The concept of mass---or to be more precise, the
<br />
energy-momentum tensor---is no integral part of general relativity, it
<br />
is replaced by the curvature of spacetime. Einstein's famous field
<br />
equations that relate the curvature of spacetime to the energy-
<br />
momentum tensor, are thus meaningless insofar as they only 'define'
<br />
the energy-momentum tensor. In principle, we could abandon the concept
<br />
of mass and energy and use the curvature tensor instead. So, would the
<br />
theory of general relativity lose anything if we removed Enstein's
<br />
field equations? The answer to this question is twofold. As a
<br />
mathematical theory, general relativity would remain complete and as
<br />
rich as it is today. But as a physical theory it would lose its
<br />
meaning, i.e. it would lose its explanatory and predictive power. This
<br />
is because a mathematical theory (in the case of general relativity:
<br />
Spacetime is a smooth 4-manifold with a metric tensor and such and
<br />
such properties) does not give a physical interpretation by itself.
<br />
The term &quot;physical interpretation&quot; means that we have a procedure how
<br />
to interpret elements of the theory as elements of our everyday
<br />
theory. A physical interpretation serves as translation from the
<br />
theory's mathematical language to our concrete everyday language.
<br />
<br />Einstein's field equations link general relativity (with the curvature
<br />
of spacetime) to special relativity (with the energy-momentum tensor)
<br />
which is itself linked to Newtonian mechanics (with the usual concept
<br />
of mass and Euclidian space). Newtonian mechanics is understood in the
<br />
everyday theory. We see from this that Einstein's field equations are
<br />
part of the physical interpretation in the sense described above.
<br />
<br />The everyday theory, of course, is only a vague concept that allows us
<br />
to exchange information about events in the world that surrounds us.
<br />
Though, it is not clearly defined.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />3 No-justification
<br />
<br />The no-justification is the most satisfying justification for the
<br />
Everything ensemble I know. I even think that a more satisfying
<br />
justification is impossible in principle. So what is it about? The
<br />
crucial point is to try to get to the bottom of our understanding of
<br />
'existence'. In our everyday theory we use 'existence' as a property:
<br />
Some things 'exist', whereas other (imaginable) things don't. The
<br />
origin of this practice lies in very pragmatic reasons. It makes sense
<br />
to separate things that are 'accessible in principle' from things that
<br />
are not. This relation between 'us' and 'things which are accessible
<br />
in principle for us' was falsely understood as an objective property
<br />
of those things. I feel Wittgenstein's hands slapping on my back when
<br />
I tell you that 'existence' is nothing else than a linguistic
<br />
confusion. Strictly speaking, the concept of 'existence' doesn't make
<br />
sense. I encourage you to abandon it. If we take the right point of
<br />
view, the problem of having to find a &quot;theory of everything&quot; doesn't
<br />
occur.
<br />
<br />The amazing result of these simple considerations is that we get the
<br />
Everything ensemble gratis! We don't need any postulate. But how is
<br />
this transition made? At this point I remind you of the second section
<br />
of this article: The Everything ensemble, or the statement that
<br />
everything exists, is the interpretation of our new perspective in the
<br />
everyday theory. In our everyday theory, we use the concept of
<br />
'existence' as a property of things. A property p is given by the
<br />
ensemble of (imaginable) things that have that property. Thus we can
<br />
identify the property p with the ensemble of (imaginable) things
<br />
having that property.
<br />
<br />The no-justification argues that it doesn't make sense to introduce
<br />
'existence' as a property, or expressed in another way, that it is not
<br />
possible to meaningfully separate (imaginable) things that have the
<br />
(hypothetic) property that they 'exist' from (imaginable) things
<br />
without that property. This leaves us with two options if we still
<br />
want to use the concept of existence given by the everyday theory:
<br />
that the ensemble of (imaginable) things is empty or that every
<br />
(imaginable) thing has the property that it exists. The property is
<br />
degenerate, it does not separate some (imaginable) things from others.
<br />
Since, in our everyday theory, we say that things surrounding us
<br />
exist, we must consequently take the second option: that every
<br />
(imaginable) thing has the property that it exists. This is the
<br />
Everything ensemble. I repeat that the statement &quot;everything exists&quot;
<br />
can be seen as a definition of the new (and degenerate!) property of
<br />
existence: for an imaginable thing, to exist doesn't mean anything
<br />
else than being an  imaginable thing. From our new perspective, it's a
<br />
tautology. But it is the interpretation of the new perspective in the
<br />
everyday theory.
<br />
<br />In this last paragraph it can be seen that the no-justification has a
<br />
lot in common with the zero information principle. I wrote that, if we
<br />
want to introduce the property of existence, than this property must
<br />
be degenerate (given by no entity or given by the ensemble of all
<br />
entities). In other words, there cannot be any information separating
<br />
some entities that exist from other entities that don't.
