<br />
Dear Folks,
<br />
<br />Once again I find myself fossicking at the boundaries and need to ask
<br />
one of those questions. My first experience with an asker of such a
<br />
question was in  the last couple of years at high school. I'll tell
<br />
you about it because, well, the list could use a little activity and I
<br />
hope the 'fabric' list doesn't mind the rather voluminous joining
<br />
post. The story:
<br />
<br />Person X raises his hand in class and the question is asked. The most
<br />
insanely stupid question. At least that's what it appeared to be to
<br />
most of the class. Snicker. Guffaw. Snicker. Rhubarb. Rhubarb. A
<br />
mexican wave of derision filters through the pubescent ranks. That
<br />
wave didn't get past me. I looked at person X across the room. Yes, on
<br />
the face of it that question was the pathetic pleading of the
<br />
apparently brain dead. Yet I knew it could not be. For person X was
<br />
one of those kids that got scarily high marks.  I knew that the
<br />
question had answered something far deeper for person X than the
<br />
shallow meanderings of the distinterested that formed the rest of the
<br />
class sitting in judgement. And none of them would ever realise that.
<br />
<br />That's the stupid question story. Now for the apparently stupid
<br />
question, which I'll pose in 2 parts. The first part is a little
<br />
background. For those of you who subscribe to the PSYCHE lists, you
<br />
will have seen my recent question &quot;Exploded Brain Mary&quot; on PSYCHE-D.
<br />
This question is in pursuit of understanding of a topic not apparent
<br />
in the question and I'm afraid I can't go into detail. It's about
<br />
resolving the bottom layer of a speculative model for qualia.
<br />
<br />Now this model is around 11 layers deep. It's a very detailed model
<br />
and I'm going to do my best to bring it into the public eye for
<br />
scrutiny in due course. Somehow. Suggestions anyone? There is no way I
<br />
can possibly bring you all up to speed on the whole thing but I can
<br />
say that I have hit a final wall of mystery which appears to suggest
<br />
something that may be true about consciousness that may be the
<br />
'fundamental' bedrock. Something that is breathtakingly simple yet so
<br />
odd I am here to ask you folks to see what I see. To see where it
<br />
leads. I really don't know if it's well trodden ground or not.
<br />
<br />The second part is 2C Mary. This is a small thought experiment
<br />
designed to illustrate as simply as I can the possibility for a
<br />
mechanism for access to apparently physics-violating phenomena. Those
<br />
interested in philosophy of mind will recognise that poor
<br />
neuroscientist Mary has been the subject of many a thought experiment
<br />
and she has acquiesced to appalling things in the name of science.
<br />
This one is no different!
<br />
<br />Let's get rid of Mary's brain completely. A radical brainectomy. We
<br />
are going to replace it with two particles. Each particle is
<br />
travelling at the speed of light, C, but in perfectly opposing
<br />
directions. The distance between them is growing at a speed of 2C. Now
<br />
nothing is actually moving at 2C and all is well for physics.
<br />
<br />The real question is the ontological status of the 'nothing' in that
<br />
last sentence. I am starting to believe that the true nature of the
<br />
'fundamental' beneath qualia is not only about the 'stuff', but is
<br />
actually about all of it. That is, the 'stuff' and the 'not stuff'. If
<br />
you think of Mary, she actually has 3 things in her brain. She has 2
<br />
particles doing something and one extra thing defined by their
<br />
behaviour. The behaviour of a mathematical line between the two
<br />
centres of mass of the particles. What argument removes that third
<br />
'thing' from Mary as an (cognitive) entity occupying our universe? I
<br />
find I can no longer dismiss this third thing.
<br />
<br />Now the relationship - the causal chain - between what I have
<br />
described and the qualia model is not easy to deduce. You'll have to
<br />
accept for the moment that there is one. The reason I need to explore
<br />
this is that I have identified what I think is a form of apparent
<br />
non-locality accessible by simply 'being' part of the universe, and
<br />
it's like the same form of access to physics violation that 2C Mary
<br />
gets.
<br />
<br />Why do I need this? Without going into detail, it possibly supplies
<br />
the answer to 'Exploded Brain Mary' that seems intuitively right yet
<br />
so bizarre, to me, anyway. It's the basis for solving the so-called
<br />
'unity of consciousness' issue, which, if this goes anywhere at all
<br />
will simply evaporate as a non-problem and no actual unity at all.
<br />
<br />The nature of the thought process that has been plaguing me for the
<br />
last few weeks has slowly found its way to a question of the form I
<br />
have just outlined. I suppose what I am asking is -
<br />
<br />Has anyone else been down this road? Is it a road at all?
<br />
<br />So many times I find I am walking in footsteps and only lack the
<br />
descriptor to find prior art.
<br />
<br />In closure, I'd like to support the general way of thinking about
<br />
this. A cloud is as much defined by what it is as what it is not. All
<br />
'reality' as we describe it, has two halves. We have been so
<br />
preoccupied with what 'is', we (presumptuous here, sorry. Set me
<br />
straight, please) have completely missed it's opposite. Turn
<br />
everything inside out. Imagine that the only 'reality' is the
<br />
processes involved by the universe in actively constructing what we
<br />
_don't_ consider matter. Keep in mind that if we 'be' any portion of
<br />
the universe we have to be all of it -  Everything contributed by what
<br />
is and every 'thing' incidentally created by being that very stuff,
<br />
the 'things' that are 'not' that stuff. These are ontologically
<br />
equivalent, I think. We don't even have the language for this. P+ for
<br />
'phenomena stuff' and P- for not-stuff? The qualia model calls it
<br />
'inverse phenomenology'.
<br />
<br />Posing the question at all has been useful. I don't know if anyone
<br />
else out there can do anything but start considering what it may mean
<br />
(other than perhaps colin should be on medication!). This is all I can
<br />
ask - have a think. If anyone wants to put the idea to death in some
<br />
cogent fashion I'd appreciate it! It'll save me a lot of time.
<br />
Resolution is my goal. Either way is OK with me.
<br />
<br />The nice thing about this, after roughly 10 layers of classical,
<br />
already-described-physics is that this is the only thing left. It
<br />
makes qualia beautiful. An 'elemental quale' appear to be a
<br />
destructive and energetic collision between P+ and P-, as I described.
<br />
Beautiful but rather mundane, if the model holds up OK. All the
<br />
model's layers point an arrow at this one thing I have described. I am
<br />
at the end and I find... Nothing or rather, &quot;NOT thing&quot;. It is why I
<br />
am here, asking my stupid question.
<br />
<br />So. Anyone care to comment on the ontological status of 'not thing'?
<br />
<br />Regardless, it's been fun writing this.
<br />
<br />cheers,
<br />
<br />Colin Hales
