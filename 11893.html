<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; The novelty is invisible to the zombie, who has the internal

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; life of a dreamless sleep. The reason it is invisible is

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; because there is no phenomenal consciousness. The zombie
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; has only sensory data to use to do science. There are an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; infinite number of ways that same sensory data could arrive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; from an infinity of external natural world situtations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; The sensory data is ambiguous - it's all the same - action
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; potential pulse trains traveling from sensors to brain.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Stathis:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; All I have to work on is sensory data also.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No you don't! You have an entire separate set of perceptual/experiential
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fields constructed from sensory feeds. The fact of this is proven - think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of hallucination. When the senory data gets overidden by the internal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; imagery (schizophrenia). Sensing is NOT our perceptions. It is these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; latter phenomenal fields that you consciously work from as a scientist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not the sensory feeds. This seems to be a recurring misunderstanding or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something people seem to be struggling with. It feels like its coming from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your senses but it's all generated inside your head.

</em><br />
OK, I'll revise my claim: all I have to work with is perceptions which I assume are 
<br />
coming from sense data which I assume is coming from the real world impinging on 
<br />
my sense organs. The same is true of a machine which receives environmental 
<br />
input and processes it. At the processing stage, this is the equivalent of perception. 
<br />
The processor assumes that the information it is processing originates from sensors 
<br />
which are responding to real world stimuli, but it has no way of knowing if the data 
<br />
actually arose from spontaneous or externally induced activity at any point from the 
<br />
sensors, transducers, conductors, or components of the processor itself: whether 
<br />
they are hallucinations, in fact. There might be some clue that it is not a legitimate 
<br />
sensory feed, but if the halllucination is perfect it is by definition impossible to detect. 

<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I can't be certain that there is a &quot;real world&quot; out there, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; even if there is, all I can possibly do is create a virtual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; reality in my head which correlates with the patterns of sense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; data I receive.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes - the &quot;virtual reality&quot; is the collection of phenomenal scenes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mentioned above .... is what you use to learn from, not the sense data.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Put more accurately - you learn things that are consistent with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; phenomenal scenes. There is a tendency in some circles to think of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness as an epiphenomenal irrelevance, devoid of causal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; efficacy... I would disagree in that it's causal efficacy is in CHANGE of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; belief (learning), not the holding of static belief. Scientific behaviour
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is all about changing belief.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality of the external world? It doesn't matter what you believe about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the existence or otherwise of 'reality'. Whatever &quot;it&quot; is, we have an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a-priori tool for perceiving it that is a phenomenon. i.e. Phenomenality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is a real world phenomenon just as real as a rock. Leave the reality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discussion to the campfire.

</em><br />
OK, let's avoid that thankless discussion...

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Whatever 'reality' is, it is regular/persistent/repeatable/stable enough
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to do science on it via our phenomenality and come up with laws that seem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to characterise how it will appear to us in our phenomenality.

</em><br />
You could say: my perceptions are regular/persistent/repeatable/stable enough 
<br />
to assume an external reality generating them and to do science on. And if a 
<br />
machine's central processor's perceptions are similarly regular/persistent/
<br />
repeatable/stable, it could also do science on them. The point is, neither I nor 
<br />
the machine has any magical knowledge of an external world. All we have is 
<br />
regularities in perceptions, which we assume to be originating from the external 
<br />
world because that's a good model which stands up no matter what we throw at it. 

<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Certainly, it is ambiguous, and that is why we have science: we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; come up with a model or hypothesis consistent with the sense data,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; then we look for more sense data to test it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You describe scientific behaviour...yes, but the verification is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; through sense data but through phenomenal fields. The phenomenal fields
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are NOT the sense data. Phenomenal fields can be ambiguous, yes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Scientific procedure deals with that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ..but..
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The sense data is separate and exquisitely ambiguous and we do not look
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for sense data to verify scientific observations! We look for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perceptual/phenomenal data. Experiences. Maybe this is yet another
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; terminological issue. Sensing is not perception.

</em><br />
If the perception is less ambiguous that the sense data, that is a false certainty. 

<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Any machine which looks for regularities in sensory feeds
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; does the same thing. Are you saying that such a machine could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; not find the regularities or that if it did find the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; regularities it would thereby be conscious?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am saying the machine can find regularity in the sensory feeds - easily.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is does so does not mean it is conscious. It does not mean it has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; access to the external matural world.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ..and that is not what WE do....we find regularity in the perceptual fields.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Looking for regularity in sensory data is totally different process fro
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; looking for regularity in a perceptual field. Multiple sensory feeds can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lead to the same perceptual field. Multiple perceptual fields can arise
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; out of the same sensory feeds. No matter how weird it sounds our brains
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can map sensory fields to the world outside...The sensory data is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intrinsically ambiguous and not about the external world, but the world at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the location of the transduction that created the sensory measurent. And
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an indirect transduction at that (a retinal cone protein isomerisation by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a red photon is not a 'red photon experience' it is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; protein-isomerisation experience  - ie no experience at all!)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I had no idea people were so confused about the distinction between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sensing and perception. I hope I am helping.

</em><br />
It's an important distinction, but I think it is more complex than the dichotomy 
<br />
sensing/perception suggests. There are multiple stages from the interface 
<br />
between the environment and the sensory organ and the ultimate perception, 
<br />
and some processing of the signal occurs at each stage: nerve ganglia, the 
<br />
thalamus, various cortical levels. What we normally call &quot;consciousness&quot; seems 
<br />
to occur at the highest level of processing, but that may just be because that 
<br />
highest level is the dictator with ultimate control over, for example, what my 
<br />
hands are typing at the moment. Phenomena such as blindsight and the 
<br />
appearance of consciousness in other animals with less complex brains at least 
<br />
raise the possibility that some sort of consciousness/perception may be ocuuring 
<br />
at lower levels of processing in the nervous system, maybe all the way down to 
<br />
ganglia. Of course, ganglia don't come up with scientific theories, but this may not 
<br />
be because they are unable to perceive but simply because they lack sufficient 
<br />
processing power. Dogs don't come up with scientific theories either, and most 
<br />
people think that is because dogs are not smart enough rather than because they 
<br />
are not conscious. Similarly, our current machines may be able to &quot;perceive&quot; at a 
<br />
basic level, but they aren't smart enough to come up with scientific theories based 
<br />
on their perceptions.
