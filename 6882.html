<br />Actually, he couldn't say why the result came out the way it did.  His

part in the experiment.  After which Stapp modified his views somewhat.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;demonstration like this, that's when I'll start taking these claims

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;seriously, until then &quot;extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;(snip)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;The issue is not the Z score in isolation, it's 1) whether we trust that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;the correct statistical analysis has been done on the data to obtain that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Z score (whether reporting bias has been eliminated, for example)--that's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;why I suggested the test of trying to transmit a 10-digit number using 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;ESP, which would be a lot more transparent--and 2) whether we trust that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;the possibility of cheating has been kept small enough, which as the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;article I linked to suggested, may not have been met in the PEAR results:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;&quot;Suspicions have hardened as sceptics have looked more closely at the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;fine detail of Jahn's results. Attention has focused on the fact that one 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;of the experimental subjects - believed actually to be a member of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;PEAR lab staff - is almost single-handedly responsible for the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;significant results of the studies. It was noted as long ago as 1985, in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;a report to the US Army by a fellow parapsychologist, John Palmer of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Durham University, North Carolina, that one subject - known as operator 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;10 - was by far the best performer. This trend has continued. On the most 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;recently available figures, operator 10 has been involved in 15 percent 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;of the 14 million trials yet contributed a full half of the total excess 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;hits. If this person's figures are taken out of the data pool, scoring in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;the &quot;low intention&quot; condition falls to chance while &quot;high intention&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;scoring drops close to the .05 boundary considered weakly significant in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;scientific results.
</em><br />
<br />First, you're right about that set of the PEAR results, but operator 10 was 
<br />
involved in the original anomalies experiments---she was not involved in 
<br />
the remote viewing (as I understand).  But p&lt;0.05 is &quot;weakly&quot; 
<br />
significant?  Hm. It was good enough for Fisher. . .it's good enough for 
<br />
the courts (Daubert).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;&quot;Sceptics like James Alcock and Ray Hyman say naturally it is a serious 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;concern that PEAR lab staff have been acting as guinea pigs in their own 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;experiments. But it becomes positively alarming if one of the staff - 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;with intimate knowledge of the data recording and processing procedures - 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;is getting most of the hits.
</em><br />
<br />I agree, but again, I don't think Operator 10 was involved in all the 
<br />
experiments. Have any of these skeptics tried to replicate?  I believe Ray 
<br />
Hyman is an Oregon State English Prof, so he probably couldn't replicate 
<br />
some of the PEAR lab work, but surely there are others who could.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;&quot;Alcock says t(snip) . . . distort Jahn's results. &quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;If Hyman and Alcock believe Jahn et al were cheating, then they shouldn't 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;mince words; instead, they should file a complaint with Princeton.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Of course, both these concerns would be present in any statistical test, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;even one involving something like the causes of ulcers like in the quote 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;you posted above, but here I would use a Bayesian approach and say that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;we should start out with some set of prior probabilities, then update 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;them based on the data. Let's say that in both the tests for ulcer causes 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;and the tests for ESP our estimate of the prior probability for either 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;flawed statistical analysis or cheating on the part of the experimenters 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;is about the same. But based on what we currently know about the way the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;world works, I'd say the prior probability of ESP existing should be far, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;far lower than the prior probability that ulcers are caused by bacteria. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;It would be extremely difficult to integrate ESP into what we currently 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;know about the laws of physics and neurobiology. If someone can propose a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;reasonable theory of how it could work without throwing everything else 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;we know out the window, then that could cause us to revise these priors 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;and see ESP as less of an &quot;extraordinary claim&quot;, but I don't know of any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;good proposals (Sarfatti's seems totally vague on the precise nature of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;the feedback loop between the pilot wave and particles, for example, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;on how this would relate to ESP phenomena...if he could provide a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;mathematical model or simulation showing how a simple brain-like system 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;could influence the outcome of random quantum events in the context of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;his theory, then it'd be a different story).
</em><br />
<br />A couple of observations. . .
<br />
1. We don't really know the prior probabilities, hence the Bayesian 
<br />
approach might not be the best. Bayesian analysis starts with assumptions 
<br />
and works great when the assumptions are correct.  It doesn't work so great 
<br />
if the assumptions are false.  Besides, I've always been suspicious of any 
<br />
great statistical theory attributed to a reclusive minister and published 
<br />
well after he's no longer around to explain how he came up with it.
<br />
2. We don't really know how the world works, but we have a model and ESP 
<br />
doesn't happen to fit it very well.
<br />
3. ESP typically refers to some form of &quot;clairvoyance&quot;, which doesn't 
<br />
accurately describe, say, the retro pk experiments, and only vaguely 
<br />
describes Sheldrake's work.  So, rejection of clairvoyance experiments 
<br />
shouldn't be a reason to reject all the others.
<br />
4. Did you really meant to say &quot;laws of physics and neurobiology?&quot;  That's 
<br />
pretty Newtonian-sounding, and itself a handwave of such weirdness as 
<br />
entanglement (when was *that* law passed. . .and *who* passed it???) As for 
<br />
neuro, we're learning new and weird things all the time.  We observe a 
<br />
complex array of evidence and fit it into a model.  Sometimes the model is 
<br />
predictive, and that's fine.  But where we go wrong is assuming the model 
<br />
is the system, and that anything not fitting the model is &quot;incorrect&quot; or in 
<br />
violation of the system (break these laws of physics and neurobiology at 
<br />
your peril!)  Some things don't fit the model, and that's all I'm 
<br />
proposing---exploring some of these outliers to see if it makes sense vis a 
<br />
vis a new decoherence model.  Of course, if we uncover cheating in any of 
<br />
the aforementioned experiments, we should have the guilty parties arrested 
<br />
and jailed in a dry cell.
<br />
5. Most scientists ask for the model first, and the experiment later.  I 
<br />
suggest this might not be the best way to uncover truth, or even flaws in 
<br />
the original model.  I;m not a big fan of the crop circle business, and 
<br />
don't plan to defend either side--but it seems that the issue is poison to 
<br />
scientists--besides being scared to death of being characterized as &quot;three 
<br />
or four sigs out from the mean&quot; most of them can't fit crop circles into 
<br />
any kind of previous model (other than college kids with boards and great 
<br />
math skills stamping down barley in the middle of the night.  In fog.)  So, 
<br />
there seems to be a reticence for scientists to study something when (a) 
<br />
there's no grant money available and (b) there's no prior model to fall 
<br />
back onto.
<br />
<br />Bottom line, science is very good about being conservative (which is fine), 
<br />
but not very good about discovering anything outside the model (which is bad.)
