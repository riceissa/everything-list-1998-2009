<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Such definitions of &quot;causality&quot; seem to miss the point that

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; every event has mulitple causes and constraints and that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any one of them is neither necessary nor sufficient.  As
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; commonly used &quot;the cause&quot; is something(s) we consider could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have been otherwise.  Heavy rains may be rare and so it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; easy to suppose their absence.  In that case we would say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; heavy rains caused the flooding.  But if you lived where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; heavy rains were the rule, you'd more likely say something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like, &quot;The flooding was caused by insufficient foresight in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; providing drainage.&quot;
</em><br />
<br />Yes, in this case probably the better statement would be &quot;heavy rains
<br />
with insufficient drainage cause flooding&quot;.  Things can have more than
<br />
one cause.  In practice the difficulty seems to be to distinguish the
<br />
irrelevant from the relevant aspects.
<br />
<br />I think what is necessary is to go from the specific and concrete
<br />
events to an abstraction which represents an entire category of events.
<br />
In any given instance of flooding, everything contributes in a sense.
<br />
If a particular stone were located somewhere else, the details of
<br />
the flooding would be different.  But if we look at flooding as an
<br />
abstraction, then we can identify other aspects which are associated
<br />
with the set of events that the abstraction covers.
<br />
<br />You still have the problem of distinguishing correlation from causation,
<br />
but at least this allows you to identify possible causative factors.
<br />
And in general there will be more than one.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Some physicists (Hartle, Penrose, Gell-Mann) regard quantum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mechanics as defining an arrow of time more basic than the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; statistical increase of entropy.  This QM AoT is defined by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the decoherence or 'collapse of the wave function'.  I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suppose the splitting of MW would be the same. However,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bohm's QM is deterministic and doesn't have this QM AoT
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even though it gives the same predictions as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non-relativistic QM. 
</em><br />
<br />I believe the Huw Price book I mentioned argued that this arrow of
<br />
time is not really fundamental, but rather is due to the low entropy
<br />
of the initial conditions.  Particularly if you look at it from the
<br />
MWI perspective, in equilibrium there will be as many merges of worlds
<br />
(or &quot;branches&quot;) as splits.
<br />
<br /><br />Regarding causality and consciousness:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't see how a concept of causality can solve this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conundrum.  The 'computation' can be causal and yet so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simple that the mapping still does all the work.
</em><br />
<br />Well, the mapping problem is independent of the causality issue.
<br />
Both problems have to be solved in some way.  Most people dismiss the
<br />
mapping issue by assuming that one can simply rule out mappings that are
<br />
&quot;too complex&quot;.  I don't think it is that easy.  But even if you did have
<br />
a way of solving this, you still have the issue of replays versus truly
<br />
causal systems.  You still have to deal with the fact that causality
<br />
seems to play a role in defining what is real.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the answer lies in embedding computation within an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; environment.  The reason the mapping can apparently do all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the work is because it is all at a symbolic level.  If you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; imagine building a robot, the the 'brain' of the robot must
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do computation taking information from sensors and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; producing signals to actuators. Then it seems the question
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of whether the robot has done a computation has operational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaning and the conundrum doesn't arise. 
</em><br />
<br />I've seen similar suggestions but they never make sense to me.  Can't we
<br />
provide a simulated brain with a simulated environment?  A similar thing
<br />
was done in the movie The Matrix, except in that case real brains were
<br />
put into a simulated environment.  Imagine something like The Matrix
<br />
but with computer simulations of human brains.  Then you have brain[s]
<br />
plus environment all running in a featureless gray box of a computer.
<br />
You still have to answer the question of whether the computer has minds
<br />
in it or not, so you still need to make a mapping.  I don't see that
<br />
introducing an environment has helped at all to solve the problem.
