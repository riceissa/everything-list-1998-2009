<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Actually this particular quote seems to present consciousness as the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ontological counterpart to the epistemological &quot;fundamental 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; psychology&quot;, just as matter is considered the ontological counterpart 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to epistemological &quot;fundamental physics&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So &quot;psychology&quot; is our way of thinking about consciousness, just as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;physics&quot; is our way of thinking about matter.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So the statement &quot;...physics is...reducible to psychology&quot; is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; basically saying &quot;our way of thinking about matter is reducible to our 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way of thinking about consciousness&quot;, or &quot;physics is reducible to our 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way of thinking about consciousness&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />No No. I mean by (correct) physics the (correct) laws predicting or 
<br />
even explaining our most probable history, and this by remaining 
<br />
invariant through that history. Today it is believed that it is Quantum 
<br />
Mechanic (under the form of Standard Model, String Theory or Loop 
<br />
gravity) A priori it could be completely independent of our way of 
<br />
thinking about anything. And I believe it is so. And with comp it is so 
<br />
because the laws of physics are given by a type of statistics on 
<br />
(&quot;turing machine&quot;, i.e. mathematical) computations, which are as 
<br />
independent of ourselves as the elementary arithmetical truth can be.
<br />
This influences &quot;our way of thinking&quot; as much as our ways of thinking 
<br />
will filters possible first person realities.
<br />
I f you want I am a Platonist even about Physics. It is just that I 
<br />
don't believe (playing the game of believing or assuming comp) that 
<br />
Physics describes a primitive reality. With comp the laws of physics 
<br />
and the physical world's emerges from a purely mathematical statistics 
<br />
bearing on a notion of &quot;first person&quot; computation. And this notion can 
<br />
be made purely mathematical. And so the comp hyp is made entirely 
<br />
testable. And then I have tested it and comp succeeds the first main 
<br />
test in the sense it predicts a non boolean statistics having some 
<br />
quantum features (including the most important one giving rise to some 
<br />
arithmetical interpretation of quantum logic).
<br />
Bell's inequality Violation? many evidence for, but still open problem
<br />
Laws of physics are completely reversible? idem
<br />
Quantum cloning? idem
<br />
Quantum computing? idem.
<br />
Most of those questions can easily been &quot;asked to a self-observing 
<br />
Lobian machine&quot;, and it can be proved that for those question the 
<br />
machine knows and can communicate the answer, but currently they are 
<br />
non-tractable. Normally one of those logic must be intractable and 
<br />
``quantum speedable&quot; (the one which *is* physics, in a sense).
<br />
<br />I reduce physics not so much on consciousness, but on theoretical 
<br />
computer science.
<br />
What can machine proves and guess about their 
<br />
(first-person-UD-accessible) consistent extensions. I could argue that 
<br />
consciousness is a sort of bet there is a &quot;model&quot; of oneself, a world.
<br />
<br />(Note that logicians use the word &quot;Model&quot; in an opposite sense of the 
<br />
physicist's usage. Logicians use the term &quot;model&quot; in the same sense as 
<br />
the painters: &quot;model&quot; is for (intended) &quot;realities&quot; we always describe 
<br />
or capture partially by our theories (painting). it is better to use 
<br />
the word &quot;world&quot; probably, or even just observer-moment?)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Tom&gt;&gt; Is not your use of the word &quot;discourse&quot;, even though it is a &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;correct-by-definition discourse&quot;, and also your use of the words &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;observable&quot; and &quot;verifiable&quot;, meant to portray something that can be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; observed by, imagined by, and encoded into our consciousness?  So is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; not your assumption that we can fit this &quot;fundamental/perfect 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; into our consciousness? 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno&gt;&gt; Yes if by &quot;our&quot; you refer to the lobian machines. But if you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mean by it &quot;human&quot; then it is a big anthropomorphism. Also I avoid the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; term &quot;consciousness&quot;. Eventually consciousness will be linked to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; automatic (unconscious!) inference of self-consistency from some 1 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person point of view. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Tom: I guess I'll have to ponder this more.  In general I am 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; uncomfortable with having terms like &quot;physics&quot; and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;psychology/consciousness&quot; defined (redefined?) later on in an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argument rather than at the beginning.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />That is a little bit curious because in SANE I *exceptionally* do give 
<br />
the &quot;new&quot; definitions at the beginning. And this asks me a specially 
<br />
hard effort. My initial goal was just to help people to understand by 
<br />
themselves that the &quot;mind-body problem&quot; is NOT YET solved. I did say 
<br />
&quot;universal dovetailer paradox&quot; instead of &quot;universal dovetailer 
<br />
argument&quot;. Same for the movie graph. I just ask questions in succession 
<br />
and if you say yes at each steps you get the conclusion. Like always in 
<br />
logic, making a paradox precise makes you get a theorem.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  In such a setting, I find it very difficult (impossible?) to get a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; grasp of what your hypotheses are.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />It is the hypothesis that we are machines. It is as old as machines. It 
<br />
is discussed in the &quot;question of Milinda&quot; which relates some shock 
<br />
waves between India and Greece on fundamental question after Plato. It 
<br />
is discussed in Plato, ..., Descartes (at least for animals!), Hobbes 
<br />
(after understanding a proof in geometry), La Mettrie who will 
<br />
aggravate the confusion between materialism and mechanism, etc.  
<br />
Leibnitz is close also.
<br />
But after Godel and Turing, and Post, the meaning of the word &quot;machine&quot; 
<br />
*has* changed.
<br />
And &quot;my hypothesis&quot; is the same as Post, Turing and is well described 
<br />
in the book of Webb for example (ref in my thesis). It is a &quot;digital&quot; 
<br />
version of Mechanism. And it is just the hypothesis that there exists a 
<br />
level of description of myself such that &quot;I survive&quot; a digital 
<br />
substitution at that level.
<br />
(It is NOT the hypothesis that there is a universe and that the 
<br />
universe is a computational object! Actually comp makes this 
<br />
impossible).
<br />
It can be argued that Quantum Mechanics implies comp, and my theorem is 
<br />
that assuming comp you can and must deduce Quantum mechanics (or the 
<br />
&quot;correct physics&quot;) from it.
<br />
<br />Now I am not sure what exactly you don't grasp in the hypotheses. To 
<br />
make comp precise, and to avoid unecessary objections I make it clear 
<br />
that I bet also on the elementary arithmetical truth (1+1 = 2, 
<br />
no-biggest -primes, Fermat theorem, etc.), and Church thesis (which is 
<br />
not trivial!).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In parallel, I guess I have another question:  It seems that in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; UDA you artificially limit all of physics to be the solution to one 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particular thought experiment.  This seems narrow to me.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />But all *theorems* are particular thought experiments.
<br />
<br />And *this* thought experiment explains how &quot;all physics&quot; is related to 
<br />
the only clear notion of &quot;everything&quot; I ever met, which is the 
<br />
collection of partial computable function, which is closed for the most 
<br />
transcendental operation ever discovered by mathematician: 
<br />
Cantor-KLeene-Godel diagonalization.
<br />
<br />And that theorem (or that reasoning if you prefer) shows comp is 
<br />
testable. (And a non trivial test has been made).
<br />
