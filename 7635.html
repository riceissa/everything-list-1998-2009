Le 17-juil.-05, à 11:12, Stathis Papaioannou a écrit :
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, it's obvious. Bruno, if only everything you said were so obvious!
</em><br />
<br /><br />(I was asking if the proposition: &lt;For all number x,  if x is bigger 
<br />
than 2 then x is bigger than 1.&gt; is obvious).    Bigger = strictly 
<br />
bigger, to be sure.
<br />
<br />I am pleased you find the propositions obvious. Thanks to Stephen 
<br />
assessing that obviousness too. Logicians and mathematicians are trying 
<br />
hard to make their reasoning decomposable in steps as obvious as this 
<br />
one, at least in principle.
<br />
<br />Now, Logicians like puzzles, paradoxes and traps, and you could have 
<br />
guessed that if I ask a such &quot;obvious&quot; question, perhaps it is not so 
<br />
obvious after all.
<br />
<br />And, actually, you illustrate very well my point. You will see why.
<br />
<br />I guess you agree that if I say &lt;For all number x, the property P(x) is 
<br />
true&gt; where x is supposed to be a natural number, it means that P(0) is 
<br />
true, P(1) is true, P(2) is true, P(3) is true, P(4) is true, P(5) is 
<br />
true, etc.
<br />
<br />Now *you* tell me that &lt;For all number x,  if x is bigger than 2 then x 
<br />
is bigger than 1&gt; is obvious, and thus this means you agree that:
<br />
<br />if 0 is bigger than 2 then 0 is bigger than 1,    (line 1)
<br />
if 1 is bigger than 2 then 1 is bigger than 1,    (line 2)
<br />
if 2 is bigger than 2 then 2 is bigger than 1,    (line 3)
<br />
if 3 is bigger than 2 then 3 is bigger than 1,    (line 4)
<br />
etc.
<br />
<br />So apparently you find obvious that if 0 is bigger than 2 then 0 is 
<br />
bigger than 1.
<br />
<br />But then,  why do you ask me in your other post? :
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Bruno:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I suppose you know some classical logic:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (p &amp; q) is true if both p and q is true, else it is false
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (p v q) is true if at least one among p, q is true, else it is false
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (~p) is true if and only if p is false
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (p -&gt; q) is true if p is false or q is true
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     (to be sure this last one is tricky. &quot;-&gt;&quot; has nothing to do with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; causality: the following is a tautology (((p &amp; q) -&gt; r)  -&gt; ((p -&gt; r) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; v (q -&gt; r))) although it is false with &quot;-&gt;&quot; interpreted as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;causality&quot;, (wet &amp; cold) -&gt; ice would imply ((wet -&gt; ice) or (cold 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; -&gt; ice)). Someday I will show you that the material implication &quot;-&gt;&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (as Bertrand Russell called it) is arguably the &quot;IF ... THEN ...&quot; of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the mathematician working in Platonia.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Stathis: That last one always got me: a false proposition can imply 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any proposition. All the rest seem like a formalisation of what most 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; people intuitively understand by the term &quot;logic&quot;, but not that one. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why the difference?
</em><br />
<br />You see my point? What you found obvious in my &quot;just a question&quot; post, 
<br />
presupposes what you don't find obvious in the second &quot;RE: Stathis, Lee 
<br />
and the &quot;NEAR DEATH LOGIC&quot;
<br />
<br /><br />So, the obviousness of &lt;For all number x,  if x is bigger than 2 then x 
<br />
is bigger than 1&gt; presupposes all the correct truth value of &quot;p -&gt; q&quot;:
<br />
<br />the truth of &quot;false -&gt; false&quot;  was implicit in you assessment of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;if 0 is bigger than 2 then 0 is bigger than 1&quot;,    (line 1).
<br />
the truth of &quot;false -&gt; true&quot; was implicit in your assessment of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;if 2 is bigger than 2 then 2 is bigger than 1&quot;,    (line 3)
<br />
<br />&quot;true -&gt; false&quot; will never appear in the list, and I guess that is the 
<br />
reason why you find the question obvious: it is is &quot;trivially&quot; true for 
<br />
x smaller or equal to 2, because those conditions are never met.
<br />
<br />So, accepting the &quot;obvious&quot;  &lt;For all number x,  if x is bigger than 2 
<br />
then x is bigger than 1&gt;
<br />
really means you take as obvious all the (infinity many) propositions:
<br />
<br />if 0 is bigger than 2 then 0 is bigger than 1,    (line 1)
<br />
if 1 is bigger than 2 then 1 is bigger than 1,    (line 2)
<br />
if 2 is bigger than 2 then 2 is bigger than 1,    (line 3)
<br />
if 3 is bigger than 2 then 3 is bigger than 1,    (line 4)
<br />
if 4 is bigger than 2 then 4 is bigger than 1,    (line 5)
<br />
if 5 is bigger than 2 then 5 is bigger than 1,    (line 6)
<br />
if 6 is bigger than 2 then 6 is bigger than 1,    (line 7)
<br />
if 7 is bigger than 2 then 7 is bigger than 1,    (line 8)
<br />
...
<br />
if 79876574327891  is bigger than 2 then 79876574327891 is bigger than 
<br />
1,    (line 79876574327892)
<br />
...
<br />
etc.
<br />
<br />and the first lines confirm the whole truth table of &quot;p -&gt; q&quot;.
<br />
<br />So if you ask me why I take the truth value of &quot;p-&gt;q&quot; as always being 
<br />
true when p is false, the answer is that I want to make &quot;obvious&quot; 
<br />
statements like the question I asked.
<br />
<br />Tell me if you see the point. If you see the point I will be able to 
<br />
explain why Bf (and Bt aswell) needs to be true in the cul-de-sac 
<br />
worlds.  Probably you could try to figure it out by yourself.
<br />
<br />Bruno
