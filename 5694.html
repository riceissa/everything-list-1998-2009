</em><br />
<br /><br />After reading ten times I conclude you got the solution. I have been mislead
<br />
by the fact that there are mainly two ways to solve the puzzle (and George
<br />
did try the two ways), and your 1. looks like the beginning of the first way,
<br />
and your 2. looks like the second way. Also the conclusion of your 1. is that
<br />
S is true. You still need your 2. to conclude, of course (as you illustrate).
<br />
And then I have been mislead because it looks you assume a knave to be
<br />
consistent. But if you ask a knave if 1=0 he answers &quot;yes&quot;, so he is certainly
<br />
not consistent in the usual sense of the word (which we will define when we 
<br />
will
<br />
introduce the &quot;believe&quot; ...). But I eventually realize you were just meaning
<br />
by consistent: &quot;consistent with his status of knave&quot;.
<br />
So ok you were right.
<br />
<br />Let me explain again. I give two independent solutions: A and B.
<br />
I recall, you are on the KK island, and a native tells you &quot;If I am a knight
<br />
then Santa Claus exists&quot;.
<br />
<br />A. Let us suppose the native is a knight. Then what he tells us is true.
<br />
So if we suppose the native is a knight the *two* following proposition are 
<br />
true:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-the native is a knight  (because if the native is a knight the native 
<br />
is knight, isn'it?)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-S is true, that is: if the native is a knight then Santa Claus exists.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;from which we can conclude that Santa Claus exists.
<br />
So we have shown that indeed IF the native is a knight then Santa Claus exists.
<br />
(Indeed By supposing that the native is a knight we get the existence of 
<br />
Santa Klaus).
<br />
At this point it is important to see that we have prove only that S is true 
<br />
(not that
<br />
Santa Claus exists).
<br />
OK. But the native asserted S, and only a knight can assert true proposition.
<br />
So the native is a knight. So know we *know* the two propositions are true:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-the native is a knight
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-S is true, that is: if the native is a knight then Santa Claus exists.
<br />
&nbsp;From which we can conclude that Santa Claus exists.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;From which we can conclude, BTW, that either a knight knave island does
<br />
not exist or, if it exists, no native will ever said to you &quot;if I am a knight
<br />
Santa Claus exists&quot;, or (in case the KK island exists and a native tells you
<br />
the S sentence)   ... that Santa Claus exists.
<br />
<br />B. Let us suppose the native is knave. Then what he said was false.
<br />
But he said &quot;if I am a knight then Santa Claus exists&quot;. That proposition
<br />
can only be false in the case he is a knight and Santa Claus does not exists.
<br />
So if he is a knave, he must be a knight and that's a contradiction. So he 
<br />
cannot be
<br />
a knave, and so he is a knight.
<br />
But then what he said was true, and giving what he said, Santa Claus exists.
<br />
<br /><br />OK?  That should give you a smell of Lob. At some point it will be necessary to
<br />
understand that in computerland the option of saying the KK island does not 
<br />
exist
<br />
just does not work for hunting away the self-referential proposition. Comp 
<br />
entails
<br />
some Lobian magic around! But I anticipate.
<br />
<br />I see you want the next problem.
<br />
<br />OK. I hope you all agree that a native, not a tourist, a real native from 
<br />
the KK
<br />
island will never tell you &quot;I am a knave&quot;, or, it is equivalent &quot;I am not a 
<br />
knight&quot;.
<br />
A knight saying that would be lying, a knave saying that would be telling 
<br />
the truth.
<br />
<br />Now with the next two problems we are doing a big step and a very big step.
<br />
So big that we will be forced to work again on 1-4 a little bit more formally.
<br />
<br />Big Problem 5:
<br />
<br />Could a native tell you &quot;You will never know that I am knight&quot;  ?
<br />
<br />Very Big Problem 6:
<br />
<br />Could a native tell you &quot;You will never believe that I am knight&quot; ?
<br />
<br />Bruno
