Stathiws,
<br />
no question about that. What I was trying to stress was the futility of arguing from one belief system (and stressing its solely expanded &quot;truth&quot;) against a different &quot;truth and evidence&quot; carrying OTHER belief system.
<br />
<br />BTW: don't schyzophrenics (maybe multiple personalitics) accept (alternately) ALL the belief systems they carry? (=layman asking the professional). 
<br />
IMO we all (i.e. thinking people) are schizophrenix with our rather elastic ways of intelligence. Beatus ille qui est &quot;onetrackminded&quot;..(the 9th beatitude). 
<br />
<br />To your initial sentence: do you believe (in YOUR criteria of your beliefs) that TWO people may have absolutely identical beliefs? I am almost certain that as your immune system, DNA, fingerprint and the other zillion characteristics are not identical to those of other animals, the mental makeup is similarly unique. 
<br />
We are not zombies of a mechanically computerized machine-identity (Oops, no reference to Loeb). Duo si faciunt (cogitant?) idem, non est idem.

<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;John,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;You shouldn't have one criterion for your own beliefs and a different criterion for everyone else's. If Christians said, &quot;those old Greeks sang songs about their gods' miraculous exploits, really seemed to believe in them, and on top of that were pretty smart, so I guess everything in the Iliad and Odyssey must be true&quot;, then they would be consistently applying the standards they apply to the Bible. Of course, they don't: other peoples' religious beliefs are subjected to rational scrutiny and (rightly) found wanting, but their own beliefs are special.

<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stathis:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is it not a misplaced effort to argue from one set of belief system ONLY with a person 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who carries two (or even more)? I had a brother-in-law, a devout catholic and an excellent
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;biochemist and when I asked him how can he adjust the two in one mind, he answered:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I never mix the two together&quot;. Tom is an excellent natural scientist and has brilliant 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;arguments in it, as long as it comes to his 'other' belief system - what he, quite 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inderstandably - does not want to give up. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all have 'second belief bases' in our multiple schizophrenia of intelligence. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some have 'Platonia', some 'primitive matter view' - it is your profession. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you really think you can penetrate one by arguments from another?

You need a person to come along and say &quot;let x=good&quot;, and then you can reason logically given this. Evolutionary theory etc. may predict what x a person may deem to be good or beautiful, but this is not binding on an individual in the way laws governing the chemistry of respiration, for example, are binding. Unlike some scientific types, I am quite comfortable with ethics being in this sense outside the scope of science. Unlike some religious types, I am quite comfortable without looking for an ultimate source of ethics in the form of a deity. Even if this conclusion made me very unhappy, that might be reason to try self-deception, but it has no bearing on the truth.

<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You seem to keep arguing that it wouldn't be very nice if there were no ultimate meaning. Is there any actual evidence that this alleged meaning exists? For example, suppose a society believes that the Sky God provides ultimate meaning and live their lives happily, whereas it could be shown that they would all be miserable and kill each other if they believed it were not true. On this basis there may be reason to think that belief in the Sky God is useful, but is there any reason to think that belief in the Sky God is true?
