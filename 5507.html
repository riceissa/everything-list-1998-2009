(I mean you are aware that I pretend (at least) that physics

number theory&quot;, etc. This is hardly physicalistic).

<br /><br />You mean classical logic? I don't think so. You could read the nice
<br />
book by I. M. Bochenski (translated in english in 1961, University of
<br />
Notre Dame Press): A History of Formal Logic. It contains a large
<br />
chapter on the logics, epistemology and metaphysics of India,before
<br />
and after Chr. It could change your mind on this point. Also quite
<br />
astonishing in that regard is the book by Th. Stcherbatsky: Buddhist
<br />
Logic. Comp itself (arguably) has appeared in the east a very long time before
<br />
Plato, as most analysis of the heaven and hell concepts.
<br />
(Reference in &quot;Conscience &amp; Mecanisme&quot;).
<br />
Remember also Giordiano Bruno who has been burned by the Church
<br />
for his questions and imaginations; (he was an explicit
<br />
&quot;many worlder&quot; in the form of other planet with life form).
<br />
You raise interesting question but I thing it would be premature to
<br />
really tackle that now.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Everything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is in the pattern of our terrestrial physical taste and comp imagination.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Maybe we get to hell: the mathematically illiterate planet?
</em><br />
<br /><br />At least I put the carts on the table: Church Turing Post Markov ... thesis,
<br />
+ a minimal amount of arithmetical realism, + that special act on faith
<br />
in front of a &quot;medical operation&quot;.
<br />
And the game is just to see where all that could lead with respect
<br />
to some unsolved fundamental question.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Can't we do better?
</em><br />
<br />... and then I point on the fact, about which I have probably underestimated
<br />
the startlingness, that, thanks to some  works done by ... Godel,
<br />
..., Solovay, we can quasi-literally ask the opinion of *the* sound classical
<br />
universal machines on that question. In some sense I &quot;eliminate&quot; the
<br />
act of faith by just interviewing the machine. What are you asking for?
<br />
<br />Look, I promise to Kory a hopefully readable account of what I see as an
<br />
obvious (but necessarily a little bit technical) mathematical/physical
<br />
confirmation of comp. It is a modest confirmation in the sense that it
<br />
leads quickly to many open mathematical problems, a sequence of
<br />
conjectures but also a real path from bit to qubit, should comp be true.
<br />
<br />I finish by a question.
<br />
Because we are about to interview the UM on a possible measure
<br />
existing on its (closer) consistent extensions, it is natural
<br />
to ask her if she *do* have a consistent extension.
<br />
<br />Now on *that* question, the UM remains silent, always.
<br />
<br />Is it a western or eastern type of behavior ?  ;-)
<br />
Is is not a little bit like the thundering silence of Vimalakirti?
<br />
<br />;-)
<br />
<br />Bruno
