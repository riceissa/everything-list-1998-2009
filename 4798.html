<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if you don't mind.
</em><br />
<br />My apology for the length of the answer. The answer was for the most 
<br />
part a restatement of something I wrote and was aired on radio over a 
<br />
decade ago, a &quot;Billy &lt;something&gt; Show&quot; that was out of Nevada (I had 
<br />
to string a long wire to receive it!) and which was very similar to 
<br />
the now very popular CoastToCoastAM.com related international radio 
<br />
show that airs nightly in most cities (and which sometimes guests 
<br />
very respectable scientists).. Although I claim absolutely no credit 
<br />
for any or the ideas expounded upon by myself then or now, I do not 
<br />
find much in the way of  inconsistancy with the general ideas 
<br />
expressed by the very qualified people who came up with the ideas 
<br />
that I merely attempt to assemble into understandable arrangement.
<br />
<br />...
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; By &quot;postulate&quot; I mean the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; expression of an idea not yet represented by a defining 
</em><br />
mathematical
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; statement.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In that case I can't agree that &quot;dark matter&quot; and &quot;dark energy&quot; are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;postulates&quot;. They both have no lack of mathematical expression, 
</em><br />
the
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem is that we don't really know which one describes them fully 
</em><br />
or
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; integrates with what else we know.
</em><br />
<br />I certainly accept that any idea set forth within a peer review 
<br />
scientific community will almost certainly be accompanied by math. 
<br />
But math at a postulate level is not a requirement unless it purports 
<br />
to rise to the level of a theory (in which case it is no longer 
<br />
merely a postulate). Restated, a postulate by general definition is 
<br />
&quot;To make claim for; demand. To assume or assert the truth, reality, 
<br />
or necessity of, especially as a basis of an argument. To assume as a 
<br />
premise or axiom; take for granted. See Synonyms at presume.&quot;
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; By theory I mean an idea supported by mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; statement but not yet verified in all possible ways by apparent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; empirical evidence.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Again there are serveral many theories (called &quot;scenarios&quot;) that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; try to account for either one, and they all aim to match the 
</em><br />
available
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; empirical evidence. 
</em><br />
<br />In this we seem to fully agree, in that a theory is an attempt to lay 
<br />
a math foundation that fully describes empiracal evidence. But it 
<br />
remains untested by peer review (experimentation and observation), or 
<br />
at least not as fully tested as be practical. Until that type of peer 
<br />
review has completed it is but a theory that does not rise to the 
<br />
level of being considered to be a law.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But, as data from better probes comes along, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; small disparity between the scenarios should favor some over 
</em><br />
others.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is already the case, for example,  when you compare the WMAP 
</em><br />
data
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with the Type Ia supernova surveys, for dark energy evidence...
</em><br />
<br />Thank the universe for the apparent consistency of exactly how some 
<br />
supernova do their thing. They were at the root of a problem where 
<br />
some seemed to be older than the expected age of the universe! But 
<br />
when the universe went from a slowing down type of expansion to a 
<br />
speeding up type of expansion the redshift data made sense and seems 
<br />
to have reconciled that age problem. Basically a phase shift 
<br />
occurred, but only in the sense that as the universe expanded the 
<br />
weakening of gravity as felt by objects in the universe reached a 
<br />
point where it started becoming less attractive than be the what 
<br />
until then was the less powerful repulsive (inflationary) force that 
<br />
is being referred to as dark energy.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; By law I mean an idea supported by a mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; statement that can not be ruled out by empirical evidence.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am not sure that you can say that about any law of physics with 
</em><br />
much
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conviction. Conservation laws are associated with global symmetries
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and even these can be broken (think of Parity and CP for example), 
</em><br />
and
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consequentially ruled out by empirical evidence.
</em><br />
<br />It was a red flag that called for re-evaluation of our basic 
<br />
assumptions. If a &quot;law&quot; can be broken then the breakage is not part 
<br />
of the law and it follows that the law is not a law nor even a valid 
<br />
postulate - because it has been disproven by empirical evidence.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Will get to the other part later...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
