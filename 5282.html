<br />No, I wish had the energy to write such an online paper. :) Anyway, please 
<br />
note that my own position is not &quot;Instantiationism&quot;. This was the word I 
<br />
used to describe the position that I *don't* accept - i.e., the idea that 
<br />
computations need to somehow be physically instantiated in order for them 
<br />
(or more importantly, the SASs within them) to be &quot;real&quot; or &quot;conscious&quot;. If 
<br />
I had to come up with a name for my position, I might call it &quot;Mathematical 
<br />
Physicalism&quot;.
<br />
<br />I have to confess that I'm not sure I'm following your argument. Are you 
<br />
referring to the tension between the static view of Mathspace, in which 
<br />
there is no concept of &quot;resources&quot; and computational structures exist &quot;all 
<br />
at once&quot;, and the dynamic, 1st-person view that we have as creatures, where 
<br />
time exists and resources are limited? I'm willing to admit that there's 
<br />
tension there, but it seems to me that the tension exists for the 
<br />
Instantiationist as well as the Mathematical Physicalist.
<br />
<br />All I can do is trundle out the same old thought experiments that we're all 
<br />
familiar with. Imagine a 2D CA in which the state of each cell is 
<br />
determined by the state of its neighbors one tick in the &quot;future&quot; as well 
<br />
as one tick in the &quot;past&quot;. Such CA cannot be computed &quot;one tick of the 
<br />
clock at a time&quot; like a regular CA. Instead you'd have to consider the 
<br />
whole structure as a 3D block of bits (one of the dimensions representing 
<br />
time) and somehow &quot;accrete&quot; the patterns within it. Or you could do a 
<br />
brute-force search through every possible block of bits, discarding all 
<br />
those that don't follow the rules. Some of the universes that you're left 
<br />
with may exhibit &quot;thermodynamic entropy&quot; and &quot;temporality&quot; - we can imagine 
<br />
a particular block universe that contains patterns which represent 
<br />
observers moving around, interacting with their environment, etc. - and yet 
<br />
from our perspective the whole structure is entirely static.
<br />
<br />There certainly seems to be a kind of mystery when we think about 
<br />
&quot;temporality&quot; within this static structure. We can &quot;follow along with our 
<br />
finger&quot; and &quot;watch&quot; some creature - some pattern of bits in the block 
<br />
universe - struggling valiantly against some obstacle in its environment. 
<br />
Yet clearly our act of following along with our finger is not suddenly 
<br />
making that creature conscious. The computations have already been 
<br />
performed - the entire block universe has already been physically 
<br />
instantiated. All we're doing now is observing it, like looking at the 
<br />
frames of a film. So at what point in time was that creature actually 
<br />
conscious? Did it happen &quot;all at once&quot; when our computation &quot;found&quot; that 
<br />
block universe? These are deep and murky questions, and I don't see how the 
<br />
idea of &quot;physical instantiation&quot; makes them go away. Indeed, it's precisely 
<br />
these &quot;block universe&quot; scenarios that suggest that it *does* make sense to 
<br />
view our universe as existing &quot;all at once&quot; out there in Mathspace, even 
<br />
though I'm in here perceiving it in this temporal fashion.
