<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps it's time I had another go at explaining all that weird  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stuff I believe in and why.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, for those few that don't know, I reckon that all possible  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universes exist and that everyone's immortal.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I admit, this does sound rather odd. It would have sounded odd to me  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about 10 years ago, too. Since about the age of 8 I was a pretty  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hardcore rational scientific naturalist: everything is simply matter  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and energy, and we but its dreams. What was real? Well, a chair. An  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; atom. Something you can touch. After all, when you think of reality,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you think of something... there. Something that sits there, quietly  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existing to itself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But what does that mean, really? Everyone knows that matter is  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; almost entirely empty space, anyway - the solidity is just the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; feather-touch of far-extended electromagnetic fields. Electrons  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; popping in and out of existence as the energy fields knot so charge  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can be transferred in quantised lumps. Particles do not behave as  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; billiard balls - they are ghosts, obeying strange equations, lacking  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hard and fast surfaces or reliable locations. Matter, energy, space,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time... they all begin to seem a bit ethereal when you look at them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Time. There's another one. I don't really believe in that, either.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Spacetime is just a barely distinguishable fabric woven by the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe. Events do not occur at a time or a place - most of the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observables we see arise kaleidoscope like out of an intricate web  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of possibilities, their form imposed by our own consciousness. And  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by that, I mean that our minds are embedded within the universe,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constructed in such a way that the metaphysical structure of the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cosmos is implied by our design - the word without reflects the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world within. This has an aspect of the anthropic principle to it -  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that we observe a world capable of supporting our existence because  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if it didn't, we wouldn't.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But this still has no bearing on how I started thinking things like  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this, so I shall get that out of the way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The short story is that I read some stories by a science-fiction  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; author called Greg Egan. Before you laugh too much, a lot of sci-fi  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is essentially just window-dressing to convey an idea - the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implications of some item of technology, turn of events or  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scientific/philosophical argument. And Greg Egan is a 'hard' science- 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fiction author, an ideas merchant. Well, you get the drift.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The first story I read was called Wang's Carpets (later included as  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a chapter of the book Diaspora), in which some spacefarers  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (themselves software) find a planet whose major life-form are  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; floating mats that take the form of Wang Tiles - tesselating objects  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whose patterns can implement a universal turing machine. But that's  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just the set-up for the idea: when someone analyses the Carpets, by  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; taking various abstract variables (appearance of certain tiles and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; features, etc) and putting them through frequency transforms, it  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; turns out that the computations the Carpets encode as part of their  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reproductive habits give rise to a fully realised n-dimensional  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; space containing self-aware creatures.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The thought-provoking part here was not that consciousness could be  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; digitalised and run as software - I had already pretty much accepted  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that - but that the mathematical transformations necessary to do  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this could be pretty strange, and come from processes that were  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; essentially plucked arbitrarily from the environment. That,   
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; largely, consciousness could be a matter of perspective.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The second story was the book, Permutation City. A great deal of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this book concerns one of the protagonists who wakes up one day and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; finds he is simply a downloaded copy - and that the 'real' him is  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; running experiments. After being run at different speeds, and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distributed in space and time, backwards, in chunks of different  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sizes, etc., the argument becomes that it doesn't matter what or how  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the program is run - it is all the same from the perspective of the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness being implemented, and that this is so abstract that  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one can find the relevant computational processes within any  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical substrate. That all consciousnesses can be found within a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; grain of sand. That there is not even any physical bedrock to fall  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; back upon - there is no way ever to verify, even in principle, that  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one is on the 'fundamental' metapysical level. At the end of the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; book, the characters have escaped into their own computational  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world, completely divorced from any physical hardware. Their  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe contains a simulation of another world, whose very alien  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inhabitants find their own physical principles for the cosmos they  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observe - principles radically different from the computational ones  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'running' it, and so compelling they start to take over the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; character's world, too.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So when you get down to it, I no longer believe in the physical  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world - or rather, I believe in all of them. While I used to require  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reasons to believe in the existence of parallel worlds, I now  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; require them not to. Existence, after all, can have no overseers. No  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arbiters to conjure it from nowhere. Time, remember, is just  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something created from within our cosmos - on a more fundamental  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; level, nothing changes, nothing is created or destroyed. Things  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simply are, or are not. Either they satisfy the criteria for  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existing, or not. Either they are possible, and exist, or they are  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; impossible, and do not.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Assuming just our world exists is like, to me, saying just the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; number 532 exists, and that there is no proof for any other number.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The Many Worlds Interpretation of quantum mechanics is like a very  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; diluted version of this. All it says is that the equations of QM and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our observations are consistent with the idea that, rather than the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; myriad possibilities inherent in a quantum system mysteriously  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; collapsing into one observed outcome, all outcomes are realised. At  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; first, this seems a little too much to believe. Where do they come  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from? Well, the key word there was mysterious. Nowhere in the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; equations of QM is the collapse predicted. That's our own kludge,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inserted to explain the fact that we somehow only see single,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; classical, outcomes. QM predicts that all these outcomes exist  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anyway, interacting within the wavefunction. The MWI simply asks:  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what if they don't stop existing? What if the act of observation  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simply causes our own wavefunction to split along those pre-existing  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lines? If those decohered elements don't interact much, we would get  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; precisely what we do see anyway.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, if I exist in multiple worlds, how many me's are there? I would  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; say: only 1. My consciousness, such that I observe it, is unique.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; While it might appear in an infinite number of possibile realities,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it is a constant, a fulcrum. I carry along with me a train of all  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible universes. So I don't think of myself as existing in 'this  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world', not really. I am in all of them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now: immortality. Or 'quantum immortality', as the idea is known. I  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; am running out of time, so I shall just say this: amongst all these  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universes I inhabit, there are possible future trajectories that  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; take me into universes in which I am dead. However, I shall not be  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; around to observe this; I can only witness universes in which I am  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; alive. And there will always be possible trajectories into sets of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universes in which I am alive. And that is what I will witness: I  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cannot die. Not in my world, anyway.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Anyway, gotta dash now.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
