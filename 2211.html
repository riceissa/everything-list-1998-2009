<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The correct (objective) a priori probability of our observations is

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; defined by whatever is the true physical theory.  
</em><br />
<br />Nick Bostrom &lt;nick.domain.name.hidden&gt; replied
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sounds like a contradiction! Objective probabilities aren't a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; priori -  they depend on what physics happens to be true in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; actual world, and  that's something we only learn from experience.
</em><br />
<br />I am using ``a priori probability'' here as a synonym for ``objective
<br />
probability''.  I think that this is fairly common among physicists,
<br />
although I realise that this may be confusing to philosophers,
<br />
especially those raised on Kant.  I would use ``propensity'' as a third
<br />
synonym.
<br />
<br />The important point is that such probabilities are independent of
<br />
our beliefs.  In my theory, they can be defined as probabilities
<br />
given the universal wavefunction and perfect knowledge of the past
<br />
history of an observer.  As I have a theory in which observers are
<br />
finitely defined, such probabilities make sense and depend only on
<br />
the (objective) laws of physics (i.e. the Hamiltonian of quantum
<br />
field theory).  I think Bostrom is pointing out that these laws of
<br />
physics are not ``a priori'' in the philosophical sense.
<br />
<br />I wrote
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  As a first approximation to the correct probabilities, however, it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is not reasonable to guess that we are about as likely as most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observers like us.  This is the self-sampling assumption.
</em><br />
<br />I meant ``not unreasonable'' of course.  Sorry.
<br />
<br />Bostrom wrote
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Quantum theory is irrelevant to the Adam&amp;Eve example, because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  that is a  thought experiment, so I can simply postulate that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  quantum physics is  false in their world. It's important to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  distinguish between  methodological or epistemological rules
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  (SSA), and empirical hypotheses  (quantum theory). The former can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  be applied to the latter, but mixing  them up can easily result in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  category mistake.
</em><br />
<br />I don't think that the Adam and Eve example is of any interest
<br />
except in as far as it sheds light on the doomsday argument as it
<br />
applies to us in the real world.  If, as I would contend, the
<br />
correctness of quantum theory changes how one should understand
<br />
the example, then I think it is highly relevant.  
<br />
<br />I wrote
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Nevertheless, Eve still must expect to be typical as an observer. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Otherwise, she has no reason to believe her physical theories.  Her
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  birth rank puts her in the position of someone who has tossed a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  fair coin 1,000 times and it has always come up heads.  But she is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  tossing a million other coins at the same time so it isn't really
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  that surprising.
</em><br />
<br />Bostrom replied
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  For all she knows, she may simply be one out of two humans -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  pretty  typical.
</em><br />
<br />Eve should find her birth rank surprising because of her (assumed)
<br />
knowledge of human biology.  The question is whether she can
<br />
deduce her own infertility from that surprise.
<br />
<br />But my point is that if she also wants to believe that her physical
<br />
theories are correct, then she has to believe in her statistical
<br />
sampling methods and in the results provided by others.
<br />
<br />Bostrom also wrote
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Let's assume the MWI is false.
</em><br />
<br />Under any interpretation of quantum theory, it really does look as if
<br />
dice are being thrown.  In my opinion, because of the way that
<br />
instabilities are magnified in the normal functioning of the
<br />
human brain, those dice affect every aspect of our behaviour on any
<br />
timescale above a millisecond. 
<br />
<br />If, as in the Bohm interpretation, probabilities are purely
<br />
epistemic, Eve will constantly acquire information which 
<br />
would previously have been much more difficult to predict (given
<br />
only her past awareness) than a birth rank of 2 in a species of
<br />
trillions.  In this situation, I suppose that the first part of my
<br />
argument would be that Eve has discovered lots of facts (in
<br />
particular, facts about the current state of her brain) which
<br />
were astonishingly unlikely given her prior history.  She would
<br />
therefore be unwise take any particular one of those facts too
<br />
seriously.  
<br />
<br />Even in classical terms, future neural processing is quite
<br />
unpredictable from current neural processing. 
<br />
<br />The second part of my argument is that one cannot separate birth
<br />
rank from the other facts about Eve's mental life.  Birth rank is not
<br />
the sort of fact that one could imagine Eve ever being asked to
<br />
guess, as if she had no idea of the answer.  As long as she has been
<br />
aware, she has had lots of clues that her birth rank was
<br />
expectional, just as we have always had lots of implicit clues of
<br />
our birth rank (e.g. the taste of powdered baby milk).
