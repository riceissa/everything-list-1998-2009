<br />This is quite correct in many important respects.
<br />
<br />Here's an example.
<br />
<br />Consider the space of all strings (DNA, RNA) which make up living 
<br />
things, from bacteria to reptiles to humans, and perhaps to other 
<br />
organisms, past, present, and future. Even assume that this space 
<br />
contains strings for beings which are &quot;possible&quot; (would be living if 
<br />
they were instantiated, made, grown) but which have never existed in the 
<br />
past and don't exist at present.
<br />
<br />I usually draw this on a blackboard or sheet of paper as a 
<br />
two-dimensional plot, with the x- and y-axes not explicitly labeled. If 
<br />
it helps, consider the x-axis to be something like body size in cc, the 
<br />
y-axis to be something like total number of neurons, and so on. Clearly 
<br />
these axes are just extreme simplifications.
<br />
<br />But what one can reasonably see is that in this space there are places 
<br />
where the single-celled organisms live, &quot;islands&quot; for the reptiles and 
<br />
birds, islands for the mammals, and some region where homo sapiens is 
<br />
found.
<br />
<br />Now humans have something like 4 billion base pairs in the genome. I 
<br />
don't recall what the conversion is from ATCG sorts of base pairs to 
<br />
bytes, but it's within a small factor, so something like 4 GB or 32 
<br />
Gbits represents the human genome. Fits on a handful of CD-ROMs, 
<br />
uncompressed.
<br />
<br />But this is not the full story. This 32 Gbit sequence is effectively a 
<br />
_pointer_ into a space of 2^ (32 Gbits) points, the space of all strings 
<br />
of the same length as the human genome. (And the space of all living 
<br />
things is even larger, as it includes all strings of our length, plus 
<br />
all orderings of shorter strings. If we include beings with even longer 
<br />
strings, it gets much bigger, of course.)
<br />
<br />Where living things in this space can be found depends on many other 
<br />
things, including the environment around the living thing (e.g., a 
<br />
lizard in a desert which only eats wheat or rice cannot live, and did 
<br />
not ever evolve).
<br />
<br />In Bennett-type terms, the strings of living things have great logical 
<br />
depth. They evolved, changed, got more &quot;complex&quot; (in the logical depth 
<br />
sense) as the phenotypes competed, lived, reproduced, etc.
<br />
<br />In a sense, the genome is a _pointer_ to a particular address in that 
<br />
vast space of all possible living things. (Just as the library call 
<br />
number of &quot;War and Peace&quot; is much shorter than the actual text of &quot;War 
<br />
and Peace.&quot;)
<br />
<br />(Completely aside: We even have some ideas about the topology and 
<br />
geometry of &quot;life space&quot;: we know something about what &quot;nearness&quot; means, 
<br />
through single-point mutations and their effects of organism viability, 
<br />
and we are learning what rearrangements and insertions of string 
<br />
sequences may mean.)
