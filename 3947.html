</em><br />
<br />Most of this paper is way over my head.  I need to read the ending much
<br />
more carefully in order to understand its conclusions.  But I wanted to
<br />
make one point which IMO is really amazing and not often appreciated.
<br />
I'm not 100% sure that it applies to the specific model considered in
<br />
this paper, but it does apply in general.  I think I got this idea from
<br />
the Huw Price book on The Arrow of Time.
<br />
<br />The authors use the example of a box containing a gas, which starts in
<br />
a low-entropy state with all the molecules in a small region.  Then as
<br />
time moves forward the molecules spread out and we get entropy increase,
<br />
allowing for dissipating structures to form such as vortices, and in
<br />
the general case even life.
<br />
<br />Then the gas reaches equilibrium, and all the dissipative states die out.
<br />
All structure and order is lost, and in a sense, time is no longer
<br />
passing, as far as causality is concerned.  Causal time is something
<br />
that only happens when there is entropy increase.
<br />
<br />After an extremely long interval, we may get a Poincare recurrence.
<br />
(Actually, I'm not sure this is the right term for this; I think a
<br />
Poincare recurrence is a more general thermodynamic effect. But I will
<br />
use the phrase here to specifically talk about a low-entropy fluctuation
<br />
out of a high-energy equilibrium state.)  The gas will randomly happen to
<br />
move back into a low-energy state, perhaps even the same state we started
<br />
with, all the molecules in one corner.  At that point we once again get
<br />
dissipation, structures, the passage of time, and the possibility of life.
<br />
This cycle can and will repeat indefinitely.
<br />
<br />The authors suggest, applying this concept to cosmology, &quot;In the
<br />
recurrent view of cosmology the second law of thermodynamics and the
<br />
arrow of time would have an unusual significance. In fact they are not
<br />
laws at all. What is true is that interesting events, such as life,
<br />
can only occur during the brief out-of-equilibrium periods while the
<br />
system is returning to equilibrium.&quot;
<br />
<br />The amazing thing is that this is wrong.  Life and other dissipating
<br />
events are not restricted to the period when the system is returning to
<br />
equilibrium.  Here is the surprise: these events also occur, to exactly
<br />
the same extent, while the system is *departing* from equilibrium.
<br />
<br />That is, if we wait long enough for a Poincare recurrence of the kind
<br />
described here, where the gas goes into a low entropy state and then
<br />
goes through some kind of complex evolution back to equilibrium, we must
<br />
pay attention to how exactly the gas goes into the low entropy state.
<br />
And given the microscopic reversibility of the system, the most likely
<br />
path into the low entropy state is a mirror of the most likely path out
<br />
of it.
<br />
<br />That is, if we really assume that somehow this gas in the corner evolved
<br />
life which then died out in the heat death of the universe, then the
<br />
most likely path back into the corner is to evolve life backwards.
<br />
We would see the formless void of space begin to cluster together to form
<br />
structure.  That structure would include the pattern of dead life-forms.
<br />
These life-forms would come to life, and they would live their lives
<br />
backwards.  They would grow young and be un-born.  Each generation
<br />
would be replaced by its ancestors.  Life would un-evolve back to a
<br />
primordial state, and eventually to simpler dissipative structures and
<br />
chemical reactions.  The whole clock of the universe would continue
<br />
to turn back until it reached the peak of the Poincare recurrence, the
<br />
point of minimal entropy, and then it would start to run forward again.
<br />
<br />Now, this does not mean that we would see exactly the same path out
<br />
of the low entropy state as in; but rather, that both paths would be
<br />
governed by the same statistical constraints.  The path out of the
<br />
recurrence shows constant increases in entropy which guide its path.
<br />
The path into the recurrence shows constant decreases in entropy which
<br />
guide it in exactly the corresponding manner.
<br />
<br />I know this is pretty amazing; so amazing that I can hardly believe it
<br />
myself.  But it follows immediately from the time-symmetry of the laws
<br />
of physics.  If Poincare recurrences did not occur in this way, it would
<br />
mean that physics had an absolute arrow of time.  We could watch a movie
<br />
of a low-entropy state forming and then dissipating, and the two phases
<br />
would look different, showing that physics is not symmetric in time.
<br />
<br />One more point: during the entropy-decrease phase of the Poincare
<br />
recurrence, what force pushes us backwards in time?  Why does entropy
<br />
continue to decrease?  The answer is, there is no such force.  At every
<br />
point during the recurrence, it is *overwhelmingly* more likely to turn
<br />
around and start heading towards higher entropy than to continue towards
<br />
further decreases in entropy.  It is no more likely for time to continue
<br />
to run backwards during the first half of a Poincare recurrence than it
<br />
is for time to turn around and begin running backwards today.
<br />
<br />So how come it happens, then?  It is not a physical phenomenon, rather it
<br />
is a selection effect.  We choose to pay attention only to those Poincare
<br />
recurrences which are interesting, that is, those which go back to what
<br />
we consider a &quot;beginning of the universe&quot; state.  Given enough time,
<br />
enormous time, some recurrences will go back that far.  So if we restrict
<br />
our attention to that minute subset of events, and we ask what path did
<br />
the universe follow in getting to this amazing low-entropy state, then
<br />
what I have said above is true.  The most likely path into the low entropy
<br />
state runs along the same constraints as the most likely path out of it.
<br />
Time runs backwards into the low-entropy state.
<br />
<br />I believe it follows, then, that if we are living in such a Poincare
<br />
recurrence, it is overwhelmingly likely that the universe did not really
<br />
go all the way back to the Big Bang.  Rather, our past is an illusion.
<br />
Time ran backwards far enough to form us; but among those recurrences
<br />
where we formed, the overwhelming majority of them don't have time go
<br />
back much farther than that.  (My son is reading the Price book now and
<br />
says that this idea goes back to Boltzmann, that our past is false and
<br />
the universe no older than us, if our experience are explained by such
<br />
a recurrence.)
