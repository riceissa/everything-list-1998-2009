<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I hope you guys will forgive my irreverence, but in the last
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; couple of hours for the first time I have managed to read this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thread to here. Having done so, and in the spirit of this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everything-list wherein it is assumed everything is not only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible but _will_ happen and indeed may already have happened
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in a universe near you [and of course is that possibility
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exists, then it definitely already always has happened], I get
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the feeling that comp could lead to madness.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You begin to see the point perhaps ...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But then, of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; course, it already has hasn't it ... in another universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; somewhere/when else ... of course ... :-)
</em><br />
<br /><br />You wish :-)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The thing is Brent and Stathis have been going around and around
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this critical point of duration and continuity for some time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; now, without wanting to admit that *our experience of being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aware of being here and now [respectively] is intrinsically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; paradoxical*. Well I have felt compelled to that viewpoint for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more than a decade or so now, and I find from reading this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discussion that comp does not solve this. OK, it may well be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that Loebian machines, whether modest or not in other universes,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or just modest but smarter than me - the latter not hard :-) can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; get on with the computation of their ontology and somehow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; transcend the apparent paradox. The paradox I have thus far
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; asserted to be primary is the comparatively simple thought that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we are constantly mistaken in taking our experience to be more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or less _all of what is happening_ when it is really only our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain's construction of its model of self in the world, which is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nothing to sniff at of course but then the processes for doing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this have been scores of millions of years in the making.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK. This is not so new. A rough summary of Aristotle versus Plato 
<br />
consists in saying:
<br />
Aristotle: reality is what you see and measure (let the experts speak, 
<br />
and sleep well)
<br />
Plato: what you see and measure *could* be the shadow of the shadow of 
<br />
the shadow of what *could* perhaps be (let us keep vigilance in all 
<br />
situations).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Comp makes the whole thing much more Comp-licated!
</em><br />
<br />It is the least we can say. My original motivation was in showing that 
<br />
with comp the mind body problem is two times more complex than 
<br />
materialists usually think. Indeed (cf uda) with comp you have to 
<br />
explain the physical from the &quot;number-theoretical/information 
<br />
theoretical etc..) studies.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; AFAICS under
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Comp, we are each and every one of us confined to an anthropic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; view which does not even have a consolation
</em><br />
<br />Careful with the idea of consolation. A priori science is not supposed 
<br />
to comfort us, but to believe (and hopefully know). Cf some recurring 
<br />
remark from Stathis to Tom. Now, if you have &quot;faith&quot;, really, then 
<br />
there are no reason to be anxious about any finding by science.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; that we are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; participating in a genuine continuity.
</em><br />
<br />And here you are quite quick. But, with respect to this notion of 
<br />
continuity,  I have a problem with a list, given tat for being less 
<br />
quick on such question you have to invest more in a bit more technical 
<br />
computer science. I am not sure computer science and logic makes it 
<br />
possible to recover any third person global notion of continuity, but 
<br />
evidences add that there are genuine first person plural genuine 
<br />
continuity. Actually, the very notion of computation, both classical 
<br />
and quantum, could have his roots in topology. In some mathematical 
<br />
structure, akin to first person structure, the notion of computable is 
<br />
equivalent with the notion of being continuous.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Pre-comp, one could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assume that, no matter how deluded one might be, as long as 'I'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; am able to be coherent long enough to recognise that it doesn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; make sense to say 'I don't exist' then the chances were very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; good that the world is going on independently of me and I have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the chance of really contributing.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I would not abandon that idea.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  In a pre-comp universe a wise
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person will recognise that, well, things are always what we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; believe them to be until we discover otherwise so we have no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; guarantee that our attempts to do the right thing are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessarily the best. However we have a right to believe that so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; long as we have tried to sort out the facts of our situation and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; purposed not to cause avoidable harm to others then we are being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as ethical as we know how to be and this counts for something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and at least we tried.
</em><br />
<br />Nice.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But with comp, assuming there are no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intrinsic barriers to the formation of worlds and experience
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wherein we can come to truly believe we and our world have a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; coherent history, we have no reason to assume that this current
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience _and the whole noumenal world we believe to exist_
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cannot just wink out of existence. By definition it seems, it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; must always be possible that everything we take to be an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indication of duration 'out there' is a transient artefact of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this slice of multiverse.
</em><br />
<br />This is a problem for any block view of reality (primarily physical or 
<br />
not).
<br />
But making the physical universe secondary does not make it more 
<br />
deluding. On the contrary: given that if the quantum hyp is correct, 
<br />
then we have to justify it from numbers, and this would make the 
<br />
&quot;quantum universe&quot; even more solid, and less deluding.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is a pretty rugged conception to present to people as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; _necessarily_ possible. I therefore take comfort in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; difficulties that people have in integrating Comp into a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; coherent explanation of the universe we perceive.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Hmmmm.... If you search comfort, be prepared to be deluded and trapped 
<br />
by wishful thinking.
<br />
'course, I hope truth being enough comfortable, but I find wishful 
<br />
thinking rather not comfortable for the long run.
<br />
Being wrong leads to difficulties, in general.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I realise that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; much can be done with higher mathematics but just because people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can create a formal language system in which algorithmic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; processes can be referred to with simple symbols, and sets of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such symbols can be syntaxed together with indicators that mean,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; effectively, 'and so on so forth for ever and ever', this does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not mean that the universe outside of peoples' heads can ever
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reflect this. I think it behoves contributors here to consider
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whether the universal dovetailer can ever be more real than Jack
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and his Beanstalk. Jack and his magic vegetable have been around
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for a couple of centuries now. The universal dovetailer may do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; likewise. We just need to keep in touch with the idea though
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that 'It Ain't Necessarily So!'.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes. And provably so. It is wahat I find particularly cute with the 
<br />
comp hyp: The &quot;yes doctor&quot; entirely and completely  justify why comp, 
<br />
if true, has to be non necessarily such. &quot;Yes doctor&quot; entails the 
<br />
fundamental right to say &quot;no&quot; to the doctor. Comp is an eminently 
<br />
personal affair, which is coherent with its &quot;elimination&quot; of 
<br />
eliminative materialism, and its reawakening of many person points of 
<br />
view.
<br />

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     No.  I'm talking about a sort of program/data division - which I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     recognize is arbitrary in computer program - but I think may have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     analogue in brains.  When I write a simulation of a system of ODEs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     the time evolution of the ODEs define the states.  But in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     simulation, what actually evolves them is passing them to another
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     program that takes them and the current state as data and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     integrates; thus producing a sequence of states.  When you talk
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     about isolated OMs, what we are conscious of, I think of them as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     states.  They are what we write into memory; they form the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     &quot;narrative&quot; of the simulation.  The integrator is like a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; simulation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     at a lower level, perhaps at the level of neurons.  We're not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; aware
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     of it and in fact many different integration algorithms could be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     used with little difference in the outcome (as in the comp idea of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     replacing neurons with chips).  But the integrator, even conceived
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     as an abstract 'machine' in Platonia, is performing a function,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     connecting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     one state to the next.  I'm not denying that you can simulate all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     this and that you can take a block universe view of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     simulation.  I'm just saying that the block can't be made of just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     the conscious parts, the OMs, it needs to include the unconscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     parts that connect the conscious parts.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The integrator is just a device to generate the next state. Perhaps
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; without it there would be no continuity because there would be no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; simulation, but if you had the DE's all solved beforehand you could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; simply plot the states and have continuous motion, or whatever it is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; are simulating. In any case, what could it possibly mean for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; unconscious part binding my OMs together to be disrupted? Suppose that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; this happened every minute on the minute: would I feel any different? 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I did feel different, that would mean my consciousness was affected, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; it would be the OMs that differed, not just the unconscious part; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; while
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; if I didn't feel any different by definition my continuity of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; consciousness has been maintained and the unconscious disruption is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; irrelevant.
