<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why shouldn't it just *be* time ?
</em><br />
<br />A structure evolves from state to state in a regular way. The fact that an
<br />
observer built of that structure inside that structure can formulate
<br />
mathematical descriptions with a &quot;t&quot; in them that correlate well with what
<br />
is observed does not mean that there is anything real in t any more than it
<br />
means anything else in the maths is reified. Time is yet another 'as-if'
<br />
construct. The universe (the structure) behaves as if a t was there when
<br />
it's just an artifact of models.
<br />
<br />The experienced moment to moment progress of the state of the structure
<br />
literally is what we perceive as time.... in the sense that there's no
<br />
special entity pouring some 'timeness' into the structure.
<br />
<br />A metaphor experience for this occurs when you write industrial 'real-time'
<br />
control software state machines. You can make the control system speed up
<br />
and slow down (meaning that the control system sees the world slow-down and
<br />
speed up, resp.) based on the rate the state machine is executed.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and that it's appearance
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; as 'physical' is what it is like when you are in it. .ie.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Presumably, what is *necessarily* like when you are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; in it , since there is no contingency in Platonia.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Platonia has not been instantiated. Our universe has. Our universe may
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; act, somewhere, somehow, as if it were interacting with entities in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; platonia, but that does not make platonic entities 'real' any more than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; real/imaginary power vectors delivered out your power-outlet make the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; square root of -1 real.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You are in line with my prejudices on that one!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; I await an apriori deduction of qualia from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; relational structures....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Why stop there? What about an a-priori deduction of mass from relational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; structures? Or space? Or electric fields? Or gravity?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Most of those just *are* relational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structrures, AFAICS.
</em><br />
<br />No. They are descriptions of observations formulated by observers of 'the
<br />
relational structure'. To an observer built of the structure inside the
<br />
structure bits of the structure behave 'massly', gravitationally, electric
<br />
field-ly, space-ly and so on. If the mathematics ca, in some sense, termed
<br />
an expression of relationality, that's just an artifact of the maths, not a
<br />
statement about the original structure exhibiting the behaviour.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  All the same...and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; none of these have been predicted by any abstract model or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'lumpy/thingy'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ontological thinking.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The physics we have is structural/relation from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; top to bottom. It was predicted from observation, or rather
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hypothesis/deduction/refutatin/confirmation...
</em><br />
<br />Yes, and none of that physics says anything at all about the intrinsic
<br />
structural nature of the entities portrayed by the physics. The are
<br />
descriptions of behaviour (WHAT HAPPENS) that correlate with observation.
<br />
Correlation(WHAT HAPPENS) is not causation(WHY IT HAPPENS). Causation is
<br />
what is happening in the underlying structure. Again: the universe is
<br />
behaving 'as-if' physics was driving it to an observer inside the structure,
<br />
of the structure.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The question is what can futher be predicted from that. If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; qualia cannot, they are presumably fundamental in some way...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The abstract model predicts things that behave
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'model'-ly. Parameters/variables in the model match adequately when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; compared to reality. They do not describe what it is actually made
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree. Physics goes no further than isomorphism.
</em><br />
<br />So you actually agree with my above comments. Methinks there's confusion in
<br />
here somewhere!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; f = ma says nothing about what mass is. It says what mass _does_.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree.
</em><br />
<br />And again. Now extrapolate the same thing to every mathematical model ever
<br />
made by science. They all have the same status and exactly the same type of
<br />
statement can be made of every parameter in very one of them.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Of course: it is well founded empirically. We have abundant
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; evidence that only certaint things exist within a given spatial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; volume (contingency) that they endure through time, and so on.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; No. We have abundant evidence of some'thing' behaving as per an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; abstraction of 'thing' at the scales we explore. We have NOT proven that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; these laws apply at all scales..indeed we have abundant evidence to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; contrary! Absense of evidence is not evidence of absense.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is not really the issue. The issue is that only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some things exist, only some laws apply, and so on.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Somethingism vs. everythingism.
</em><br />
<br />There is an evolving structure, we are in it. It behaves with amazing
<br />
amounts of regularity (even the persistence of randomness and chaotic
<br />
behaviour is regularity!). The regularity as perceived (in the first
<br />
person!)...that orderliness...correlates well with some models and not
<br />
others, at some scales and not others. These models are descriptions only
<br />
and are not explanations in the sense of causality.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Time, in particular, is not a mere mathematical construct. It is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quite hard, if not impossible, to capture the passing (a series) of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time mathematically.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is precisely why Platonists and othe mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; literalists tend argue that it doesn't exist.
</em><br />
<br />Well I agree that it doesn't exist. See above....it's virtual.
<br />
I disagree that it's hard. It's the most simple intrinsic property implicit
<br />
in the evolution of the structure we inhabit. The causal options for the
<br />
intrinsic state transitions of the structure limit the next state to be a
<br />
specific thing. The limit makes the structure evolve as it does and it does
<br />
this in a regular way (one direction).
<br />
<br />It's only hard because no mathematic model (progressing theorem evolution)
<br />
actually progresses from proof-step to proof-step without being driven by a
<br />
mathematician or the preempting of a theorem proving model provided by a
<br />
mathematician.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Timeless universe, universes where everything that can exist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; does exist, are not well founded empirically.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; No they are not. Again a mathematical model (quantum mechanics) that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to imply multiple universes does not mean that they exist....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is a big difference between multiple universes and everything.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Physical multi-world-ism is basically on the somethingist side of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fence.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Schordinger's equation means some things are definitely impossible.
</em><br />
<br />&quot;Schordinger's equation&quot; is yet another model of the structure, not the
<br />
structure! What exists is the structure! Because the maths implicates the
<br />
impossibility/possibility of something or the idea of multiple universes or
<br />
anything else _does not mean_ that the structure that the equation describes
<br />
will necessarily incorporate those ideas. It means that the structure acts
<br />
'as-if' it did to observers inside it, made of it.
<br />
<br />See a pattern here? This is all the same from one end to the other. This is
<br />
a fundamental cultural blockage we inherit because we have all been brought
<br />
up to worship abstract mathematics and its 'unreasonable effectiveness' with
<br />
an almost god-like deference.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Only that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; model makes it look like it does. I can imagine any number of situations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; where the fuzziness of the ultra-scale world obeys the rules of a QM-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; model.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; For example, the perfectly deterministicly repeated trajectory of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whatever
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; an electron is made of through 35.4 spatial dimensions is going to look
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; awfully fuzzy to critters observing it as course scales within 3
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; dimensions. QM depicts fuzziness... and 'aha' the universe is made of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; QM?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Not so. It merely appears to obey the abstraction QM provides us.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Fuzziness can be accomodated within physics in a way that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; qualia can't.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A 35.4 dimensional universe is just a minute corner of Platonia.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />So what? What's that got to do with the structure of the universe? Platonia
<br />
is just a word.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; QM says nothing about what the universe is actually constructed of. It
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; not constructed of quantum mechanics! It is constructed of something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; behaves quantum mechanical-ly.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Physicalism in general assumes that there is some substrate to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to physical behaivour/porperties...but it is assumed to be only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a bare substratee with no interesting properties of its own.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />Well then that just about says it all for the imagination of those who
<br />
invent words like 'physicalism', say what it is and then think they've said
<br />
anything about the natural world. A resounding so what! Nobody told the
<br />
universe its structure had no interesting proprties...it seems to be
<br />
trundling along nicely producing people/observers who can define words like
<br />
physicalism, which is kind of interesting, isn't it?
