Le 13-janv.-06, à 02:24, Russell Standish a écrit :
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have tried to identify 1pp with G and 1p with G*, but I'm really
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unsure that the analogy is sound.
</em><br />
<br /><br />It is tempting to classify the self-reference logics (G, G*) in the 
<br />
first person discourses, and I have been stuck in that idea for a 
<br />
while.
<br />
But it can't be. The godelian provability predicate is definable in 
<br />
arithmetic only thanks to the fact that it is just asked to Peano 
<br />
Aritmetic (a &quot;famous&quot; lobian or self-referentially correct machine) to 
<br />
talk about a third person description of itself, through Godel numbers 
<br />
usually. So G is more like the discourse you could do on your 
<br />
doppelganger or on your brain, seen in some high level third person 
<br />
description. It is a purely scientific (and even purely deductive) 
<br />
third person talk a machine can do about itself, except that she did 
<br />
already bet on some level of substitution, so that in a sense it is 
<br />
just serendipitously correct.
<br />
<br />Now if the lobian machine we talk with is sufficiently elementary, like 
<br />
Peano Arithmetic, and most probably Zermelo Fraenkel Set Theory, we can 
<br />
believe in their consistency (~Bf) and even in their soundness (Bp -&gt; 
<br />
p): PA (resp. ZF) does not tell us falsities (~Bf), and PA communicates 
<br />
only true sentences of Arithmetic (Bp -&gt; p)(resp. set theory).
<br />
<br />Exercise: find a lobian machine which is unsound, but still consistent.
<br />
By &quot;exercise&quot; I mean I have not the time to explain, but I want draw 
<br />
the attention on that important fact. It is a rather simple consequence 
<br />
of the second incompleteness theorem: Dt -&gt; ~BDt.
<br />
<br />Amazingly enough perhaps, G* gives still a pure third person discourse. 
<br />
Note in passing that I insist on the fact that G and G* gives thrid 
<br />
persons discourses in my last three english paper.
<br />
G* is a proper extension of G, which is complete, at the propositional 
<br />
level, for the description of the true provability and consistency 
<br />
sentences. As applied to us, we cannot take it for granted because we 
<br />
cannot know our correct level of description, and then, if we are lucky 
<br />
enough to bet on the correct level, we still cannot know if comp is 
<br />
true; and then, even if comp is true, if we are lobian machines, we 
<br />
cannot know we are consistent, still less sound.
<br />
And this is actually what G* says. And so G* is an amazing sort of 
<br />
&quot;scientific theology&quot; which ask you not to take it as granted in its 
<br />
roots. Practically it means theotechnologies are private matters, 
<br />
somehow, and it makes obligatory the right of saying no, to the doctor.
<br />
<br />All the first persons notion are obtained by variant of the 
<br />
Theaetetical  definition of knowledge. This is possible exactly thanks 
<br />
to the gap between provability (G) and truth (G*).
<br />
<br />Although the following
<br />
<br />Bp
<br />
Bp &amp; p    (pure first person, the knower)
<br />
Bp &amp; Dp  (first person plural, betting machines)
<br />
Bp &amp; Dp &amp; p
<br />
<br />are shown equivalent by G*, and so defined strictly speaking the same 
<br />
machine, none of those equivalencies can be shown by G, i.e. the 
<br />
machine itself. So, although they define the same machine, from the 
<br />
machine stance they defines different logics.
<br />
And both G and G* can derive completely (at the propositional level) 
<br />
those logics. And of course here too G* knows more(*), so that the 
<br />
theaetetical variants are lifted to the corona G* \ G.
<br />
That's the beginning of the story, it is the framework for translating 
<br />
the UDA thought experiment in the language of the machine, and extract 
<br />
the logics of &quot;probability one&quot; on the near 2^aleph_0 
<br />
&quot;observer-moments/states/worlds...&quot;.
<br />
<br />Bruno
<br />
<br /><br /><br />(*) with the notable and fundamental exception of the pure first person 
<br />
knower.
