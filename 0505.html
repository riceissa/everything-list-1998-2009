<em class="quotelev1">&gt;GH:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;It is not against these theories. The many-worlds hypothesis + a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;mathematical constraint such as analyticity of fields could lead to an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;&quot;everything possible&quot; hypothesis that would imply that all possible worlds
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;are also different everywhere, so &quot;clone free&quot;...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;BM:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This would make the &quot;many-worlds hypothesis&quot; empty. If the worlds
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are so different, how will interference be possible ?
</em><br />
<br />In fact there is no precise definition of what is a macroscopic world in
<br />
MWI. This is one of the major difficulties of the theory; however it is
<br />
logical to consider that two different macroscopic worlds have by
<br />
definition negligible interference terms, which makes the conventional
<br />
interpretation of QM  work (reduction of the wave packet). Interference
<br />
terms are important only at the microscopic level.
<br />
&nbsp;Note also that the fact that fields are different over any neighborhood of
<br />
any point doesn't imply that the interaction vanishes!(Ex: cos x and
<br />
&nbsp;cos (x+a) if a&lt;&gt;0 [Pi/2])
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;GH:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ... it relies on the hypothesis that you think you will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;really be , or &quot;identify yourself to&quot;, one of your copy, which is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;contestable, especially if you consider that no copy can be exact.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;BM:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Remember that with comp we are by definition informatical (in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;classical sense) entity, and we are (from a third person point of view)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;100% exactly duplicable. (In the same sense that you can make *in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;principle* a perfect copy of the 10E100 first decimal of PI).
</em><br />
<br />but not of PI in a finite time. Of course as we already discussed the
<br />
universe could be discrete. But you cannot make an  exact copy of it at its
<br />
finest level (ie Planck scale) with a machine embedded in it.
<br />
The point is that when you say &quot;we are informatical&quot;, you probably mean
<br />
that, like a computer, our computational structure can be described with
<br />
much less information than our physical one. That's why we can built
<br />
perfectly reproducible computers, and we can duplicate them with very
<br />
different physical structures.
<br />
But it can well be (and it is very probable) that the brain is not like our
<br />
simple computers. For example the response of neural cell can be some
<br />
continuous function of the concentration of hormons. Of course you can hope
<br />
to modelize it with a discrete approximation at any level of accuracy. But
<br />
by doing that, you start another stuff. The reproduction is not exact
<br />
anymore, and you are facing the problem of how deep you must go to
<br />
reproduce EXACTLY its behaviour. And in fact the brain is no more
<br />
informatical in the first sense, because it may well be that you need the
<br />
complete description of its physical state. So unlike our artificial
<br />
computers, its evolution is NOT simpler than the evolution of any physical
<br />
system. And if you have to go to the quantum level ,(even worse, to the
<br />
Planck scale!) you are facing a practical impossibility: it is (even in
<br />
principle) impossible to measure the complete quantum state of a single
<br />
system, and a fortiori to reproduce it (just because the complex value
<br />
Psi(x,t) can not be an observable). And as we already discussed you will be
<br />
lead to simulate the whole environment (ie visible Universe) at this level,
<br />
which is also impossible...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Exercice (I am joking) :
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If a mad scientist decides to put you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;into the following quantum &quot;cat&quot; state:  Psi =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (1/sqrt(|a_1|^2 + |a_2|^2))*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    [a_1*|you in-hell&gt; + a_2*|you in-paradise&gt;]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and give you the opportunity to choose between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;A) Psi with a_1 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a_2 (a_2 negligeable compare to a_1) and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;B) Psi with a_2 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a_1 (a_1 negligeable compare to a_2)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Will you care about that opportunity ? and if you care,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;what will you choose:   A or B ?
</em><br />
<br />As you well know, it is impossible to prepare a macroscopic system in any
<br />
coherent superposition because of the environment induced decoherence. So
<br />
your joke experiment is really impossible (the scientist is either mad or a
<br />
lier!).
<br />
What is possible of course, and very simple, is to prepare you in some
<br />
state like
<br />
&nbsp;(1/sqrt(|a_1|^2 + |a_2|^2)°*
<br />
&nbsp;[a_1*|you in-hell&gt;|world with you in-hell&gt; + a_2*|you in-paradise&gt;|world
<br />
with you in-paradise&gt;]
<br />
<br />simply by measuring the spin of a polarized electron on a conveniently
<br />
chosen axis (with relative probability a1/a2) and decide to send you in
<br />
hell or paradize following the result. Of course as your states are
<br />
incoherent you are back to simple probability calculus and the choice is
<br />
obvious.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;GH:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;You
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;could also think that you will die whatever, and choose B just by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;compassion with other copies.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;BM:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Indeed, but it is better, if only for the sake of the argument,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to presuppose a minimal amount of selfishness.
</em><br />
<br />What I meant is that if you think you die, your selfishness is useless. You
<br />
only need a minimal amount of altruism to choose B. If you are a pure
<br />
selfish man, you won't care about your choice.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;GH:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;For example, just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;modify a little bit your experiments: you won't be destroyed, but you will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;be put in the unique &quot;paradise&quot; box in A and in the unique &quot;hell&quot; box in B.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;The other 999999 copies will be placed in the hell or paradise boxes,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;respectively. Unless you are a saint, and without misprint, won't you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;choose &quot;A&quot;? It would mean that you care less about your copies than about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;yourself...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;BM:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I will not choose A, because with comp, a teleportation without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;annihilation of the original is equivalent with a duplication where the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;original is destroyed. So, with comp, your experiment is equivalent to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mine!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I have no doubt that this is rather counter-intuitive. But comp, if true,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is necessarily *unbelievable*.
</em><br />
<br />Ok, Bruno may be you would choose B. What about if, despite my promises,
<br />
you are not completely confident in my capability of creating the other
<br />
999999 copies? (I assume of course that once in the box, you are totally
<br />
unaware of what happens really in the other boxes. As is well known, we
<br />
will forget everything in paradise!)
<br />
May be this thought experiment is a proof that COMP (understood as the
<br />
possibility of creating an EXACT copy of yourself) is false?
<br />
<br />Cheers
<br />
<br />Gilles
