<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; And if Platonia exists, it already contains every string that

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; could be output by the UD -- so what do you need a UD for?

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; [Lee]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It'll probably be retorted that it all has to do with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; measure, but there are lots of machines (I mean TMs) in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Platonia, and lots and lots of them are a lot shorter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (and so by any measure more plentiful) than the old UD.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That's true, there are lots of shorter programs than the dovetailer.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But how many of those short programs support conscious observers?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let's suppose you wanted to write a program that supports a conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer. It's going to be a very long, complicated program right?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Very informationally complex. Well, I'm lazy. I would just write a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; program that generated all possible programs then ran them. I would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then know that on some subset of those programs I've got conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observers. My program is considerably simpler than your program for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generating a conscious observer, it just takes a lot longer to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; run.
</em><br />
<br />Okay, thanks for that idea. But there is still the problem of
<br />
measure to you, no?  (I know Bruno has other ideas, and has
<br />
explained them, and I think that there are a lot of ways people
<br />
have spoken of regarding how to assign measure. Where are you?)
<br />
<br />That is, the UD will devote less than 1/10^10^10^10 of its resources
<br />
to &quot;running&quot; the first conscious observer on the list of *all* TMs.
<br />
On the other hand, I could believe that the rarity of a program
<br />
DEVOTED TO RUNNING ME or (more regrettably, some other conscious
<br />
entity) might be less than that.  I.e., maybe only one in 10^^3.
<br />
But more sensibly: d'you think that Schmidhuber or anyone has made
<br />
a very good case why the UD would give me more runtime (i.e.
<br />
observer-moments) than a specialized devoted program (which must
<br />
also exist in Platonia)?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So it takes much less information to compute everything than it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does to compute one particular universe. I'm guessing the UD in its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; most compact form is the simplest program for computing a conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer! (know of any others?). And it is simpler than most of those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bitstrings appearing in its computational history.
</em><br />
<br />Yes.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; [Lee]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Well, I think that David Deutsch's version includes all our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; latest and best physical theories, which still includes the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Schrödinger equation and other time-based foundations. I'm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; guessing that the universes (I mean *slices*) are real; that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is, have a higher ontological status than completely unrelated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; snapshots. But that would be just a guess.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; As for me, the whole multiverse as well as any slice strongly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; exhibits a dependence on time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I might be misunderstanding, but neither the multiverse as a whole nor
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any slice of it is time-dependent.
</em><br />
<br />The laws of physics link snapshots of places with higher time
<br />
clock readings with those with lower readings. I think that in
<br />
FoR, slices *are* spacetimes, and are objectively linked together
<br />
just as the pieces in a crossword puzzle are even though it's
<br />
still in the can.
<br />
<br />Thus the linkage is dictated by the laws of physics.  And almost
<br />
all of those have this little parameter t in them. It seems to
<br />
me that this might afford time a special role.
<br />
<br />But I'm still busy re-reading the chapter on Time; I know that
<br />
I once agreed with every word, and thought that I understood it.
<br />
But I'm a lot less sure now.
<br />
<br />Lee
