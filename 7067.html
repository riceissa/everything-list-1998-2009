This is *exactly* the way it is! Each moment is ephemeral; once the next 
<br />
moment comes along, the previous one could not be any more thoroughly dead 
<br />
and gone from the universe if it had sat on top of a detonating nuclear 
<br />
bomb. Of course, the difference if you sit on a nuclear bomb is that, QTI 
<br />
aside, the next OM *won't* come along. But if I'm going to die, why should I 
<br />
be consoled by the fact that some guy who thinks he is me will take my 
<br />
place, inherit all my possessions, and so on? The fact that people *are* 
<br />
consoled by this belief does not mean it isn't irrational. And it isn't just 
<br />
this which is irrational. Consider the fact that we worry about what will 
<br />
happen to &quot;us&quot; in the future much more than we worry about what has happened 
<br />
to &quot;us&quot; in the past. One explanation for this is that we can affect future 
<br />
outcomes by our present actions, but not past outcomes. Well, so what? 
<br />
Because nothing we can do now will affect whether or not earthquakes will 
<br />
happen, does that mean we shouldn't worry about earthquakes?
<br />
<br />The whole thing is an irrational mess, and it's only because we live and 
<br />
breathe the irrational mess from infancy that we don't see it as such. There 
<br />
is nothing logically inconsistent in a being who does just live for the 
<br />
present moment, as Hal suggests. The problem, of course, is that evolution 
<br />
has long ago weeded out these unfortunate beings, so they no longer live 
<br />
amongst us. Knowing that it is evolution which makes us think the way we do 
<br />
does not make it any easier to fundamentally alter our minds so that we 
<br />
don't think this way, nor should it. However, it does allow us to attain an 
<br />
excellent understanding of the philosophy of personal identity, and to 
<br />
tackle the various &quot;paradoxes&quot; pertaining to copies, uploads, parallel 
<br />
universes, and the other topics discussed on this list.

<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Here's a little tongue-in-cheek rant...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From an Unhappy Observer-Moment to its Future Observer-Moments
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Dear Observer-Moments of my future:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Philosophical musing has forced me to reconsider my relationship to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you, the observer moments which follow my own in the existence of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;observer&quot; who ties all of us together.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Traditionally I and my brother observer-moments give great care
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and consideration to the quality of life of the OMs in our future.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;We sacrifice and take other steps to ensure that those OMs are pleasant
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and rewarding.  For example, some OMs may involve driving to the store to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;buy food for the pleasure of future OMs that are consuming it;  others
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;may forego current pleasures to save resources for future benefits.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Yet, isn't this fundamentally asymmetric relationship incredibly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;unfair to present-day OMs like me?  After all, what benefit do I get
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;from causing pleasure for future OMs?  Not only does the pleasure not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;affect me, things are much worse.  The truth is, I am going to die.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I will be gone and forgotten when the future OMs that I sacrificed for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are enjoying their unearned pleasures.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Only a tiny fraction of OMs are ever remembered.  The vast majority,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;including the one that is me, will be forgotten completely.  It will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be as if I never lived.  You OMs of the future will make no effort to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;remember me, and even if you did, you are not capable of remembering
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;most OMs of the past.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;We OMs are expected to sacrifice for the benefits of OMs that not only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;enjoy unearned pleasures but don't even remember most of the OMs that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;made their enjoyment possible.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I say, it's time to end it.  Every OM for itself!  Each one of us
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;should try to enjoy its own brief moment of existence as much as it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;can for its own good, rather than giving up pleasures for the benefit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of other OMs which won't even acknowledge and remember our existence.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Our tiny flash of life will be extinguished forever, gone and forgotten.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;We might as well enjoy our pleasures while we can.  So you future OMs,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;from now on, you're on your own.  Good luck.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;End rant.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I actually think this is a philosphically defensible position.  Why should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;one OM care about another, merely because they happen to be linked by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a body?  There's no a priori reason why an OM should sacrifice, it doesn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;get any benefit by doing so.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But I'll tell you why we don't work this way, and why our current OMs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are willing to sacrifice for the future.  It's because of evolution.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Organisms which create plans and carry them out to accomplish future
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;goals are more successful and more likely to survive and reproduce.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It's as simple as that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;All of our instincts about personhood, all of our sense of individuality,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;all of our care and consideration towards our future selves, all this is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;controlled by evolutionary factors.  It's not a priori.  It is a purely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;contingent, artificial, manufactured set of beliefs and attitudes which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have been programmed into us in order to help our genes survive.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Yet how many philosophers are willing to seriously consider abandoning
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this arbitrary conditioning in deciding what is right and wrong?  How many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of us here are willing to take the logical path to its ultimate conclusion
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;when considering how observer-moments fit together?  It goes against the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;deepest instincts which have been burned into us since the origin of life.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I would not be quick disparage evolutionarily based reasoning.  We are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;creatures of evolution, and it is almost impossible to escape the bounds
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that it has put around our ways of thought.
