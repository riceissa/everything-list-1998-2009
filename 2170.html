<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible for me to visit this prisoner. The prisoner can, from time to =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time, also visit us in the following way. At certain times the prisoner =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is allowed into a room. In this room the computer simulates a virtual =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality apparatus. When the prisoner gets into the apparatus, he can =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; control a ``real=B4=B4 robot wandering in my room. This is thus virtual =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality ``the other way around=B4=B4. It would now be very difficult to =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deny that the prisoner has consciousness.=20
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; An interesting question can now be asked: Does the prisoner only exist =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; when the computer is simulating his universe, or does his universe exist =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; independently of our universe and simulating his universe simply means =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that we can take look at his universe and even interact with him?=20
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If the latter is true then clearly all possible universes exist =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; independently of each other. We can then ask why we find ourselves in =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this universe instead of the rather boring universe of the prisoner. I =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think that this must follow from probabilistic arguments. It may be that =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all universes are, in some sense, equally likely a priory. The =
</em><br />
<br />The most logical a priori distribution is the Solomon-Levi, or
<br />
Universal Prior - see discussion in the everything list archives, or
<br />
Schmidhuber's paper. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; probability that we find ourselves in a particular universe would then =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be given by an appropriate conditional probability. When we refer to our =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe we actually refer to a large class of universes, because we =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't have complete knowledge of our universe (we can only store a =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; finite amount of information in our brains). So, given the knowledge we =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do have, we live in a large number of universes ``simultaneously=B4=B4, =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and the number of ``equivalent=B4=B4 universes increases with its size. =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We should thus ask for the probability that we live in any of the =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; equivalent universes. It is thus clear that ``our=B4=B4 universe is =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; infinitely more likely than the prisoner`s universe.=20
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />This is not actually the correct argument. The prisoner's universe 
<br />
contains less information than ours, therefore ought to have higher
<br />
measure according to the universal prior. The trick to realise is that
<br />
most of the information in our universe is due to contingency - in our
<br />
universe we started with a very simple description of how a universe
<br />
should evolve (the Shroedinger's equation, lets say), and a simple
<br />
initial condition (a very small, very dense, very hot sphere of gas
<br />
let's say) and let the whole thing evolve. Darwinian evolution can be
<br />
considered to be a natural &quot;Maxwell's Daemon&quot;, soaking information up
<br />
into the system that is evolving. Physics is also evolving in a
<br />
similar way, with the Anthropic Principle playing the equivalent part
<br />
to natural selection, and chance playing the part of variation.
<br />
<br />The prisoner's universe, however, is likely to be highly arbitrary,
<br />
with many features added in by the programmer to make the environment
<br />
interesting. The features are not &quot;compressible&quot;, in the sense of
<br />
arising from the natural dynamics of the system.
<br />
<br />Hence the prisoner's environment is more complex (in a Kolmogorov
<br />
sense), therefore has lower measure in the space of universes.
<br />
<br />I discuss these ideas in two of my papers &quot;Why Occam's razor&quot;, and
<br />
&quot;Evoltuon in the Multiverse&quot;, which you can get from my website.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Interestingly this fits in well with observational evidence that our =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe is flat. From the arguments I gave above, you would expect that =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the universe is spatially open, because such an universe has an infinite =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; volume. This infinite volume also cause me to exist in an infinite =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; number of places simultaneously in a single universe, because the =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probability that somewhere an intelligent being emerges that has stored =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in his brain the same information as in my brain is extremely small but =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; strictly larger than zero due to the finiteness of the amount of =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information that can be stored in the brain. It would, of course, =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessarily be the case that this intelligent being is very, very =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; similar to me and that he lives on a planet which is very similar to the =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; earth.=20
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now it would be reasonable to expect that an universe where the density =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of ``copies=B4=B4 of me is larger is more probable. By increasing the =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter density of the universe I can increase the number of copies of =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; myself, but if the matter density becomes too large then the universe =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would be spatially closed. Therefore it is reasonable to expect that we =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; live in a flat universe.=20
</em><br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I was about to poohoo this idea when I realised there was a subtlety
<br />
to it. Presumably, you are talking about an ensemble of universes,
<br />
some open, some closed. Of interest is the measure of sentient beings
<br />
over this ensemble. I can see why an open universe should have greater
<br />
measure than a closed one, because a closed universe must only have a
<br />
finite number of sentient objects, compared with the countably
<br />
infinite number of such objects in an open universe. However, I don't
<br />
really follow your arguments as to why this measure should be maximised
<br />
in the flat universe case. A countably infinite number is the same as
<br />
a countable infinite number, regardless of matter density.
<br />
<br />Also, you must be careful, as the closed universe can contain black
<br />
holes, whose interiors are complete universes in themselves. You would
<br />
need to ensure that the total volume of the closed universe,
<br />
_including_ all daughter universes was finite for the argument to
<br />
work. Similarly, you must assume that there is a particular &quot;Mother&quot;
<br />
universe that started the whole thing off, otherwise if there were an
<br />
infinite heirarchy of such parent universes than again the argument is
<br />
blown.
