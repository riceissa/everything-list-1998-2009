</em><br />
<br />That is indeed saying just the same thing (though the language is 
<br />
slightly different).
<br />
<br />The important part of modal logic is not in the &quot;accessible from this 
<br />
one&quot; or &quot;it is possible&quot; language.
<br />
<br />Rather, the &quot;forking paths&quot; (a la Borges) picture that is described by 
<br />
posets and lattices.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; There can be no implication from one world to the other. That is, we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; can't say &quot;A implies B&quot; or &quot;B implies A.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What does that have to do with my question? Anyway A and B are supposed 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be worlds here, not propositions, so of course you can't say &quot;A implies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; B&quot;. I don't know what point you're trying to make here.
</em><br />
<br />Worlds _are_ propositions. And the &quot;causal operator&quot; (time) is the same 
<br />
as implication.
<br />
<br />With some important caveats that I can't easily explain without drawing 
<br />
a picture. In conventional logic, implication is fully-contained or 
<br />
defined from some event A (or perhaps some combination of events A, B, 
<br />
C, etc., all causally contributing to a later event).
<br />
<br />There are two interesting cases to consider where implication does not 
<br />
follow so easily from A:
<br />
<br />1. Possible worlds. The event A forks down two (or more) possible paths. 
<br />
A future where war occurs, a future where war does not. A future where 
<br />
Fermat's Last Theorem is proved to be true. A future where it is not. A 
<br />
future of heads, a future of tails.
<br />
<br />2. Quantum mechanics. Schrodinger's cat.
<br />
<br />(It was Einstein and Podolsky's belief that classical logic must apply 
<br />
that led to their belief that there _must_ be some other cause, some 
<br />
hidden variable, that makes the outcome follow classical logic. Bohm, 
<br />
too. But we know from Bell's Theorem and the Kochen-Specker &quot;no-go&quot; 
<br />
theorems that, basically, these hidden variables are not extant.)
<br />
<br />(By the way, the book &quot;Interpreting the Quantum World,&quot; by Jeffrey Bub, 
<br />
has an interesting section on how modal logic applies to QM.)
<br />
<br />Bruno is much more of a logician than I am, but the various terms of 
<br />
logic, lattices, and set theory are analogous (probably a very efficient 
<br />
category theory metaview, but I don't yet know it).
<br />
<br />1 is True
<br />
0 is False
<br />
lattice infimum or Boolean meet, ^ , is conjunction (AND)
<br />
lattice supremum or Boolean join, v , is disjunction (OR)
<br />
lattice or Boolean orthocomplement is negation (NOT)
<br />
<br />(Understanding this is not essential to my arguments here...I just 
<br />
wanted to make the point that there are mappings between the languages 
<br />
of logic, set theory, and lattices. In a deep sense, they are all the 
<br />
same thing. Definitions do matter, of course, but e-mail is not a great 
<br />
place to lay out long lists of definitions!)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; This branching future is exactly what I was talking about a week or so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ago in terms of &quot;partially ordered sets.&quot; If the order relationship is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;occurs before or at the same time as,&quot; which is equivalent to &quot;less
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; than or equal to,&quot; A and B cannot be linearly ordered. In fact, since
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; both A and B are completely different states, neither can be said to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; a predecessor or parent of the other. In fact, A and B are not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; comparable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm with you so far in this paragraph.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; We cannot say &quot;A or not-A.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now I'm lost again. Again A is a world not a proposition so what 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would &quot;A
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or not-A&quot; mean even if A and B are comparable?
</em><br />
<br />The two forks in the road are given the same truth value weighting in 
<br />
this &quot;possible worlds&quot; approach.
<br />
<br />We have _assumed_ A in this fork I described, so &quot;not-A&quot; is certainly 
<br />
not necessarily the other path. In fact, the meaningful interpretation 
<br />
of &quot;not-A&quot; in the complement sense is &quot;that which precedes A,&quot; that is, 
<br />
the events leading up to A in this world.
<br />
<br />I realize this sounds confusing. Draw a picture. Just have three points 
<br />
in it, arranged in a triangle:
<br />
<br />A           B
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\       /
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X
<br />
<br />Time is in the upward direction. The points/events/states X, A, B form a 
<br />
poset. One arrow between any two points. Pre-ordering (reflexive, 
<br />
transitive) and partial-ordering (reflexive, transitive, antisymmetric).
<br />
<br />We cannot, however, say &quot;X implies A&quot; because X has given rise to _both_ 
<br />
A and B.
<br />
<br />Besides the possible worlds situation, where we &quot;assume&quot; X could give 
<br />
rise to either of these events, there is also the distinct possibility 
<br />
that this will be the only logic we ever know for quantum mechanics. The 
<br />
situation X gives rise to either the cat being dead or alive at the time 
<br />
we make the measurement, and it makes no logical sense to sense that 
<br />
&quot;but there must be some hidden cause because nature works by Boolean or 
<br />
Aristotelian logic.&quot;
<br />
<br />Further, this situation describes many cases of incomplete knowledge. As 
<br />
Lee Smolin and Fotini Markopoulou have pointed out so  convincingly, 
<br />
there are events outside our light cone which will combine in various 
<br />
ways with other events to produce futures which look exactly like these 
<br />
posets and lattices. (I described this in some detail in some earlier 
<br />
posts.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If anyone else understand the point Tim is making please help me out...
</em><br />
<br />I hope my various posts this morning have helped. If not, I attribute 
<br />
this mainly to our inability to communicate with drawings on a 
<br />
blackboard and to different backgrounds. It may be that we are seeing 
<br />
things exactly the same way, just using different terminology.
