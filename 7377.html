I  reply to Prof. Pruss:
<br />
<br />BH: I have the vague suspicion here that by using words like
<br />
physical/matter/concrete/chunk, you're skirting the issue of how worlds are
<br />
specified in the general case, by narrowing the scope to worlds whose only
<br />
constituents are material -- literally, having mass and occupying space.
<br />
What about worlds consisting of a single point of space, populated by
<br />
(soul-like?) entities whose (of course non-spatial) internal specifications
<br />
and external relationships change over time?  I fear you're taking a
<br />
short-cut that relies on our intuition that ordinary baryonic matter has a
<br />
privileged and obvious and natural way to be specified.
<br />
<br />AP:  The question of whether two chunks of matter are the same surely has
<br />
little to do with specifications.
<br />
<br />You just did it again. Would you still say &quot;surely&quot; if in your statement you
<br />
replace &quot;chunks of matter&quot; with &quot;souls&quot; or &quot;spirits&quot; or &quot;logically possible
<br />
entities&quot;?
<br />
<br />AP: just as a world should be able to contain s-t-disconnected regions,
<br />
there is nothing impossible about it containing causally disconnected
<br />
regions, unless God necessarily exists (which Lewis doesn't think, but I
<br />
do).
<br />
<br />If two spacetime-disconnected regions are causally disconnected (such that
<br />
none of the events in each has any possibility of influence on any events in
<br />
the other), then it seems pure artifice to say the regions are in the same
<br />
world. You could as easily say that all possible events in all possible
<br />
worlds are in fact in the same world.
<br />
<br />AP: But what, then, ARE the worlds?  Are they IDENTICAL with their
<br />
specifications?  Or are they concrete entities?  If they are identical with
<br />
their specifications, then I do not see how to meaningfully formulate
<br />
Lewis's extreme modal realism: We would have to say something like that the
<br />
specifications are all true or something like that, and we can't do that
<br />
without contradiction since the specifications contradict one another.
<br />
<br />I'm not sure how Lewis's extreme modal realism is inconsistent with a world
<br />
being identical with the class of specifications that do an equally good job
<br />
of specifying it. If two specifications contradict each other, they surely
<br />
specify different worlds, right?
<br />
<br />What are the worlds?  I would say they are of the same ontological category
<br />
as numbers. If our universe can be fully specified by a (possibly infinite)
<br />
bit string, then there is a sense in which it is irrelevant whether or not
<br />
ours is a &quot;concrete&quot; world that &quot;really&quot; exists. Here's something
<br />
&lt;<a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;selm=3A5F7AF9.A306AAE%40eng.sun.c">http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;selm=3A5F7AF9.A306AAE%40eng.sun.c</a>
<br />
om&gt; I wrote a few years ago that gives a flavor of what I mean: 
<br />
<br />Consider gliders in Conway's game of Life.  Even if nobody ever wrote down
<br />
the rules of Life, gliders would still be a logical consequent of certain
<br />
possible configurations of the logically possible game of Life. It has been
<br />
proven that Life is rich enough to instantiate a Turing machine, which are
<br />
of course known to be able to compute anything computable. So if mind is
<br />
computable, consider a configuration of Life that instantiates a Turing
<br />
machine that instantiates some mind.
<br />
<br />Consider the particular Life configuration in which that mind eventually
<br />
comes to ask itself &quot;why is there something instead of nothing?&quot;.  Even if
<br />
in our universe no such Life configuration is ever instantiated, that
<br />
particular configuration would still be logically possible, and the asking
<br />
of the Big Why would still be a virtual event in the logically possible
<br />
universe of that Life configuration.  The epiphenomenal quality of that
<br />
event for that logically possible mind would surely be the same, regardless
<br />
of whether our universe ever actually ran that Life configuration. So the
<br />
answer to that mind's Big Why would be: because your existence is logically
<br />
possible.
<br />
<br />So pop up a level, and consider that you are that mind, and that your
<br />
universe too is just a (highly complex) logically possible state machine.
<br />
In that case, the answer to your Big Why would be the same. 
<br />
<br />Note that, while the Life thought experiment depends on mind being
<br />
computable, the logically possible universe (LPU) thought experiment only
<br />
assumes that our universe could be considered as a logically possible
<br />
sequence of (not necessarily finitely describable) universe-states.  The LPU
<br />
hypothesis also depends on the thesis that physicalism is right and that
<br />
qualia and consciousness are epiphenomena.
<br />
<br />So if EVERY universe &quot;really is&quot; something like the possible universe
<br />
described above, then what you talk of as &quot;concreta&quot; isn't fundamentally
<br />
very concrete after all, and talk of concreteness and tangibility and
<br />
materiality isn't very helpful in deciding whether two similar universes are
<br />
identical. Instead, identity becomes more a question of whether there is a
<br />
certain sort of equivalence between the specifications of the two universes.
<br />
There may be lots of ways to specify the number seven, but that doesn't mean
<br />
there are multiple copies of it.
<br />
<br />AP: Is a world which consists of a particle of type A one meter apart from a
<br />
particle of type B, neither of which ever moves, distinct from a world which
<br />
consists of a particle of type B one meter apart from a particle of type A,
<br />
neither of which ever moves?
<br />
<br />No.
<br />
<br />AP: What I am getting at is that if one thinks in terms of descriptions, it
<br />
would make more sense to identify worlds with equivalence classes of
<br />
descriptions than with individual descriptions.
<br />
<br />Precisely!  What I've meant all along by a &quot;specification&quot; of a universe has
<br />
to do with a certain sort of equivalence class among possible descriptions,
<br />
abstracting over differences like the font size in which the description is
<br />
written. I don't know enough about Kolmogorov-complexity to know whether
<br />
what I would consider the same universe can have multiple minimal
<br />
K-specifications.
<br />
<br />AP: Lewis is wrong to suppose the numbers are equal.  To get that, he needs
<br />
to assume that there is an upper bound on the cardinality of things in a
<br />
world, but his reasons for supposing such an upper bound are wrong.  He
<br />
neglects the possibility that there may be multiple things, even infinitely
<br />
many, at one point in s-t.
<br />
<br />I agree it would be wrong to assume that there can only be one thing at one
<br />
point in spacetime.
<br />
<br />I clearly need to learn more about infinite measures, but my intuition is
<br />
still that apparently regular worlds should predominate over apparently
<br />
irregular worlds, even if apparently irregular worlds predominate over
<br />
worlds that in fact contain neither apparent nor non-apparent
<br />
irregularities. I've yet to hear (or at least understand) anything that
<br />
contradicts this intuition.
