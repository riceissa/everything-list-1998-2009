Hi John,

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is applied in whoever's theory - as 'his' truth.
</em><br />
<br />I think you are perhaps confusing provable (in a theory), and truth  
<br />
(of possible statements assertable in the theory). A theory does not  
<br />
known &quot;his&quot; complete truth.
<br />
Being realist on the arithmetical statement is an admission of  
<br />
ignorance in arithmetic. We accept that truth extends the mean of our  
<br />
brains, theories, systems, etc.
<br />
I hope I can clarify this later for you. It is weird, and not easy to  
<br />
explain without providing details.
<br />
Reality is beyond fiction and when you make attempt to be just honest  
<br />
(and may be false), then &quot;reality looks crackpot&quot; ...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am in trouble with the &quot;Church Thesis&quot;, it seems to be anchored in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the math of functions and applied to comp.science. (BTW &quot;recursive  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; functions&quot; pointing back to themselves? a restriction into what has  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; been known (already)?  I may have the wrong idea (if any) about the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ch-Th of course.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It may be 'fundamental' in - what I consider - a segment of the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; totality.
</em><br />
<br />For  mathematical reasons, assuming comp, we will have the choice  
<br />
between a non completely knowable totality, or on some necessarily  
<br />
partial, but complete in their domain, &quot;totality&quot;, or sequence of  
<br />
totalities.
<br />
Self-extending totalities are akin to the notion of first person.
<br />
With machines incompleteness makes room for the others (the second and  
<br />
third persons)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I can accept the 'universal machine' as not restricted to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical comp,
</em><br />
<br />This is unclear. Universal machine appears only in that 'apparently  
<br />
restricted digital world'. remember that after Gödel, we can no more  
<br />
be sure that digitality is a restriction. Gödel signed the  
<br />
reductionist conception of numbers. Assuming comp, we know that we are  
<br />
either insane or very limited. And then UDA shows that the physical  
<br />
worlds arise 'logically' from our limitations (where &quot;us&quot; = the Lobian  
<br />
machine/entity, not the humans).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; it definitely should not apply those binary-slanted algorithms. I  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consider it as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some analogue 'think-tank' beyond our present terms.
</em><br />
<br />That is the case for all theory. Science is modest.
<br />
<br />(and in AUDA all 08 hypostases are derivable from the Löb 'modesty'  
<br />
formula B(Bp-&gt;p)-&gt;Bp, I say this for those who have follows some post,  
<br />
or read Smullyan's or Boolos (or Smorynski) book on the logic of  
<br />
provability/consistency.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Whatever I would try to characterize it with, is MY restriction to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; its unlimited capabilites. So I don't.
</em><br />
<br />You are a universal machine, John. I can prove it, and I can even show  
<br />
that, as far as you are sound, you are Löbian. This means you can know  
<br />
that your are, at least, a universal machine. And this will be used  
<br />
negatively, in some way. Because Universal machine are very limited.  
<br />
They are under the jug of many limitation theorems.
<br />
<br />In the arithmetical interpretation of Plotinus theology. Universal  
<br />
machine corresponds to what Plotinus call &quot;man&quot;, 'or reasoner&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno, is your own restriction  concentrated to 'physics' with  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'math' as in:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (&quot;All theories in physics use at least that arithmetical  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fragment....&quot;)?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Not here. I am just making the quasi obvious remark that physicist  
<br />
needs the concept of number, or anything equivalent (like real numbers  
<br />
+ trigonometry)  in their theory.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I love your extension of 'metaphors' (bosons) into galaxies and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brains. They certainly are, included into our presently valid  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;perceived reality&quot; of figments.
</em><br />
<br />Yes. With comp, brains, galaxies, atoms, still exists, but not as  
<br />
first order citizens. This is not obvious, and is the conclusion of  
<br />
UDA. This is so counter-intuitive that I have no problem with those  
<br />
who takes this as a reason to doubt  comp. Without the Everett-QM  
<br />
confirmation, I would have believed that this is close to a refutation  
<br />
of comp.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Scientists do not commit themselves ontologically....&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Most - (especially the conventional ones) do.
</em><br />
<br />This is due to the abandon of theology (the fundamental science) by  
<br />
academy to temporal political power. Atheists and Christians are ally  
<br />
against the reintroduction of non confessional theology in the  
<br />
academy. This explains why there is a still widespread belief that  
<br />
science can do ontological commitment. But then it is no more science  
<br />
but &quot;religion&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I find it a restriction of the total into the so far experienced  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; portion - even  to the adjusted format of those - serving as the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'entirety this 'ontology' is based on.  I would love to device an  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ontology for the 'totality' - that would explain lots of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; questionmarks we still have in our ignorance (the how-s, why-s, and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the other 1000 to be modest).
</em><br />
<br />Comp provides a vast range of acceptable and equivalent *hypothetical*  
<br />
ontology.
<br />
The hypothetical ontology of comp is a subset of all scientific  
<br />
theories today.
<br />
<br />This has nothing to do with the fact that comp entails that we can  
<br />
stop speculating on matter. Even if matter exists, it would be an  
<br />
epiphenomenon, or better, an epinoumenon. Almost exactly like  
<br />
invisible horses driving the cars. But this should not be considered  
<br />
as obvious. It is a consequence of comp which needs some reasoning.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am not sure about the 'excluded middle' since that is excluded  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from a mere segment we consider 'them all' while the entire set may  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; include quite another middle. (My usual objection against  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; statistical conclusions and probabilities of course, that are mere  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; illusions of our human ways of anticipatory thinking).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I intended this reflection to be 'positive' to your ideas, as  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; considered them in more ways than just 'arithmetically  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; based' (numbers?).
</em><br />
<br />I will try to reassure you about the idea that &quot;arithmetically based&quot;  
<br />
could be a reductionism, or a restriction. On the contrary, this idea  
<br />
leads to the idea that universal machine should have the right to vote  
<br />
(to put the things in this way). With the discovery of the universal  
<br />
machine, there is a sense to say that now we really have a better view  
<br />
on our ignorance, which appears to be larger than what we could ever  
<br />
have conceived before the work of Cantor, Kleene, etc.
<br />
<br />The universal machine is not the solution of our problems. The  
<br />
universal machine *is* our problem.  (Assuming comp/CTM).
<br />
<br />I think that I will have to make a little detour into other  
<br />
&quot;impossibility theorem&quot;. I can already hear you saying that an  
<br />
impossibility theorem is impossible, because impossible could be a  
<br />
relative notion. But this is not the case, mathematics kicks back, and  
<br />
many things are just impossible, sometimes absolutely impossible, and  
<br />
sometimes we can prove it to ourself (assuming our consistency).
<br />
<br />You cannot prove that an impossibility theorem is not possible,  
<br />
because if you prove that, you are proving an impossibility theorem!
<br />
<br />Of course we need some faith, that 00 is different from 1, for example,  
<br />
but not much more. I intend to show that the principle of excluded  
<br />
middle can be seen as a tolerance-of-ignorance principle. As I said to  
<br />
Brent a long time ago, the excluded middle principle is more a rule of  
<br />
politeness among persons than a platonic reality. With comp, it  
<br />
reveals, in 'Arithmetica', incredible and innumerous unknown forms of  
<br />
'living entities', and some incredible mess, too. The Mandelbrot set  
<br />
provides some partial illustration of that phenomenon(*).
<br />
<br />Bruno
<br />
<br /><br />(*) You may enjoy this interpenetration of two parts of the M set. M  
<br />
invades itself, as you can see when zooming on the border of a little  
<br />
Mandelbrot. As in this &quot;dezoom&quot;:

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I just make explicit that elementary true arithmetical statements are

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; part of the theory. You are free to interpret them in a formlaistic
