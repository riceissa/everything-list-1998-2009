<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; given the singular incorrigibility of first-person 'experiential
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; reality' - concludes that though whatever underlies remains forever
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; *unknowable* it must nonetheless perforce be 'real in the sense that I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; am real' (RITSIAR - a gnomic acronym that has surfaced before on this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; list).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Hmm... OK. Nice. Not completely convinced yet.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let's try to be clear(!)  I don't intend 'RITSIAR' to refer merely to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the 1-person, but to the 0-person and all the other persons you can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think of.  Why?  Because given that &quot;I&quot; am indubitably RITSIAR, then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whatever &quot;I&quot; emerge from must also subsist in a status that is also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; RITSIAR in some uneliminable *ontological* sense.  Naturally I don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intend by this that either the One, or 3-person descriptions,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; literally call themselves &quot;I&quot;, but rather that what is ontologically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; RITSIAR in the 1-person is irreducibly so in the whole, and vice
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; versa.  As an analogy, if - merely for the sake of argument - we were
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to choose to ascribe fundamental 'materiality' to the world', then we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; also must consistently hold that all and any constituent parts and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sub-wholes subsist in ontological 'materiality' by the same token.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not to do this would be equivalent to accepting sudden non-linear
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; step-changes in *ontological* status merely as a function of scale -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which AFAICS is incoherent - i.e. I wouldn't have a clue what this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could possibly mean.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't want us to talk past each other merely on the basis of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; incommensurable jargon - if there's anything I can do to make this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point clearer, I'll go on trying.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; 1) The unknowable is singular (i.e symmetrical, holistic, indivisible:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; e.g. Plotinus' One)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;unknowable&quot;?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; or unprovable, uncommunicable, that is unbelievable,  unjustifiable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here I'm saying that the *undifferentiated* One is unknowable, because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'knowing' is here posited precisely to subsist in differentiated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ways-of-being adopted by the One *posterior* to its bare,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; undifferentiated 'presence'.  Hence, this 'bare presence' or personal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ground is a priori both unknowing and unknowable.  
</em><br />
<br />If I understand you correctly, this is similar to the explication of &quot;I&quot; by 
<br />
Thomas Metzinger in his book &quot;The Ego Tunnel&quot;.  He expresses it as the self 
<br />
being transparent.  We look *through* it but not *at* it, and necessarily so.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;'Knowledge'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subsists in the multiplicity of distinguished ways-of-being that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emerge from the bare presence of the One: i.e.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'getting-a-grip-on-Oneself'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The excluded middle principle is what you need to think and dream
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; about what you build, and what can follow, and talk on it with others.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; You need it somehow to believe in another one. Also, it prevents not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the falsity of solipsism, but the falsity of any doctrinal (3-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; communicable) solipsism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm not abandoning the principle, rather I was pointing to the fact
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that in analysis at this level, there is something deeply mysterious -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; apparently paradoxical in terms of mutually exclusive 'opposites' -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about a 'seamless' unity nevertheless being 'differentiable'.  As a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter of personal psychological compulsion, I feel it necessary to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point this out, to forestall someone else asking &quot;how can you claim
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that 'parts' ultimately subsist in the context of a 'seamless' whole?&quot;
</em><br />
<br />This paradox arises in quantum cosmogony.  The universe (or multiverse) evolves 
<br />
as the rotation of a single ray in Hilbert space.  But relativistic horizons 
<br />
separate different local projections so that we see decohered, classical objects 
<br />
(and we are such objects).  At least that's the speculation - there is both 
<br />
unity and diversity: different aspects of the wave-function of the universe 
<br />
which is unknowable.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  If you like, I consider myself to be a sort of dualist in this sense:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that there seems to me ultimately to be an inescapable duality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (meaning two irreducible ways of being) between intuitions of 'whole'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and 'part'.  Once we have reasoned as far as we can in terms of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'ultimates', we're left with nothing to 'separate' the 'whole' into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'parts'.  If we believe we can 'actually' *sever* the 'whole', what do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we suppose 'lies between' the 'parts' (e.g. the old notion of 'atoms
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the void')?  Nothing?  One may simply say that this of course is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the well known tension between intuitions of the 'continuous' and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'discrete'.  But at this level of discourse, there seems to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something wrong that can't be fixed by invoking higher-order 'limit'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theories unavailable even in principle at this depth of analysis.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Nonetheless, the unknowable - unknowably - somehow resolves this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; paradox.  But maybe I'm the only one who cares about this.  Or maybe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it's just gibberish.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; 8) Taken together, 5, 06 and 07 collapse into a basic intuition of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; existence as - always and everywhere - constituted by a 'personal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; self-actualisation' which is posited to be characteristic of reality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; 'from the ground up'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ? This belongs to the incommunicable part. If you communicate it, you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; bet on the existence of someone else, and on something sharable. But
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; then you do science, and in honest science you share only doubts.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Do you see what I see?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Do you believe what I believe?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hm, I think there may be a misstep in emphasis here.  The key
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intuition, which I was deriving step-by-step up to that point, is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whatever it is that we take to be 'real' or 'existent' - and by that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; token fundamentally RITSIAR - must thereby be both 'personally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; present' and 'self-actualising'.  
</em><br />
<br />You make the self fundamental, but is it so.  Maybe the self is a mathematical 
<br />
construct or a statistical ensemble or experiences.  RITSIAR may not be real in 
<br />
the ontology of the best theory.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;In my terms, this would have to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so whether we take RITSIAR to be based on Number, 'matter' or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; spiritual green cheese.  I agree this isn't science, and hence is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'immodest' or theological - or guesswork.  But nevertheless I can't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; make any sense out of science or any other attempt to account for what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I (or you) see or what I (or you) believe unless I ground this in such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intuitions.  Can't help it.  And you're going to say 'yes, the Lobian
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine would say exactly that'!  But does that mean that such an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intuition isn't in some deep sense foundational?  And hence that it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - in that foundational sense - explanatorily 'true'?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I prefere the phrasing &quot;is the truth of an arithmetical statement,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; like &quot;there is no biggest prime number&quot; true (or false) dependent of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; you?&quot; I don't think it is RITSIAR, although only RITSIAR can really
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; appreciate it here and now.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, I know you prefer this phrasing, and I'm going to say that this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is the nub of some of the most intractable debates that have gone on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in this list since it started.  The burden of what I've been arguing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; above is that if you want to ground reality, existence, being or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whatever cognate you like on any intuition whatsoever, then that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intuition must be credibly RITSIAR - not merely 1-person subsets of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it, but the whole 0-person superset. If RITSIAR isn't there from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; start - i.e. if it's not the basic ontology - then it can't be 'jammed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in' at a later stage.  
</em><br />
<br />But that's where I would appeal to two different senses of &quot;basic&quot;.  Basic to 
<br />
epistemology is perception/intuition/experience/cognition.  But based on that 
<br />
knowledge one may develop theory in which the ontology is different.  Physics 
<br />
gains knowledge from physicists looking at records and instrument readings.  But 
<br />
the theory built on this knowledge is in terms of elementary particles and 
<br />
fields.  The positivists wanted to build physics on an ontology of perceptions 
<br />
and instrument readings, but it was not at all fruitful and has been abandoned.
<br />
<br />You are concerned that RITSIAR can't be recovered if it's not asserted in the 
<br />
beginning, but the alternative is that the ontology of the world is real in a 
<br />
different sense than you are real, i.e. &quot;you&quot; are not really real.
<br />
<br />Brent
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Consequently, if you want to rest your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'numerical ontology' on 'truth', then 'truth' is your foundational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; criterion of 'what is RITSIAR': i.e. 'present and self-actualising'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; IOW, it would have to be the case that &quot;I&quot; - the 1-person - and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One in which &quot;I&quot; subsist, are RITSIAR entirely in virtue of such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; present and self-actualising 'truth'.  And moreover such truth is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *necessary* or tautological truth - it doesn't depend on contingent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence in the sense that 'matter' might.  Hence it 'conjures'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; worlds into existence merely in virtue of its truth.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now I'm not at this point (or perhaps at any point) arguing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conclusively against such a notion of 'existence'.  I just want to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; know if you think that this line of argument is invalid or incoherent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and not just that it is 'predictably Lobian'!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; In other words, does this view hold that the ineluctable, independent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; 'necessity' of mathematical 'truth' is capable of, as it were, of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; *invoking* 'what is' - thereby resolving the Wittgensteinian mystery:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;that the world is&quot;?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; With a gap. But with an explanation why there is a gap, and then there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is the beautifulness of the geometry of the gap, and of the nature of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the gap, ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is this a contradiction of what I just said above?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; That is, our discovery of its actual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; presence, prior to time and space, necessarily - radically - excludes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; its non-presence, but nonetheless we retain the intuition (perhaps
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; incoherently) that - counter factually - it 'might not have been thus
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; present'?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I will read this sentence ten times before breakfast. Gosh, that's an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; hard one.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sorry, perhaps I'm making it harder to say than need be.  I'm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contrasting 'contingent existence' - i.e. the fact that we believe 'a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world' to exist when in some sense 'it might not have existed' - with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the kind of 'tautological' or 'arithmetical' necessity that I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; described above.  Perhaps you don't accept the distinction, but it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appears to me that your resting your case on the 'truth' of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical assertions as a proxy for 'existence' is tantamount to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conjuring the world through 'necessity'.  Neat trick.  Maybe right.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dunno.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In my own analysis, as described above, Arithmetical Reality would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; needs be grounded in a foundational 'duality' deriving from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logically prior 'bare presence' of the One.  I would further say that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the presence of the One is contingent: i.e. although its presence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definitively rules out its absence, one still can't say that in such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; absence its presence would have been 'necessary'.  (Note to self -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perhaps this is trying to stretch what is sayable beyond breaking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point).  Thus 'dualised presence', manifesting self-motivatedly and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-referentially, is basic to what is RITSIAR in everything that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; follows.  The schema itself is describable and justifiable within the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; limits you specify in terms of AR etc.  But in the end I would say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that my 'bet' is that this is a descriptive schema the 'realisation'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of which subsists in the 'dualised presence' of the One.  In other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; words, we can't dispense with either theology or science: which is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just fine!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Easy, eh?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I didn't expect this one.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We call this irony!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Sure, nice post. You still seem to reify a bit the third hypostase,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the universal self, the god within. It is an important one, but comp
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; makes it possible to take the ONE as a zero-person being, more like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;the truth&quot; (on the machine). Then the other hypostases &quot;emerge&quot; or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;emanate&quot; (to use Plotinus' word) from it, with their communicable and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; incommunicable statements.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; See what I mean?  When you phrase it as you do above, I feel that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we're 'violently agreeing', except that you insist on the One as being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'more like &quot;the truth&quot; as opposed to 'reification'.  Maybe in the end
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this is just semantics.  Indeed I'm not trying to say that the One is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'any thing'.  I might be content to say that &quot;the truth&quot; equates to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what is present and self-actualising, in the basic senses I attempt to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attribute to it above, and that this is a sufficient basis for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deriving the knowable and provable aspects of 'what is RITSIAR' whilst
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at least being able to refer in some sense to its deeper
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unknowablility.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Personally, I find it useful to start from a more primitive position
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; prior to speculating about the status of say, mathematical formalisms.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Like Schopenhauer, Spinoza, Schrodinger and very many others, I find
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; dualism to founder hopelessly on the rock of interaction and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; explanatory redundancy.  Hence I'm a monist (or a non-dualist) who -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; given the singular incorrigibility of first-person 'experiential
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; reality' - concludes that though whatever underlies remains forever
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; *unknowable* it must nonetheless perforce be 'real in the sense that I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; am real' (RITSIAR - a gnomic acronym that has surfaced before on this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; list).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Hmm... OK. Nice. Not completely convinced yet.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Other primitive intuitions are founded on this:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; 1) The unknowable is singular (i.e symmetrical, holistic, indivisible:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; e.g. Plotinus' One)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;unknowable&quot;?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; or unprovable, uncommunicable, that is unbelievable,  unjustifiable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; 2) The unknowable is pluralistic (asymmetrical, differentiated: i.e.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; pattern and order manifested within the One)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; 3) 01 and 02 taken together are of course 'paradoxical' in the light of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; the logic of the 'excluded middle'.  This, I believe, is not vicious,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; but rather points virtuously towards the limit of such logics.  It
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; situates an unresolvable mystery appropriately, rather than attempting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; speciously to dispel it or ignore it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Hmm... The &quot;excluded middle&quot; is what makes us modest.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It makes possible to prove the existence of some object x by showing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that x belongs to {a, b, c} , without any means to decide which of a,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; b and c x is.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The excluded middle principle is what you need to recognize unknowns
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and capture them in some set, hopefully not to big.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; In the theoretical computer science, and especially in theoretical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; learning many theorems are necessarily non constructive.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; You abandon the excluded middle principle when you want to build
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; something, or extend yourself, with the exclusion of the other.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The excluded middle principle is what you need to think and dream
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; about what you build, and what can follow, and talk on it with others.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; You need it somehow to believe in another one. Also, it prevents not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the falsity of solipsism, but the falsity of any doctrinal (3-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; communicable) solipsism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; 4) 1 and 2 taken together must be RITSIAR.  For me, this comprises the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; intuition that 'existence' is fundamentally - and only - a 'personal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; and present way of being'.  To put it another way, epistemology and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; ontology are enfolded into the unmediated intuition of  'the way one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; is' as follows:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; 5) 1 (uniqueness, symmetry) - relating to an intuition of bare
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; 'reflexive presence' (i.e. the whole is 'present-to-self', as &quot;I am&quot;).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; 6) 2 (asymmetry, differentiation) - relating to orderings of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; 'motivated self-access' (i.e. an intuition that 'presence' manifests
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; in recursive orders of reflexively-intimate self-relativisation.  Note
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; that this vitiates and replaces the notions of 'observation' and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; 'action' and thereby collapses otherwise infinite regresses.  It also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; welds 'causal closure' to an indivisible primitive intuition that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; enfolds - of necessity - both 'perception' and 'intention'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; 7) All subsets of being, as it were - including the first-personal -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; emerge as a consequence of the 'superset of being' (the '0-personal')
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; 'getting a grip on itself' (or better: *oneself*).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Nicely said.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; 8) Taken together, 5, 6 and 7 collapse into a basic intuition of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; existence as - always and everywhere - constituted by a 'personal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; self-actualisation' which is posited to be characteristic of reality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; 'from the ground up'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ? This belongs to the incommunicable part. If you communicate it, you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; bet on the existence of someone else, and on something sharable. But
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; then you do science, and in honest science you share only doubts.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Do you see what I see?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Do you believe what I believe?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; The foregoing treatment attempts to summarise a (well-known: e.g.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Plotinus, Vedanta, etc.) set of intuitions intended to underpin other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; notions of 'existence' in all its forms - i.e. any other postulation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; of 'existence' whatsoever is parasitic on the 'master' intuition that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; whatever 'exists' must be 'personally present as an actualised
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; way-of-being'.  So, in this light, what of the 'existence' of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; mathematics, 'possible' worlds, and other such 'abstractions'?  Well,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; they indeed qualify in this sense (trivially) in the form of our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; shared 'mental constructions'.  But are they additionally present - in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; some other form - *in-their-own-right*?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I prefere the phrasing &quot;is the truth of an arithmetical statement,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; like &quot;there is no biggest prime number&quot; true (or false) dependent of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; you?&quot; I don't think it is RITSIAR, although only RITSIAR can really
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; appreciate it here and now.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; One's view on this will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; clearly depend on the way one's theories (implicit or explicit) posit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; how the particular zoo of worlds, universes etc. one favours emerges
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; from the ground outlined above.  I would dichotomise such views into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; two camps: necessitist and contingentist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; COMP, I think (but I may be off-beam here: see below) falls into the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; first camp.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; OK, at first sight, if I follow you.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;  As far as 'reality' goes in COMP, I'm reasonably sure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; that what Bruno (conceding that he is almost always way ahead of me on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; any of this) implies in the metaphysics (or theology) of COMP, is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; 'arithmetical reality' should be regarded as 'real' and 'present' in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; more or less the sense of 'RITSIAR'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Eh, eh, no! There is gap! But comp, actually the universal machine,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; can explain why a gap is necessary between RITSIAR and the number
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; relation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Hence, the 'Platonic existence'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; that underpins COMP is RITSIAR.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Hmm... I think RITSIAR could correspond to the third hypostase (of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; machine).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; By this I don't mean the 'numbers'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; and 'operators' that we denote verbally or in writing - these of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; course are just a 'way of speaking' - a language.  Rather these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; symbols gesture towards an unknowable domain that nonetheless
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; possesses these characteristics in some (rigorously definable?) sense.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; If we bet on the comp theology. The ability to be reincarnate through
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; a digitalizable machine, then, thanks to theoretical computer science,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; we get a bit of rigor there. Yes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; And this domain is inescapably 'personal' - it is 'us', and it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; everything else, too.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; To each machine we can associate the theology of the machine. The set
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of all true statements on the machine.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; We can associate the science of the machine. The set of all statements
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; provable by the machine on the machine.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; We can associate a notion of knowledge: we say a machine knows p, when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the machine proves p, and p is true.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; And other hypostases, including matter.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The machine can discover the gap between some of those hypostases.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It is not &quot;us&quot;. It is the views of &quot;us&quot;, the universal Lobian
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; machines, the hopefully correct one.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Lobian machine can study the correct theology of simple correct
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; machine, and then lift them on themselves, but this need an act of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; faith, and this one is equivalent with CT+&quot;yes, qua computatio, doctor&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;qua computatio&quot; is important. Someone could say yes to the doctor
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; because he thrusts the doctor, and doesn't want to think on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;metaphysical&quot; problems.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; One astonishing consequence of this schema is that any 'possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; world' derivable from such a RITSIAR intuition of mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; infinities must also be 'real' in this sense (though this is not the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; same as experiential coherence: hence the need to invoke filters such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; as COMP).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Hmm.. in a sense you may be right. Nature has already bet on comp by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; inventing or discovering brains, which filter or project. The machine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; filters reality like COMP filters the set of theories possible. (But
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; any theories does that).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;  This directly implies something like MWI, or at least 'many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; minds', and the radical indeterminacy of the first-person (although
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; this can also be a consequence, in a 'non-computational' and more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; restricted sense, of 'weak' materialism).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; OK. Right. Russell Standish made a similar point, with respect to some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; part of the movie graph. (a pinch of Occam has to be used).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Whether one considers this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; is a defect or an advantage depends on temperament, I believe.  One
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; thing I notice about it, however, is that it seems to ground the idea
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; of 'what is' firmly on *necessity*.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The necessity is the ultimate sharable part. It is as important as the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; non sharable part, which includes things (statements) true for every
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; one, yet non sharable or non communicable as such. The sharable (by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; those who bet on comp) non sharable part.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Bruno has frequently remarked on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; the independence of mathematical truths of anyone's believing them,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; but I'm not quite sure if he means that one should thereby take this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; to transcend all notions of 'contingency'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Not at all. Why? On the contrary it shows that the physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; necessities emerge from a special sum on all the infinitely many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; contingencies.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Necessities and possibilities go in pair.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (there is a Galois connection there)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; In other words, does this view hold that the ineluctable, independent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; 'necessity' of mathematical 'truth' is capable of, as it were, of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; *invoking* 'what is' - thereby resolving the Wittgensteinian mystery:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;that the world is&quot;?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; With a gap. But with an explanation why there is a gap, and then there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is the beautifulness of the geometry of the gap, and of the nature of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the gap, ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Or does 'what is' merely comprise that which is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; 'contingently necessary'?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Nooo... It is necessary, but viewed from inside it multiplies, and a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; part of it becomes necessarily contingent. A bit like when you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; duplicate yourself in two.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (but also like when you meet a machine more complex or just older than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; you).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; That is, our discovery of its actual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; presence, prior to time and space, necessarily - radically - excludes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; its non-presence, but nonetheless we retain the intuition (perhaps
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; incoherently) that - counter factually - it 'might not have been thus
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; present'?

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;  I don't imagine for a moment that the foregoing is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; compelling enough, or sufficiently coherently conceived or expressed,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; to persuade anyone who isn't already lurching in that direction.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; However, having recently been extending my reading and thinking in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; this area (yet again!) I feel a renewed interest in continuing the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; debate, should anyone feel motivated, which might advance mutual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; understanding just a little (the impetus, I take it, behind this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; list).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Sure, nice post. You still seem to reify a bit the third hypostase,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the universal self, the god within. It is an important one, but comp
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; makes it possible to take the ONE as a zero-person being, more like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;the truth&quot; (on the machine). Then the other hypostases &quot;emerge&quot; or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;emanate&quot; (to use Plotinus' word) from it, with their communicable and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; incommunicable statements.

<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So what are your thoughts on my question as to whether abstract

<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; concepts other than numbers also exist in a platonic sense?  For
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; example, the idea of &quot;red&quot;?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So obviously we can cast everything as numbers and say, &quot;In this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; program, 0xff000000 represents red&quot;.  But RED is what we're really
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; talking about here, and 0xff000000 is just a place holder...a symbol
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for what actually exists.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In your view, Bruno (or David, or anyone else who has an opinion),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; what kinds of things actually &quot;exist&quot;?  What does it mean to say that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; something &quot;exists&quot;?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It seems to me that maybe consciousness is actually very simple.  It
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is just a group of platonic ideals, like red, that are related to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; other by a point of view:  &quot;I like red&quot;, or &quot;I see a red sphere.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe what is complicated is constructing or identifying a causal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; structure (e.g., a machine, a brain, a program, etc) whose evolving
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; state can be interpreted as representing a series of &quot;connected&quot; or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;related&quot; instances of consciousness.  But the machine (physical or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; otherwise) is NOT that consciousness, the machine just represents
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; consciousness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In this view, consciousness itself consists directly of the abstract
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; platonic ideals that form the contents of a given moment of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; consciousness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It remains to explain the relative stability of that illusion. How
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; why some dreams glue, in a way sufficiently precise for making
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; predictions about them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe unstable illusions exist, but, being unstable, don't ponder
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; questions?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Obviously we have such conscious beings here in this world, with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; schizophrenics and the like.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So your questions about &quot;why are my perceptions so orderly&quot;, would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; NOT
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be universally valid questions, because there are conscious entities
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; whose perceptions are NOT orderly.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And I would say that even my perceptions are not consistently
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; orderly,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; as when I dream I often experience strange scenarios.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; To say that dreaming and hallucinating are special cases I think is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; make an unfounded assumption.  It would seem to me that orderly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; perceptions are the special case, and dream-logic realities would be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the norm.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If consciousness is in some way a result of computation, then a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; program that generates all possible mind-simulations will surely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; result in the vast majority of resulting minds experiencing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dream-logic realities, not &quot;law-and-order&quot; realities like ours.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think Sean Carroll (who I'm reasonably sure would disagree with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; everything I've proposed above, but still) had a pretty good point on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; such &quot;counter-intuitive&quot; predictions:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;The same logic applies, for example, to the highly contentious case
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of the multiverse. The multiverse isnt, by itself, a theory; its a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; prediction of a certain class of theories. If the idea were simply
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hey, we dont know what happens outside our observable universe, so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; maybe all sorts of crazy things happen, it would be laughably
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; uninteresting. By scientific standards, it would fall woefully short.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But the point is that various theoretical attempts to explain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; phenomena that we directly observe right in front of us  like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; gravity, and quantum field theory  lead us to predict that our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; universe should be one of many, and subsequently suggest that we take
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that situation seriously when we talk about the naturalness of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; various features of our local environment. The point, at the moment,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is not whether there really is or is not a multiverse; its that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; way we think about it and reach conclusions about its plausibility is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; through exactly the same kind of scientific reasoning weve been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; using
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for a long time now. Science doesnt pass judgment on phenomena; it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; passes judgment on theories.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So, I could continue further and go into a lengthy defense of why I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; think this supports what I'm saying, BUT maybe you'll come to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; conclusion I have and I can save myself a lot of typing!  So, I'll
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; just try that approach first.
