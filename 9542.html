I don't understand why you consider the measures of the programs that do the
<br />
simulations. The ''real'' measure should be derived from the algorithmic
<br />
complexity of the laws of physics that describe how the computers/brains
<br />
work. If you know for certain that a computation will be performed in this
<br />
universe, then it doesn't matter how it is performed.
<br />
<br />The algorithmic complexity of the program needed to simulate a brain refers
<br />
to a ''personal universe''. You can think of the brain as a machine that is
<br />
simulating a virtual world in which the qualia we experience exist. That
<br />
world also exists independent of our brain in a universe of its own. This
<br />
world has a very small measure defined by the very large algorithmic
<br />
complexity of the program needed to specify the brain.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Hal,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It seems to me that you are introducing a notion of physical
</em><br />
universe,=20
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and then use it to reintroduce a notion of first person death, so
</em><br />
that=20
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; you can bet you will be the one &quot;annihilated&quot; in Brussels.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I should first mention that I did not anticipate the conclusion that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I reached when I did that analysis.  I did not expect to conclude that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; teleportation like this would probably not work (speaking figurately).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This was not the starting point of the analysis, but the conclusion.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The starting point was the framework I have described previously, which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can be stated very simply as that the measure of an information pattern
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comes from the universal distribution of Kolmogorov.  I then applied this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; analysis to specific information patterns which represent subjective,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; first person lifetime experiences.  I concluded that the truncated version
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which ends when the teleportation occurs would probably have higher
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure than the ones which proceed through and beyond the teleportation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Although I worked in terms of a specific physical universe, that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a short-cut for simplicity of exposition.  The general case is to simply
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ask for the K measure of each possible first-person subjective life
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience - what is the shortest program that produces each one.  I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assume that the shortest program will in fact have two parts, one which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; creates a universe and the second which takes that universe as input
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and produces the first-person experience record as output.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This leads to a Schmidhuber-like ensemble where we would consider
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all possible universes and estimate the contribution of each one to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the measure of a particular first-person experience.  It is important
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; though to keep in mind that in practice the only universe which adds
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non-negligible measure would be the one we are discussing.  In other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; words, consider the first person experience of being born, living your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; life, travelling to Brussels and stepping into a teleportation machine.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A random, chaotic universe would add negligibly to the measure of this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; first-person life experience.  Likewise for a universe which only evolves
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; six-legged aliens on some other planet.  So in practice it makes sense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to restrict our attention to the (approximately) one universe which has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; third-person objective events that do add significant measure to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instantiation of these abstract first-person experiences.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You agree that this is just equivalent of negating the comp
</em><br />
hypothesis.=20
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You would not use (classical) teleportation, nor accept a digital=20
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; artificial brain, all right? Do I miss something?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is perhaps best to say that I would not do these things
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *axiomatically*.  Whether a particular teleportation technology would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be acceptable would depend on considerations such as I described in my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; previous message.  It's possible that the theoretical loss of measure for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some teleportation technology would be small enough that I would do it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As far as using an artificial brain, again I would look to this kind of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; analysis.  I have argued previously that a brain which is much smaller
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or faster than the biological one should have much smaller measure, so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that would not be an appealing transformation.  OTOH an artificial brain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could be designed to have larger measure, such as by being physically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; larger or perhaps by having more accurate and complete memory storage.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then that would be appealing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think that one of the fundamental principles of your COMP hypothesis
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is the functionalist notion, that it does not matter what kind of system
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instantiates a computation.  However I think this founders on the familiar
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; paradoxes over what counts as an instantiation.  In principle we can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; come up with a continuous range of devices which span the alternatives
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from non-instantiation to full instantiation of a given computation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Without some way to distinguish these, there is no meaning to the question
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of when a computation is instantiated; hence functionalism fails.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My approach (not original to me) is to recognize that there is a degree
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of instantiation, as I have described via the conditional Kolmogorov
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure (i.e. given a physical system, how much does it help a minimal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computation to produce the desired output).  This then leads very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; naturally to the analysis I provided in my previous message, which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attempted to estimate the conditional K measure for the hypothetical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; first-person computations that were being potentially instantiated by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the given third-party physical situation.
