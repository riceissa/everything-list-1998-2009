<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thanks to all who replied to my question.  This question has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bothered me for years, and I have hopes that some progress can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be made towards an answer.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I've heard some interesting concepts, including:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (1) &quot;Numbers must exist, therefore 'something' must exist.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (2) &quot;Something exists because Nothingness cannot non-Exist.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps the above two are equivalent.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; With respect to (1) above, why must numbers exist?  
</em><br />
<br />I am not sure that any definitive answer can be given to this
<br />
question. A possible argument is that the existence of numbers
<br />
by themselves is much easier to accept than the existence of
<br />
&quot;usual material things&quot; in a classical sense. Of course, even
<br />
if it was really a weakest assumption, it is not granted.
<br />
<br />The idea behind &quot;numbers must exist&quot; is that &quot;God Himself
<br />
cannot make that two plus two equates something different of
<br />
four&quot;. Another way to say it is that &quot;even if there were nothing
<br />
(or no thing) there would remain that whenever/wherever there
<br />
would be something in which natural numbers could be thought of,
<br />
the Fermat conjecture should be true&quot;. If natural numbers did
<br />
not exist, this necessity would immediately apply to them
<br />
whenever and wherever they appear. I would say that the set of
<br />
such necessities is not different from natural numbers themselves.
<br />
Of course, it is too strong to claim that natural numbers exist
<br />
individually and one independently of another. The arguement is
<br />
that &quot;arithmetics&quot; as a whole exists by itself (and as something).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; With respect to (2) above, why can't &quot;nothingness&quot; exist?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; The trivial answer is that even &quot;nothing&quot; is &quot;something.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, I don't think that this addresses the real question.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A state of pure &quot;NO THING&quot; would forbid even the existence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of numbers,
</em><br />
<br />Yes. It should even forbid the existence of a &quot;Fermat theorem
<br />
constraint&quot; and it is hard to imagine (at leat for me) that such
<br />
a constraint could not exist. So it is not so puzzling (at least
<br />
to me) that something exist.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; or of empty space, or of an empty set.  It would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be non-existence.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Non-existence seems so much simpler than the infinity of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things, both material and immaterial, that surrounds us.
</em><br />
<br />&quot;Material and immaterial things that surround us&quot; most probably
<br />
only appear so to us. To explain the existence of something could
<br />
also be a too strong (and unachievable) requirement. Only the
<br />
perception of the existence of something requires an explanation.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So why are things here?  (I'm grateful that they are, of course.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is this a self-consistent, if unanswerable, question?
</em><br />
<br />Like &quot;Who created the world?&quot;, this formulation involves possibly
<br />
unnecessary and misleading prejudices. At least: the existence of
<br />
&quot;thing*s*&quot; and the existence of an &quot;here&quot;.
<br />
<br />Georges.
