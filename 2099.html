</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;From: Russell Standish &lt;R.Standish.domain.name.hidden&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;Basically, the i in the equation is to ensure that the Hamiltonian is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;hermitian, which is required by the law of conservation of probability 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(d/dt (psi* psi))=0. This latter law is simply the statement that the axiom 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;saying the probability of the certain event is 1, and shall remain so for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;all time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     As you know Russell, I find your &quot;derivation&quot; of the SE quite 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;wanting. As far as conservation of probability, it is not obvious that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;measure should be conserved as a function of time.  In fact, measure is not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;strictly conserved.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     The i is there to make the equation simpler to write.  Of course one 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;could write it in terms of real quantities only, such as amplitude and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;phase.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Well wait for the mark 2 version of the Occam paper, where I shall be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;far more explicit in the steps. Sorry it is taking so long, but I have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a real job to do as well.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OK, I'll try to be patient ...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;One of the Kolmogorov probability axioms is that the certain event has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probability 1. Conservation of probability is simply asserting that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the probability of the certain event does not change over time. A
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;fairly obvious corrollory one would have thought.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe you're trying to insult my intelligence, but in doing so you only 
<br />
insult your own.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, measure is not strictly conserved as a function of time.  Of 
<br />
course it is by definition true that the integral of the effective 
<br />
probability over all observer-moments in all universes (including, since we 
<br />
are presumably using the AUH, universes that are not governed by QM) and all 
<br />
times is equal to 1.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if it were established that the measure per unit time of an 
<br />
&quot;observer&quot; was equal to the squared amplitude of that &quot;observer&quot;'s 
<br />
wavefunction (and this has yet to be satifactorily derived from theory), 
<br />
that might (in general) not have been conserved.  It may well be, too, that 
<br />
the formula for measure would have to be modified if the sum of square 
<br />
amplitudes was not conserved - which might even allow conservation of 
<br />
measure-per-unit-time without requiring conservation of squared amplitudes.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Saying that the i is there makes it easier to write misses the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;point. The Schroedinger operator is i times a Hermitian operator. This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is not the most general form of linear operator, so this structure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ought to have some form of explanation. The one I gave is not actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;due to me, but I can't think where I first came across it - possibly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Emile Durand.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a very well known fact that a Hermitian Hamiltonian leads to a 
<br />
unitary (squared-amplitude-sum-conserving) time evolution operator; I don't 
<br />
know who first said it but it must have been in the early days.  Of course, 
<br />
if it weren't Hermitian, it would have other consequences, such as allowing 
<br />
consevation of energy to be violated.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BTW, there are some people who attach an almost mystical significance to 
<br />
the i.  I had one teacher who told the class that in classical mechanics, i 
<br />
is used only for convenience; but in QM it is fundamental; therefore QM is 
<br />
weird.  That's nonsense.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From: Higgo James &lt;james.higgo.domain.name.hidden&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Trying to derive SE from AUH is like trying to derive 'Jacques Mallah' from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;AUH.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It's very easy: all universes exists, so some thoughts of the cleass &quot;the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;SE is -i hbar d/dt psi = H psi&quot; exist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Some thoughts of the class &quot;why is  the SE -i hbar d/dt psi = H psi&quot; also 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;exist - and by WAP we shouldn't wonder why we *are* (not think, but are) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;such a thought. If we weren't, we wouldn't wonder it...
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James, you are abusing the AP.  SE is not like JM.  It would be 
<br />
worthwhile to try to derive SE because the effective probability of 
<br />
observer-moments that see it is likely to be large; we might be able to get 
<br />
a prediction.  In the case of JM, one name is just about as likely as 
<br />
another (of similar length), so most observer-moments probably don't think 
<br />
they have the name JM.
