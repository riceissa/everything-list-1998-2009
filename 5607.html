<br />BM:
<br />
The post is addressed to George, but concern &quot;my thesis&quot;. May I make some 
<br />
comments?
<br />
I put &quot;my thesis&quot; in quotes because it is really the Sound Universal 
<br />
(Turing) Machine's thesis, you know.           ... or will know ;)
<br />
&quot;Turing&quot; is under quotes thanks to Church thesis. It is Church thesis which 
<br />
makes the notion of universal machine independent of which precise machine 
<br />
is used to define it. After denying the Church Turing Post Markov ... 
<br />
thesis for some time Godel will eventually accept it and he will call it an 
<br />
epistemological miracle (in its Princeton talk, see Davis 1965).
<br />
Church thesis makes the intuitive notion of computability   -machine or 
<br />
-reference frame totally independent. We can also say that the notion of 
<br />
computability is formalism independent.
<br />
After having accepted Church thesis, Godel will look after a corresponding 
<br />
machine or formalism independent notion of provability. This is curious, 
<br />
because at that time Godel did show, by its own incompleteness phenomenon, 
<br />
that provability is an essentially machine or formalism dependent notion. 
<br />
At the same time, by its very reasoning Godel will provide tools for 
<br />
studying what *is* universal and machine independent concerning the 
<br />
provability notion. This gives rise to the logic of provability, also 
<br />
called the logic of self-reference, which has made tremendous and 
<br />
continuous progress since its birth.
<br />
After this introduction I want to comment Stephen's genuine remarks in some 
<br />
sufficiently precise
<br />
way so that we can avoid future misunderstanding.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPK:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; The problems that I have with Bruno's thesis is Digital
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;substitution and that it does not address the problem of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;epiphenomenona found in both Idealism and Materialism.
</em><br />
<br /><br />BM:
<br />
Giving that the Comp, through the UDA  (for exemple) , leads to Monistic 
<br />
idealism, I think the use of the word &quot;epiphenomenon&quot; could be misleading 
<br />
(it is used more in the non interactive dualist approach of the mind body 
<br />
problem, as far as I know). It is better to to talk about simply phenomena, 
<br />
and I guess you pretend I don't address them (which imo is a little bit 
<br />
unfair as I will try to explain).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />SPK:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;Digital substitution seems to assume that consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;and awareness and related notions can be completely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;explained in terms of how one number relates to another.
</em><br />
<br />BM:
<br />
Here is an &quot;important error&quot;, on which ultimately Godel's theorem will put 
<br />
light.
<br />
Saying &quot;yes doctor&quot; for a digital brain substitution does not mean you or 
<br />
the surgeon or the international scientific community has *explained* how 
<br />
consciousness is related to
<br />
numbers or machines. As I insist, comp needs an act of faith. It says there 
<br />
is a level where we can survive (in the grandmother sense) to a digital 
<br />
subtitution, but then it justifies why an ignorance gap remains and must 
<br />
remain. That is: IF there is a level where we survive the subtitution, then 
<br />
we can never pretend to know that level. Please remember that Godel's 
<br />
theorem shows that provability by a machine and truth about that machine 
<br />
are different from the machine perspective. Yes the comp practionners 
<br />
believe its own consciousness can be reduce in some way to relations 
<br />
between numbers, but he/she does not pretend that, even if the correct 
<br />
realtions are given to him, that he can take them as a complete 
<br />
explanation. Comp + Godel will justify why he would became inconsistent 
<br />
would he find such an explanation.
<br />
It helps to keep this in mind to understand the explanation of where the 
<br />
physical appearance comes from, because in some sense the physical 
<br />
appearances will come from our sharable border of that necessary ignorance, 
<br />
where &quot;our&quot; refers to *us* the hopefully sound universal machines.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />SPK:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;I think that your would agree that Bruno's thesis
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;is a very sophisticated form of Idealism.
</em><br />
<br />BM:
<br />
OK. Although I'm not so sure it is so sophisticated. I could argue it is 
<br />
just the consequence of George Boole's laws of thought. But OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />SPK:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;It is widely recognized that &quot;matter&quot; and physicality in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;general is an epiphenomenona within any Ideal theory.
</em><br />
<br />BM:
<br />
You say that again. Perhaps you are right. I would be please to know some 
<br />
references.
<br />
In the case of monistic idealist theory I do think &quot;phenomena&quot; or 
<br />
&quot;appearances&quot; are less misleading terms.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />SPK:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;This in turn makes the notion of a physical substrate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;suspect as it does not exist apart from its properties
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;as encoded in numbers, e.g. our consciousness is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;merely information thus what that information is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;&quot;encoded&quot; in is irrelevant.
</em><br />
<br />BM:
<br />
I do not quite agree with the saying &quot;consciousness&quot; is merely information. 
<br />
I will at some point suggest that consciousness is true and partially 
<br />
automated anticipation of our own consistency, but it is premature to do it 
<br />
now (without first explaining Godel's theorem and the Solovay's extensions 
<br />
with G, G* etc.).
<br />
<br /><br /><br />SPK:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; What I am trying to do is to make the point that it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;is not sufficient to just take as an article of faith
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;or postulation the idea that digital substitution is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;actually possible, especially when the epiphenomenona
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;problem is not even addressed! OTOH,
</em><br />
<br />BM:
<br />
Please remind me what means &quot;OTOH&quot; I always forget this one!
<br />
It is not sufficient to make that act of faith to solve the mind-body 
<br />
problem, I agree. Although it is sufficient for surviving the digital brain 
<br />
transplantation (if comp is correct).
<br />
But I'm afraid the (epi)phenomena are addressed. I can even sum the 
<br />
technics up in one short sentence: just apply the Theaetetus' definition of 
<br />
knowledge from opinion with opinion defined by machine's formal provability.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />SPK:
<br />
if it can be shown that digital substitution is possible in practice then 
<br />
Bruno's thesis will go along way to explaining many things. But there is 
<br />
more to my difficulties than this! Copying, to me, implies that something 
<br />
is doing the copying. What is that
<br />
<br /><br />BM:
<br />
I do not think that the notion of &quot;possible in practice&quot; is relevant for 
<br />
the issue here.
<br />
I am not sure I understand either why you need that something does the 
<br />
copying. Where would that something come from?, and what would it be?, as 
<br />
you ask yourself. I am not building from nothing, I take granted 
<br />
arithmetical truth. It is a part of comp, and it's enough to grant the 
<br />
computational histories, and stable machine discourses including some 
<br />
necessary interrogations. The phenomenal qualities will be handled by 
<br />
logical *modalities*, those isolated from variant of the Godel Lob logic of 
<br />
self-reference.
<br />
<br />Stephen, thank you for your frank remarks which helps me to be aware all 
<br />
this is not so easy.
<br />
I suspect you make the Lucas-Penrose confusion, consisting to confuse 
<br />
&quot;believing we are a machine&quot;, and &quot;believing we know which machine we are&quot;. 
<br />
In the case of consistent or sound machines the truth of the first 
<br />
proposition entails the falsity of the second one.
<br />
<br />Bruno
