&nbsp;&nbsp;Because you referred me to Deutsch's book I too a look at his own 
<br />
defense of the Everett interpretation and was reminded also
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;of his not so passive understanding of the CT. As it turns out his 
<br />
whole masterplan hinges on his belief that *CT is a result of
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Physics* so he is really no great help to you.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes sure, it is the point where if you asks David how he can defend 
<br />
such a revisionist form of CT, he just say that he disagrees with 100% 
<br />
of the mathemaéticians. Actually Deutsch's position is interesting 
<br />
because it illustrates the point that once you take comp seriously 
<br />
enough, you are forced to &quot;physicalize&quot; the math, for not making math 
<br />
more fundamental than physics.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;I don't really agree with Deutsch on this, by the way...
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I prefer to follow Wheeler's view that the physical laws cannot be 
<br />
generated in any physical way.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;...but I don't think this is correct about Wheeler either. Sure he 
<br />
talked a lot about &quot;if from bit&quot; but never developed into
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;anything usable. The origin of the physical laws is an interesting 
<br />
philosophical problem on its own but, if your suggestion
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;is that they can be derived from math alone is somewhat spurious 
<br />
because the laws of physics are already mathematical!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;The main problem is that the physical laws are only one part of the 
<br />
information you need to build observable physics. The
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;other are the boundary conditions, the symmetry-breaking accidents and 
<br />
such which really don't have an obvious place in the
<br />
&nbsp;Platonic world.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the rest of the post you turn around the pot., and adopt a tone 
<br />
like if I was doing something speculative, and this just illustrates 
<br />
what you have already confessed: you don't have study the argument I 
<br />
have given. For example:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;You ARE doing something speculative whether you admit it or not! And I 
<br />
don't really have to study your argument because
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;it is derived from premises that, you already admitted, are 
<br />
incompatible with the conclusions you claim.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; I decrypt the above as a statement that you are NOT trying to derive 
</em><br />
QM but a more general TOE
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;This means you have not already grasped the main theorem in my work, 
<br />
although I have unsuccessfully try to give you the idea. I try one 
<br />
times again:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is that there is only one TOE compatible with comp, and it 
<br />
is derivable from comp. That TOE is physically complete. To verify 
<br />
comp, just compare that TOE (already given) with QM (currently most 
<br />
believed physical theory) or compare directly with the physical facts. 
<br />
The tests already done confirm the quantum logical aspects of nature.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;To claim that a TOE is physically complete you have to know ALL of 
<br />
Physics which is more than anyone in this world claims
<br />
&nbsp;to know, least of all, me! So who am I to disagree? (;-)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Could you please stop trying to demolish theoretical works before 
<br />
grasping the enunciation of the main theorems? What is your goal?
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;Bruno
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;My goal was to try and understand whether there is a grain of anything 
<br />
interesting in what you claim you have done.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Since you say above both that I have &quot;already grasped the main 
<br />
theorem&quot; and than demand that I grasp it before I
<br />
&nbsp;demolish it I can only conclude that it is... self-demolishing!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Now it appears to me that you are trying, at all costs (including 
<br />
logic), to save the remnants of the strong-AI thesis in some
<br />
religious cultist form (&quot;The Grand Programmer&quot;-vision),  thus your 
<br />
constant references to faith and theology. This, incidentally
<br />
may be a better bet than actually doing science since there is better 
<br />
funding in the &quot;intelligent design&quot; camp these days, so maybe I wished 
<br />
you more luck than you need...
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Best regards,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Godfrey
