<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (maybe a bit more, given our shared past). This is no more than a description of how our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; psychology as beings who feel themselves to be embedded in linear time works. Arguments that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; this does not reflect the reality of the situation, that it does not make sense to consider I might
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;become&quot; either copy prior to the duplication but only one copy after the duplication, do not change
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the way my brain forces me to feel about it. Lee Corbin on this list has argued that I should consider
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; both copies as selves at all times, and perhaps we would evolve to think this way in a world where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; duplication was commonplace, but our brains aren't wired that way at present.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In saying you disagree that duplicate OM's perspectives are perceived,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I take it that you mean their collective divergent experiences are not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; integrated in a consistent memory, not that they would be non-conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; zombies.  If this was your point, I agree.
</em><br />
<br />That's what I meant.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, I see a difference of opinion in how we understand the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probabilities.  Whereas you say prior to the duplication and torture,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one has a 1/2 probability of being tortured and 1/2 probability of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being spared, I see it as one having a 100% probability of being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tortured AND a 100% probability of being spared, as both experiences
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; occur with 100% certainty.  The probability that an observer-moment
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sampled from both perspectives post-duplication will remember being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tortured would be 1/2.
</em><br />
<br />OK, but I am looking at it from the perspective of going into the replicator. 
<br />
Suppose you were offered either the above choice - you are duplicated and 
<br />
one of the copies will be tortured - or a biased coin will be tosed and you 
<br />
will have a 51% chance of being tortured and a 49% chance of being spared. 
<br />
From a selfish perspective, it would be best to go for the duplication, because 
<br />
since you can only experience being one person at a time, you can expect to 
<br />
come out of the duplicator with a 50% chance of being tortured as opposed 
<br />
to the 51% chance in the case of the coin toss.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Our brains may not be wired for experiencing total empathy for others
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; who are suffering, but this is a result of evolutionary psychology.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps a species whose brains were wired this way would be maximally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moral, as they would be intolerant to any suffering and would operate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at great risk to themselves to aid other individuals.
</em><br />
<br />Sure, we are only contigently wired to consider our own future selfish interests. 
<br />
It is possible to conceive of other evolutionary paths where, for example, we 
<br />
regard our kin as selves in the way social insects seem to do, or we regard 
<br />
future and past selves as other and live selfishly for the moment. There is nothing 
<br />
irrational about either of these positions, because the relationship betwen the 
<br />
observer moments is a contingent fact of evolution.
