<br />Russell Standish sent me private mail referring to his article at
<br />
<a href="http://parallel.hpc.unsw.edu.au/rks/docs/occam/">http://parallel.hpc.unsw.edu.au/rks/docs/occam/</a>, where he made a similar
<br />
argument.  However I am not completely convinced.
<br />
<br />Parenthetically, I don't see that the presence of quantum randomness
<br />
in our universe is relevant.  If we assume that many-worlds is the true
<br />
physics of our universe, then in fact our universe is deterministic and is
<br />
not full of quantum randomness.  Even if we do have quantum randomness,
<br />
that would not be like the situation I am describing, where you have a
<br />
universe which is almost entirely lawful and has some kind of extremely
<br />
rare exception.
<br />
<br />I agree however that you (and Russell) are right that one would not
<br />
literally expect to see a flying rabbit or a materializing dragon.
<br />
The information content of such a manifestation would be large, and most
<br />
&quot;miracles&quot; which used a similar quantity of information would be random
<br />
in their effects, and probably unnoticeable.
<br />
<br />Nevertheless I think there could be exceptions to the laws of nature which
<br />
have major, observable effects while being relatively concise to specify.
<br />
Going back to my CA example, in some CA worlds if you had a cell fixed
<br />
in the &quot;1&quot; state, that could have dramatic macroscopic effects.  It might
<br />
appear to be continually radiating the equivalent of energy, for example.
<br />
In such a situation, you might have conservation of energy throughout
<br />
the entire universe, except at this one location it would be violated.
<br />
<br />The collection of all universes which have this kind of violation of the
<br />
laws of nature could, by my argument, have measure not much less than
<br />
that of a universe which had the simpler laws of physics which allowed
<br />
for no such violation.  Inhabitants of such a universe who have not yet
<br />
stumbled upon the magic location might think that their observations
<br />
give them reason to believe that the laws of physics hold everywhere.
<br />
But they are wrong.  There is a significant probability that violations
<br />
of this sort exist.  Occam's razor is not as sharp as they believe.
<br />
