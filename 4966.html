I think this discussion might have already took place
<br />
here, but I would like to take you opinions on this.
<br />
<br />How do we define (de)coherence? What makes interference
<br />
happen or be lost?
<br />
<br />Take the a double-slit-like experiment. A particle can take
<br />
two paths, A and B. We can in principle detect which path
<br />
the particle went through.
<br />
<br />Suppose we can make the detecting apparatus 'non-interfering'
<br />
enough so that the particle is not grossly deflected by the
<br />
detection, but can still reach the screen. We know that the
<br />
result of this thought-experiment is that interference does not
<br />
happen.
<br />
<br />The first answer is that the paths have 'decohered'. But what
<br />
exactly does that mean? In a MWI perspective, I like the
<br />
explanation that the two universes A and B are different by a
<br />
large number of particles: the electrons in a wire, which carry
<br />
the amplified pulse of the detector, which then reach a
<br />
computer, and such and such. Something of the order of 10^23
<br />
particles have changed state.
<br />
<br />Now suppose we use some kind of very slow detector. The
<br />
detection is made by, say, a very slow process such that not
<br />
many particles (suppose only one particle, even though I don't
<br />
know how to make that detector) change their state before the
<br />
interfering particle reaches the screen. After that, we can amplify
<br />
this information and know which path the particle went through.
<br />
Again, I believe interference would not be possible. But it is a
<br />
little harder to say why.
<br />
<br />Before anyone says that *some* other particle has changed
<br />
state, and that should be enough for the decoherence, suppose
<br />
now an experiment with a charged particle, say, an electron.
<br />
We make it go through paths A and B by steering it with
<br />
magnetic fields. Certainly, it has interacted with *something*,
<br />
ot it could not be steered. It interacted with the photons of the
<br />
EM field, or in last analysis, with the electrons that are
<br />
generating it. We could use electric fields, so that the interaction
<br />
is more evident. On the other hand, a photon being reflected
<br />
by a mirror is also interacting with something, but that does
<br />
not prevent the interference from happening, as is well known.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Therefore interaction by itself does not cause decoherence.
<br />
And if it is just a large number of particles changing state that
<br />
does, then what is the threshold? Would an experiment with a
<br />
few-particle-delayed-detector as described above allow
<br />
interference? Or is it the 'information' that causes decoherence?
<br />
If that is the case, how does one define 'information'?
<br />
<br />-Eric.
