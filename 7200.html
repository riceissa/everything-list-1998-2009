<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Returning to your example, if God creates a person, call him A, and a day 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; later kills him, A will be really dead (as opposed to provisionally dead) if 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there will never be any successor OM's to his last conscious moment. Now, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suppose God kills A and then creates an exact copy of A along with his 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; environment, call him B, on the other side of the planet. B has all of A's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; memories up to the moment before he was killed. This destruction/creation 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; procedure is, except for the duplication of the environment, exactly how 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; teleportation is supposed to work. I think most people on this list would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; agree that teleportation (if it could be made to work, which not everyone 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does agree is possible) would be a method of transportation, not execution: 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even though the original dies, the copy has all his memories and provides 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the requisite successor OM in exactly the same way as would have happened if 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the original had continued living. So in the example above, if B is an exact 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; copy of A in an exact copy of A's environment, A would &quot;become&quot; B and not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even notice that there had been any change.
</em><br />
<br />I'm not sure I would put it like this, although I agree that this would
<br />
probably become a common way of describing it.  But there are some aspects
<br />
of the process by which A becomes B which are different from our usual,
<br />
moment-to-moment continuity of identity.  One obvious difference is that
<br />
it is a divine miracle.  This can hardly be neglected.  Even if we imagine
<br />
this being done technologically rather than miraculously, with A's brain
<br />
being scanned and transmitted to where B will be created, the process of
<br />
making this scan will increase the measure of that OM for A by virtue
<br />
of storing it in extra places.  This may manifest as the potential for
<br />
future copies of A to be created starting with that exact mental moment.
<br />
People may come to view transporting as a dangerous activity which puts
<br />
them at risk of the creation of unauthorized copies.
<br />
<br />These are all ways in which seemingly abstract and metaphysical questions
<br />
become manifest in the real world.  I think it is important to see that
<br />
these are not merely imperfections in the thought experiments which we
<br />
should ignore in the interests of getting at the real issues.  In my
<br />
model, the number of implementations is all important.  It is a major
<br />
determinant of measure.  Any technology which messes around with this
<br />
stuff is likely to affect the measure of the relevant observer moments.
<br />
Having your mental state recorded increases its measure, which manifests
<br />
physically as a greater chance that it can interact with the world.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, consider the same situation with one difference. Instead of creating B 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at the instant he kills A, God creates A and B at the same time, on opposite 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sides of the planet but in exactly the same environment which will provide 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; each of them with exactly the same inputs, and their minds at all time 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; remain perfectly synchronised. God allows his two creatures to live for a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; day, and then instantly and painlessly kills A. In the previous example, we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; agreed that the creation of B means that A doesn't really die. Now, we have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *exactly* the same situation when A is killed: B is there to provide the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; successor OM, and A need not even know that anything unusual had happened. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; How could the fact that B was present a day, a minute or a microsecond 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; before A's death make any difference to A? All that matters is that B is in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the correct state to provide continuity of consciousness when A is killed. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Conversely, A and A's death cannot possibly have any direct effect on B. It 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is not as if A's soul flies around the world and takes over B; rather, it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just so happens (because of how A and B were created) that B's mental states 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; coincide with A's, or with what A's would have been if he hadn't died.
</em><br />
<br />If we focus on observer-moments, there are no A and B as separate
<br />
individuals.  There are two instantiations of a set of OMs.  Each OM has
<br />
double measure during the time that A and B exist, then it has single
<br />
measure after A has been destroyed.  It is meaningless to ask, after A
<br />
dies, if B is now A or still B, or maybe both?  (I am curious to know
<br />
how you would try to answer this question, using your terminology!)
<br />
Rather, there is then a single instantiation of the set of OMs.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Who's measure is decreased here, A's or B's? How would any of them know 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; their measure had been decreased? It seems to me that neither A nor B could 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *possibly* be aware that anything had happened at all. The only benefit of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; having multiple exact copies of yourself around would seem to be as backup 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if one is destroyed. If your measure were surreptitiously increased or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; decreased, what symptoms would you expect to experience?
</em><br />
<br />Well, we've been discussing this all along, and I have tried to answer
<br />
it several times, but I can only do so by analogy.  Having your measure
<br />
decreased is like having a chance of dying.  Having it increased is
<br />
like... well, I can't analogize it to anything, because it has never been
<br />
possible and we have no experience of it.  Only if technology advances
<br />
to allow mental copies will it be possible for us to increase measure.
<br />
What will it be like?  It will be like gaining greater influence over
<br />
the world, greater ability to put our plans into fruition (just as death
<br />
represents a loss of those abilities).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What about if you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; were a piece of sentient software: surely having multiple instantiations of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the ones and zeroes could not make any difference; if it did, wouldn't that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be a bit like expecting that your money would have greater purchasing power 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if your bank backed up their data multiple times? Or like saying that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;2+2=4&quot; would be more vividly true (or whatever it is that increasing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure causes to happen) if lots and lots of people held hands and did the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; calculation simultaneously?
</em><br />
<br />I don't think those are accurate analogies.  Your money would not have
<br />
multiple purchasing power if it were backed up multiple times, but
<br />
that information would have greater measure.  Measure is a property of
<br />
information.  When the information about your money has greater measure,
<br />
this will tend to give it greater robustness and more opportunity to
<br />
interact with and influence the world.  Specifically, it can't be deleted
<br />
and lost as easily.  Multiple backups have real value and any legitimate
<br />
bank will make sure to use them.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I can't be completely sure that increasing your measure would have no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; effect. Maybe there would be some sort of telepathic communication between 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the various copies, such as is said to occur between identical twins, or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some as yet undiscovered physical phenomenon. However, there is absolutely 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no evidence at present for such a thing, and I think that until such 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evidence is found, we should only go on what we know to be true and what can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logically be deduced from it.
</em><br />
<br />No, I have absolutely no expectation of any such nonphysical effects from
<br />
increasing measure.  I am confident that we agree about the third-party
<br />
effects of making copies.  No copy will demonstrate that he is able to
<br />
read the minds of his fellows.  I can only say that increasing measure is
<br />
the opposite of decreasing measure, that our measure decreases every day,
<br />
and that we fight as hard as we can to keep it from decreasing faster.
<br />
I believe that you view this fight as a philosophical mistake, but your
<br />
genes don't agree!
<br />
<br />Your genes are not content to have just one copy.  A gene doesn't say,
<br />
it doesn't matter how many of me there are, as long as at least one
<br />
exists I am still alive.  No, each gene fights its hardest to increase
<br />
its measure.  It wants to occupy as much of the universe as it can.
<br />
It wants to increase its influence, its redundancy, its robustness.
<br />
This is what increasing measure means to your genes.  If people lived
<br />
in a regime where increasing measure were possible, I believe they would
<br />
come to adopt similar views, and for the same reason our genes did.
