<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Le 09-oct.-06, à 21:54, George Levy a écrit :

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     To observe a split consciousness, you need an observer who is also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     split,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ?
</em><br />
<br />This is simple. The time/space/substrate/level of the observer must 
<br />
match the time/space/substrate/level of what he observes.  The Leibniz 
<br />
analogy is good. In your example if one observes just the recording 
<br />
without observing the earlier creation of the recording and the later 
<br />
utilization of the recording, then one may conclude rightfully that the 
<br />
recording is not conscious.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     in sync with the split consciousness, across time, space,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     substrate and level (a la Zelazny - Science Fiction writer). In
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     your example, for an observer to see consciousness in the machine,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     he must be willing to exist at the earlier interval, skip over the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     time delay carrying the recording and resume his existence at the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     later interval. If he observes only a part of the whole thing, say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     the recording, he may conclude that the machine is not conscious.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is unclear for me. Unless you are just saying like Leibniz that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you will not &quot;see&quot; consciousness in a brain by examining it under a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; microscope.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Note also that I could attribute consciousness to a recording, but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this makes sense only if the recording is precise enough so that I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could add the &quot;Klaras&quot; or anything which would make it possible to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; continue some conversation with the system. And then I do not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attribute consciousness to the physical appearance of the system, but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to some people which manifests him/it/herself through it.
</em><br />
<br />Adding Klaras complicate the problem but the result is the same. Klaras 
<br />
must be programmed. Programming is like recording, a means for inserting 
<br />
oneself at programming time for later playback at execution time. I have 
<br />
already shown that Maudlin was cheating by rearranging his tape, in 
<br />
effect programming the tape. So I agree with you if you agree that 
<br />
programming the tape sequence is just a means for connecting different 
<br />
pieces of a conscious processes where each piece operates at different 
<br />
times.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     In addition, if we are going to split consciousness maximally in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     this fashion, the concept of observer becomes important, something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     you do not include in your example.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Could you elaborate. I don't understand. As a consequence of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reasoning the observer (like the knower, the feeler) will all be very 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; important (and indeed will correspond to the hypostases (n-person pov) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the AUDA). But in the reasoning, well either we are valid going 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from one step to the next or not, and I don't see the relevance of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your point here. I guess I miss something.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
I do not understand the connection with the hypostases in the AUDA. 
<br />
However, it is true that the conscious machine is its own observer, no 
<br />
matter how split its operation is. (i.e., time sharing, at different 
<br />
levels... etc). However, the examples will be more striking if a 
<br />
separate observer is introduced. Of course the separate observer will 
<br />
have to track the time/space/substrate/level of the machine to observe 
<br />
the machine to be conscious (possibly with a Turing test). Forgive me 
<br />
for insisting on a separate observer, but I think that a relativity 
<br />
approach could bear fruits.
<br />
<br />You could even get rid of the recording and replace it with random 
<br />
inputs (happy rays in your paper).
<br />
<br />As you can see with random inputs, the machine is not conscious to an 
<br />
observer anchored in the physical. The machine just appears to follow a 
<br />
random series of states.
<br />
<br />But if the machine can be observed to be conscious if it is observed 
<br />
precisely at those times when the random inputs match the counterfactual 
<br />
recording. So the observer needs to &quot;open his eyes&quot; precisely only at 
<br />
those times. So the observer needs to be linked in some ways to the 
<br />
machine being conscious.
<br />
<br />If the observer is the (self reflecting) machine itself there is no 
<br />
problem, the observer will automatically be conscious at those times.
<br />
<br />If the observer is not the machine, we need to invoke a mechanism that 
<br />
will force him to be conscious at those times. It will have to be almost 
<br />
identical to the machine and will have to accept the same random data So 
<br />
in a sense the observer will have to be a parallel machine with some 
<br />
possible variations as long as these variations are not large enough to 
<br />
make the observer and the machine exist on different 
<br />
time/space/substrate/level.
<br />
<br />Therefore from the point of view of the second machine, the first 
<br />
machine appears conscious. Note that for the purpose of the argument WE 
<br />
don't have to assume initially that the second machine IS conscious, 
<br />
only that it can detect if the first machine is conscious. Now once we 
<br />
establish that the first machine is conscious we can infer that the 
<br />
second machine is also conscious simply because it is identical.
<br />
<br />The example is of course a representation of our own (many)world.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     (**) I am open to thoroughly discuss this, for example in november.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Right now I am a bit over-busy (until the end of october).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
I'll be traveling to France in early November. We'll leave the detailed 
<br />
discussion for later in November.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     OK. Take your time.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I will, thanks. In the meanwhile I would appreciate if you could

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; elaborate your point.
