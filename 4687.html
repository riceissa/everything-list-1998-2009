<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is there a similar definition, in math?
</em><br />
<br />If, from a set of axioms and rules of inference, we can produce a
<br />
valid proof of a theorem, then the theorem is true, within that
<br />
axiomatic system.
<br />
<br />I'd suggest that this notion of provability is analogous to the
<br />
&quot;reality&quot; of physics.  Provable theorems are what we know, within
<br />
a mathematical system.
<br />
<br />Now, one problem with this approach is that it focuses on the theorems,
<br />
which are generally &quot;about&quot; some mathematical concepts or objects,
<br />
but not on the objects themselves.  For example, we have a theory of
<br />
the integers, and we can make proofs about them, such as that there
<br />
are an infinite number of primes.  These proofs are what we know about
<br />
the integers, the &quot;mathematical reality&quot; of this subject.
<br />
<br />But what about the integers themselves?  They are distinct from the
<br />
theorems about them.  Maybe we would want to say that it is the integers
<br />
which are &quot;mathematically real&quot;, rather than proofs about them.
<br />
<br />The question in my mind is how to understand Tegmark's theory that the
<br />
world is a mathematical structure, something analogous to the integers but
<br />
more complex.  We actually live within a mathematical object, according
<br />
to this view.  What does physical reality mean in such a framework?
<br />
Would it correspond to mathematical reality, within that one mathematical
<br />
structure that we live in?
<br />
<br />Or turning to Schmidhuber's model, where the world is a computer program,
<br />
what does physical reality correspond to?  We have a distinction there
<br />
between the program and its output, similar to the distinction in math
<br />
between proofs and the objects about which theorems are proven.
<br />
<br />If we focus on the output, then that would be the fundamental physical
<br />
reality of the universe.  We could then &quot;chunk&quot; that output or identify
<br />
patterns in it, and those would be real as well.  In general, any
<br />
computable function which took as input a region of the universe and
<br />
produced as output a true/false result would define an element of
<br />
physical reality.
<br />
<br />Some functions would be much more useful than others, producing &quot;elements
<br />
of reality&quot; which are more stable or more predictable.  Conserved
<br />
quantities, for example, would be elements of reality which were useful
<br />
for predictions in a variety of situations.  But in principle, I think
<br />
all computable predicate functions would have equal philosophical status.
