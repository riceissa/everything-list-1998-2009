Hi Kelly, and others,
<br />
<br />Well, thanks for your report. Did you smoke the extract? It usually 
<br />
last for 4 minutes. It is amazing it did last so long with you, I know 
<br />
only one case of an experience lasting 20 minutes. I am happy you found 
<br />
your experience interesting. You can consult and discuss your 
<br />
experience, and those of others here: 
<br />
<a href="http://www.entheogen.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=135">http://www.entheogen.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=135</a>
<br />
<br />Now the real question is, does that experience helped in providing, for 
<br />
example, an answer to my last remark to Quentin?
<br />
<br />I quote the question again. It is important concerning 
<br />
comp-immortality, and eventually how to derive physics from computer 
<br />
science.
<br />
I do think such a question is difficult, and show the weakness in 
<br />
identifying the self with personal memories, and this justifies the 
<br />
necessity of the AUDA move, I think.
<br />
<br />Of course, if you enjoy dream-state-like, you can enjoy Salvia without 
<br />
troubling yourself with hard metaphysical questions. Yet I would be 
<br />
interesting if Quentin or Stathis, or anyone, could acknowledge a 
<br />
conceptual difficulty here.
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;Hmmm...
<br />
I ask you, and others, this question. What is the probability &quot;now&quot;, 
<br />
that you will find yourself in Washington and Moscow the 24 december 
<br />
2009, when you are annihilated in Brussels, now, (17 March 2009) and 
<br />
reconstituted in both Moscow and Washington the 18 March 2009, say)? 
<br />
The problem is that the reconstitution machine did dysfunction in 
<br />
Washington, so that, from the 18 March 2009 up to the 20 Augustus 2009 
<br />
you (the you in Washington) suffered a  &quot;total amnesia&quot;.  And then, 
<br />
&quot;you&quot; recovered slowly and progressively from that through adequate 
<br />
medication up to a total recall, the 23 December (and none of yous did 
<br />
move from W or M).
<br />
<br />Note that with high concentrated extract of Salvia Divinorum, people 
<br />
can &quot;suffer&quot; (or &quot;enjoy&quot;) a total amnesia, where you forget not just 
<br />
your name and memories of life, but you forget even what is a person, 
<br />
what is space, what is time.  Yet you remain conscious. Life appears as 
<br />
a dream, that you recall vaguely, and then forget, and then you forget 
<br />
you did that dream. Yet &quot;you&quot; come back. (See the reports, I don't 
<br />
encourage its consumption, but anyone interested by consciousness can 
<br />
be interested by such reports).&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Le 28-mars-09, à 20:50, Kelly a écrit :
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I tried Salvia for the first time yesterday.  Very similar to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dreaming, but more intense, with a lot more sounds.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; At first I thought, &quot;Nothing's happening&quot;.  Then I thought, &quot;I seem to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be about to slide sidewise...I need to stop&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then, I was sitting somewhere...in a tilled field I think, and I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; couldn't remember who I was.  Then I thought, someone's going to be in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; trouble...I need to tell my sister.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then, for the next 30 minutes it was 1978, and I was in Arkansas, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I was a kid again.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Every now and then I'd think, &quot;What's going on???  Did I take
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something?&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I could never remember for sure.  A couple of times I would think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the Salvia extract, but I couldn't remember if it was just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something I'd heard of, or if I'd actually used it.  And I'd decide,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Nah, couldn't be salvia...reality doesn't work that way.  That would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be like magic.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; After about 30 minutes of dreaming it was 1978, and I was 7, and in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Arkansas,  I came to enough to look at the clock, and I remember
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thinking, &quot;It didn't work...&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; THEN, I was underwater looking up towards the surface, and there was a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; giant squid passing over me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; About 20 minutes later, I got up and starting writing up what I'd
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seen, but I was still drifting in and out, like I was having day-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dreams.  And they were still about Arkansas 1978, but it was like I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was there, and there was a plan, and I was part of it.  Something was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about to happen, and I was like part of a group that knew about it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Over the next hour the day-dreams stopped, and within 2 hours of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; starting it was over.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Very interesting.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
