Hi Pete,
<br />
<br />Le 28-mars-06, à 20:27, Pete Carlton a écrit :
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hi -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The problem of consciousness is the problem of conscious thought. I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; imagine there is no thinker, but I can't imagine there is no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; consciousness, and that is the problem.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think it's not really a problem; it is only a problem if you are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; committed to a *certain* conception of consciousness (as irreducible,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ineffable, intrinsic, etc).
</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree. Now I am indeed committed to the personal, but I think 
<br />
universal, fact that consciousness is ineffable in the sense that &quot;I&quot; 
<br />
cannot give a pure third person proof that &quot;I&quot; am conscious. Thought 
<br />
experiments based on the comp hyp can indeed explain that, as far as 
<br />
someone is conscious, he/she cannot communicate that fact  in any 
<br />
objective way. But now, *that* &quot;meta-fact&quot; can be explained in some 
<br />
objective way.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I of course am not going to convince you to think of consciousness in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a Dennettian framework, but just be aware that there is a perfectly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; respectable and mainstream philosophical line that dismisses things
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like Chalmers's &quot;hard problem&quot; as an artifact of bad
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conceptualizing.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I would say there is about 1500 years of attempt to dismiss the first 
<br />
person. In general that dismissing comes from a category error. From 
<br />
the fact that, indeed, the scientific discourse (third person, 
<br />
objective) cannot make the use of first person knowledge, some people 
<br />
claim that no scientific discourse can be made on consciousness. But 
<br />
you can always build a third person theory about anything provided you 
<br />
give sufficiently clear definitions, postulates, reasonable inference 
<br />
rules, consistency world-views (logician's model), etc. A third person 
<br />
discourse on the notion of first person discourse is quite possible.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What the implications of this view are for your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scheme, I can't say yet.  My hunch is that it would make things much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; easier to take &quot;intrinsic consciousness&quot; out of the picture and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; replace it with hugely complex behavioral dispositions, etc.
</em><br />
<br /><br />This is dismissing the hard problem. The question is really how to find 
<br />
a relation between hugely complex behavioral dispositions and 
<br />
consciousness.
<br />
Now I think consciousness is a &quot;logical child&quot; of &quot;consistency&quot; or 
<br />
&quot;expectation of some possible truth or reality&quot;, and logic can explain 
<br />
why consistent machines (or more general entities) are bewildered by 
<br />
their true but &quot;unpostulatable&quot; (if I can say) self-consistency. This 
<br />
can justify many of the &quot;meta-facts&quot; described above.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Anyway, I had another question: are you trying to *identify* one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person with one simple (Turing, Lobian, etc) machine?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is a mistake - what if the best way to output your behavior is using
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a collection of millions or billions of machines, some of which are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; broken, some of which mess up the other machines, some of which are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not found in your brain but are instead in your environment, or in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other people.. will you say that this can all be reduced to one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine?  But then why identify *that* machine with one person?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Ah Ah !  This is an excellent remark, except maybe it shows you have 
<br />
not study my work---don't be sorry, nobody is perfect :-)
<br />
But the main point is really that: if comp is true then the mind body 
<br />
relation is not one-one. You can, for all practical purpose, attach a 
<br />
consciousness to some appearance of a &quot;digital machine&quot; (not 
<br />
necessarily a material one though), but no digital machine can attach 
<br />
its own consciousness to any particular machine token, but only to an 
<br />
abstract machine type having a continuum of  (2^aleph_0) &quot;token 
<br />
incarnations&quot; appearing in the universal deployment (like in 
<br />
Everett-Deutsch QM).
<br />
Also, in comp as I present it, if some part of some 
<br />
neighborhood-environment needs to be emulated for my consciousness to 
<br />
proceed, then I put that part, by definition,  in the &quot;generalized 
<br />
brain&quot;, which is the part of the universe which needs to be duplicated 
<br />
for *me* being duplicated. The thought experiments I use are simpler 
<br />
when one assumes that the brain is the traditional biological one 
<br />
inside the skull, but that supplementary assumption can be eliminated 
<br />
once the universal dovetailer (or the universal wave function) is 
<br />
invoked. Even if the whole Milky Way *is* my brain, once it is 
<br />
Turing-emulable, you can understand that sooner or later the Universal 
<br />
Dovetailer will simulated it (infinitely often)---and then remember 
<br />
that the first person is not aware of any simulation delays.
<br />
But still, bravo (if you don't have read my work) because the fact that 
<br />
comp forces the mind-body relation to be NOT one-one, is a key feature: 
<br />
to an apparent (complex) body you can associate a mind (and this is 
<br />
almost just a rule of politeness), but to a mind-state, you can only 
<br />
associate the infinity of computational possible &quot;body-histories&quot; going 
<br />
through that state.  And then the comp mind-body problem reduces 
<br />
partially to the mathematical justification of the rarity of Harry 
<br />
Potter Magics or other Wonderland sort of White Rabbits. And if too 
<br />
much white rabbits are shown remaining, a case against comp is done, 
<br />
but incompleteness assures such a task is not an obvious one.
<br />
<br />Bruno
