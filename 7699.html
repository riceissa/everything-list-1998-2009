<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think a reconciliation between Bruno and Lee's arguments can be the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; following:
</em><br />
<br /><br />Thanks for trying to reconciliate us :)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Our perception of reality is limited by the structure and composition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of brains. (we can 'enhance' these to be able to perceive and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand 'more', but at ANY point of time the above limitation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; holds). I think this is closer to what Lee wants to say, and I totally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; agree with it. This is what I have tried to elaborate on in my earlier
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (my first here) email.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But the very fact that this limitation is absolutely inescapable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (observation and understanding is ALWAYS limited to the observer's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; capabilities) gives us the following insight:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That which cannot be modelled (understood) cannot figure in ANY of our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;models of reality&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Why ?  (I have explicit counterexamples, like the notion of knowledge 
<br />
for machine).
<br />
Logic has evolved up to the point we are able to build formal theory 
<br />
bearing on non formalizable notions (like truth or knowledge). Amazing 
<br />
and counterintuitive I agree.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Therefore although our models of reality keep
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; changing, at any given time instance there is no way for us to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perceive anything beyond the model, because as soon as something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; outside our current model is perceived, we have moved to a future
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instance, and can create a model that includes it. Thus it is kind of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; senseless to talk of a reality beyond our perception.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Why? We can bet on some theories and derive consequences bearing 
<br />
indirectly on some non perceivable structure.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  In other words,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we can call something &quot;reality&quot; only once we perceive it. In this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense &quot;models may be more real than reality&quot; to us. This is an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argument of the &quot;Shroedinger's Cat&quot; kind.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In fact if I am correct about what both Bruno and Lee want to say,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then Lee's arguments are a prerequisite to understanding to what Bruno
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is hinting at.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Actually I agree with it. I do think Lee is close to what I want to 
<br />
say, at the level of our assumptions. But Lee is quite honest and 
<br />
cannot not be sure that my conclusion must be non sense (which means 
<br />
that he grasped them at least).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Quantum Physics says that an observer and his observation are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; impossible to untangle.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK. But I don't use this. Actually I don't use physics at all. Physics 
<br />
is emergent, not fundamental (once we assume seriously enough &quot;digital 
<br />
mechanism&quot; (or computationalism).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; From the above fact,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A Realist (Lee) would conclude that &quot;absolute reality&quot; is unknowable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (follows from heisenburg's uncertainty also btw:-) ). But for this the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; realist assumes that this &quot;absolute reality&quot; exists.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A Nihilist (Bruno) would conclude that since this tanglement of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer and observation is inescapable, it is meaningless to talk
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about any &quot;absolute reality&quot; outside the perceived and understood
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality (models).
</em><br />
<br /><br />Actually I am a platonist, that is, a mathematical realist. I do also 
<br />
believe in physical reality. My point is just that if you make some 
<br />
hypothesis in the cognitive science (mechanism, computationalism) then 
<br />
physics is 100% derivable from mathematics. The physical laws are 
<br />
mathematical (even statistical) laws emerging from what any machine can 
<br />
correctly bet concerning invariant feature of their most probable 
<br />
computational history.
<br />
<br />Nihilism is what happens when you believe in both computationalism and 
<br />
materialism. This has been illustrated by La Mettrie and mainly Sade 
<br />
(but also Heidegger and Nietsche in a less direct way, and then perhaps 
<br />
Hitler or Bin Laden in in very more indirect way).
<br />
I am not at all a nihilist. I just show that the computationalist 
<br />
hypothesis makes the physical world emerge from the truth on numbers. I 
<br />
take those truth as being independent of me.
<br />
<br />I am not a physical realist perhaps, although I do believe in an 
<br />
independent physical world. I just don't physical reality is primitive. 
<br />
Like Plato I take what we see and measure as some shadows of something 
<br />
quite bigger, and non material ...
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; None of the views is &quot;naive&quot;. In fact neither view can ever disprove
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the other, because both belong to different belief (axiomatic)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; systems. apples and oranges, both tasty.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; P.S.:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If what I have said above sounds ok and does help put things in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perspective, then I would like to think that in this WHOLE discussion
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is NO NEED of invoking terms like &quot;comp hyp&quot;, &quot;ASSA&quot;, &quot;RSSA&quot;,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;OMs&quot;, etc. I, being clearly a lesser being in this new domain of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intellectual giants at eskimo.com, would highly appreciate if atleast
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the full forms are given so that I can google them and put them in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; context.
</em><br />
<br />OK, but I think those you mention are used in so many posts that I 
<br />
suggest you to remember them:
<br />
ASSA = A SSA = Absolute Self-Sampling Assumption,
<br />
RSSA = R SSA = Relative Self-Sampling Assumption,
<br />
comp hyp = Computationalist Hypothesis (or digital mechanism, ...)
<br />
OM = Observer-moment
<br />
<br />Bruno
