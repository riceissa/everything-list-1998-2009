<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'll even go out on a limb and suggest that *continuity* is really

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what bothers a lot of people. A lot of us (e.g. Jesse Mazer) are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quite okay with, say, a program that uses the rules of Life to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; give rise to a conscious entity.  But we get really squeamish when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; someone talks about just using the static, instant descriptions---
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the generations of Life as depicted on, say, 2D grids. Even if you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have big a pile of such descriptions---trillions and trillions of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them---we point out that these snapshots are only frozen instants,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where the real &quot;meat&quot; was the continuous process (that so happened
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to use the Rules).
</em><br />
<br />One point of my example was that if you think of the Life universe as
<br />
existing in and of itself, as a Platonic entity, pure information, there
<br />
is really no difference between these views.
<br />
<br />This thread talks about &quot;time deniers&quot; and I might be one, but from my
<br />
perspective it seems that many people are &quot;time mystics&quot;.  They see a
<br />
special role for time that goes beyond its mere presence as part of the
<br />
laws of physics of a universe.
<br />
<br />I imagine that multiple universes could exist, a la Schmidhuber's ensemble
<br />
or Tegmark's level 4 multiverse.  Time does not play a special role in
<br />
the descriptions of these universes.  Some universes will have properties
<br />
that are similar to what we think of as the passage of time; others will
<br />
have nothing that would be recognizably like time; and yet others will
<br />
have some aspects that are similar to time passing but not quite the same.
<br />
<br />Does a pure Life universe have a time coordinate?  In a way, it does.
<br />
Or you can just as easily see it as a stack of grids.  Is there really
<br />
a difference, if the laws of physics are the same in both cases?
<br />
<br />Alternative sets of Life rules will cause every grid in that stack to
<br />
be the same, or equivalently, will cause each successive instant to have
<br />
the same state.  Does that universe have time?
<br />
<br />Even in the case of Life, there are other ways to create the stack of
<br />
grids (or equivalently, succession of states) than to start with some
<br />
initial conditions and evolve forwards.  You could start with some final
<br />
conditions and work your way backwards.  Or you could start in the middle
<br />
and work outwards.  Wolfram considers computational systems (in my view,
<br />
simple universes) which get defined via successive approximations in much
<br />
this way.  Do such universes have time?  There is no unambiguous answer.
<br />
<br />Tegmark in one of his papers considers universes with two or more
<br />
time dimensions.  Can you wrap your mind around that?  Doesn't the
<br />
potential existence of such universes suggest that the notion of process
<br />
vs static-state is too simple?  What would a 2D-time process be like, vs
<br />
a 1D-time process like what we are used to?  Could we imagine universes
<br />
with fractal time dimensions, like the fractal space dimensions which
<br />
are sometimes explored?
<br />
<br />These considerations lead me to the view that there is nothing special
<br />
about time, that it is merely a useful way of looking at some universes.
<br />
Probably the fraction of universes (or more generally, information
<br />
objects) that have a notion of time that is very similar to our own
<br />
is small.
<br />
<br />Now, certainly it seems that consciousnesses like ours, anything that
<br />
we would recognize as a conscious entity, will involve a notion of
<br />
time similar to what we use.  We are bound up with the idea of time
<br />
and so if we see a consciousness in a Life universe, whether we think
<br />
of it as a stack of cells or as a succession of states, it will seem
<br />
to that consciousness that time is passing.  But this is largely
<br />
a selection effect of our own anthropomorphic biases.  We only see
<br />
consciousnesses that perceive time passing because those are the only
<br />
kinds of informational entities that we can think of as conscious.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; P.S. I thought UD was &quot;Universal Dovetailer&quot;, but now you mean
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Universal Description&quot;. We've got to get cautious using the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; acronyms, or be sure, as you did here, to say what you mean in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a post.
</em><br />
<br />Actually it is &quot;Universal Distribution&quot; but I didn't want to write that
<br />
out in detail every time I used it.  Maybe I will write UDist in the
<br />
future to help remind people that no doves were harmed in creating
<br />
this concept.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; P.P.S. Stephen Paul King was one of those who kept bringing up
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the distinction between a *description* of something and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thing itself. With what I have written above, I see a connection
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; now.
</em><br />
<br />For an informational object, a sufficiently precise description is
<br />
equivalent to the object itself, in my view.  And I am considering an
<br />
ontology where everything is an informational object.
