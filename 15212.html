<br />Good point. What's the most concise way to say it? &quot;I believe that  
<br />
persons represented by unimplemented computations are conscious&quot;?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not at all. But many in this list said it was obvious that the UD does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not need to be run, and I remember that I thought that explaining MGA
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was not really necessary. Even you, right now, seem to agree that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computation does not need to be implemented. This does not motivate me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; too much. The MGA is far more subtle than UDA, and it is a bit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; frustrating to explain it to people who says in advance that they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; already agree with the conclusion.
</em><br />
<br />You're right. I do already accept the conclusion. But it's my  
<br />
impression that almost no one else in the world does. I suspect that  
<br />
there are others on this list who do, but even then, I'm not sure they  
<br />
represent a majority. (Should I start an informal poll? How many  
<br />
people on this list believe that persons represented by unimplemented  
<br />
computations are conscious?)
<br />
<br />My impression is that you're more interested in exploring the  
<br />
consequences of that conclusion after you accept it. Obviously,  
<br />
there's nothing wrong with focusing on the issues that interest you  
<br />
most. But for the world-at-large, the primary issue is *why* we should  
<br />
accept in the first place that persons represented by unimplemented  
<br />
computations are conscious. As I said earlier, I've never seen it laid  
<br />
out convincingly. (At least, not in the one language I can read. :)
<br />
<br />I'm aware that exploring the consequences of the conclusion can lend  
<br />
support to the conclusion itself. For instance, if you can show that  
<br />
something like quantum physics emerges from the idea that persons  
<br />
represented by unimplemented computations are conscious, that counts  
<br />
as evidence. But that's a hard road to go. Arguments involving Godel,  
<br />
Loebian machines, etc., go over my head, and will go over most other  
<br />
people's heads as well.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dennett, like many &quot;naturalist&quot; is not aware that the notion of matter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is not obvious at all.
</em><br />
<br />For what it's worth, Dennett made some interesting comments about this  
<br />
somewhere. (Maybe in &quot;Dennett and His Critics&quot;, but I can't remember  
<br />
for sure.) He basically said that, in his capacity as a professional  
<br />
philosopher, he's chosen to focus on the issue of how persons  
<br />
represented by implemented computations can be conscious. (He didn't  
<br />
put it that way, but I think that's a good way of saying it.) When it  
<br />
comes to ontology, he's essentially a layperson. He's willing to  
<br />
accept the standard naturalist ontology (and the standard view of  
<br />
&quot;impelmentation&quot;) so that he can focus on his philosophical specialty.  
<br />
He even indicated that he has some private opinions about ontology,  
<br />
but he doesn't feel qualified enough to air those opinions in public.  
<br />
For all we know, he *is* aware that the notion of matter is not  
<br />
obvious at all. It's just not the issue he's chosen to focus on.
<br />
<br />My point is that one can read Dennett as if he were entirely agnostic  
<br />
about the question of whether persons represented by unimplemented  
<br />
computations are conscious. Almost everything he says about  
<br />
consciousness still makes sense without the assumption of &quot;matter&quot;,  
<br />
even if he himself does assume it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now I feel guilty. There is just no presentations of the MGA in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; English. The MGA appears the first time in my 1988 paper, written in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; french.
</em><br />
[snip]
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In this list, I have always suggest people to read the Maudlin&quot;s paper
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1989, which develops a similar argument.
</em><br />
<br />I don't know French, and I've never tracked down Maudlin's paper. I've  
<br />
only read previous threads on this list, like this one:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/everything-list/browse_thread/thread/567c5ffde76c70a/780e5a48fb33724e?hl=en&amp;lnk=gst&amp;q=olympia#780e5a48fb33724e">http://groups.google.com/group/everything-list/browse_thread/thread/567c5ffde76c70a/780e5a48fb33724e?hl=en&amp;lnk=gst&amp;q=olympia#780e5a48fb33724e</a>
<br />
<br />I don't really grasp the argument presented in that thread, so  
<br />
(therefore) I don't find it very convincing.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps the time has come I explain the MGA on the list? Would you be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interested? It seems that both you and Stathis already accept the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conclusion. So ...
</em><br />
<br />No need to do it just on my account, but yes, I'm interested.
