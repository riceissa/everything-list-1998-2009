<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Theology concerns itself with the &quot;mechanism&quot; of belief.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; What is the mechanism of belief?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It acts like a filter, or a pair of tinted glasses if you will.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Belief is that way of looking at reality that reinforces that way of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; looking at reality. Is that scientific?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No. But then your definition of theology is perhaps a little bit to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; much a contingent matter.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps the word &quot;theology&quot; has too many connotations. I explain  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; below why I do think that, despite its heavy historical background,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it could still be the less misleading word.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I prefer &quot;metaphysical&quot; myself. After all, it claims to be the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; system that is looking at the system. That is perhaps best  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; described as &quot;metaphysics&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Any assessment of supposed objective rigour in ANY form of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; theological thinking - be it &quot;total unrigorous manipulative pseudo-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; theology&quot; or even the usual kind of theology taught to the average
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; working cleric has to be seen in the light of this comment.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The FOR book, Everett formulation of QM, and my own work rely on  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the computationalist hypothesis. Is this not a &quot;theological&quot;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumption?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br /><br />Only if it can never be proven. The trick is to NEVER believe that it  
<br />
can never be proven!
<br />
<br />If COMP one day turns out to be true then it's not theological  
<br />
anymore, it's logical. I'm assuming an equivalence of meaning here in  
<br />
the use of the terms &quot;theological&quot; and &quot;metaphysical&quot; in dealing with  
<br />
assumptions. Of course, if quantum computers turn out to work in the  
<br />
specified manner, then MWI is proven and there never was anything  
<br />
metaphysical going on. Whether or not that is seen as reliable proof  
<br />
of COMP remains to be seen
<br />
<br />The danger, that Alan guards against, lies in STARTING from the  
<br />
metaphysical/theological viewpoint. But this of course makes it  
<br />
extremely hard to deal with all these assumptions out in the open (as  
<br />
you say).
<br />
<br />I certainly do not hold that scientists are somehow free of the  
<br />
ravages of belief. In science, one's beliefs are always smuggled in  
<br />
through the back door - hence Einstein's famous  &quot;God does not play  
<br />
dice with the universe&quot;. He meant it quite as much as a statement of  
<br />
religious faith as a refutation of QM (and I do not believe Einstein  
<br />
would have considered himself offtopic either)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is this not a belief in a form of survival after a form of possible  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; death? A belief that I can survive with an artificial body can be  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seen as an argument for the ability of the &quot;soul&quot; to be independent  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of its body. No?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Yes of course, but again if it turns out to be physically real or at  
<br />
least possible (testable), why do we need the metaphysics? What if  
<br />
the &quot;soul&quot; turns out to be the summation of the &quot;amplitude of your  
<br />
minds&quot; to use Herwig's words, spread across the multiverse? I can  
<br />
cope with that notion under the banner of the real, the possible. No  
<br />
star in the east, no burning bushes - just a mind-blowing real  
<br />
possibility
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Those cases also illustrate the possibility of some theological  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumptions about which we can reason. As Deutsch and Tipler do, it  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seems to me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br /><br />The exciting part surely in what they do is to bypass the theology  
<br />
altogether. It's simply an unnecessary explanatory step. Truth really  
<br />
is stranger than fiction. Theology would try to reference everything  
<br />
to the Bible - see next
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Theology wants to limit the field of ideas because theology is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; traditional gate-keeper of the intellect of organised religion.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is not because 99% of the theologians, and this 99% of the time,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are under the control of political organization (like science  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sometimes, somewhere: ex: genetic in Soviet Union), that we should  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dismiss the original questioning.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br /><br />I feel it is the other way around. Politics is belief or spirituality  
<br />
in action. What we believe authors what we do, sets up what we call  
<br />
&quot;moral&quot;.  The supposed split between the Church and the State is as  
<br />
much nonsense today as it was in the Middle Ages. Law is ultimately  
<br />
rooted in adherence to a moral framework, so belief in values, morals  
<br />
etc precedes politics, indeed gives rise to it
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; anyone heard of an organised religion that is gagging for new
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; thinking, new ideas???
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Come on. The jewish commentaries, the scolastic christians, The  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Muslim neoplatonist,  the Hinduism school, the taoist schools, the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; buddhist schools: all have been open some long time to critical  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argumentations and improvements. Hinduism and Buddhism have even  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; had quite sophisticate internal school of logic.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br /><br />Most look to their past for a continuing mandate and thus fall back  
<br />
on their laurels. There is not enough futuristic stuff in theology.  
<br />
It's usually about why things have to be NOW the way they are because  
<br />
of something that happened way back THEN.  COMP is exciting because  
<br />
it offers the possibility of &quot;future&quot; conditioning of &quot;past&quot; events.  
<br />
Religious thinking is not really up to this
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Look at the neo-platonist tradition: quite a long and sincere  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argumentation. It still exists today everywhere on the planet, even  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if it is hidden by the media politically correct cacophonia.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yet, Plato was a truly fascist thinker. He admired Sparta, a fascist  
<br />
state - and built this power-structure thing into his vision of what  
<br />
a Republic was. Let's not forget that. He believed in slavery. This  
<br />
surely is of interest in looking at the theological aspects of the  
<br />
neo-platonist tradition?  He claimed a form of reality for ideas that  
<br />
is based on &quot;mathematical reality&quot; - essentially a yes-no, right- 
<br />
wrong information system - at least in its everyday implementation.  
<br />
This was extrapolated as the search for &quot;truth&quot;. According to  
<br />
Socrates (or Plato more likely as all we know of Socrates words comes  
<br />
via Plato's ) - all you had to do was get rid of all error and then  
<br />
you are left with the truth. But this is nonsense. Life is not a  
<br />
mathematical problem. Usually the cause of all &quot;error&quot; is human  
<br />
nature. This is a very difficult cause to remove.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Theology has an unspoken brief to limit the field of ideas to what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the powerbrokers in organised religions long ago decided was  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; permissable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But organised religion, like organised academy, should be separate  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from the original intent.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The same is true for philosophy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />It's hard not to extrapolate to the world around here. Many religious  
<br />
scholars are standing up for their beliefs right now in a very public  
<br />
way. Islamic scholars have the direct ear of government. In this way,  
<br />
belief systems can quickly author actions if required.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Science (and hopefully philosophy if it can keep up) will usually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; seek to enlarge and populate the field of ideas with anything and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; everything necessary to understand reality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But by preventing seriousness in theology and its related  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; questions, you make yourself an objective ally of those who want  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;theology&quot; to be kept in the hand of social manipulators.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br /><br />If by &quot;seriousness in theology&quot; you allow that everything in a belief  
<br />
system may be subject to a complete makeover or update to a more  
<br />
contemporary way of expressing and dealing with issues then I am not  
<br />
against it at all. Everything has to change in the universe, so why  
<br />
does belief remain stuck in Sunday school? Going back to the Bible to  
<br />
justify everything is how the social manipulators work because God  
<br />
spoke to man in a way that requires interpretation and that can be  
<br />
exploited
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And the worst is that this attitude encourages a wrong  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understanding of science, like if science was answering (or even  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tackling) those questions, which for methodological reasons only,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it does not. It makes science a peculiar theology : one which  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pretend to reach the truth. Is that not a form of arrogance?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br /><br />Like I said - scientists have their beliefs; they just don't talk  
<br />
about them. Most don't talk about them even to themselves and that's  
<br />
the biggest worry. It's impossible not to act out of belief because  
<br />
we know when we are doing something we do not believe in. You cannot  
<br />
lie to yourself. I do not think science pretends to be reaching the  
<br />
truth because if that happens we all have to shut up and go to bed  
<br />
because there is nothing left to talk about.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is not naturalism a religion? Is not the &quot;primitive universe&quot; or  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Nature&quot; just a &quot;Modern God&quot;?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes. But doesn't Occam's razor eliminate some things here? Or,  
<br />
doesn't Occam show up when God is around?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; After all, as I just recall in my preceding post, nobody has given  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a proof of the existence of Nature.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br /><br />I think the Gaia hypothesis of Lovelock came closest. The Earth may  
<br />
yet convince us that she exists through repeated attempts to destroy  
<br />
the human plague with natural catastrophe and severe weather. We take  
<br />
a lot of convincing, don't we?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Even Aristotle, as I begin to suspect, has been much more cautious  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on the existence of Nature than most of its followers.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have no problem with scientists and theologians. I have problem  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with any dogma, both when used in science or in theology.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But today, dogmatic theologians are less annoying than dogmatic  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scientists,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Except where they provide intellectual justification for people to  
<br />
strap bombs on themselves etc.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; because the dogmatic scientists pretend having no dogma, making  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dialog on fundamental open questions even more difficult I'm afraid.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
Then it is a very silly situation then. We should dismiss all  
<br />
scientists' claims until we can be certain of their dogma. You can  
<br />
see why they try to avoid talking about it
