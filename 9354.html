Hi George,
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thank you for still working on my post. I am working on the reply, in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particular designing the set of function or number that can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; diagonalized to generate a large number. I shall be busy this weekend
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with family matters but I will reply to you in detail.
</em><br />
<br />Take it easy we have all the time. In case of trouble don't hesitate to 
<br />
ask for hints or supplementary explanations. This is said for everyone.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree that the idea of quantum suicide did not originate with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Tegmark,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even though he is the one who popularized it.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Sure. He wrote a beautiful paper. Note that he is unaware of the more 
<br />
general and more simple (?) comp immortality.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The idea also came to me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; independently in the early 1990's as I was pondering the Scroedinger 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cat
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiment. What if I was the cat? How would I feel? What if I was the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scientist conducting the experiment and I was inside a larger box
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; enclosing the whole experiment? Would I feel the superposition? These
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are very obvious questions to ask. This Scroedinger cat experiment
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; approximately dates to the 1920-1930's (?) and it is very well possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that others have had the same thought.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I think Schroedinger used the cat for explaining a paradoxical feature 
<br />
of QM, and I have not see suggestions by him that comp leads to either 
<br />
many world or quantum immortality (as Everett and Deutsch will do for 
<br />
the many-world, but not the immortality question though.
<br />
I think that in the &quot;priority&quot; matter (a boring subject but then 
<br />
friends said that I must defend myself a little bit more) the criteria 
<br />
is the date of the publication. It is one thing to get an idea and a 
<br />
different thing to publish it. You need to fçind the idea but also to 
<br />
get the nerves to make it public. I have not publish so much &quot;easy&quot; 
<br />
readable (original) thing not to insist a little bit on this, 
<br />
especially given that I still somehow paying a hard price for having 
<br />
dare to work on such questions in the seventies. I suspect a little bit 
<br />
Russell (notably in his book) to dismiss how much both the universal 
<br />
dovetailer and comp-immortality was (and still is actually) original in 
<br />
the &quot;TOE&quot; framework. Russell makes often (in posts and in his preprint 
<br />
book) the confusion between the notion of &quot;Universal Machine&quot;, 
<br />
Schmidhuber great programmer (which does not dovetail) and the 
<br />
Universal Dovetailer. Those notions are related but are not at all 
<br />
equivalent in the search for a TOE, neither extensionally, nor 
<br />
intensionally (different programs and different functions).
<br />
I developed and defended those ideas very early. This explains in part 
<br />
why I have been confronted with an obvious natural skepticism, and this 
<br />
is why I have provided the logical analysis (well to be true I got this 
<br />
one simultaneously as I explained in the 1988 paper: it is even the 
<br />
reason why I have chose to do math and not physics). Actually the 
<br />
&quot;heart of the matter&quot; explanations will consist in showing how much 
<br />
universal dovetailing and Church thesis are non trivial notions. 
<br />
Paradoxically enough, the widespread use of computer hide the 
<br />
complexity. You need training in diagonalization to doubt Church's 
<br />
thesis!
<br />
The same with the comp first person indeterminacy. Probably my main 
<br />
easy (for you in this quite open-minded list) discovery. Remember that 
<br />
Schmidhuber did leave the list by refusing explicitly the first-third 
<br />
person distinction (which explain why his great programmer does not 
<br />
need to dovetail). It is not just a question of priority, it is a 
<br />
question of getting the notions right before.
<br />
Another point. james Higgo told us explicitly that, despite quantum 
<br />
suicide, Tegmark did not believe in the quantum immortality consequence 
<br />
of the quantum hyp, showing the big nuance between the immortality and 
<br />
suicide points, often confuse in posts or elsewhere. Oops I must leave 
<br />
...
<br />
<br />Best,
<br />
<br />Bruno
