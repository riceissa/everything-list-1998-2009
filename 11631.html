David, 
<br />
<br />Consider these three examples:
<br />
<br />(a) You utter sentence S, &quot;the cat sat on the mat&quot;. The word &quot;on&quot; 
<br />
starts at time t1 and finishes at time t2.
<br />
<br />(b) At time t1 while uttering S you are intantaneously teleported to a 
<br />
distant location.
<br />
<br />(c) You have no actual past but materialise de novo at time t1 as if in (b), 
<br />
uttering  &quot;... on the mat&quot;. 
<br />
<br />We are interested in your phenomenal consciousness between t1 and t2 in 
<br />
each case (ignoring the change of scenery due to the teleportation). It is no 
<br />
doubt quite complex, involving not only saying the word &quot;on&quot; but also a sense 
<br />
of self, a sense of the whole sentence and your place in it, an idea that this is 
<br />
part of an experiment, and so on. There may even be a lag between action and 
<br />
awareness, so that you are actually conscious of saying &quot;sat&quot; in the interval 
<br />
t1t2 rather than when you actually said it, and there will probably be at least some 
<br />
sense of continuity between &quot;sat&quot; and &quot;on&quot; during t1t2. 
<br />
<br />The point is, whatever you are thinking during t1t2, you are thinking *something*, 
<br />
and you are thinking the same something in (a), (b) and (c). Whatever complex 
<br />
brain processes are occurring during t1t2 in (a) are also occurring in (b) and (c), and 
<br />
therefore whatever conscious processes are occurring during that interval in (a) will 
<br />
also occur in (b) and (c), and you will not lose your place in the sentence or your sense 
<br />
of continuity of consciousness. The OM t1t2 is exactly the same in each case, and falls 
<br />
perfectly into position in each case by virtue of its content alone.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; at some subconscious level have the structure of the whole sentence spanning a 2 second interval

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; t1-t2 or else the sentence could not be generated.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's still unclear to me from the above whether we're in agreement or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not. I'm concerned that you may be assuming what is to be explained,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; owing to an illegitimate sleight of intuition. That is, it's so normal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for us to think in terms of the overall 'sequence of moments' that it's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; easy to forget that the posit for OMs is that they are *informationally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; closed* with respect to other OMs (this is the point I've been debating
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with Peter, with which I thought you agreed). If OMs are thus closed,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then it must follow that whatever information is required to generate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the experience of 'a given moment' (under-defined, but see below)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *must* be contained in its entirety within *some* (but of course not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; every) OM.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Were that not the case, *no* individual OM would contain all the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; elements of a coherent conscious experience, and by the same token
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *any* coherent conscious experience would necessarily have to span
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *multiple* OMs. But any such assumption - i.e. meta-assembly of data
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; over multiple OMs - is precisely what we wish to rule out of our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; account. A 'successor' OM - and any conscious state dependent on it -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; must simply 'forget' anything about 'prior' OMs that is not re-encoded
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; within it - beyond such encoding, everything else is simply radically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; absent. A metaphor here might be a cine-film. An OM is then a frame. If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all you have is a single frame, then your 'experience' must be strictly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; limited to whatever is contained in that frame, unless you can somehow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; surreptitiously sneak a glance at - or recall at will - other frames.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; we rely on the machinery of the brain keeping track of everything to generate successive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; moments of consciousness which pull everything back into coherence.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is what you say above consistent with the constraints on OMs in my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; account? I think perhaps we may intend the same thing here.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This consideration, at least, strongly suggests (IMO entails) something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entirely non-trivial about what the brain is actually doing (your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'engineering problem'), beyond representing simple 'snapshots' from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; external input. To overcome the 'OM constraint', it needs to assemble,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from these 'instants', 'rolling constructs', each of which encodes an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; updated version of the 'specious present', *simultaneously*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; representing multiple snapshots and their relations. It may be entirely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; owing to such 'time capsules' (as Barbour, taking this issue seriously,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implies) that we are able to assemble and implement a dynamic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience of 'time'. In fact, we can be pretty sure that there is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain mechanism doing something like this, because as Colin recently
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reminded us, there are syndromes that interfere with it, changing the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'dynamic granularity' (refresh rate). So our dynamic experience - the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'A-series' - may depend critically on such 'time-synthesising'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mechanisms within brain structure and function, rather than mapping in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a simple sequential way to external 'B-series' events. And this of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; course would then make sense of why such biological time-mechanisms
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would have evolved. That is, because successive improvement in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ability to represent, and consequently discriminate and respond to, an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; environment perceived as dynamic events and processes at variable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; levels of granularity, confers obvious survival advantage.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As for memory being encoded in or accessible to an OM, that is an unnecessary complication.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As you said previously, the OM's are related solely by their information content. If the seconds
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of your life were sliced up, shuffled and thrown to the wind, (t1) 3:10:02 PM of 10/10/06 would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; still subjectively follow (t2) 3:10:01 PM of 10/10/06 even though there is no connection or &quot;flow&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of information between them. If you look at how t1 and t2 are generated, then yes, there is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; connection - they both come out of your head - but once generated, they form a natural sequence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which cannot be disrupted.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; But my point about the 'coherence' of consciousness is that it seems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; (especially from what occurs, or fails to occur, when it deteriorates)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; that complex representation and processing of *temporally extended*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; information sequences (e.g. grasp of the entirety of the content and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; meaning of a sentence or proposition) is necessary for one to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; experience and act as a fully-functioning conscious individual.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Consequently, it seems to me that such processes must converge on OMs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; in which all the necessary information is fully encoded and expressed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; (which is essentially what Barbour seems to be claiming for his 'time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; capsules' - e.g. his 'flight of the kingfisher' example). Without this,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; the alternative seems to be that the individual random, wind-blown
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; seconds of your metaphor would need to be totalised in some additional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; non-information-based manner in order to coordinate an ensemble of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; informationally incomplete, discrete elements into coherent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; experiences. AFAICS they only 'form a natural sequence' from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; quasi-objective perspective of our philosophical stance. And such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; coordination is in any case what we were assuring Peter was both
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; unnecessary and impossible.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; We have to distinguish between what actually happens to create the moments of a stream of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; consciousness and what is the minimum logically necessary that needs to happen. My brain must
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; at some subconscious level have the structure of the whole sentence spanning a 2 second interval
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; t1-t2 or else the sentence could not be generated. But that's just an engineering problem: if the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; moments t1 and t2 come about with exactly the right sort of phenomenal content, magically, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; by random processes, then I will experience a coherent 2 second span of consciousness in which I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; utter the full sentence. The only way I might not experience this is if there is something wrong with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the actual phenomenal content of t1 and t2: if whatever vague sense I have of the whole sentence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; during t1 and t2 is missing during either or both intervals, then I would forget what I was saying.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The vague sense of the whole sentence has two parts, in t1 and t2, just as the sentence itself has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; two parts. If we had a longer sentence through further nitervals t3, t4 and t5, it could be, for example,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that during t4 the sense of the whole sentence is completely absent, and only in retrospect from t5 is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; it seen that t4 was part of the whole. This sort of thing happens all the time during absent-minded
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; moments, and we rely on the machinery of the brain keeping track of everything to generate successive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; moments of consciousness which pull everything back into coherence.
