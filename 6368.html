<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The perpetual question I have (about the epiphenomena problem that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; any form of Idealism has), regarding this notion of a Platonic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Reality, is that IF all possible Forms of existence *exist* a priori
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; - &quot;from the beginning&quot; - what necessitates any form of 1st person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; experience of a world that &quot;evolves&quot;, has an irreversible arrow of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; time, etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It seems to me that Plato's Ideal is the ultimate case of a system
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; in thermodynamic equilibrium, and as such exhibits no change of any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; kind, per definition. What then is the origin of, at least, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; illusion of change? How can Becoming derive from pure Being?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [Brian]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; These, of course, are very good questions, and ones whose answers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; require a lot of hand-waving. In defense of Platonic Reality, I could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; retort that the questions can just as saliently be directed at the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical block Multiverse. As Charles frequently notes, the Block
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe is inescapable unless you have an infinite number of time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dimensions.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This idea about an infinite time dimensions seems inevitable if we take 
<br />
the bitstring idea seriously, especially when these bitstrings are such that 
<br />
they can be run in strictly series or parallel ways. But I would like to 
<br />
point out that such processes are the exception and not the rule in the 
<br />
&quot;real&quot; world.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think of the process of constructing a house, there are many different 
<br />
work crews specializing in one aspect of home construction or another, each 
<br />
trying to do their jobs. As anyone that has been in this industry would 
<br />
know, the hardest part of planning is in getting all of the crews scheduled 
<br />
so that they do not conflict or are left waiting on some other crew to start 
<br />
or finish. If we are going to take the computationalist claims seriously, 
<br />
then we must demand that they include concurrency problems in their models. 
<br />
;-)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BTW, I have mentioned before that there are serious problems with the 
<br />
&quot;block universe&quot; idea, one of them is this concurrency problem. While 
<br />
quantum mechanics, ignoring the collapse postulate, is strictly 
<br />
deterministic, the existence of canonical conjugacy between observable 
<br />
quantities, such as position and momentum, (exemplified by the Heisenberg 
<br />
Uncertainty Principle) prevents us from even constructing a space-time 
<br />
manifold where each and every event can be one-to-one and onto mapped to 
<br />
others.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simply put, it is impossible to define the position and momenta 
<br />
quantities of particles or waves on a slice of space-time (a &quot;Cauchy 
<br />
hypersurface&quot;) such that any thing resembling a classical manifold obtains; 
<br />
it simply is impossible. The best we can do is to break the manifold up into 
<br />
little pieces, attach distributions of quantities to them and then try to 
<br />
stitch them together.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Additionally, how do we justify the assumption that the mere a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; priori existence of Turing Machines does not necessitate some means
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to &quot;implement&quot; the TMs? It is one thing to claim that software can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; run on any suitable hardware, it is altogether something else to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; claim that &quot;hardware&quot; doesn't exist!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [Brian]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I share your feelings on this. Bruno's reply would, I think, go along
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the lines of: a TM and its computational history are just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relationships among integers. Those relationships, just like any other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical relationships, need no hardware. When we discover a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical relationship and write it down, does it then become real?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Possibly I am talking out of my hat here.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that you are not just defining &quot;realness&quot; to be &quot;only those 
<br />
aspect of existence that can be represented by some physical means, 
<br />
reversible or not&quot;. I would argue that this definition misses the mark since 
<br />
it is easily shown that unless two more observers can agree upon , say, a 
<br />
representation of a mathematical relationship, we have no way to know that 
<br />
the scratches in the sand are no more than random marks left by grazing 
<br />
birds. ;-)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reality is a 3rd person aspect, it is that which we can all agree upon. 
<br />
Putting it into Anthropic terms, it is that which is both consistent and 
<br />
necessary for our existence as observers and is capable of being faithfully 
<br />
communicated. I seem to have put the cart before the horse in my response to 
<br />
your statement above but is it intentional, I am trying to point out that 
<br />
any relationship has to include some means for it to have a meaning in order 
<br />
for us to even try to claim that that relationship is &quot;real&quot;.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point is that to claim that numbers and relationships between then 
<br />
exists a priori to any means of associating &quot;meaningfulness&quot; to them is 
<br />
self-stultifying, especially claims that reduce those to whom 
<br />
&quot;meaningfulness&quot; matters the most namely &quot;observers. By reducing observers 
<br />
to mere relationships between numbers and the appearance of change to some 
<br />
kind of transitivity implicit in these relationships (such as the well 
<br />
ordering of the Reals) fails when we consider QM, because any casual reader 
<br />
of a QM test will tell you that observables, prior to the specification of a 
<br />
particular means to make a measurement and the actual implementation of the 
<br />
measurement, have a complex value. Complex numbers, as we know, do not have 
<br />
a well order; where then are we to find a source for the illusion of time?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something actually has to move and change, and as I have railed before 
<br />
in many polemics, so why not drop the pretension that physicality is merely 
<br />
epiphenomena and consider the mere possibility, even if for the sake of 
<br />
discussion here, that the physical world and all manner of material process 
<br />
has the same ontological status as Mathematical relationships. In so doing 
<br />
we might not need to resort to so much hand-waving. ;-)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Just because all possible TMs *could* get some measure of runtime,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; since we are assuming from the beginning that there exists some form
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of hardware, does not mean that they can all be implemented. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; most notorious case are TMs that ask the question &quot;Do I halt?&quot;...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [Brian]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A TM that asks &quot;Do I halt&quot; may get a definite answer because it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only one algorithm - the algorithm of that TM - that is under
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consideration. The problem is that we cannot write a TM to decide
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whether *any* given TM will halt. No such TM exists, so of course it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will never be implemented.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us consider exactly what it would mean for one TM to communicate 
<br />
with another. It is there, I argue, that the any kind of Ideal monism 
<br />
collapses into mere world play! Unless a TM has some means to cause some 
<br />
causally meaningful change in another TM, is it even possible to consider 
<br />
inter-TM communication? If so, I would truly like to know! One might argue 
<br />
that the physical world is necessary if only to act as an interface between 
<br />
one TM and another!
<br />
<br /><br /><br />See: <a href="http://tph.tuwien.ac.at/~svozil/publ/2000-interface.htm">http://tph.tuwien.ac.at/~svozil/publ/2000-interface.htm</a>
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; We need to be very careful that we are not assuming infinite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; resources for our TMs to run on, the computationalist equivalent of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; a Perpetual Motion Machine. We need to seriously consider that even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; our Holiest of TMs &gt; is subservient to Thermodynamic laws. Have we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; learned nothing from the Maxwell Demon?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [Brian]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My justification for the statement that all possible TM's will get
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some runtime comes from the Turing Principle which predicts that a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universal computer will be realized, and possibly realized in all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universes. So there is no bound to the number of computations that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will be performed in this universe and others. Hence all possible TMs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will be implemented, even if some of those don't get implemented until
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; near the end of the universe.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But exactly what does &quot;will be realized mean&quot; if there is no &quot;hardware&quot; 
<br />
that equal ontological status with the universal computer software, e.g. the 
<br />
bitstrings or numebrs themselves?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Regarding sim virtual worlds, It can be easily argued that, given
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; sufficient computational resources, the differences that can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; found, noticed, measure or know by any 1st person means of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; distinguishing virtual worlds from &quot;real&quot; worlds vanish.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [Brian]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, indeed.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does this principle have a name?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; We need to be very careful that we are not elevating our internally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; generated abstraction of being able to &quot;peek into the world from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; outside&quot; and yet be independent of it into a postulate.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [Brian]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree. And I think what is missing in Bruno's stuff is some theory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of what an observer is. That's what sets the whole thing alight.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finding a consistent theory of an observer is my obsession! ;-) Thus I 
<br />
am very attentive to ideas that are related to the notion of observers, even 
<br />
those of Bruno. ;-)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; As was discovered
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; in the case of the Maxwell Demon, the very act of observation or,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; equivalently!, simulation of the &quot;world in a fishbowl&quot; has a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; thermodynamic &quot;cost associated with it that can not be dispelled by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; appeals to abstract notions of a Platonia. ;-)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [Brian]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, when we run a sim, we out here in the &quot;real&quot; world bear a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thermodynamic cost. And if we are sim's, someone presumably is bearing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the cost of us. Thermodynamics doesn't seem to arise in any obvious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way from maths. I can sort of formulate an answer to this problem, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'll save it because it hasn't been toilet trained yet :)
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that lack of an equivalent to a thermodynamic cost in mathematics 
<br />
irritates me. There has been some work by Jakko Hintikka, Johan van Benthem 
<br />
and others that seems to make some strides in alleviating my allergy that 
<br />
compares the &quot;truth&quot; of a given theorem to a game that pits agents trying to 
<br />
prove a given statement against agents trying to falsify it:

that thermodynamics holds sway even in that lofty Platonic realm. ;-)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; To put is bluntly, the question [of what Charlie sim should expect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to see] is meaningful only if a 3rd person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; method is available with which to establish falsifiable the content
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of the virtual world, if one can somehow &quot;unplug&quot; oneself from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Matrix, but even then we have no way of being absolutely sure that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the &quot;unplugged world&quot; isn't just another more sophisticated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; simulacrum. ;-)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [Brian]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No, there is no way to unplug oneself from the Matrix. It's platonic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; turtles all the way down.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure, I like non-well founded sets. ;-) But nevertheless, there is a 
<br />
&quot;cost&quot; that must be paid for the act of emulating that takes place.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Stepping back from writing this, it is easy to presume that I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; merely playing with words and/or being clever, but really: what in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the world am I to do with this idea of propping up the totality of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; my 1st person experience, inconsistent and obstinate as it may be,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; with the most tenuous of vapors, the mere a priori possibility of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; string of ones and zeros that somehow can exactly represent the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; totality of my life, as if I am just watching a DVD: &quot;This is your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Life: Stephen Paul King&quot;. Something about this disturbs me in ways
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that I have a problem even putting into words.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [Brian]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Nice polemic! It gives me the heebe-jeebies too! It is profoundly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; disturbing. But if it is really what gives at the most fundamental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; level, then we've got no choice but to swallow the pill. Ultimately,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm sure, we would see its beauty.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; About the idea of nested simulations: It can be easily proven that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; if one has access to infinite computational resources, there exists

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, I can see that quite easily.

<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cool!

<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; A couple of friends of mine, Paul Hanna and David Woolsey pointed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; out this some time ago and even helped me work out an algebra of

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; sorts that represent the various aspect that the idea of simulating

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; simulations can manifest. If we assume that only finite resources

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; are available for the &quot;hardware&quot; implementing these simulations it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is easy to see that some form of truncation will, inevitably, occur
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; thus solving the &quot;problem&quot; of infinite regress.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [Brian]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Also easy to see, but you run foul of the Turing Principle if you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assume the universe will not perform an infinite number of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computations in the limit.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I run afoul of the assumption that computations can somehow occur 
<br />
with zero thermodynamic costs! We have banished Perpetual Motion from 
<br />
science but it still haunts Mathematics!
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; One question I have is: Could it be that the reason why we have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; experiences of a finite universe stem from some underlying finite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; limit on the ability of one computation to emulate another? If we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; turn to networks of computers we see all kinds of limiting factors:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; concurrency, synchronization issues, translation barriers, etc. If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; we are going to take the Computational paradigm seriously, do not we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; also have to take all of it, not just the Platonic best parts?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [Brian]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Again, I'm going to throw the Turing Principle at you.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, again, I am going to demand a theory that explains how one Pure 
<br />
Number can communicate with another! Dovetailers don't pass muster for me!
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [Brian]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm running out of time, so I'll have to end there. I'll try to give
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some answers on the points you raised on Russell's stuff later, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that needs some study!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, I appreciate your comments on those points because those are 
<br />
the ones that I have the least confidence in; they relate to possible 
<br />
contradictions in my thesis.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Kindest regards,
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Stephen
