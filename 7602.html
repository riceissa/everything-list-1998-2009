<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interesting to take a snapshot at the end of a simulation and do the trick 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of reversing everything, but with a tiny perturbation--the simulation might 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appear to behave like a reversed version of the original run for a little 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; while, but then the butterfly effect would probably kick in and the upload's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; psychological arrow of time would *reverse* in the middle of the simulation. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What would this feel like subjectively, from the upload's point of view? 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Obviously he wouldn't have a memory of experiencing everything backwards, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but it still would be interesting to interview the upload about it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; afterwards. For example, what would happen if the reversal of the upload's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; psychological arrow of time happened at the same moment that the entropic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arrow of time reversed in the simulated physical world around the upload, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and at that moment pieces of a vase were rushing together to reassemble, but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instead failed to meet up exactly and just broke apart again? The upload 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should have a memory of seeing the vase fall, but at the moment it landed it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; might appear to behave very strangely, assuming the upload didn't just 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perceive himself blacking out at that moment.
</em><br />
<br />That's a cool problem.  I've given it some thought and here is what
<br />
I came up with.  The short answer is that as we are running backwards,
<br />
due to the chaotic nature of the physics, the transition from an accurate
<br />
backwards one to a locally disrupted one will be nearly instantaneous.
<br />
The divergence from the original forwards run will grow exponentially,
<br />
meaning that if you have set it so that it &quot;kicks in&quot; after say -5
<br />
seconds, then at -4.9999 seconds everything would still look normal.
<br />
<br />Then, once you had divergence in a specific location, I think the effects
<br />
would spread out at the speed of sound.  We are relying on every atom
<br />
moving the opposite of what it did before, and atoms generally move at
<br />
the speed of sound, so as soon as one starts misbehaving it will kick
<br />
its neighbors, which will kick their neighbors, and the disruption
<br />
will spread at that speed.
<br />
<br />Once the disruption has occured then I think you are right that time will
<br />
effectively start forward again, and probably take a different path than
<br />
it did the first time through.
<br />
<br />This would imply then that subjectively there are two paths, the one we
<br />
ran the first time, and the one which resulted from the alteration. They
<br />
would subjectively diverge at the point where the butterfly effect
<br />
kicked in during the reverse run.  The transition would be subjectively
<br />
instantaneous, with the whole brain flipping in a millisecond or less
<br />
from backwards to forwards motion.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From the measure perspective, I'd say that the first half that was
</em><br />
shared has measure 1, the second half that got run twice (once forward,
<br />
once backward) had measure 2, and the alternate second half would have
<br />
measure 1.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And perhaps something like this could help explain the low-entropy big bang, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which is apparently the source of the arrow of time in our universe and yet 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doesn't have any agreed-upon explanation by physicists. It would certainly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be interesting if even a complete theory of quantum gravity didn't explain 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it, so that the only remaining option would be either &quot;intelligent design&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or some sort of &quot;meta-physical&quot; explanation in terms of a multiverse with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different types of universes having different measure.
</em><br />
<br />Right, that is one of the big selling points of the Tegmark and
<br />
Schmidhuber concept, that the Big Bang apparently can be described in
<br />
very low-information terms.  Tegmark even has a paper arguing that it
<br />
took &quot;zero information&quot; to describe it (but frankly I am getting pretty
<br />
turned off on the &quot;zero information&quot; concept since several people here
<br />
use it to describe completely different things, and if it really took
<br />
zero information then there couldn't be more than one thing described,
<br />
could it?).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;My feeling is that causality, like time, is in the eye of the beholder.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;It's not an inherent or fundamental property.  Rather, it is a way that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;we can interpret events in some kinds of universes.  Completely chaotic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;universes (where every moment is random and uncorrelated with the next)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;would not have causality in any meaningful sense.  Likewise for static
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;universes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But if such a chaotic universe is computable, then for those of us watching 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the computation from the outside, the read/write head of the Turing machine 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is still obeying regular laws, in terms of when it decides to flip a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particular bit or change its internal pointer-state or move from one 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; location on the bitstring to another...if it's possible to define a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical notion of &quot;causal structure&quot; for any particular algorithm, I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would think it would be possible to apply it to *all* algorithms. But 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perhaps no such mathematical notion of causal structure will be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; forthcoming...the reason I'd guess it is is that such a notion would seem 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; essential for defining what it means to &quot;instantiate&quot; a particular observer 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in such a way that you don't count things like lookup tables, and also so 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that you don't end up concluding that random thermal vibrations in a rock 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; actually instantiate all possible algorithms (the problem discussed in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Chalmers' paper &quot;Does a Rock Implement Every Finite-State Automaton?&quot; at 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://cogprints.org/226/00/199708001.html">http://cogprints.org/226/00/199708001.html</a> ).
</em><br />
<br />The model I suggested the other day, basically just the Universal
<br />
Distribution, IMO fully solves these two riddles.  First, the question
<br />
is not &quot;are they conscious&quot; but &quot;how much measure do they add to the
<br />
particular observer-moments which they are putatively experiencing&quot;.
<br />
And the UDist shows that this can be answered in a straightforward,
<br />
quantitative way, by asking what is the shortest program that takes these
<br />
data structures as input (the lookup table or the rock) and outputs
<br />
something that matches our canonicalized representation of the OMs in
<br />
question (perhaps a schematic representation of a neural network with
<br />
specified firing patterns).  I can tell you that the rock isn't going
<br />
to add any measure.  I don't know about the lookup table, maybe there
<br />
is an algorithm to use it to deduce the neural network that would have
<br />
created it.  Hans Moravec argued that there was such an algorithm, at
<br />
least for a big enough lookup table.  But in principle it is an empirical
<br />
question in the framework based on the UDist.  There's nothing fuzzy or
<br />
philosophical about it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, that's what I was talking about in my last post when I said that my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intuition of &quot;causal structure&quot; is not a time-asymmetric one, that it would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only be about saying two events are causally related without specifying one 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as the &quot;cause&quot; and the other as the &quot;effect&quot;. And as I said, my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understanding of loop quantum gravity is that it does involve some notion of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; building spacetime out of relationships between events without any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time-asymmetry being involved.
</em><br />
<br />Maybe so, I don't know much about LCG.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Scerir has also posted some interesting paradoxes along these lines
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;relating to QM.  Suppose we have a photon that passes through a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;polarizer oriented at 20 degrees from vertical, then through one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;oriented at 40 degrees, and makes it through both.  At the end we would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;say its polarization was 40 degrees.  But what was it between the two
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;polarizers?  Conventionally we would say that the first polarizer made its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;polarization become 20 degrees and the second polarizer then changed the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;polarization to 40 degrees.  But actually you can just as easily argue
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;that the photon polarization was 40 degrees between the two polarizers.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;That interpretation works just as well, a sort of retroactive causality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What would the MWI say about this? Whatever it would say, I'm pretty sure it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wouldn't say that there was a single photon in a definite state between the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; two polarizers.
</em><br />
<br />No, I think it does, but I might be wrong.  I think it says the universe
<br />
splits into two when the photon hits the first polarizer; in one the
<br />
photon is absorbed and in the other the photon continues in the 20
<br />
degree polarization state.  Or you can run time backwards and get the
<br />
photon to be in the 40 degree state.  I don't think the MWI helps much
<br />
with this.
