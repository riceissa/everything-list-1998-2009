<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; something &quot;exists&quot;?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is naturally the $64k question for this list - or any other, for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that matter (pun intended).  I don't know the 'answer' - of course -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but it doesn't stop me banging on about it interminably, here and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; elsewhere.  Anyway, I'll have another go, but naturally only on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; basis that anything that follows is just a 'way of speaking' that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; might - or mightn't - be helpful in resolving apparent puzzles
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stemming from linguistic or logical confusions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Personally, I find it useful to start from a more primitive position
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prior to speculating about the status of say, mathematical formalisms.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Like Schopenhauer, Spinoza, Schrodinger and very many others, I find
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dualism to founder hopelessly on the rock of interaction and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explanatory redundancy.  Hence I'm a monist (or a non-dualist) who -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; given the singular incorrigibility of first-person 'experiential
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality' - concludes that though whatever underlies remains forever
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *unknowable* it must nonetheless perforce be 'real in the sense that I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; am real' (RITSIAR - a gnomic acronym that has surfaced before on this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; list).
</em><br />
<br />Hmm... OK. Nice. Not completely convinced yet.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Other primitive intuitions are founded on this:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) The unknowable is singular (i.e symmetrical, holistic, indivisible:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; e.g. Plotinus' One)
</em><br />
<br />&quot;unknowable&quot;?
<br />
<br />or unprovable, uncommunicable, that is unbelievable,  unjustifiable.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) The unknowable is pluralistic (asymmetrical, differentiated: i.e.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pattern and order manifested within the One)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3) 01 and 02 taken together are of course 'paradoxical' in the light of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the logic of the 'excluded middle'.  This, I believe, is not vicious,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but rather points virtuously towards the limit of such logics.  It
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; situates an unresolvable mystery appropriately, rather than attempting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; speciously to dispel it or ignore it.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Hmm... The &quot;excluded middle&quot; is what makes us modest.
<br />
It makes possible to prove the existence of some object x by showing  
<br />
that x belongs to {a, b, c} , without any means to decide which of a,  
<br />
b and c x is.
<br />
The excluded middle principle is what you need to recognize unknowns  
<br />
and capture them in some set, hopefully not to big.
<br />
In the theoretical computer science, and especially in theoretical  
<br />
learning many theorems are necessarily non constructive.
<br />
You abandon the excluded middle principle when you want to build  
<br />
something, or extend yourself, with the exclusion of the other.
<br />
The excluded middle principle is what you need to think and dream  
<br />
about what you build, and what can follow, and talk on it with others.
<br />
You need it somehow to believe in another one. Also, it prevents not  
<br />
the falsity of solipsism, but the falsity of any doctrinal (3- 
<br />
communicable) solipsism.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4) 1 and 2 taken together must be RITSIAR.  For me, this comprises the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intuition that 'existence' is fundamentally - and only - a 'personal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and present way of being'.  To put it another way, epistemology and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ontology are enfolded into the unmediated intuition of  'the way one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is' as follows:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 5) 1 (uniqueness, symmetry) - relating to an intuition of bare
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'reflexive presence' (i.e. the whole is 'present-to-self', as &quot;I am&quot;).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 6) 2 (asymmetry, differentiation) - relating to orderings of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'motivated self-access' (i.e. an intuition that 'presence' manifests
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in recursive orders of reflexively-intimate self-relativisation.  Note
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that this vitiates and replaces the notions of 'observation' and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'action' and thereby collapses otherwise infinite regresses.  It also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; welds 'causal closure' to an indivisible primitive intuition that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; enfolds - of necessity - both 'perception' and 'intention'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 7) All subsets of being, as it were - including the first-personal -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emerge as a consequence of the 'superset of being' (the '0-personal')
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'getting a grip on itself' (or better: *oneself*).
</em><br />
<br />Nicely said.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 8) Taken together, 5, 06 and 07 collapse into a basic intuition of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence as - always and everywhere - constituted by a 'personal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-actualisation' which is posited to be characteristic of reality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'from the ground up'.
</em><br />
<br />? This belongs to the incommunicable part. If you communicate it, you  
<br />
bet on the existence of someone else, and on something sharable. But  
<br />
then you do science, and in honest science you share only doubts.
<br />
<br />Do you see what I see?
<br />
Do you believe what I believe?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The foregoing treatment attempts to summarise a (well-known: e.g.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Plotinus, Vedanta, etc.) set of intuitions intended to underpin other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; notions of 'existence' in all its forms - i.e. any other postulation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of 'existence' whatsoever is parasitic on the 'master' intuition that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whatever 'exists' must be 'personally present as an actualised
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way-of-being'.  So, in this light, what of the 'existence' of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematics, 'possible' worlds, and other such 'abstractions'?  Well,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they indeed qualify in this sense (trivially) in the form of our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shared 'mental constructions'.  But are they additionally present - in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some other form - *in-their-own-right*?
</em><br />
<br />I prefere the phrasing &quot;is the truth of an arithmetical statement,  
<br />
like &quot;there is no biggest prime number&quot; true (or false) dependent of  
<br />
you?&quot; I don't think it is RITSIAR, although only RITSIAR can really  
<br />
appreciate it here and now.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; One's view on this will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; clearly depend on the way one's theories (implicit or explicit) posit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; how the particular zoo of worlds, universes etc. one favours emerges
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from the ground outlined above.  I would dichotomise such views into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; two camps: necessitist and contingentist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; COMP, I think (but I may be off-beam here: see below) falls into the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; first camp.
</em><br />
<br />OK, at first sight, if I follow you.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  As far as 'reality' goes in COMP, I'm reasonably sure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that what Bruno (conceding that he is almost always way ahead of me on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any of this) implies in the metaphysics (or theology) of COMP, is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'arithmetical reality' should be regarded as 'real' and 'present' in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more or less the sense of 'RITSIAR'.
</em><br />
<br />Eh, eh, no! There is gap! But comp, actually the universal machine,  
<br />
can explain why a gap is necessary between RITSIAR and the number  
<br />
relation.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hence, the 'Platonic existence'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that underpins COMP is RITSIAR.
</em><br />
<br />Hmm... I think RITSIAR could correspond to the third hypostase (of the  
<br />
machine).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; By this I don't mean the 'numbers'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and 'operators' that we denote verbally or in writing - these of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; course are just a 'way of speaking' - a language.  Rather these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; symbols gesture towards an unknowable domain that nonetheless
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possesses these characteristics in some (rigorously definable?) sense.
</em><br />
<br /><br />If we bet on the comp theology. The ability to be reincarnate through  
<br />
a digitalizable machine, then, thanks to theoretical computer science,  
<br />
we get a bit of rigor there. Yes.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And this domain is inescapably 'personal' - it is 'us', and it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everything else, too.
</em><br />
<br />To each machine we can associate the theology of the machine. The set  
<br />
of all true statements on the machine.
<br />
We can associate the science of the machine. The set of all statements  
<br />
provable by the machine on the machine.
<br />
We can associate a notion of knowledge: we say a machine knows p, when  
<br />
the machine proves p, and p is true.
<br />
And other hypostases, including matter.
<br />
The machine can discover the gap between some of those hypostases.
<br />
<br />It is not &quot;us&quot;. It is the views of &quot;us&quot;, the universal Lobian  
<br />
machines, the hopefully correct one.
<br />
<br />Lobian machine can study the correct theology of simple correct  
<br />
machine, and then lift them on themselves, but this need an act of  
<br />
faith, and this one is equivalent with CT+&quot;yes, qua computatio, doctor&quot;.
<br />
<br />&quot;qua computatio&quot; is important. Someone could say yes to the doctor  
<br />
because he thrusts the doctor, and doesn't want to think on  
<br />
&quot;metaphysical&quot; problems.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One astonishing consequence of this schema is that any 'possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world' derivable from such a RITSIAR intuition of mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; infinities must also be 'real' in this sense (though this is not the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; same as experiential coherence: hence the need to invoke filters such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as COMP).
</em><br />
<br />Hmm.. in a sense you may be right. Nature has already bet on comp by  
<br />
inventing or discovering brains, which filter or project. The machine  
<br />
filters reality like COMP filters the set of theories possible. (But  
<br />
any theories does that).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  This directly implies something like MWI, or at least 'many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; minds', and the radical indeterminacy of the first-person (although
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this can also be a consequence, in a 'non-computational' and more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; restricted sense, of 'weak' materialism).
</em><br />
<br />OK. Right. Russell Standish made a similar point, with respect to some  
<br />
part of the movie graph. (a pinch of Occam has to be used).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Whether one considers this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is a defect or an advantage depends on temperament, I believe.  One
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thing I notice about it, however, is that it seems to ground the idea
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of 'what is' firmly on *necessity*.
</em><br />
<br />The necessity is the ultimate sharable part. It is as important as the  
<br />
non sharable part, which includes things (statements) true for every  
<br />
one, yet non sharable or non communicable as such. The sharable (by  
<br />
those who bet on comp) non sharable part.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno has frequently remarked on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the independence of mathematical truths of anyone's believing them,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but I'm not quite sure if he means that one should thereby take this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to transcend all notions of 'contingency'.
</em><br />
<br />Not at all. Why? On the contrary it shows that the physical  
<br />
necessities emerge from a special sum on all the infinitely many  
<br />
contingencies.
<br />
Necessities and possibilities go in pair.
<br />
(there is a Galois connection there)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In other words, does this view hold that the ineluctable, independent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'necessity' of mathematical 'truth' is capable of, as it were, of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *invoking* 'what is' - thereby resolving the Wittgensteinian mystery:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;that the world is&quot;?
</em><br />
<br />With a gap. But with an explanation why there is a gap, and then there  
<br />
is the beautifulness of the geometry of the gap, and of the nature of  
<br />
the gap, ...
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Or does 'what is' merely comprise that which is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'contingently necessary'?
</em><br />
<br />Nooo... It is necessary, but viewed from inside it multiplies, and a  
<br />
part of it becomes necessarily contingent. A bit like when you  
<br />
duplicate yourself in two.
<br />
(but also like when you meet a machine more complex or just older than  
<br />
you).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is, our discovery of its actual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; presence, prior to time and space, necessarily - radically - excludes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; its non-presence, but nonetheless we retain the intuition (perhaps
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; incoherently) that - counter factually - it 'might not have been thus
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; present'?
</em><br />
<br />I will read this sentence ten times before breakfast. Gosh, that's an  
<br />
hard one.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Easy, eh?
</em><br />
<br /><br />I didn't expect this one.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I don't imagine for a moment that the foregoing is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; compelling enough, or sufficiently coherently conceived or expressed,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to persuade anyone who isn't already lurching in that direction.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, having recently been extending my reading and thinking in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this area (yet again!) I feel a renewed interest in continuing the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; debate, should anyone feel motivated, which might advance mutual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understanding just a little (the impetus, I take it, behind this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; list).
</em><br />
<br />Sure, nice post. You still seem to reify a bit the third hypostase,  
<br />
the universal self, the god within. It is an important one, but comp  
<br />
makes it possible to take the ONE as a zero-person being, more like  
<br />
&quot;the truth&quot; (on the machine). Then the other hypostases &quot;emerge&quot; or  
<br />
&quot;emanate&quot; (to use Plotinus' word) from it, with their communicable and  
<br />
incommunicable statements.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It seems to me that maybe consciousness is actually very simple.  It
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is just a group of platonic ideals, like red, that are related to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; other by a point of view:  &quot;I like red&quot;, or &quot;I see a red sphere.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Maybe what is complicated is constructing or identifying a causal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; structure (e.g., a machine, a brain, a program, etc) whose evolving
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; state can be interpreted as representing a series of &quot;connected&quot; or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;related&quot; instances of consciousness.  But the machine (physical or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; otherwise) is NOT that consciousness, the machine just represents  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; consciousness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; In this view, consciousness itself consists directly of the abstract
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; platonic ideals that form the contents of a given moment of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; consciousness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; It remains to explain the relative stability of that illusion. How  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; why some dreams glue, in a way sufficiently precise for making
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; predictions about them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Maybe unstable illusions exist, but, being unstable, don't ponder  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; questions?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Obviously we have such conscious beings here in this world, with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; schizophrenics and the like.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; So your questions about &quot;why are my perceptions so orderly&quot;, would  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; NOT
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; be universally valid questions, because there are conscious entities
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; whose perceptions are NOT orderly.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; And I would say that even my perceptions are not consistently  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; orderly,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; as when I dream I often experience strange scenarios.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; To say that dreaming and hallucinating are special cases I think is  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; make an unfounded assumption.  It would seem to me that orderly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; perceptions are the special case, and dream-logic realities would be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the norm.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; If consciousness is in some way a result of computation, then a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; program that generates all possible mind-simulations will surely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; result in the vast majority of resulting minds experiencing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; dream-logic realities, not &quot;law-and-order&quot; realities like ours.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I think Sean Carroll (who I'm reasonably sure would disagree with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; everything I've proposed above, but still) had a pretty good point on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; such &quot;counter-intuitive&quot; predictions:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;The same logic applies, for example, to the highly contentious case
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of the multiverse. The multiverse isn’t, by itself, a theory; it’s a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; prediction of a certain class of theories. If the idea were simply
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; “Hey, we don’t know what happens outside our observable universe, so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; maybe all sorts of crazy things happen,” it would be laughably
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; uninteresting. By scientific standards, it would fall woefully short.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But the point is that various theoretical attempts to explain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; phenomena that we directly observe right in front of us — like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; gravity, and quantum field theory — lead us to predict that our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; universe should be one of many, and subsequently suggest that we take
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that situation seriously when we talk about the “naturalness” of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; various features of our local environment. The point, at the moment,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is not whether there really is or is not a multiverse; it’s that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; way we think about it and reach conclusions about its plausibility is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; through exactly the same kind of scientific reasoning we’ve been  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; using
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; for a long time now. Science doesn’t pass judgment on phenomena; it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; passes judgment on theories.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; So, I could continue further and go into a lengthy defense of why I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; think this supports what I'm saying, BUT maybe you'll come to the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; conclusion I have and I can save myself a lot of typing!  So, I'll
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; just try that approach first.
