<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Jacques, you silver tongued devil, you.  Don't sugar coat things, tell
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; us how you really feel.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judging by the reaction to my sugar coating - which it WAS -
<br />
maybe that wouldn't be such a good idea.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 	But consider this:  Is the branch in which you win the lottery not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; already occupied?  How will it profit this lottery winner if you, finding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; yourself in another branch, kill yourself?
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;You seem to be using the model where state reduction is a process of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;differentiation of pre-existing universes, rather than the actual forking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of a single universe into multiple daughter universes.  But neither
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;approach is inherently superior to the other.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Even in your model, where all (future) &quot;branches&quot; are already occupied,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;many branches are completely identical prior to differentiation.  It is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reasonable to consider your &quot;identity&quot; or &quot;consciousness&quot; as being common
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to all of these branches.  You are not living in just one of them,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you span all of the identical ones.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess that depends on the definition of 'you'.  It sure doesn't
<br />
seem reasonable that I'm living in a branch where I won the lotto.  I
<br />
don't remember doing that.  Some other guy did that who's almost like me.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 	Your belief that you will magically leap into the body of this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; winner, at the same date and time as you die, is absurd.  You guys take
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; one true fact - that the effective probability of finding yourself to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that winning guy, given that you find the date and time to be such and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; such, and that your name is such and such, etc. - is nearly one.  But you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; don't understand what it means and you sure as hell don't use it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; correctly, and the result is this monstrous quantum cult of death.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; With the concept of identity I described, or the concept of a universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which branches at the time of state function collapse, there is no leap
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; involved.  It is a continuous process.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrong.  It makes no difference if you assume that worlds branch.
<br />
(Off topic note: When did the term 'collapse' start applying to the MWI?
<br />
Last I heard the MWI was the antithesis of that.)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think of it from the point of view of the guy who won the lottery.
<br />
If the other branches commit suicide, can he then say &quot;I wouldn't be here
<br />
otherwise, I'd be in another branch&quot;?  Of course not.  He would still have
<br />
been there and is totally unaffected by what goes on in the other
<br />
branches.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as continuous, don't forget that it is not the selection of
<br />
the lottery numbers that kills you.  It's what happens after that, after
<br />
the branching already occurred a macroscopic time ago.  You know you
<br />
didn't win and that death is coming, but you still think you can leap to
<br />
the other distant branch.  Not very continuous.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; last post I even invited you to &quot;show me why I am stupid&quot;.  But

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only when I decided to write something a little bit personal did
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you decide to respond in a scornful, derisive manner.  Why is that?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I won't respond to the technical issues, &quot;the facts&quot; that you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; listed in your post, because I would just be repeating the stuff
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I wrote in the above two posts.  I still wish you'd respond to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You just answered your own question.  Responding to them would
<br />
just be repeating what I already wrote, including the technical side of
<br />
the last mail.  Only when you wrote something new that hadn't been written
<br />
before did I respond.  Your two technical posts were a rehash of the same
<br />
stupid view I keep pointing out the fallacies of.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's interesting, isn't it, how people can disagree so 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fundamentally sometimes?
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, interesting.  That's one word for it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I'm not stupid, and I don't believe you are either.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks, but I can't return the favor.  I do believe you are
<br />
stupid.  Not in all ways, no doubt, but in important ways.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  I suspect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I will unsubscribe from this newsgroup before long.  I'm a scientist, not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a suicide counselor.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I didn't ask for any counseling.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if your wife dies or leaves you or whatever that could change
<br />
and I might be in a situation where your life or more depends on my
<br />
persuasiveness.  Who needs that?  Or it might not be you, it could be
<br />
anyone who thinks as you do.  It could be worse too than just a suicide.
<br />
It's only a matter of time if this list continues to grow and you guys
<br />
keep thinking like this.
