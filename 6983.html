<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;many people.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;Very few supporters of the AP would &quot;expect to find a SAS&quot; in a bitstring.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;Until you *specify* a way of interpreting the string, it contains nothing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;but bits.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;The observer specifies the interpretation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But the observer is *generated* by the interpretation! Until you have an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interpretation, you have no observers. And until you have an observer, you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have no interpretation (at least that's how I read the sentence quoted 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; above).
</em><br />
<br />No the observer is somehow primary. As are the descriptions. If it
<br />
weren't for the anthropic principle, there would be no connection
<br />
between the two, and we'd have a genuine &quot;brain-in-the-vat&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; How can structures which exist as some sort of pattern inside a bit string 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (or am I supposed to say in the &quot;meaning&quot; integer output by some (other) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; O(x)?) read a separate bitstring which exists as a parallel universe in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Platonia?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />That is what they do, by definition. Observers observe. Platonia is a
<br />
collection of all possible observations, hence what observers observe
<br />
is in Platonia.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So you find it a mystery that you have a face, eye etc??  If so, what does 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the AP have to do with this mystery? Actually, maybe it would clarify 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things if you said what you mean by the AP; it certainly doesn't seem to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be very like the AP that I know about.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />The AP is a statement that observed reality must be consistent with
<br />
the observer being part of that reality.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm not sure whether your &quot;my reality&quot; refers to the external world or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your internal representation of it. I guess the latter, otherwise your 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; body would be you, not a token representing you.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />I'm not entirely sure I distinguish your difference between &quot;external
<br />
world&quot; and &quot;internal representation&quot;. We're talking about observations
<br />
here, not models.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;In particular, any bitstring can be &quot;interpreted&quot; as any other bitstring
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;by an appropriate map. Hence until you specify an interpreter you are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;simply not proposing a theory at all.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;The observer _is_ the interpreter. There may well be more than one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;observer in the picture, but they'd better agree!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why does this follow? Your &quot;observers&quot; are maps O(x) from prefix strings 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the integers. Why can't you have two inconsistent maps... or rather, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; how can you possibly avoid such?  And since two different maps don't 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interact at all (how can a mapping interact with another mapping?) each of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your observers seems to be sealed in his own little universe. In which 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; case having &gt;1 observer appears to be an unverifiable speculation, which 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is why I say it seems like solipsism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />It follows from the Anthropic Principle. If O_1 is consistent with its
<br />
observed reality, and O_2 is consistent with its observed reality,
<br />
and O_1 observes O_2 in its reality, then O_1 and O_2 must be
<br />
consistent with each other (at least with respect to their observed realities).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;Most readers of your paper would take it that you are making a strong
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;ontological proposition, i.e. that the basis of reality is your set of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;bitstrings.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;This is the case.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, if you are making an ontological proposition, you are ipso facto not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just explaining appearances. In your model your &quot;bitstrings&quot; *are* the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; noumenon (in Kant's terminology). 
</em><br />
<br />Sorry, I don't see this. The bitstrings are phenomena. No noumenon
<br />
appears. It is possible we are arguing semantic differences only though.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;In this case &quot;where they live&quot; is crucial because it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;defines the environment the SAS find themselves in.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Why?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; An intelligent system is &quot;intelligent&quot; by virtue of the way it interacts 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with its environment. Think about the Turing test again: we conclude that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the computer is (not) intelligent because of the way it interacts with us. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To put it another way, you define these things as &quot;observers&quot;. This 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implies something observed. Obviously your model had better account for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; people (observers) like us observing something like the world we see 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (&quot;where we live&quot;), and preferably interacting with other people who are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; granted equal status your ontology.
</em><br />
<br />Does it not? OK, it is not exactly explicit about it, but this
<br />
situation should appear somewhere in Platonia.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;It is not solipsism, if only for the reason that multiple observers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;exist in our observed reality. They are all as real as our own 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;consciousness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Bruno Marchal calls this &quot;shared dreaming&quot;. It seems apt.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If that's the *only* reason it's not solipsism, then I would say you just 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't have the courage of your convictions. Bruno's &quot;shared dreaming&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sounds very like Leibniz's pre-established harmony, but that only works if 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you believe in a provident deity (if it ever worked for anyone but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Leibniz!).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />I'm not especially interested in Lebniz's thoughts on this
<br />
subject. But if it involves a provident deity, it sounds nothing like
<br />
either my theory or Bruno's.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The acid test is this: Can your observers exchange information with each 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other, and if so what is the data channel?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />Yes. You will observe in your description other observers making
<br />
&quot;marks&quot; on the universe. This is a communication channel. There are
<br />
some subtleties to do with free will and so on, but this is
<br />
definitely stepping outside the remit of &quot;Why Occam's paper&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;Or are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;your &quot;observers&quot; the missing &quot;interpreters&quot; in your theory which give it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;meaning, and allow us to find (in principle) the SAS within the bitstrings
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;that represent actual observers like us?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Yes. I wasn't aware of them being missing though. Where did you find
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;them? :)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I hope this is a bit clearer now. My problem is that you are trying to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; make your observers work at two different levels: as structures within the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universes generated (somehow!) by your bitstrings, but also as an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interpretive principle for producing meaning by operating *on* the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bitstrings.  It's a bit like claiming that PCs are built by &quot;The Sims&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />Yes it is a bit like that. Obviously, the Anthropic Principle (or its
<br />
equivalent) does not work with &quot;The Sims&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Incidentally, a TM by itself can't generate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;meaning, as it is only a map from integers to integers. You still have to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;specify externally how to interpret the code as something more than a mere
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;number. (E.g. in the Turing test the output bits have to be processed into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;English language text).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;The use of TM was to connect with computationalists. Computationalists
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;would say that all observers could be represented by a TM, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;observers do attach meaning to bitstrings. The meanings themselves can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;be enumerated, ie embedded in N.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm actually very sceptical of this claim.  Obviously you can encode a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaning in a number, but the meaning is then carried at least partly by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the code, and not just by the number.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />Of course, but that is of no importance. For the purposes of the
<br />
argument, all one does is perform an arbitrary enumeration of meanings
<br />
(which of course implies that this should be possible). The numbers do
<br />
not carry any meanings at all.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;And the theory works even if the observers were not TMs, but simply
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;some prefix map from the space of descriptions to the space of meanings.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;All you give up is the compiler theorem, or some universal complexity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;measure. Grounding complexity with respect to the observer suffices.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is there a mathematical theory of meanings that could make the notion of a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;space of meanings&quot; well-defined? Last I heard, philosophers were still 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arguing about what &quot;meaning&quot; means!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />By saying that meanings are enumerable sidesteps all these
<br />
difficulties. I have no problem with enumerable meanings, in fact I
<br />
think it is self-evident - but maybe not.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;Not to mention the terms &quot;observer&quot; and &quot;superposition&quot;. In QM, which is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;the natural context, superposition implies that it is possible sometimes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;to observe (and predict) interference effects. I don't see how this can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;happen in your sense, since there is no interaction between descriptions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;I disagree. Superposition simply means that something is true and not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;true simultaneously, it is indeterminate.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In your private language, maybe. I shudder to think what bizarre ideas it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would put in the heads of my students if I used this definition!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />Presumably when discussing this with your students, you are in the
<br />
context of quantum systems. In that context, superposition has the
<br />
usual linear sum of state vectors.
<br />
<br />According to Oxford dictionary, &quot;superposition&quot; means multiple things
<br />
occupying the same place. This is obviously a far more general usage
<br />
than the QM meaning. And last time I looked, English was not a private
<br />
language. 
<br />
<br />In the context of descriptions, a set of descriptions is a
<br />
superposition of descriptions. Where the descriptions disagree with
<br />
one another, the situation is indeterminate. Where they agree, that is
<br />
the information encoded by that set. If you want a mental image, use
<br />
Borges's library of Babel. Each book is a description. A set of books
<br />
has less information than each individual book due to inconsistencies
<br />
between them.
<br />
