<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It does seem that the SSA pretty much implies that if U(E1') &gt; U(E2) then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; U({E1,E1'}) &gt; U({E1,E2}).  Is it really rational for this to be otherwise?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, I believe it can be. If you believe otherwise you have to convince me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; why it's impossible to value diversity of experience in your copies, or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; why having that value would lead to absurd consequences. 
</em><br />
<br />Let me start with this.  If U(E1) &gt; U(E2), then would a rational person
<br />
have to pick E1 over E2?  What if he were someone who were contrary?
<br />
Or someone who preferred lesser utility?  I think we can rule these
<br />
cases out by properly defining utility.  With the proper definition it
<br />
will always be the case that if U(E1) &gt; U(E2), he picks E1.
<br />
<br />Now consider a single-universe model.  He can choose one of two
<br />
alternatives.  In one alternative he is guaranteed to get E1, and in the
<br />
other alternative he has a 50-50 chance of getting E1 or E2.  Is there
<br />
a rational way to prefer the second alternative?  That is, can it be
<br />
better to have a chance of getting E2 rather than the certainty of E1?
<br />
I would like to rule this out for rational choosers, but I'm not 100%
<br />
sure.  Some people seek risk, although a risk which has only a down side
<br />
still seems irrational.
<br />
<br />Suppose we could be confident that choosing a certainty of E1 was always
<br />
better than a 50-50 chance of E1 or E2.  Translating into a MWI model
<br />
we have something closer to the scenario Wei originally presented: a
<br />
choice between a state where the universe splits (or duplicates) and two
<br />
copies both get E1, and a state where one copy gets E1 and one gets E2.
<br />
The question is whether it would be rational to have different preferences
<br />
in the multiverse case than in the single-universe case.
<br />
<br />There is an argument that there should be no differences, because the
<br />
information available in any sub-part of the multiverse is the same as in
<br />
the single universe case.  In fact maybe we can never tell which theory
<br />
is correct, therefore the differences are entirely hypothetical.  If
<br />
we accept this then what is irrational in the single universe case is
<br />
also irrational in the MWI.
<br />
<br />The final scenario is to go from a multiverse setting to a case of actual
<br />
duplication as Wei presents.  Instead of universes splitting, we have
<br />
people being duplicated.  But whether the rest of the universe splits
<br />
or not should probably not affect our decision about which experiences
<br />
are best.  So we should still get the same answer, and preferring E1+E2
<br />
is therefore irrational.
<br />
<br />Granted this argument has a lot of steps and not all of them have
<br />
been fleshed out very well here.  The common element is that the
<br />
E1/E2 experiences are mutually exclusive.  In the first case they
<br />
are literally exclusive; in the second case they are in separate,
<br />
completely independent universes; and in Wei's original scenario they
<br />
are in separate and independent copies.  It seems that in all cases
<br />
where we have completely independent and exclusive outcomes that utility
<br />
should be strictly additive.  If there can be no interactions between the
<br />
experiences of E1 and E2, they might as well be in separate universes,
<br />
or they might as well be logically exclusive alternatives.  Therefore
<br />
they can only add.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; We all know the law of diminishing marginal utility, which says that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; marginal utility of a good decreases as more of that good is consumed, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the existence of substitution effects, where the marginal utility of one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; good decreases when another similar good is consumed. I suggest there is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no reason to assume that the value of experiences of one's copies cannot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exhibit similar cross-dependencies. Actually I think the reason that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we have diminishing marginal utility and substitution effects, namely that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they provide an evolutionary advantage, also applies to the value of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiences of copies.
</em><br />
<br />I don't think diminishing utility applies when the experiences are with
<br />
mutually exclusive alternatives.  The 20th apple is worth less to me
<br />
than the first because I'm sick of apples by the time I get to the 20th.
<br />
But in 20 different universes, if apples are my favorite fruit, I do best
<br />
to eat apples in every one.  That maximizes my total sensory enjoyment
<br />
and nutritional gain, which is what gives apples the highest utility.
<br />
<br />Maybe you could expand on your argument about how diminishing utility
<br />
relates to evolutionary advantage across copies; I'm not sure what you
<br />
are getting at there.  I see the reason higher quantities have less
<br />
marginal value to you as because of how they interact with each other
<br />
and with you; putting them all into separate universes would eliminate
<br />
the effects which I see as causing diminishing marginal value.
