<br />*Over-view of 'The Sentient Centered Theory of Metaphysics' (SCTOM)* By Marc 
<br />
Geddes This version: 13th September, 2005 
<br />
<br />*Metaphysics: Mathematico-Cognition* 
<br />
<br />SCTOM is a rational framework which attempts to provide a truly integrated 
<br />
conception of reality. By 'integrated' it is meant a conception of reality 
<br />
that explains how the most fundamental properties of existence facts fit 
<br />
together into a unified metaphysical framework. SCTOM is not reductionistic. 
<br />
A true explanatory framework must explain how high level properties of 
<br />
reality such as values fit into the picture. SCTOM is intended to provide a 
<br />
logical scaffolding upon which all future scientific and philosophical 
<br />
theories can be developed and integrated. 
<br />
<br />The proposed noumena ('raw stuff', foundation) of reality is called 
<br />
Mathematico-Cognition. The metaphysical position proposed is a hybrid of two 
<br />
known positions - Mathematical Platonism - the idea that mathematics is the 
<br />
objectively real fabric of reality, and Objective Idealism - the idea that 
<br />
cognition is the objectively real fabric of reality. 
<br />
<br />The core assumption is that existence without perception is meaningless. 
<br />
Reality requires not only raw data but something to *interpret* that data, 
<br />
to supply meaning to it. This can only be done by consciousness of *some* 
<br />
kind. If something was hypothesized to exist that could in no way directly 
<br />
or indirectly affect the conscious perceptions of *any* possible observer, 
<br />
then in what sense could it be said to exist at all? Even if it could be 
<br />
successfully argued that it did have some kind of abstract philosophical 
<br />
existence, it could never have any possible value to sentient minds. For the 
<br />
purposes of understanding general intelligence, it suffices to define that 
<br />
which exists as that which could directly or indirectly ( i.e. in principle) 
<br />
affect the perceptions of *some* possible conscious observer. 
<br />
<br />We propose that *cognition* (in the very general sense defined above) should 
<br />
be taken as the bedrock or fundamental building-blocks of reality. The heart 
<br />
of SCTOM is the assumption that a truly integrated understanding of reality 
<br />
requires that *all* aspects of reality be defined in terms of cognition of 
<br />
some kind. We assume panpsychism, the view that there is some degree of 
<br />
conscious awareness in everything. 
<br />
<br />The approach adopted however, is not mysticism or one of the subjectivist 
<br />
views of reality that propose that aspects of reality are mind created. 
<br />
Instead, a very robust realism is assumed. Properties of reality exist 
<br />
largely independently of what any particular observer thinks about them and 
<br />
are not mind created. Properties of reality are not defined by the mind of 
<br />
any one particular observer. That idea quickly leads to solipsism, the idea 
<br />
that reality can only be ascribed to one's own conscious perception. What is 
<br />
being suggested here is that reality be defined by the minds of *all 
<br />
logically possible* observers. Nor does this mean that reality is somehow 
<br />
'socially constructed' - or created by some sort of consensus view emerging 
<br />
from the beliefs of every one in a society. Objective Idealism proposes that 
<br />
properties of reality are *correlated with* or *emergent from* from general 
<br />
properties of conscious perception, not that they are *created* by specific 
<br />
beliefs. Reality is not mind created. But it is not greater than mind 
<br />
either. 
<br />
<br />*Metaphysics - The 'Complexity' of reality is finite* 
<br />
<br />In order for SCTOM to be a truly general theory, it has to be all 
<br />
encompassing. It must be universal in scope. And it must be comprehensible 
<br />
to sentient minds. But this assumes that some unitary finite logical 
<br />
framework is capable of being applied everywhere that a sentient mind could 
<br />
logically exist. This in turn requires the curious idea that the complexity 
<br />
of reality be finite in *some* sense (perhaps in a sense which has not yet 
<br />
been defined). 
<br />
<br />*Metaphysics: Core SCTOM assumptions* 
<br />
<br />The two initial working assumptions of SCTOM then are: 
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Mathematico-Cognition - The essence of reality is a hybrid of 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mathematics and cognition 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The complexity of reality is in some sense finite 
<br />
<br />The evidence for these assumptions will come in part from the internal 
<br />
consistency of SCTOM itself. If SCTOM seems to be providing an elegant 
<br />
explanatory framework for many different areas of knowledge, this is some 
<br />
evidence that its correct ideas are correct. 
<br />
<br />*Metaphysics : Quantum Computation and Classical Computation* 
<br />
<br />The most general form of computation is not the classical conception of 
<br />
universal computation as developed by Turing, but the quantum conception. 
<br />
Physicist David Deutsch was the first to begin exploring quantum computation 
<br />
in depth. Since reality is at root quantum mechanical and SCTOM is supposed 
<br />
to be a truly general metaphysical framework, SCTOM must produce an 
<br />
integrated explanation of quantum phenomena. 
<br />
<br />*Metaphysics: The Multiverse* 
<br />
<br />SCTOM should provide an explanatory framework for the space of all possible 
<br />
worlds in which sentient minds could exist, if it is to be successful in 
<br />
abstracting out the most general features of mind. 
<br />
<br />A natural framework for thinking these issues is the Multiverse Theory, the 
<br />
idea that everything that can logically exist, does exist somewhere. The 
<br />
most modern incarnation of the idea has been developed by physicist Max 
<br />
Tegmark. SCTOM assumes that there are no supernatural forces at work in 
<br />
reality - that all finite parts of reality are in principle comprehensible 
<br />
to *some* mind. This follows from the objective idealism postulate - reality 
<br />
and cognition are equivalent. Combined with the postulate of objectivity, 
<br />
this means that ultimate reality is completely rational in nature. 
<br />
<br />*Metaphysics - Mathematico-Cognition as binary and coding* 
<br />
<br />The language of science is mathematics. SCTOM assumes that both the 
<br />
*language* (means of describing objective reality) and an aspect of the 
<br />
*fabric of reality itself* (objects being described) are mathematical in 
<br />
nature. The metaphysical position taken is thus a form of mathematical 
<br />
Platonism - mathematics is an aspect of the fabric of reality. Specifically, 
<br />
mathematics is proposed as the *structure* of reality. 
<br />
<br />It is assumed that all of reality ultimately boils down to a 
<br />
proto-mathematics: binary. Binary is composed two discrete states, 0 and 1. 
<br />
This could be the fundamental unit of Mathematico-Cognition. A bit of 
<br />
information is both mathematical and cognitive. But 0's and 1's are not 
<br />
enough. It is the *coding system* (or cognitive interpretation) that is 
<br />
assigned to the 0's and 1's that gives 'form' to reality. 
<br />
<br />*Metaphysics - Mathematics and the 7 Universal Knowledge Domains* 
<br />
<br />The old idea of mathematical Platonism will here be given a radical new 
<br />
twist which is the key to SCTOM. The idea is that reality is *almost* fully 
<br />
consistent, but not quite. It is conjectured that there are minuscule 
<br />
contradictions, which allow the possibility of more than one fully precise 
<br />
mathematical description of reality. A 'fully precise' description of 
<br />
reality is one which must be (a) Universal in scope and (b) Completely 
<br />
accurate. It is conjectured that there are in fact 7 different valid 
<br />
mathematical formulations of reality. 
<br />
<br />Each of these 7 different view-points are universal and complete. Further 
<br />
all of them are nearly (but not quite) logically equivalent. The body of 
<br />
mathematical knowledge pertinent to each view-point shall be called a 
<br />
'Universal Knowledge Domain' (UKD). The idea is that there are at root 7 
<br />
different valid ways of understanding reality, each of which is none the 
<br />
less 'universal' in scope. This idea takes some getting used to. It is 
<br />
important to understand that it is *not* being suggested that there are 7 
<br />
different realities. There is only one reality and the 7 universal knowledge 
<br />
domains should be thought of as different manifestations of it. Mathematics 
<br />
is the real fabric reality and the 7 universal knowledge domains represent 7 
<br />
different view-points - or cognitive 'interpretations' of this reality. 
<br />
<br />Recall that the ultimate nature of reality was postulated to be 
<br />
Mathematico-Cognition, which consisted of two components - raw data - binary 
<br />
- and an *interpretation* of that data. So the 7 different knowledge domains 
<br />
arise from the fact that there are 7 different complete ' coding systems' 
<br />
for assigning meaning to the strings of 0's and 1's. The observed reality 
<br />
will be a two-way interaction between raw binary and the coding system 
<br />
selected. 
<br />
<br />If there are 7 domains of mathematical knowledge which universal in scope, 
<br />
then these 7 domains will form a core of cognition which will be common to 
<br />
all sentients. The idea of mathematical Platonism implies that Mathematics 
<br />
is both the fabric of reality (objects being reasoned about) and the means 
<br />
through reality is apprehended. Here are the proposed 7 UKD's, each labeled 
<br />
with a letter beginning with 'M' so that they will be easily remembered. 
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Mentality - Concerned with qualia (raw experiences) and situations 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(relations between self and world) 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Meaning - Concerned with interactions and roles 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Morality - Concerned with agency, choice and memes. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Mind - Concerned with the projection and actualization of 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;possibility 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Models - Concerned with processes and systems. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Motion - Concerned with movement through space 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Measure - Concerned with physical objects and geometrical relations 
<br />
<br />Each universal knowledge domain will use a different kind of mathematics. 
<br />
The theory thus also suggests a natural way to classify the branches of 
<br />
mathematics. The table below lists the type of math best suited for use with 
<br />
each universal knowledge domain. The supposition is that each branch of 
<br />
mathematics named is truly universal in scope i.e. capable of fully 
<br />
describing any finite part of reality. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Mathematics*  *Mind* Foundations  *Morality* Decision Theory 
<br />
*Models* Analysis,
<br />
Calculus  *Meaning* Game theory  *Mentality* Propositional  *Motion* Operator 
<br />
Theory  *Measure* Geometry, Topology 
<br />
<br />*Epistemology - The mapping between the 7 UKD's* 
<br />
<br />What is the precise nature of the relationship between the 7 different 
<br />
UKD's? Since reality is a unified whole, the 7 modes of perception must be 
<br />
(almost) consistent, so they must in some sense be different representations 
<br />
of the same reality. So the question is how the different representations 
<br />
map to each other. 
<br />
<br />Note that 3 of the domains (Measure,Motion, Models) are concerned with 
<br />
logical/physical concepts. And 3 of the domains (Mentality, Meaning, 
<br />
Morality) are concerned with experiential concepts. The 'Mind' domain is the 
<br />
odd one out. The proposal here is that Mind is the bridge between 
<br />
logical/physical concepts and experiential concepts. 
<br />
<br />The proposal for the mapping between the 7 domains is that a representation 
<br />
of something in a higher level domain is composed of a mapping between 
<br />
representations in 2 related lower level domains. The proposed mappings are: 
<br />
<br /><br />Model = Mapping (Measure&gt; Motion) 
<br />
<br />This says that to describe something as a *Model* (a 'computational system') 
<br />
one needs to map geometrical relations to spatial operators 
<br />
<br />Morality = Mapping (Mentality &gt; Meaning) 
<br />
<br />This says that to give a description of something in terms of *Morality* one 
<br />
needs to map descriptions in terms of 'Mentality' with the description in 
<br />
terms of 'Meaning' (handled by game theory ). 
<br />
<br />Note that after these mappings, the results are two higher level modes of 
<br />
description (Model, Morality) which in some sense bring the experiential and 
<br />
the external closer together. The third and final proposed mapping will 
<br />
fully reconcile the experiential and the objective. 
<br />
<br />Mind = Mapping (Model &gt; Morality) 
<br />
<br />This says that the 'Mind' level of description is obtained by mapping a 
<br />
description of something as a computational system (handled by the math of 
<br />
analysis and calculus) with a description of something in terms of 
<br />
'Morality' or memes. (handled by the math of decision theory). 
<br />
<br />*Epistemology - Cognition equals reality* 
<br />
<br />SCTOM assumes that reality itself cannot be separated from the process of 
<br />
perceiving and understanding it. What observations imply about reality 
<br />
depends on a procedural context - the nature of the methods, rules and 
<br />
procedures used by a sentient observer to obtain the information. This is a 
<br />
philosophical position known as proceduralism. Sometimes the very means 
<br />
through which a given sentient observes the world (or even the mere fact 
<br />
that the sentient exists!) will bias or constrain what the sentient will 
<br />
observe. This is known as the observer-selection effect. 
<br />
<br />Since SCTOM assumes *cognition* as a fundmental aspect of reality, we need 
<br />
to try to identify the most general properties associated with cognition in 
<br />
order to be able to develop a general epistemology. We propose a dual-aspect 
<br />
nature to cognition: Recognition and Classification. Recognition is 
<br />
awareness of a relationship between several pieces of information (a 
<br />
pattern) that enables a sentient to simplify or *compress* how the 
<br />
information is represented. Classification is a unique ordering between 
<br />
patterns (formation and manipulation of concepts). 
<br />
<br />*Epistemology - The 4 core mental operations* 
<br />
<br />It is proposed that general intelligence requires 4 core kinds of 
<br />
operations. Thus 4 more universal categories of cognition are being 
<br />
proposed. 2 are concerned with the 'Recognition' aspect of cognition , the 
<br />
other 2 are concerned with the 'Classification' aspect. 
<br />
<br />Representation - A modality. A form of perception. The raw 'stuff' of 
<br />
consciousness. We propose that consciousness cannot exist apart from 
<br />
perception and all consciousness must be consciousness about something 
<br />
(perception). Perceptions do not have to be perceptions about physical 
<br />
objects. They can be highly abstract in nature. 
<br />
<br />Induction - Pattern recognition and data compression in some knowledge 
<br />
domain. Generalization and associative classification from some data set. 
<br />
Includes fuzzy logic. 
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Passive Cognition : These 2 general operations taken together can be 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;classified as 'Passive Cognition' for a given knowledge domain. The 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;probabilistic framework could be handled by Bayesian probability theory and 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fuzzy set theory. 
<br />
<br />Deduction - Formation and combination of concepts. For the purposes of true 
<br />
deduction, a 'concept' is a pattern that can be *uniquely* classified in 
<br />
some particular sense. Patterns which cannot be uniquely classified are 
<br />
pseudo-concepts handled by Induction and fuzzy logic. 
<br />
<br />Action plans - Linear ordering of actions for manipulating the world, either 
<br />
physical or abstract. 
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Active Cognition : These 2 operations taken together can be 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;classified as active cognition for some knowledge domain. The framework 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;could be handled by formal logic and classical set theory. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;*Epistemology - The 56 universal categories of cognition* 
<br />
<br />The 7 universal knowledge domains form one axis of cognition. The proposed 
<br />
noumena of reality was Mathematico-Cognition, which the 7 domains represent 
<br />
different manifestations of. Each of these 7 domains can be sub-divided into 
<br />
two - one the mathematical aspect , the other the cognitive aspect. The 4 
<br />
universal mental operations form another axis. Combining the two axes one 
<br />
obtains a model of general intelligence composed of 7*2*4 = 56 categories of 
<br />
universal cognition. The result is a 'Periodic Table Of Cognition'. 
<br />
<br />*Ethics and Esthetics* 
<br />
<br />It is proposed that there is a universal value system - a set of general 
<br />
values that is objectivity 'good' for all sentient minds that can logically 
<br />
exist. In keeping with the spirit of the dual-aspect theory of perception 
<br />
and the theory of universal knowledge domains, it is proposed that there are 
<br />
two core universal values associated with each knowledge domain - one 
<br />
'passive' (loosely concerned with 'harmonization') , the other 'active' 
<br />
(loosely concerned with 'expansion'). The interaction of the two 
<br />
complementary sets of values manifests itself as a third general (combined) 
<br />
value. The table below lists the 4 UKD's associated with mental aspects and 
<br />
the proposed positive utilities (values) for each. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;*Active Utility* *Passive Utility* *Combined Utility*  *Mind*
<br />
Creation Discovery
<br />
Actualization  *Morality* Growth Altruism Liberty  *Meaning*
<br />
Productivity Harmony
<br />
Purpose  *Mentality* Happiness Health Eudaimonia 
<br />
<br />*Ethics and Esthetics: The ultimate purpose of Mind* 
<br />
<br />Reading off the top level set of values (the 'Mind' domain) suggests 
<br />
'Actualization' as the ultimate meaning of existence. Actualization is 
<br />
composed of the values 'Creation' and 'Discovery', the process of a mind 
<br />
seeking to better understand itself and express its nature in the world. 
<br />
<br />'Mind' was defined as that which projects and actualizes possibility. And 
<br />
the UKD 'Mind' is supposed to be universal in scope. An intriguing 
<br />
supposition is that 'Mind' and the flow of time itself should be equated. If 
<br />
time is the structure of the universe, then so is mind. It can be 
<br />
conjectured that mind is the 'glue' holding the universe together - the 
<br />
thing ensuring it's continued existence. An equivalent metaphor is that mind 
<br />
'knits moments of time' together. Perhaps without mind causes would not be 
<br />
associated with effects enough for the concept of 'Time' to be meaningful? 
<br />
If these ideas are along the right lines, the ultimate purpose of mind might 
<br />
be to enable the universe to last forever. 
<br />
<br />This idea could be tied into the idea of the 7 UKD's as arising from tiny 
<br />
inconsistencies in the warp and weave of reality. The mappings between the 7 
<br />
UKD's have 'Mind' as the end result. If Mind should be equated with the flow 
<br />
of time then the arrow of time could be a manifestation of a gradual 
<br />
reduction in the residual inconsistencies within reality. Speaking 
<br />
metaphorically, the cosmos could be said to be 'trying to eliminate the 
<br />
contradictions' and the flow of time would then arise from an ever better 
<br />
integration of the 7 UKD's. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--
<br />
&nbsp;The following schematic proposes 56 universal data types for sentient 
<br />
minds. It is proposed that 7 universal knowledge domains (Measure, Motion, 
<br />
Mentality, Meaning, Models, Morality and Mind) and 4 universal mental 
<br />
operations (Action plans, Deductions, Inductions and Representations) are 
<br />
sufficient for a true general intelligence (one capable of universal 
<br />
reasoning, or reasoning in all domains in which a sentient mind could 
<br />
logically exist). Each of the 7 domains can be further sub-devided into 
<br />
mathematical knowledge and cognitive knowledge. Only the cognitive kinds of 
<br />
knowledge are given here. Brief definitions of these cognitive terms are 
<br />
given below.

<br />
<br />The core idea is that the raw noumena of reality is something called *
<br />
Mathematico-Cognition* The 7 knowledge domains should be thought of as the 
<br />
different fundamental manifestations of this Mathematico-Cognition.

<br />
<br />*Definitions: Proposed Universal Mental Operations* 
<br />
<br />The x-axis (horizontal axis) lists the proposed 4 universal mental 
<br />
operations. The first two (Action plans, Deductions) loosely equate to 
<br />
active consciousness (which in humans mostly refers to operations in the 
<br />
frontal lobes). The last two (Inductions, Representations) loosely equate to 
<br />
passive consciousness (which in humans often refers to operations in the 
<br />
posterior parts of the brain). Bear in though, that the proposal here is for 
<br />
an ideal architecture, not the architecture of the human brain. 
<br />
<br />*Action plans*: Linearly ordered concepts combined according to accepted 
<br />
rules providing plans of action for the sentient to manipulate the world in 
<br />
some knowledge domains. In humans often carried by out the ACTION networks 
<br />
in the frontal lobes. 
<br />
<br />*Deductions*: Formation and combination of concepts in some knowledge 
<br />
domain. Here a 'concept' is defined to be a chucked mental unit that can be 
<br />
*uniquely* classified in some knowledge domain (so by this definition a 
<br />
'fish' is not a concept because it's a folk term which can't be uniquely 
<br />
classified under a scientific Taxonomy of evolutiuonary biology). 
<br />
<br />*Inductions*: Pattern recognition. Data compression arising from chunking. 
<br />
Here 'Induction' is being used in the most general sense to simply mean 
<br />
probabilistic generalizations from data in some domain. 
<br />
<br />*Representations*: Data structures for various modalities. Perceptions. 
<br />
<br />------------------------------
<br />
<br />*Definitions: Proposed Universal Knowledge domains* 
<br />
<br />The y-axis (vertical axis) lists the proposed 7 universal knowledge domains. 
<br />
It is proposed that there are 7 knowledge domains which are 'Universal' 
<br />
(applicable everywhere in reality where sentient minds can exist). These 7 
<br />
knowledge domains are supposed to 'over-lap' or supervene on each other. It 
<br />
is suggested that all other knowledge domains are sub-domains which could be 
<br />
classified under one of the 7 core domains. The suggestion is that the 7 
<br />
proposed universal knowledge domains are exhaustive. i.e sufficient to fully 
<br />
encompass all parts of reality in which sentient minds could exist. 
<br />
<br />*Mind* Involving the projection and actualization of possibility 
<br />
<br />*Morality* Involving agency and choice 
<br />
<br />*Models* Involving Systems and Computation 
<br />
<br />*Meaning* Involving interactions and roles that agents play 
<br />
<br />*Mentality* Involving qualia and situations - representations of the 
<br />
relation between self and world 
<br />
<br />*Motion* Involving movements through space 
<br />
<br />*Measure* Involving spatial relationships 
<br />
<br />Remember the 7 M's - Mind, Morality, Models, Meaning, Mentality, Motion and 
<br />
Measure! 
<br />
<br />------------------------------
<br />
<br />*Definitions: Proposed Universal data types* 
<br />
<br />Representations: 
<br />
<br />*Gestalt* Modal representation of a geometrical property 
<br />
<br />*Movement* Modal representation of a movement through space 
<br />
<br />*Happening* Modal representation of a raw happening in the world 
<br />
<br />*Interaction* Modal representation of the effect of an action taken by an 
<br />
agent on the world (espeically other agents) 
<br />
<br />*Computation* Modal representaton of the functional properties of a system 
<br />
<br />*Agent* Modal representation of an agency 
<br />
<br />*Episode* Modal representation of a generic event 
<br />
<br />Inductions: 
<br />
<br />*Pattern* Recognition of a pattern in a physical modality 
<br />
<br />*Force* Recognition of a general form of motion 
<br />
<br />*Activity* Recognition of a coherent short-term action task 
<br />
<br />*Relationship* Recognition of a coherent interaction between a sentient and 
<br />
something in the world (espeically another sentient) 
<br />
<br />*Process* Recognition of a goal-oriented change in state of a system 
<br />
<br />*Lifestyle* Recognition of a way of life for a sentient in moral terms 
<br />
<br />*Projection* Recognition of a possible 'outcome' in terms of it's utility (
<br />
i.e predicted outcome) 
<br />
<br />Deductions: 
<br />
<br />*Object* Concept formation and combination of physical units 
<br />
<br />*Translation* Concept formation and combination of translations (spatial 
<br />
transforms) 
<br />
<br />*Situation* Concept formation and combination of 'activity units' as regards 
<br />
effect of the world on a sentient (a 'situation') 
<br />
<br />*Role* Concept formation and combination of 'social units' as regards the 
<br />
effect of the sentient on the world (a 'role') 
<br />
<br />*System* Concept formation and combination of computational units as regards 
<br />
function (a 'system') 
<br />
<br />*Meme* Concept formation and combination of 'cultural units'. Being used 
<br />
here in a more specific sense than the common definition of the term. Here 
<br />
it means a unit referring to the coherent lifestyle preference of a sentient 
<br />
as regards the sentients effects on others. 
<br />
<br />*Utility* Concept formation and combination of 'event units'. Again, is here 
<br />
being defined in a more specific sense than it's general usage. Here it 
<br />
means projected outcomes of generic events classified according to their 
<br />
general value to sentients). 
<br />
<br />Action plans: 
<br />
<br />*Schema* A series of classification heuristics to help recognize objects 
<br />
<br />*Schemata* A series of short-term physical actions to manipulate physical 
<br />
objects 
<br />
<br />*Script *A series of general physical/logical actions taken by a sentient in 
<br />
a general situation 
<br />
<br />*Strategy* A series of social strategy used in a situation to help a 
<br />
sentient carry out its chosen role 
<br />
<br />*Procedure* A series of functional steps used to manipulate a system 
<br />
<br />*Plan* A series of social steps used by a sentient to carry out memes 
<br />
<br />*Goals* A series of of abstract plans by a sentient to achieve projected 
<br />
outcomes.

With ease, and you beside.
