<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Jesse has it right on here, and one can go even further in this vein.  You 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are impressed by the relationship between one particular story and one 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;particular event - but you hand-picked both the story and the event for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;discussion here because of their superficial similarities.  You challenged 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;me to find another example of a story with the same resemblances that the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Heinlein story has to the atomic bomb project.  But resemblances between 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;any written story and any similar event that happens after the story's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;publication would be in the same class.
</em><br />
<br />I'm not saying that Heinlein was plugged into anything particular.  As a 
<br />
sociologist, my interest is the inability of some branches of science to 
<br />
address many common-sense events.  Any scientist worth his degree can 
<br />
conjure up logic in order to drop a complicated issue and move on to 
<br />
something else:  improperly framed question, no prior data, no model, post 
<br />
hoc cherry-picking, etc and etc.  I once had a phone chat with Ray Hyams 
<br />
about this---his response was telling---basically skeptics don't 
<br />
investigate---they debunk.  That isn't the scientific method; that's a 
<br />
belief system.   That, and economical considerations, of course, is why it 
<br />
took 10 years before medicine figured out the importance of helicobacter 
<br />
pylori.   My own working definition of a science skeptic is the last guy on 
<br />
the cul-de-sac who hasn't been told (by everyone else) how to find his 
<br />
water lines using two clotheshangers.  The reason of course, is that 
<br />
everyone knows it wouldn't work for him anyway. ;-)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I'm not saying that the resemblances between the story and the bomb are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;trivial - they do make an impression.  It also makes an impression when 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;someone dreams of a relative dying and the next day they receive news that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that relative did in fact die that night; or when you're in a foreign city 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and you look up the number of the taxi company and it turns out to be your 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;home phone number, or when exactly 100 years separate (1) the election to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Congress (2) the election to the presidency (3) the birth of the assassins 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of and (4) the birth of the successors of John F. Kennedy and Abraham Lincoln.
</em><br />
<br />If the Heinlein story failed to impress, then may I ask what went missing 
<br />
in it that--had it been there--would have suggested further study?  Twenty 
<br />
key words and phrases including &quot;Oppenheimer,&quot; &quot;Trinity&quot; &quot;plutonium&quot; 
<br />
&quot;Neddermeyer&quot; &quot;mushroom cloud&quot; &quot;Teller Light&quot; and &quot;shake?&quot;   Or would that 
<br />
again be just classified as a rather unusual coincidence?   I hear a lot of 
<br />
qualifiers (such as the one below) but nothing substantial regarding your 
<br />
criteria.  It seems all very vague--except of course, for the 
<br />
conclusion.   If you have a criteria or model for evaluating some of these 
<br />
events (such as Heinleins example) I'd like to hear it.  Then, as good 
<br />
scientists, we can begin to evaluate how appropriate it may be for the 
<br />
examination of these unusual events.  Until we have that protocol defined, 
<br />
I'm sorry, you're just expressing a belief (that nothing that can't be 
<br />
explained by a model is exceptional or even should be evaluated.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;These coincidences all make an impression on one.  But nothing special 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;needs to be invoked to explain the occurrence of these events --  what 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;needs to be explained is the facet of human psychology that makes people 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;think something strange is going on when in fact nothing is.
</em><br />
<br />Yet, without knowing the facts you immediately assume the facts &quot;when in 
<br />
fact nothing is.&quot;   It's a common position taken by the lazy 
<br />
scientist---and it doesn't have to do with strange things, either.  It's 
<br />
why the EPA never bothered to determine the density of the WTC surge 
<br />
cloud.  Nothing to worry about, because, well, *in fact* there is nothing 
<br />
to worry about.  The citizens of New York *do* appreciate that 
<br />
position.   (hey, Pete, you're a fed---why haven't they come up with the 
<br />
density?)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;   Many people have taken stabs at it, and evolutionary explanations seem 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to work well -- seriously, you should get the Dawkins book and read the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; chapter to see where we're coming from; Carl Sagan also addressed this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; issue very well.
</em><br />
<br />And of course, I encourage you to consider coming up with an appropriate 
<br />
protocol that doesn't include prejudging the data, or assuming facts not in 
<br />
evidence---and tell us what the density of that surge cloud was in 
<br />
milligrams per cubic meter.  Is that in a book somewhere also? ;-)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;--Also, you still have not explained how you get 1 in 10e-9.
</em><br />
<br />I used it as an example of a p value that is dreadfully easy to obtain when 
<br />
applying standard probabilities to any of these events.  My concern is that 
<br />
for many scientists, 1x10^-9, though ridiculously small---is, for some 
<br />
things, still not small enough.  Which is why scientists have willfully 
<br />
ceded important areas of research to the likes of the Midnight Examiner, 
<br />
the Star, The Washington Times and Fox News.
<br />
<br />Cheers,
<br />
<br />RM
<br />
<br />Pete, if you need some numbers to call at the EPA's RTP facility, I'll be 
<br />
glad to give em to you.
