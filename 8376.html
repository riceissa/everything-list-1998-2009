We already discussed this. When you define the first person by the
<br />
Theaetetical trick you get freely, from the self-reference logic G, a
<br />
temporal logic. The one named by S4Grz. Search in the archive &quot;S4Grz&quot;.
<br />
Read &quot;S 4 Grzegorczyk&quot;.
<br />
<br />Theatetical trick = define Cp (knowing p) by &quot;p &amp; Bp&quot; i.e. you prove p
<br />
and p is true.
<br />
<br />**
<br />
[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you are asking us to take a &quot;definition&quot; to be a proof of existence?!
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find this to be merely a &quot;castle in midair&quot;, sorry, but that is due to 
<br />
my lack of understanding of your &quot;trick&quot;; it is the fact that it appears to 
<br />
be a &quot;pulling oneself up by the bootstraps&quot; trick is what bothers me about 
<br />
it. I have nothing against bootstrapping IF and only IF there is a clear 
<br />
reasoning as to how it does not violate coherence with the rest of logic and 
<br />
physics. BTW, I am still waiting to read an English version of your Thesis. 
<br />
That, I hope, might help me. Have you considered Google's translation 
<br />
services?
<br />
<br />**

<br />
The 3-platonia is timeless, but so are many &quot;block-universes&quot; for many
<br />
physicists. S4Grz explains the origin of the appearance of time from
<br />
the internal points of view of machines/numbers.
<br />
<br />**
<br />
[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it is that timelessness that I am basing my argument against your 
<br />
thesis! YOu are ignoring the vast number of arguments that have been found 
<br />
in physics and even the reasoning comming from computer science, for example 
<br />
the Calude et al work on the non-embeddability of quantum logic into 
<br />
classical logics. One simply can not obtain quantum logic from classical 
<br />
logic without adding postulates to classical logic.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your work is, as I see it, the equivalent to trying to derive quantum 
<br />
physics and the wide variety of experimental evidence from some 
<br />
super-classical physics. This is not a new thing, you just seem to have 
<br />
found a way to do in using logical systems instead of matematical physics. 
<br />
The point is that it is equivalent!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, there is some good work that shows a very promising way of 
<br />
solving the emergence of time from timelessness by Prof. Kitada, but it is 
<br />
far over my paygrade to even attempt to traslate his work into your 
<br />
language. Thus I ask that you read what he has written and see if it makes 
<br />
some sense to you. This paper is, I think, a good place to start: 
<br />
<a href="http://www.kitada.com/timeV.html">http://www.kitada.com/timeV.html</a>

<br />
In general physicist does not even address this question (by naively
<br />
relating belief in change with some physical change, but that leads to
<br />
many difficulties as the UD argument is supposed to illustrate).
<br />
<br />***
<br />
[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are very mistaken one this! Physicists are deeply interested in this 
<br />
question, even to the point that there are yearly conferences on the 
<br />
subject: 
<br />
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22problem+of+time%22+conference">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22problem+of+time%22+conference</a>

I will perhaps make other comments next week, but I must go now ...
<br />
<br /><br />Best,
<br />
<br />Bruno
<br />
<br />PS What do you mean by &quot;onward&quot;?
<br />
<br />***
<br />
[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is short for a battle cry:  &quot;Onward into the Unknown&quot;, the motto of 
<br />
explorers. ;-)
<br />
<br />Onward!
<br />
