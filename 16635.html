<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Consciousness is information.  Physical systems can be interpreted as

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; representing, or &quot;storing&quot;, information, but that act of &quot;storage&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; isn't what gives rise to conscious experience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; You're aware of course that the same things were said about the

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; physio/chemical bases of life.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You mentioned that point before, as I recall.  Dennett made a similar
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argument against Chalmers, to which Chalmers had what I thought was an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; effective response:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; -------
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://consc.net/papers/moving.html">http://consc.net/papers/moving.html</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps the most common strategy for a type-A materialist is to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deflate the &quot;hard problem&quot; by using analogies to other domains, where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; talk of such a problem would be misguided. Thus Dennett imagines a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; vitalist arguing about the hard problem of &quot;life&quot;, or a neuroscientist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arguing about the hard problem of &quot;perception&quot;. Similarly, Paul
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Churchland (1996) imagines a nineteenth century philosopher worrying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about the hard problem of &quot;light&quot;, and Patricia Churchland brings up
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an analogy involving &quot;heat&quot;. In all these cases, we are to suppose,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; someone might once have thought that more needed explaining than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure and function; but in each case, science has proved them
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wrong. So perhaps the argument about consciousness is no better.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This sort of argument cannot bear much weight, however. Pointing out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that analogous arguments do not work in other domains is no news: the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whole point of anti-reductionist arguments about consciousness is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is a disanalogy between the problem of consciousness and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problems in other domains. As for the claim that analogous arguments
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in such domains might once have been plausible, this strikes me as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something of a convenient myth: in the other domains, it is more or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; less obvious that structure and function are what need explaining, at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; least once any experiential aspects are left aside, and one would be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hard pressed to find a substantial body of people who ever argued
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; otherwise.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; When it comes to the problem of life, for example, it is just obvious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that what needs explaining is structure and function: How does a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; living system self-organize? How does it adapt to its environment? How
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does it reproduce? Even the vitalists recognized this central point:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; their driving question was always &quot;How could a mere physical system
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perform these complex functions?&quot;, not &quot;Why are these functions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; accompanied by life?&quot; It is no accident that Dennett's version of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; vitalist is &quot;imaginary&quot;. There is no distinct &quot;hard problem&quot; of life,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and there never was one, even for vitalists.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In general, when faced with the challenge &quot;explain X&quot;, we need to ask:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what are the phenomena in the vicinity of X that need explaining, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; how might we explain them? In the case of life, what cries out for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explanation are such phenomena as reproduction, adaptation,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; metabolism, self-sustenance, and so on: all complex functions. There
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is not even a plausible candidate for a further sort of property of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; life that needs explaining (leaving aside consciousness itself), and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indeed there never was. In the case of consciousness, on the other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hand, the manifest phenomena that need explaining are such things as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discrimination, reportability, integration (the functions), and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience. So this analogy does not even get off the ground.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ------
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</em><br />
<br />On the contrary, I think it does.  First, I think Chalmers idea that 
<br />
vitalists recognized that all that needed explaining was structure and 
<br />
function is revisionist history.  They were looking for the animating 
<br />
spirit.  It is in hind sight, having found the function and structure, 
<br />
that we've realized that was all the explanation available.  And I 
<br />
expect the same thing will happen with consciousness. We will eventually 
<br />
be able to make robots that behave as humans do and we will infer, from 
<br />
their behavior, that they are conscious.  And we, being their designers, 
<br />
will be able to analyze them and say, &quot;Here's what makes R2D2 have 
<br />
conscious experiences of visual perception and here's what makes 3CPO 
<br />
have self awareness relative to humans.&quot;  We will find that there are 
<br />
many different kinds of &quot;conscious&quot; and we will be able to invent new 
<br />
ones.  We will never &quot;solve&quot; Chalmers hard problem, we'll just realize 
<br />
it's a non-question.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Though it DOES seem plausible/obvious to me that a physical system
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; going through a sequence of these representations is what produces
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; human behavior.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;       
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; So you're saying that a sequence of physical representations is enough
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to produce behavior.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Right, observed behavior.  What I'm saying here is that it seems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; obvious to me that mechanistic computation is sufficient to explain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observed human behavior.  If that was the only thing that needed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explaining, we'd be done.  Mission accomplished.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; BUT...there's subjective experience that also needs explained, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this is actually the first question that needs answered.  All other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; answers are suspect until subjective experience has been explained.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; And there must be conscious experience associated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; with behavior.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, here's where it gets tricky.  Conscious experience is associated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with information.  
</em><br />
<br />I think that's the point in question.  However, we all agree that 
<br />
consciousness is associated with, can be identified by, certain 
<br />
behavior.  So to say that physical systems are too representationally 
<br />
ambiguous seems to me to beg the question.  It is based on assuming that 
<br />
consciousness is information and since the physical representation of 
<br />
information is ambiguous it is inferred that physical representations 
<br />
aren't enough for consciousness.  But  going back to the basis: Is 
<br />
behavior ambiguous?  Sure it is - yet we rely in it to identify 
<br />
consciousness (at least if you don't believe in philosophical 
<br />
zombies).   I think the significant point is that consciousness is an 
<br />
attribute of behavior that is relative to an environment.
<br />
<br />Brent
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But how information is tied to physical systems is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a different question.  Any physical systems can be interpreted as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; representing all sorts of things (again, back to Putnam and Searle,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one-time pads, Maudlin's Olympia example, Bruno's movie graph
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argument, rocks implementing every FSA, Stathis's birds and trees, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; triviality attacks on functionalism).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; That seems to me to imply that physical representations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; are enough to produce consciousness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The problem is that physical &quot;representations&quot; are everywhere.  The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem is coming up with a non-arbitrary way of deciding when a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical system represents something that's conscious and when it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doesn't.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Physical systems are too representationally promiscuous!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Which leads me to abandon physicalism/materialism for idealism.
