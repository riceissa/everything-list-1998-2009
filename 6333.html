Stathis, you asked th million $ question:
<br />
<br />&quot;...&gt;Could you briefly explain what reductionism is and why
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you don't like it?&quot;&lt;
</em><br />
( May I shortchange it into:
<br />
&quot;what is MY take I call reductionism - and I like it&quot;.)
<br />
<br />Let us start with two concepts I want to use:
<br />
1. Wholeness:
<br />
the 'world' (existence, everything) as an interconnected unlimited
<br />
function, all of it influencing all of it.
<br />
2. Model: Our mind is not capable to assume it all, so as a mental aid for
<br />
survival we consider &quot;things&quot; in topically, functionally, ideationally (and
<br />
in whatever aspect) identifying our
<br />
REDUCED views, which are applicable for our observational skills. We
<br />
surround models by boundaries within which we 'observe' and 'recognize'. If
<br />
they are not substantially cutting into those 'observed' features, we tend
<br />
to disregard the 'out-of-boundary' effects which, however, are there - with
<br />
a potential of change in the (not currently observed) aspects.
<br />
Such a limited (maybe wide) fraction of the totality is MY &quot;model&quot;.
<br />
Aristotle spoke about such models consisting only of  material parts
<br />
when he stated that the &quot;total is more than the sum of its components
<br />
<br />To 'reduce' our view - thinking/observing - to units of such models
<br />
is what I CALL reductionism. I was reprimanded by philosophers stating quite
<br />
different (and several) definitions of philosophical
<br />
'reductionism'  (systems) - this is, however,  MY TAKE.
<br />
<br />Why I don't like it (or do?)
<br />
Our knowledge base of the world (now I mean: nature) consists of evaluation
<br />
about reductionistic (model) observations. Our history of the cognitive
<br />
inventory we carry about the world was built upon models, sometimes in
<br />
disregard of other models (and the totality).
<br />
This is the ONLY way we with our feeble mind can learn about the world. This
<br />
is how technology was developed. I use it, you use it.
<br />
I cannot dislike our way of getting along. What I dislike is the
<br />
consideration of model-deductions as validated onto the totality. Most
<br />
sciences (all are: models!) do it, except for the new trend of approaching
<br />
physical considerations (and math) in non-physical sciences. It is also
<br />
limited, just broader.
<br />
<br />Consider to it the development of the models (sciences) at those levels of
<br />
epistemic enrichment at which observations were made - with means of the
<br />
time - and evaluation was coined - at the level of the time. Later on more
<br />
epistemic enrichment required additions, ameliorations, but the original
<br />
reductionist ideas survived in most cases. Quantizing models (applied
<br />
mathematics) led to equations of incomplete quantities, maybe usable within
<br />
the model-consideration but ultimately leading to paradoxes. One reason IMO
<br />
how and why QM was necessary to develop.
<br />
<br />Your example &quot;...a hydrogen atom is made up of an electron and a proton,
<br />
...&quot; is asking for the question: &quot;and an electron? and a proton?&quot; and so
<br />
on - but the main deficiency of your (reductionist) statement is to consider
<br />
for the alleged material(?) particles as to 'making' a model whithout also
<br />
including functional aspects, total ambience-connections in an interrelated
<br />
totality - dynamism.
<br />
I (as a colloidal chemist) used another example:
<br />
there is no such thing as &quot;water = H2O&quot; except for the primitive conclusion
<br />
of 'destroying' water and getting measurement  results resembling those on
<br />
H2 and O2 (not H and O) with the proportion describable as in the water
<br />
formula-weights. None of such &quot;ingredients&quot; allowing for a surface tension,
<br />
the 4C max density, or hydrodynamics etc., so characteristic  for 'water'.
<br />
<br />Reductionistic model-view resulted in an unimaginable edifice of the
<br />
scientific knowledge-base, all balanced by applied math. As it turned out
<br />
½century ago, it does not contribute easily to a 'deeper' understanding of
<br />
the world. We realize complexities within models, between models and
<br />
unrelated to models. Finite and infinite ones.
<br />
This is why I slant my speculations away from the reductionistic model-view.
<br />
Alas, I am not to far ahead with it.
<br />
<br />You asked the m$ - I replied the 2c.
<br />
Cheers
<br />
John M

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; John, this is the second time you have mentioned reductionist thinking ijn

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the last few days. Could you briefly explain what reductionism is and why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you don't like it? For example, a hydrogen atom is made up of an electron
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and a proton, but its behaviour is very different to that of an electron
</em><br />
or
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a proton on its own. Is it reductionist to say that a hydrogen atom is
</em><br />
just
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; made up of these two subatomic particles? Similarly, a human being is made
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; up of electrons, protons and neutrons, but its behaviour is very different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to what one might guess from knowing the intricate details of particle
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics. You can say that the hydrogen atom and the human being (and for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that matter, just about everything else in the universe) show surprising
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behaviours, or emergent behaviours, and I would agree with you. You can
</em><br />
also
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; say that there are aspects of very complex systems, like a human being or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the universe as a whole, which science is incapable of explaining at our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; current level of understanding, and I would agree with you again. But how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does this negate the essential point that everything is made up of its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constituent parts, however complex the configuration of and interaction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between those constituent parts may be?
