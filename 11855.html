<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The eight hypostases:

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK.  I follow all of your logic (propositional calculus) once we get
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; into it.  There are two problems with going too far in this.  One has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; been noted before, that this is pretty technical stuff, although I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; enjoy it and would like to hear it out.


</em><br />
Thanks. Sometimes I think I have arrived at the limit of what I can 
<br />
explain about my work in this list.




<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The other problem is how all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of this logic connects to Everything.  That is why I am trying to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand the 0-person.  I think questioning the 0-person might be the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; same thing as questioning the assumption of Arithmetic Realism (AR),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but I'm not sure.


</em><br />
You are mainly right. Strictly speaking any sufficiently rich notion of 
<br />
truth would work. If you are interested in the theology of an &quot;angel&quot; 
<br />
(a non turing emulable entity like Analysis + omega rule (anomega)) you 
<br />
will have to take a notion of analytical truth, but for any digital 
<br />
machine arithmetical truth is enough (even for ZF, but this is hard to 
<br />
show: better to take the X-notion of truth for a machine talking on 
<br />
X-objects).
<br />
Anyone believing in a notion of independent (from oneself) truth 
<br />
believes in a notion of zero-person. With comp AR is enough.


<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  In the past it may have sounded like I was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; supporting AR, but actually I was just arguing that physicalism is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any more well founded than AR.

</em><br />
I agree with this. To be sure I have not yet meet anyone who does not 
<br />
believe in AR. (I have meet many who pretend not to believe in AR, but 
<br />
that is different: they put in AR much more than I put in, in general 
<br />
as a way for escaping the uda consequences, I guess).



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What I am worried about is that all of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the fancy calculus might end up being something like string theory,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; beautiful but how can it be proven that it is the key to understanding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and living in the world around us?


</em><br />
To be honest, if comp ends with a physical theory like string theory, 
<br />
it would be quite marvellous, despite current critics against it (which 
<br />
I don't take seriously).
<br />
Now I do expect, or at least I am collecting evidence that the 3th 
<br />
hypostases (the soul + acomp), i.e. S4Grz1, could lead to a &quot;loop 
<br />
gravity&quot; type of everything theory, and the 4th or 5th hypostases (the 
<br />
intelligible and sensible matter) could lead to string type theories.
<br />
But honestly this is still speculative, and the comp physics is not so 
<br />
well advanced.
<br />
Now, there is an important sense making the comp-physics far in advance 
<br />
compared to what physicists have done. Indeed physicist does not tackle 
<br />
the mind body problem and does not have any tool to address it, I mean 
<br />
they have no tools to distinguish the communicable part of physics and 
<br />
the non-communicable part. Comp uses the G* minus G difference to makes 
<br />
sense of those fundamental nuances. It makes comp a theory of 
<br />
everything communicable and non communicable. In that sense the comp 
<br />
theory explains much more fundamental things. Strictly speaking, 
<br />
without (a)comp, we have just no tools to distinguish the 
<br />
scientist-prover, the knower, observation and anticipation.




<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. This 0-person cannot be the basis for saying that the scientific
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; discourse (and allegedly the Everything List discussions) has to have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; an impersonal basis.  As you say, this 0-person has no discourse.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; And
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; the hypothetical existence of a 0-person does not rule out the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; existence of person at the deepest level to which we can relate (as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; persons).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The trick is that a lobian machine as rich as ZF is able to prove the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; whole (provable and unprovable by PA) theology of a simpler lobian
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; machine like PA. There is nothing hypothetical in the notion of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;arithmetical truth&quot; from the pov of a rich (set theoretically based)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; lobian machine. Faith arrives only when a machine begins to bet on its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; *own* correct theology, i.e. its *own* G* if you want (or G* minus G).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here you talk as if the 0-person is always relative to a given limited
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; G.  But above you say that the 0-person is viewed from outside
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everywhere (nowhere), i.e. an absolute notion.  Which is it?


</em><br />
The zero person is not relative to a person. But G is the &quot;INTELLECT&quot;, 
<br />
and G* is the &quot;DIVINE INTELLECT&quot; that is the &quot;truth on the intellect&quot;.
<br />
As logics, G and G* are universal. I mean they are sound and complete 
<br />
for any sound lobian machine or entity (angels). But their arithmetical 
<br />
intepretation are relative and indeed are indexical.  Example: take the 
<br />
second incompleteness theorem &quot;~Bf -&gt; ~B(~Bf)&quot;, i.e.:

<br />
NOT PROVABLE FALSE    entails   NOT PROVABLE (NOT PROVABLE FALSE)

<br />
This is a theorem of G (and thus of G* which extends G). But &quot;provable&quot; 
<br />
means for any machine &quot;provable by me&quot;, and so the arithmetical meaning 
<br />
of the &quot;B&quot; is different from one machine to another.
<br />
On the contrary the 0-person can be seen as a big undifferentiate truth 
<br />
which does not even mention any machine (or if it does, it does it in 
<br />
some trivial way).


<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; I believe the reasoning behind an impersonal basis is based
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; on the desire to get away from the personal at the core level of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; being.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I don't think so. It comes only from the scientist desire to get away
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of first person truth in the scientific discourse. Actually, the cute
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; thing here is that we get a extremely powerful defense of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; existence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of the first person, at the core level of being (despite the need to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; restrict the scientific discourse in the third person discourse).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Doesn't the 3rd person provide the discourse of 1st person?


</em><br />
Yes, but only because the knower is defined by &quot;Bp &amp; p&quot; in the language 
<br />
of the machine. This is due to the fact that I limit my interview with 
<br />
the machine on the third person provable (or bettable) propositions. 
<br />
But from the S4Grz logic you can manage to interview directly the first 
<br />
person associated to the sound lobian machine. That gives a 
<br />
intuitionist view of the mathematical reality, with an unameable self 
<br />
which has the tendency of wanting control everything ... Something akin 
<br />
to Brouwer original motivation for a theory of a subject/consciousness. 
<br />
It is interesting but premature.



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Again, why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is the 0-person needed?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You didn't answer that question above; you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simply restated what the 0-person is.


</em><br />
I don't think we needed, we just cannot avoid it. Like AR is needed for 
<br />
giving sense to the Church Thesis.



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So the 3rd person is the discourse of the 1st person.  OK.


</em><br />
I am not sure this is correct. The 3rd person = the scientist = the 3rd 
<br />
person discourse = the one described by G (for the communicable part) 
<br />
and by G* for the non communicable part.

<br />
Now, the third person discourse can be used to study, in some 
<br />
scientific way, the first person discourse, but that first person is 
<br />
completely different from the third, and have completely different 
<br />
discourse, almost opposite, despite G* (but only G*) knowing there is 
<br />
no difference in the set of arithmetical propositions they can prove.





<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simply labeling what's there.  It isn't trying to get away from 1st
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person truth.  We don't have to *try* to get away from 1st person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; truth.  When we say anything about 1st person we *automatically* are in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the 3rd person by definition.

</em><br />
If by &quot;we&quot; you mean the scientist, then I agree.


<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What I am calling into question is the need for 0-person, and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; motive for saying we need it.  As I stated before, I think it is an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attempt to elevate the impersonal to the &quot;god&quot; level.  That way we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't have to worry about the personal at the core of being because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we've artifically stuck the impersonal at the core.


</em><br />
Well, I do this through auda, but just because 99,999% of the scientist 
<br />
(including me) estimate that we have to build our scientific theories 
<br />
in a third person way, and they suspect the UDA to rely too much on the 
<br />
first person (which is debatable). In AUDA I make clear that the 
<br />
iincompleteness gives sense to nuances which appears only in UDA by 
<br />
heavy appeal on &quot;folk psychology&quot;. This is due in great part to the 
<br />
fact that I have been obliged to defend all this in a faculty of 
<br />
science. Would I have done philosophical studies, I could have 
<br />
concentrate myself only on the UDA, but of course I have discovered the 
<br />
AUDA together with the UDA.


<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Exercice: show that the UD is not a Universal Machine (at all). It is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; enough to show that the UD cannot crash. Indeed it has no inputs! (Now
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; there is a sense in which we could say that the UD is &quot;borned crashed&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; given that it is programmed for non stopping (my usual definition of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; crashed). So there is a sense to say that the UD is a &quot;crashed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; universal machine&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The other definition of crashing is that the machine takes an input for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which the output is not defined.  So since the UD does not have an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; input, crashing is not possible.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I also see your reasoning about the &quot;crashed UM&quot; based on your usual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definition of crashed.  But this makes me think that I should not trust
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the output of the UD, if it is &quot;crashed&quot;.


</em><br />
But the UD has no output. Extensionally the UD is a function from 
<br />
nothing to nothing (like any big whole).
<br />
Note that the UD is the comp accessible part of the zero-person. (But 
<br />
this is something I cannot explain before saying more on the 
<br />
hypostases).



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So would you call a machine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that generates the natural numbers a crashed machine?  Probably just a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; linguistic curiosity.


</em><br />
I would modelize such a machine by a Wi instead of a Fi, in this case. 
<br />
The UD really generates nothing, but implicitly its trace.



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Weyl quote is interesting though in that it cites the infinite in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; first half in reference to good, and it cites our finiteness in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; second half in reference to evil.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; I would say that our finiteness (or other limitations such as a need
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; for a particular reference frame) is not sufficient for the existence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; of evil.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Yes, evil belongs intrinsically to the realm of the ideally correct
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; self-observing universal machine.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Again, simply realizing our own limitations is not cause for doing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evil.  It is when we are dissatified with our own limitations, and we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; want to elevate ourselves above where we are, that we are tempted to do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evil.  We are finite, so there will always be a level at which it will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be impossible for us to see truth and operate in it.  Elevating our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understanding inside of our capabilities is good, I am not discounting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that.  But it is a simple mathematical problem that we will always find
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a limit to what we can do.  This is fine.  No evil yet.  But it is when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we try to go above that limit at all costs, taking &quot;more is better&quot; as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our ultimate motto, that we end up stepping on others to do it.


</em><br />
I was using evil in the quasi-benacerafian sense. Evil is just DBf. The 
<br />
consistency of inconsistency forced by the second incompleteness 
<br />
theorem.



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So what is the answer?  What is the &quot;balance&quot; (not a good word) between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a) staying within our limits and b) the expanding our knowledge by a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; combination of leaps of intuition and logical inference?

</em><br />
Only the first person do that, but then the first person is locally 
<br />
immune to the evil. Globally, there is a &quot;tension&quot; between first and 
<br />
third person, and this makes sense through the existence of the first 
<br />
person plural (whre inconsistencies become contagious from a person to 
<br />
another).


<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   I have a view
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of this, but it will be good to get others' views also.


</em><br />
OK. Sure.



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hint: I think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this is connected to Stathis' post, that this is where faith comes in.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; More later.


</em><br />
Faith comes from the guessability of the non provable truth, like the 
<br />
belief in a reality, or in a &quot;god&quot; (or in a zero-person pov) ...


<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; This is my point.  We go too far when we let our view of the &quot;natural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; order&quot; (or &quot;god&quot;!) be the dictator of what can happen.  Indeed this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; actually making ourselves the center of the universe (multiverse).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; This is against the true essence of spirituality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I agree with you. &quot;Naturalism&quot; as implicit metaphysics or theology is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; as fake as any form of authoritative dogma. Of course a *doubting*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; naturalist can remain scientific. But a naturalist who says that when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; we die, we will not born again (like many materialist believes) is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;religious&quot; in the worst sense of the word. The truth is that we don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; know, but can propose theories.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; With comp, it is easy to kill oneself ... locally. It is harder  ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; globally.  With comp it remains possible that consciousness is a sort
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of prison, as Otto Rossler extracts from Descartes (I agree with him 
</em><br />
