A few years ago I posted a speculation about Harry Potter universes,
<br />
from the Schmidhuber perspective.  Schmidhuber argues that the reason
<br />
we don't see such a universe is that its program would be more complex,
<br />
hence its algorithmic-complexity measure would be less.  Such a universe
<br />
would basically have natural laws identical to what we see, but in
<br />
addition it would have exceptions to the laws.  You wave a wand and say
<br />
&quot;Lumino!&quot; and light appears.  (Here I am taking the Harry Potter name
<br />
rather literally, but the same thing applies to the more general concept
<br />
of universes with magical exceptions to the rules.)
<br />
<br />You could also argue, as Wei does, on anthropic grounds that in such a
<br />
universe the ease of exploiting magic would reduce selection pressure
<br />
towards intelligence.  Indeed in the Harry Potter stories there are
<br />
magical animals but it is never explained why their amazing powers did
<br />
not allow them to dominate the world and kill off mundane creatures long
<br />
before human civilization arose.
<br />
<br />I suggested that the Schmidhuber argument has a loophole.  It's true that
<br />
the measure of a simple universe is much greater than a universe with
<br />
the same laws plus one or more exceptions.  But if you consider the set
<br />
of all universes built on those laws plus exceptions, considering all
<br />
possible variants on exceptions, the collective measure of all these
<br />
universes is roughly the same as the simple universe.  So Schmidhuber
<br />
gives us no good reason to reject the possibility that our universe may
<br />
have exceptions to the natural laws.
<br />
<br />If we do live in an exceptional universe, we are more likely to live in
<br />
one which is only &quot;slightly&quot; exceptional, i.e. one whose laws are among
<br />
the simplest possible modifications from the base laws.  Unfortunately,
<br />
without a better picture of the true laws of physics and an understanding
<br />
of the language that expresses them most simply, we can't say much about
<br />
what form exceptions might take.  We know that they would be likely
<br />
to be simple, in the same language that makes our base laws simple,
<br />
but since we don't know that language it is hard to draw conclusions.
<br />
<br />Here is where the anthropic argument advanced by Wei Dai sheds some
<br />
light; one thing we could say is that these simple exceptions should not
<br />
be exploitable by life and make things so easy as to remove selection
<br />
pressure.  So this would constrain the kinds of exceptions that could
<br />
exist.
<br />
<br />Ironically, waving a wand and speaking in Latin would indeed be the
<br />
kind of exception that would not likely be exploited by unintelligent
<br />
life forms.  So purely on anthropic principles we could not fully rule out
<br />
Harry Potter magic.  But the complexity of embedding Latin phrases in the
<br />
natural laws would argue strongly against us living in such a universe.
