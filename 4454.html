<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Noone that I could recall came up with a convincing argument against

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the Euthanasia issue - it would seem that committing euthanasia on

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; misery than if you'd just left things alone - quite the contrary to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; what one expects in a single universe notion of reality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The problem Russell points out is that in the MWI if we try to kill
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; someone, we will succeed in many branches, but fail in some others.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And in those in which we fail, we will probably injure the victim.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The effect from the point of view of the continuations of the victim is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that their quality of life has been worsened.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;From the point of view of _this_ particular continuation, namely, me, I 
<br />
will choose injury over death.
<br />
<br />Any attempt to claim that injury means &quot;quality of life has been 
<br />
worsened&quot; as compared to death is...well, I won't say &quot;silly,&quot; as 
<br />
that's not a good debating term.
<br />
<br />Let's turn to simple causal decision theory. A man is approaching me 
<br />
with a large knife. I have two choices:
<br />
<br />* Choice 1: Attempt to defend myself, probably causing me some amount 
<br />
of injury but possibly saving my life.
<br />
<br />* Choice 2: Allow myself to be killed.
<br />
<br />I get the idea from your paragraph above that you think Choice 1 is 
<br />
less desirable, as &quot;The effect from the point of view of the 
<br />
continuations of the victim is that their quality of life has been 
<br />
worsened.&quot;
<br />
<br />Am I misunderstanding your point of view about what I should do?
<br />
<br />My approach is to optimize for the actual life (reality, branch, world) 
<br />
I am actually experiencing. Arguments that it would be better for &quot;me&quot; 
<br />
to allow myself to be killed, or euthanized, so as to make some average 
<br />
of realities forever disconnected from mine (Everett, De Witt, etc., 
<br />
not contradicted by anyone here, at least not recently) is not 
<br />
convincing to me.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think a counter-argument comes if we look at the larger picture, not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just the particular branch in which we are acting.  Suppose that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; victim has suffered some injury which led to their unfortunate 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; condition,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where we are now considering committing euthanasia.  In other branches,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then, the victim is alive and healthy.  If we eliminate them from most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the branches in which they are injured, then in the big picture 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; average quality of life has been improved.  Even though there are a few
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; branches where our attempts to kill them have failed and have made 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; life worse, those are small in proportion to the set of branches which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; encompass their entire life.
</em><br />
<br />If you believe in this strong form of quantum suicide, then of course 
<br />
the path to &quot;quantum eugenics&quot; is clear: immediately kill children who 
<br />
get less than perfect scores on exams, immediately kill anyone who is 
<br />
outside the societal norms for beauty and charm, and so on. This will 
<br />
mean, so the theory goes, that in some realities there are mostly 
<br />
smart, healthy, beautiful, wise people.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now it may be said that this perspective is invalid, because the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; injured person here in front of us is the only one we can affect.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; His consciousness will never re-join the branches where he was not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; injured.  We can only affect him, and therefore we should judge our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; actions only based on their effects on him and his future 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; continuations.
</em><br />
<br />And this is what a person facing attack and death will also choose to 
<br />
do, to optimize his own survival and his own quality of life. Suicide 
<br />
can be a choice in extreme cases, I think many in society would agree. 
<br />
But it has nothing to do with branches of Possibilia forever 
<br />
disconnected from Actuality.
