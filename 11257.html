Le 27-sept.-06, à 20:41, Tom Caylor a écrit :
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I've thought of bringing up the Monster group here before, but I didn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think anyone here would be that weird, since I even get &quot;weird&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reactions to my ideas about the Riemann zeta function.  I've noticed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the connection with the number 26 also.  (By the way, for some unknown
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reason in my childhood 26 was my favorite number ;)
</em><br />
<br /><br />26 is 24 + 2.
<br />
24 dimensions of space + 2 dimension of time (useful for continuous  
<br />
bifurcating time).
<br />
I have try to develop such a &quot;toy&quot; theory. But it has no fermion  
<br />
although there are bizare object emerging from many sort of bosons  
<br />
which could perhaps play that role.
<br />
There are too much theories like that, and my hope is to extract  
<br />
constraints from the comp person point of view.
<br />
(At least now we know the difference between fiction and reality: it is  
<br />
18 ;)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In the past I've been drawn to the Monster group and the classification
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of finite simple groups, perhaps for reasons similar to other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematically inclined people.  There's just something mysterious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about the fact that there are only a finite number of classes of this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; type of mathematical object.  And yet it is a rather non-trivial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; number, larger than the number of spatial dimensions, and even larger
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than the number of platonic solids, or the number of faces on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; largest platonic solid.  And when you look at the order (size) of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; largest of the finite simple groups (the Monster group), it is huge.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And yet it is the largest.  This seems to be a signpost that something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fundamental is going on here.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes. But sometimes I am afraid it is just mermaid's songs. Too much  
<br />
beautiful to be true.
<br />
Perhaps I should trust a bit more the &quot;artist&quot; in me ;)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; On the other hand, if I recall correctly without checking, rings and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fields don't have such a classification such that there are a finite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; number of some basic type of them.  I'm just shooting off at the hip,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but I wonder if this has to do with the fact that groups have only one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; operator (addition or multiplication, say), whereas rings and fields
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have at least 2.  This rings a bell with the sufficient complexity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; needed for Godel's Incompleteness Theorems (and a nontrivial G/G*?).
</em><br />
<br />Yes I think you are right.
<br />
But my present speculation (not to confuse with my thesis on comp where  
<br />
there is no speculation at all) is based on the hope that there is a  
<br />
not too much complex universal diophantine equation, so that we can  
<br />
generalize in some genuine way &quot;Wiles modularity conjecture&quot;. If that  
<br />
were true, then the third and fourth hypostases would make possible to  
<br />
put full light on the godel-lobian blind spot, and verify how the laws  
<br />
of physics arise with all details including where qualia come from  
<br />
thanks to the G* part. If the jump of complexity is too big, well  
<br />
either comp will be shown false or we will have to hope there is bigger  
<br />
Monster Group, or some genuine non simple finite super giant group  
<br />
related too some more complex modular form.
<br />
<br />Matiyasevich reports the following interesting dialog between a  
<br />
logician L and a number theorist N:
<br />
<br />L: Matiyasevic has find a polynome such that all and only all its  
<br />
positive value are the prime numbers.
<br />
N: Waouh! Great! Super! We will learn a lot on the prime numbers!
<br />
L: Well, actually Matiyasevic has found a way to build such a polynome  
<br />
for any Recursively Enumerable set of number (any Wi).
<br />
N: Oh, what a pity, we will learn nothing on the prime numbers.
<br />
<br />But my feeling is that now we can use number theory to learn a lot on  
<br />
the Wi. The positive benefits are for the logicians. Matiyasevic result  
<br />
could eventually lead to an &quot;analytical&quot; (complex) recursion theory.  
<br />
Alas this is very complicated to do (compare the simplicity of the  
<br />
notion of prime number and the difficulty of Riemann's paper).  
<br />
Monstrous moonshine gives me at least the courage to do some  
<br />
speculations.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; A
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; similar point is that there are an infinite number of primes, whereas
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the number of classes of finite simple groups is finite.  Another
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; caution is to note the failure this approach in the past, notably with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Plato's &quot;theory of everything&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Honestly I think you are unfair with Plato. But then read Plotinus who  
<br />
is clearer on numbers and forms.
<br />
Frankly! The only failure of Plato is to have kept Aristotle in the  
<br />
Academy (against the advise of Xeusippus and the mathematicians) !
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; We don't want to go down the path of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; numerology, which is a lot of what comes up when I google &quot;monster
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; group&quot; and &quot;multiverse&quot;.  But on the other hand, this is part of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nature of exploring.
</em><br />
<br />Sure. And the advantage of the Mermaid's Songs, is that even if they  
<br />
take you far from the truth, they still make you enjoying beautifulness  
<br />
...
<br />
<br />Bruno
<br />
<br />PS Those interested can take a look on Mark Ronan's recent popular  
<br />
book: &quot;Symmetry and the Monster&quot; which tells the story of the  
<br />
classification of the finite simple groups, and introduces the Monster.
