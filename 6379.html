<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Stephen writes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The perpetual question I have (about the epiphenomena problem that any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; form of Idealism has), regarding this notion of a Platonic Reality, is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; IF all possible Forms of existence *exist* a priori - &quot;from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; beginning&quot; -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; what necessitates any form of 1st person experience of a world that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;evolves&quot;, has an irreversible arrow of time, etc?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Prigogine used to declaim on this a lot. I think that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; answer that many people like to give---and which has caused
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; me no end of headaches---is that if we regard time as just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a dimension like the others, then we can conceive everything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as a block universe (as we have all discussed a lot here
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; already).
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have read every I could find by Prigogine many years ago. It was his
<br />
idea that lead me to wonder if Being were merely the &quot;fixed point&quot; of
<br />
Becoming... But that is metaphysics... ;-)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [LC]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm assuming that your question isn't just rhetorical. I have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to admit &quot;they&quot; have a strong argument. Probably Calvin in Geneva
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; made the same argument before them. Even Vonnegut talked about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our actions being frozen in amber, as it were. And Balfour has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explained it rather well: our *sense* time passing is a sort
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of illusion, and all that really is is a set of adjacent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; configurations. But, alas, I am saying nothing new here: we've
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all reiterated these ideas.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no problem with the idea of block universes in principle, in
<br />
fact, the idea of a &quot;history&quot; makes perfect sense in these terms. I had
<br />
mentioned something previously about light cones and closed universes
<br />
considered from the point of view of being it the Present and looking out
<br />
toward the Big Bang event horizon.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each observer, in this sense has a &quot;block universe&quot; of their own.  One
<br />
thing that we can claim to be unassailable is that any kind of &quot;observer&quot;
<br />
that we can imagine will always have some notion of an object of their
<br />
observations. It seems to me that the converse is also equally unassailable.
<br />
If there exists something that is observable, then there must exist some
<br />
observer that has such as an object. But the problems start when we take
<br />
this idea that abstract it to the point where the observer is some abstract
<br />
notion of a &quot;god-like&quot; point of view; that somehow it is possible for an
<br />
observer to exist that is the ideal voyeur that can somehow perceive all and
<br />
yet not is affected by this act of observation.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing we seem to all agree upon is that the act of observation
<br />
involves some kind of creation of a persistent imprint of the act, something
<br />
that can be used to communicate the result of the observation, be it a
<br />
crystallization of silver in a photographic plate or the creation of a
<br />
connection between neurons. Are we going to somehow abstract away this and
<br />
get away with it? I do not think so!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It seems to me that Plato's Ideal is the ultimate case of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; system in thermodynamic equilibrium, and as such exhibits no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; change of any kind, per definition. What then is the origin
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of, at least, the illusion of change? How can Becoming derive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; from pure Being?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [LC]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; :-)  Yes, one of the titles of Prigogine's books was &quot;From
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Being to Becoming&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Why is it necessary that I cannot remember the future equally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; well as I can remember the past, assuming that I have not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; experienced a blow to the head or oxygen deprivation?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [LC]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course, if we turn to the natural world for explanations, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; specifically, turn to evolution, then this question amounts to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;why are records made of the past and not the future?&quot;. I don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; know of a very good answer. Perhaps Huw Price and others in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; end say, &quot;It's because the direction indicated by records is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what we call the past---traces of influence---and the other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; direction, the direction where entropy increases, is what we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; call the future.&quot;  But I would not be too surprised if a better
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; answer somehow obtains.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have some ideas about this but it will take a some time to explain
<br />
them. One thing for sure is that this &quot;arrow of time&quot;
<br />
<br />snip
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     Just because all possible TMs *could* get some measure of runtime,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; since we are assuming from the beginning
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that there exists some form of hardware,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; does not mean that they can all be implemented. The most notorious case
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; are TMs that ask the question &quot;Do I halt?&quot;...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [LC]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; When you write &quot;does not mean that they *can* all be implemented&quot;,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm not sure what you mean by can. Perhaps you mean only what the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; follow-up sentence implies. Now I would say that as usual we need
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to distinguish between TMs considered as abstract sets of quadruples
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (or quintuples in some expositions), and an idealized little machine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that runs around on wheels.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word &quot;can&quot; is used in the same sense as &quot;it is not inconsistent that 
<br />
...&quot;. But the mere a priori possibility that a TM can be implemented has 
<br />
nothing to do with whether or not is &quot;actually&quot; is implemented.  As we have 
<br />
discussed previously, there is a difference between an &quot;idealized little 
<br />
machine&quot; and a real &quot;little machine that runs around on wheels&quot; in that the 
<br />
first is at best the title of a emulation program that we could run on our 
<br />
favorite VR player that would be indistinguishable from some imagination of 
<br />
a &quot;little machine that runs around on wheels&quot;.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference is that we can chose to turn off the VR machine, think of 
<br />
something else, or whatever equivalent action in the &quot;idealized&quot; case but in 
<br />
the &quot;Real&quot; case we have to shell out hard cash to buy the thing and when it 
<br />
gets crushed underfoot, we have to sweep it up and dispose of the remains 
<br />
properly. ;-)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically, the &quot;real&quot; object is one that we can not &quot;turn off&quot; without 
<br />
doing something to our ability to observe it. I am reminded of how little 
<br />
children will cover their own eyes with their hand and claim: &quot;You can't see 
<br />
me!&quot;
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [LC]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But in either case, whether it eventually halts or whether it just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; spins its wheels, I would guess that they all can be implemented.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why not, exactly? After all, you just start the thing. If it wants
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to ask questions (that we know it cannot answer), it will just go
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ahead.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you read D. Deutsch's paper where he discusses the relationship 
<br />
between physics and computations?
<br />
<br /><a href="http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/deutsch85quantum.html">http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/deutsch85quantum.html</a>
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     We need to be very careful that we are not assuming infinite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; resources
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; for our TMs to run on, the computationalist equivalent of a Perpetual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Motion Machine.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, but won't it be retorted by them that wherever Universal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Reality Generators are built (in the multiverse), and wherever
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is the right kind of controlled big crunch, then indeed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some algorithms will run longer than any finite time?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To recap my answer to &quot;them&quot;, I suggest that all really long
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and really grotesque and exotic TMs just won't get much runtime
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; across the multiverse. That is, for any TM of N states and that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; writes out in M states as many 1s and 0s as is possible for a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Busy Beaver to do, there will be a M with 10^10^10^10^10 times
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as many states and a vastly vastly greater non-computable function
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of amount of writing done in that number of states. And these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; really exotic and lengthy TMs just will receive a negligible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; amount of runtime.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing about this line of thinking is that it tacitly assumes
<br />
implementation and only looks at the number of irreducible steps that the
<br />
computation must incur. It is easy to show that even infinitely slow
<br />
physical systems can implement computations, as long as we have eternities
<br />
to stand around a wait for the output.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that I have been misunderstanding this notion of runtime. Are
<br />
we considering computations to be like numbers laid out side by side and
<br />
determining which is longer than another? Does this not tacitly assume some
<br />
kind of transformation or whatever that lets us abstractly butt them up
<br />
against each other, much like how I would determine that some piece of wood
<br />
has a length equal to some amount defined by gradulations on my tape
<br />
measure.
<br />
<br />snip
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [LC]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, like I say, they don't need to invoke Platonia to get away
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with some infinities. But how might we be elevating our notion
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of &quot;being able to peek into the world from the outside&quot; into a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; postulate? As for me, I'm incurably wed to assuming a 3rd person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; viewpoint even when no such person can truly exist---and so do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you mean like me?
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So long as we understand that such 3rd person view points are abstracted
<br />
from our 1st person viewpoints that is fine and dandy. ;-) It is when we
<br />
assume that we can somehow obtain certainty of a 1st person viewpoint from a
<br />
3rd that obvious problems follow. We have as an example the idea of
<br />
examining the hardware of a computer, even down to the atomic level, all of
<br />
the circuits on the mother board, the CPU, etc., do we obtain some certainty
<br />
of its software aspect unless we plug a monitor to it or some other
<br />
Input/Output interface? We would be hard pressed!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; [LC]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; There are a lot of ammonia molecules inside Saturn, and they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; are indubitably physical. Can you explain at all how it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; even a bit reasonable to claim that they depend on (or are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; based on) consciousness?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     I believe that Greg Egan, in one of his wonderful novels, discussed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the idea that even molecules, bouncing in their Brownian dance, are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; implementing algorithms,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; algorithms that might just code for simulations of entities just like us.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; How could we ever interface with them such that we could get
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; answers?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [LC]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, thanks for explaining a meaning to what Greg Egan wrote
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that eluded me. Well, I have no idea how we could interface
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with them. So why is interrogating them or interfacing with them
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; important?
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because we can only have some meaningful measure of certainty that there
<br />
is &quot;someone home&quot; if we can ask questions, like in the Turing Test. Some
<br />
form of interface must be possible.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [LC]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It may be that these bouncing molecules happen to spell out my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whole life in detail. But surely that can't happen much, can it?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (I confess this is all new to me.)
