</em><br />
<br /><br />Your comments are exactly on target Brent, because I am
<br />
doing exactly that - stretching the 'common meanings' of
<br />
this and several other concepts.  Not to take them beyond
<br />
'recognition', but definitely beyond the conventional.
<br />
Because the conventional notions are narrow and too
<br />
presumptive (by familiarity, and unexplored assumptions).
<br />
<br />When you mentioned MWI and 'randomness', my first thought
<br />
was of Andre Linde and alternative universes defined not
<br />
as variables of -this universe- but as alternatives of
<br />
the universal constants - where different values of force
<br />
and field strength and assignment - vary. Eg, where the
<br />
fine structure constant is not (approx) 1/137, but maybe
<br />
1/143.9.  
<br />
<br />Even those 'possible universes' would be functionally-pinned
<br />
to certain values and not others.  Where again - the value-states
<br />
would be the 'primal memory' of -that- specific universe.
<br />
<br />Actions that happen 'because of' or 'conditional on' some
<br />
temporally &quot;previous&quot; information (aka 'instructions', guide
<br />
data, etc) are what you seem to associate as 'memory driven'
<br />
behaviors.  Where we have a current notion of 'stable, recallable
<br />
information', and by experience that kind of information seems
<br />
to be N (data) that is 'stored and later accessible' when/as
<br />
needed.  So with that kind of -general notion- I began to think
<br />
about 'general conditions' and where functional instructive
<br />
information -could- be held for -any system's- general draw.
<br />
<br />Memory as resource.   Well, it just seems to make sense to
<br />
first look at relationships that fill that definition, not
<br />
the mechanisms we are aware of that match the relationship.
<br />
<br />&quot;Memory&quot; of 'how' to perform.  Irrespective and indifferent to
<br />
'mechanisms'.  Whether it provides 'choice' or not &quot;to&quot; perform.
<br />
<br />The universal constants and similar invariant relations-of-systems
<br />
must be includable as a form-of-&quot;memory&quot;.
<br />
<br />Which in the long run is much much better for our intuitive
<br />
notions of existence, life and being.  Life for example, may
<br />
be a special existential state, but its a lot more spectrally
<br />
consistent to think of sentience being wholly present, but in 
<br />
precursive primary forms, and then in refined, improved capacity
<br />
forms later on, than to say that this massively important 
<br />
quality flat-out has no familially related qualia, and then
<br />
suddenly does.
<br />
<br />We already see other aspects that show the spectral notion
<br />
to exist.  For example there are power laws and wave function 
<br />
-laws- that are seen in the QM realm and macro/complex systems
<br />
- like animal speciation/ditribution studies; relation for relation.
<br />
Even though the 'qualia' that display the rules, laws and relations
<br />
are quite quite different.  Where there is more going on than
<br />
scaling differences to account for those mappings.
<br />
<br />The example I use often is the QM &quot;defined&quot; electron 'shells'
<br />
of atoms.  The interesting thing about them - especially the 
<br />
valence group - is that electrons of the approprotiate energies
<br />
can fill or vacate those QM regions.  No big thing, you might
<br />
remark.  Very calculable. Great for building molecules we 
<br />
might want; understanding physics event and chemistry.
<br />
<br />Right.  But there's more.
<br />
<br />A qualia currently not defined.
<br />
<br />And it goes like this:  certain respiring animals
<br />
use materially identifiable organs called 'lungs',
<br />
to capture gas and release gas.  They take certain
<br />
energy/configuration molecules and exude other 
<br />
energy/configuration molecules. Plants are complementary
<br />
and do the opposite exchange.
<br />
<br />But both kinds of organisms 'breath' in some fashion,
<br />
through some 'physical' organs or organelles.
<br />
<br />So lets look at valence shells of electron.  There
<br />
is no cognition or 'intentional' or survival-related
<br />
necessity to hold/release electrons.  An atom or molecule
<br />
won't 'cease to exist' if the activity of filling/emptying
<br />
valence states of an electron doesn't take place (as part
<br />
of some larger/extended metabolic sequence of electron
<br />
transferring) - but - a living organism -would- die if
<br />
atoms didn't functionally 'breathe'.
<br />
<br />The valence shells of atoms are their defacto 'functional'
<br />
&quot;lungs&quot; even if they don't exist in/as a 'physical'
<br />
manifestation of -material- operant organelle.
<br />
<br />I am NOT imposing a biology model on to physics.
<br />
I AM citing that primitive precursive BEHAVIOR
<br />
CAPACITIES exist from the outset of existential
<br />
living system - within the formative first
<br />
systems of organization that the universe
<br />
exists as.
<br />
<br />If we intuit that the whole of existence is
<br />
a unitary (witness the strong belief in a
<br />
unified field theory or a TOE) then rationality
<br />
informs us to look for performance connections
<br />
from scale to scale of organization - as per
<br />
Colin's post recently.
<br />
<br />Current paradigms can't bridge the gap between
<br />
non-living and living.  Mainly because the better
<br />
categorizing is Pre-animate vs Animate.
