<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I know some people on this list have attempted world-building 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with OMs, but my starting point is the less ambitious idea that

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness can in principle extend across time and space 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; without being specially linked. If a person's stream of consciousness 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; were chopped up into seconds, minutes, days or whatever, using 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whatever vehicle it takes to run a human mind, and these moments 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of consciousness randomly dispersed throughout the multiverse, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they would all connect up by virtue of their information content. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Do you disagree that it would in principle be possible?
</em><br />
<br />So if I understand you right, this is where the difference between
<br />
a book and a person arises. When a book's letters are scattered over
<br />
the cosmos, the information is lost, but when the observer moments
<br />
are so scattered, the subjective experience still remains.
<br />
<br />Now we suppose from quantum mechanics that the Bekenstein bound
<br />
on the number of states a human can be in is less than 10^10^45.
<br />
(Tipler, 1993, &quot;The Physics of Immortality&quot;.) So each state of
<br />
your life is a very special small subset of all those states.
<br />
Let's do something special with just *one* life that you've
<br />
led (will lead) in the universe, one life, that is, in a particular
<br />
spacetime.
<br />
<br />I propose to take something quite a bit like observer-moments and
<br />
ask some questions about it. Suppose that an exact frozen replica
<br />
of your brain is made corresponding to each 10^-42 seconds of your
<br />
life. This gives us about 10^42 * 10^7 * 70years, or about 10^50
<br />
states (a far cry from all those possible for humans, 10^10^45).
<br />
<br />We place those 10^50 states in a long row, and then, for an audience,
<br />
we round up all the billions of observers in the visible universe
<br />
to watch the show. First the spotlight is on your brain the second
<br />
after you were born. Then one 10^-42 seconds later the spotlight
<br />
moves to the next frozen brain, and so forth. 
<br />
<br />The audience is placed in the same frame of reference as the moving
<br />
light, and so they see an apparently continuous evolution of your
<br />
brain.
<br />
<br />How is this any different from what happened to you actually? From
<br />
an external scientific point of view, it seems remarkably identical.
<br />
(I am ultimately to claim that something essential---but not 
<br />
&quot;consciousness&quot; or anything like that is missing, but rather
<br />
*causality* is missing.)
<br />
<br />I suppose that you would assert that a first person experience was
<br />
attached to this performance, a performance moving against a background
<br />
of stars as the stage. Is that correct? 
<br />
<br /><br />Next we begin a process of deconstruction.  First, on one century's
<br />
performance, there is trouble with the spotlight, and it's very dim
<br />
although the audience can still see the show. But a few performances
<br />
(centuries) later, the spotlight goes out altogether. Still, the
<br />
audience knows from the notes passed out exactly what is happening.
<br />
On another night, the audience fails to show up. Do these things
<br />
really affect whether or not a first person experience attends the
<br />
brain?
<br />
<br />In other performances, the spotlight dances all around, from a
<br />
trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a hundred trillionth
<br />
of a second (about 10^-50 seconds) from your brain in midlife to
<br />
your brain as an adolescent, then to your brain as a young adult,
<br />
then to the geezer Stathis brain, and so on, completely wrecking
<br />
the order. Now from what you wrote above about  
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; it takes to run a human mind, and these moments 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of consciousness randomly dispersed throughout the multiverse, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they would all connect up by virtue of their information content. 
</em><br />
<br />one might surmise that you believe that the order that these frozen
<br />
brains appear is irrelevant. (I happen to agree---my own view is
<br />
that as soon as there was no longer causality connecting each 
<br />
frozen brain with another brain---that is, that no real computation
<br />
was taking place---the first person experience no longer occurred.)
<br />
<br />But if I have surmised correctly, then you wouldn't care that the
<br />
frozen brains were not only shown sometimes out of sequence, but
<br />
that there did not have to be an audience, nor was the spatial
<br />
relative locations of the brains relevant. They could be jumbled
<br />
all over the cosmos.
<br />
<br />But next, what about the neurons making up the brains?  What would
<br />
be lost if they too were dispersed through time and space? Finally, 
<br />
just when, if any time, would anything be lost: what if the neurons
<br />
are themselves separated into atoms and dispersed?
<br />
<br />Well, to me this is the ultimate reductio, because it means that
<br />
among the dust in the vast, vast, vast volumes of the cosmos, each
<br />
of your brain states already exists. (To me this is as absurd as
<br />
some of Hilary Putnam's claims, or Greg Egan's in Permutation City.
<br />
(For the record, Greg Egan made it clear in an interview that he
<br />
does *not* necessarily believe in the notions presented in all his
<br />
books.))
<br />
<br />The only place in all this chain of reasoning where it seems that
<br />
first person experience could be lost is when one state no longer
<br />
followed *causally* from a preceding state, or, in other words
<br />
(in my opinion) when a true computation involving information
<br />
flow no longer occurred.
<br />
<br />Your thoughts?
