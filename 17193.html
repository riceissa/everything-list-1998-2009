<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have some further comments and questions on step 8.
</em><br />
<br />Good.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; In this light
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; it becomes self-evident that any and all explanatory entities -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; physical, computational, or whatever - are severely restricted to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; domain of epistemology.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I don't see why. I would not put arithmetic in epistemology, or only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; in a very large sense of epistemology, the epistemology of the 0-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; person views!. It seems clearer to accept them ontologically like in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the usual practice of math. Could be only a vocabulary problem here.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, I normally wouldn't dispute this point, but but I'm being a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stickler here.  In the strictest sense the ontological equivalence of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anything whatsoever to the indexical OFP can only be an assumption -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; albeit one that might be justifiable in the case of the best theory.
</em><br />
<br />OFP, OFP, ... ?  Ah Ontological First Person.
<br />
Actually in &quot;indexical OFP&quot; I could argue that &quot;indexical and  
<br />
ontological&quot; are just reminders on point where we already agree (and  
<br />
agree with the universal machine discourse, after some definition and  
<br />
theorems ...).
<br />
<br />But with comp, the first person does not necessarily identifies with  
<br />
any representation, like we don't have to identify ourselves with a  
<br />
body, but we can bet on &quot;staying the same person in the sense that I  
<br />
stay the same person after drinking a cup of coffe&quot; (SSPSSSPDCC, if  
<br />
you want :) for some digital body transformation.
<br />
The 1-I, the 1-person, does not need to identify itself to any body,  
<br />
or representation (actually: the 1-person cannot do that, it can  
<br />
identify itself only to itself as a person).
<br />
So the 1-person bet on some 3-person (the body, the code relatively to  
<br />
its most probable universal computation), and on its invariance for  
<br />
some (digital) body transformation.
<br />
Assuming comp, the reasoning leads to make consciousness a larger  
<br />
invariant (and then you have more choice and latitude in the  
<br />
transformation, for example with amnesia, or false souvenirs, etc.).
<br />
<br />But strictly speaking (I am also a stickler), the first person can  
<br />
never identify herself to *any* representation, she share this with  
<br />
the 0-person ONE, or the non differentiate (arithmetical) truth. The  
<br />
knower does not know who he is. Relatively to probable histories, he  
<br />
makes bets &quot;all the time&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Beyond this, that the unique qualitative nature of the OFP *is* as it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appears, is in principle outside the scope of explanation itself.
</em><br />
<br />No! This is the &quot;miracle&quot; of comp. Machine cannot not discover the  
<br />
incommunicable part of their experience, but they can, assume of bet  
<br />
on comp, and justify that why it has to be so. That is AUDA. The gap  
<br />
is justified from inside. It is a consequence from the fact that  
<br />
machine can prove their own incompleteness theorems, and even study  
<br />
the geometry of their ignorance. The ultimate gap remains unavoidable,  
<br />
so you are right saying that the unique qualitative nature of the OFP  
<br />
is outside the scope of the explanation, but that fact, is an &quot;easy&quot;  
<br />
theorem on and by  the machine which introspect herself.
<br />
<br />To sum up:
<br />
The unique qualitative nature of the OFP *is* beyond the scope of the  
<br />
explanation-comp theory. But that very fact *is* in the scope of the  
<br />
theory.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;  IOW - as Bruno says above - they are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; theoretical constructions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Yes, but this does not mean those construction does not refer to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; something real independently of us, and this is what I assume for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; comp
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree, as above that it is the whole point of our endeavours to say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the construction *refers* to something real.  But I think perhaps
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the something thus referenced is not best characterised as being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; real *independently* of us, but rather *constitutive* of us and our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (most general) environment.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I agree with you, but this can be said among enlightened people who  
<br />
understand the whole stuff.
<br />
Before the reasoning, you could be suspected to put the horse behind  
<br />
the car.
<br />
With comp, numbers, or finite things like combinators etc. have  
<br />
clearly a relation with us, but a priori it is simpler to state their  
<br />
laws without referring to us.
<br />
A number is even if and only its square is even. This is a law about  
<br />
numbers. Those are the type of truth which we have to state as not  
<br />
depending on us &lt;here and now&gt;, even if it depends on us, or are us,   
<br />
&quot;there&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Even if the whole existence get annihilated, 17 would still be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; prime.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I understand that it is justifiable to take this as your point of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; departure and don't really wish to make an argumentative point out of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it.  Nonetheless, in passing, perhaps I have a more radical intuition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of annihilation than you.  One can waste a lot of breath speculating
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on 'nothing' because, strictly I guess, there can be nothing at all it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can refer to.
</em><br />
<br />This I do not understand. There are many nothing everywhere, and other  
<br />
absence, and I am open that absolute nothingness could be conceivable,  
<br />
a bit like theories having no models. It seems you just point here on  
<br />
a difficult open question.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I could demonstrate this, given infinite time, simply
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by flatly rejecting *any* survivor of such annihilation that you or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anyone cared to propose, to the crack of doom.  On this basis, even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; '17 is prime' is a goner.
</em><br />
<br />I still don't see why or how you could do that, except by convincing  
<br />
me that Peano Arithmetic is inconsistent.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; So far so obvious.  But - as has again been recognised  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; immemorially -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; solipsism is a dead-end and hence we seek a theory to capture the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; relation between the OFP and its environment.  But immediately we  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; faced with the notorious 'explanatory gap', and it seems to me that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; its most precise expression is in the gap between ontology and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; epistemology.  Indeed, what conceivable strategy could raise these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; theoretical constructions - to which the OFP uniquely lends  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; existence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; - to the ontological certainty of their host?  Is there a coherent  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; to conceive what it could mean to *be* a theoretical entity (as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; opposed to postulating or observing one)?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It is the point of saying &quot;yes&quot; to the doctor. You don't say yes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; because the new brain is a good modelisation of your brain, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; because you bet it will enact yourself completely, relatively to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; neighborhood.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes indeed, this is my point.  There is no way to *conceive* in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; advance what it would mean to *be* such an enactment (i.e. to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *sure*) so you can only bet that saying yes will not affect the state
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the indexical OFP.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, thanks to the &quot;(i.e. to be *sure*). Yes. Of course we can  
<br />
conceive in advance what it could mean to be such an enactement. It  
<br />
would be like me or you but with souvenirs of going to the digital  
<br />
hospital and coming back, or like using teleportation, and  
<br />
communicating themselves at the speed of light in the neighborhood,  
<br />
like those very words.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; You may confuse the reality of number, and the reality of machine/
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; theories talking about those numbers. Numbers are not viewed as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; theoretical construction. The theoretical construction are our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; theories on the numbers. It simplifies things.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree that this assumption simplifies things, and as you say it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one shared by all mathematicians.  But again, in the final analysis,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; numbers can only be 'viewed' as ontologically real, not *known* to be.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But this is true of any assumption whatever, and I freely concede
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your points about the simplicity of the assumptions in the case of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comp.
</em><br />
<br />Ah :)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; All theories demands faith, but the faith needed for understanding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that 17 is prime is not comparable to the act of faith needed to say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; yes to the doctor.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Agreed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;  It's no use appealing to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; notions of 'what it's like to be a brain' - nor what it's like to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; be a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; COMP-quale - because we can never say that it is 'like anything to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; be'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; the stuff of epistemology.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Assuming comp we can still say that it is like you feel right now.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Only zombie cannot understand, but if they are good zombie, they will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; have no problem to fake that they understand.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, *assuming* comp.  We cannot *know* what it is like to be a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comp-quale, but we may have sufficient faith to bet that it's like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'what you feel right now'.
</em><br />
<br />Yes. Actually this is even a problem for real practitioners of comp,  
<br />
they may come to believe they know that comp is true, and then they  
<br />
will be inconsistent. Comp entails the existence of sort of possible  
<br />
future &quot;delusion&quot;, it may already be a way to keep alive the past  
<br />
delusion. There is a sort of paradox here a machine clever enough to  
<br />
understand or bet on an artificial brain can understand the artificial  
<br />
brain is not needed. The problem is that you don't need to understand  
<br />
the implication of saying &quot;yes doctor&quot; for saying &quot;yes&quot; to the doctor.  
<br />
A common problem with technologies, already related to their  
<br />
duplicabilities.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Hence we must see our theorising and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; observing - in physical, computational, or whatever terms - *in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; relation* to ontological certainty, not as constitutive of it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; That's right.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hooray!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I thought this was obvious.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You may have heard the following story.  A professor of mathematics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; enters the lecture room with a sheaf of papers and writes a complex
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theorem on the blackboard.  He turns to the students and says &quot;ladies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and gentlemen, this of course is obvious&quot;.  He then shuffles his
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; papers, looks at the board again and continues more doubtfully &quot;at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; least, I think it is obvious&quot;.  Then he stares fixedly at the board
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for ten minutes without speaking, looking increasingly uncomfortable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Finally, he rubs out the theorem and leaves the room.  The students
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are nonplussed, but remain in their seats.  Thirty minutes later, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; professor re-enters the room, looking disheveled but happy.  He writes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exactly the same theorem on the blackboard with a flourish, turns to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; his audience and announces triumphantly &quot;ladies and gentlemen, I was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; right - it IS obvious!&quot;
</em><br />
<br />I guess it was obvious, but not obviously obvious :)
<br />
Yes in math there is the obvious (that nobody understand)
<br />
Then there is what is obviously obvious (for those who still does not  
<br />
understand).
<br />
And so forth.
<br />
Normally &quot;obvious&quot; means, assuming a non sadistic teacher:
<br />
- it follows in one step from the definition or from the last theorem.
<br />
Making it a very relative notion.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Rather, they stand in some theoretical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; relation to RITSIAR, but strictly on the epistemological side of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; explanatory gap.  They are 'real as far as theory takes us', or if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; further jargon is unavoidable: RAFATTU.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Well frankly this will depend of the first &quot;T&quot; of RAFATTU. It depends
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of the theory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; With the comp theory, quarks, electrons, planet and galaxies are not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ontologically real.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; With string theory, they may be real.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, real in the relative sense we have been discussing.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK. And number are real in that sense, too.
<br />
Usually, even physicists, have less doubt about the existence of even  
<br />
numbers than on the standard modal of elementary particles.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; My argument against the *physical* instantiation of a computational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; mind (i.e. in any non-eliminative sense) rests on the claim that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; very arbitrariness of possible physical instantiations of a given
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; computation (cf Hofstadter) violates the criterion of direct
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; supervention on *specific* physical entities and relations from  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; a class of emergent phenomena inherits physical - as opposed to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; merely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; mental (and hence egregiously question-begging) - stability.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I think that this what the movie graph argument makes necessary.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Good, I'm glad we agree.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Naturally, all this is per physics as ordinarily understood.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Tolerating such a violation is tantamount to accepting (and this is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; notoriously claimed by Hofstadter et al) that *any* arbitrarily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; assembled set of physical entities deemed to be in the required
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; 'functional' relation (e.g. - famously - in an anthill) necessarily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; stabilises exactly the same 'mental state'.  AFAICS this is by  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; itself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; quite sufficient to reveal such a 'mind' as intrinsically  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; unphysical -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; and a fortiori un-RITSIAR.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Hmm... things are more subtle, but in a first approximation this can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; be useful.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Remember, I mean 'unphysical' in terms of standard physical theory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; By un-RITSIAR, in this instance, I mean that in these strictly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical terms (i.e. without comp) such a mind doesn't even exist -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hence 'a fortiori'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; My argument assumes, however, that - per physicalism - a running
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; computation (as opposed to its specification)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It is important to distinguish a program (immaterial static object)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and a computation (an immaterial &quot;dynamic&quot; object, which can be  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; finite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; or infinite, but is best handled when accepting it is infinite,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; because in that case a dynamic can be defined by a function from N to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; anything: it is a sequence of things). If not, people get troubled by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the existence of running computation in platonia/arithmetical truth.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ah, but my argument attempts to distinguish a computation (immaterial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dynamic object) and an implementation of a computation (material
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dynamic process) - again, per standard physical theory - as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; refutation of standard comp *in these strictly physical terms*.  My
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point is, that per physicalism, a computation must be implemented in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some physical mechanism in order to have any real - i.e. physical -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; effects (at least this was true the last time I did any programming).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hence the existence of 'immaterial objects' in this case is simply
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; irrelevant to any effects that would be strictly justifiable as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ontologically real, per physicalism.
</em><br />
<br />Actually I do disagree with this, and Peter Jones made good point  
<br />
here. If you were true, UDA could be simplified a lot. Physicalism  
<br />
does not prevent dualism form/matter at all, like immaterial software  
<br />
and physical hardware. Physicalism can still explained the existence  
<br />
of the many immaterial being like nations, countries, persons (being  
<br />
fuzzy on the 1-3 distinction), games, music, etc.
<br />
But comp, pushed on its logical conclusion prevent physicalism to  
<br />
explain the 1-person stable observations. We have to explain the  
<br />
appearances of all observables protagonists from the relation between  
<br />
numbers. There is a problem of vocabulary deciding if matter disappear  
<br />
or not. It is easier to say that physicalism is shown inconsistent or  
<br />
epistemologically empty. But this is not an entirely trivial  
<br />
proposition to demonstrate; it is full of traps, and without QM, nor  
<br />
Post or Turing, I would never have believed this, nor find the  
<br />
argument. UDA needs the universal machine concept.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Consequently, I agree that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reversal of ontological primacy you stipulate is necessary to save
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comp.
</em><br />
<br />Comp doesn't let much choice: like biology got an evolutionary aspect,  
<br />
physics got an evolutionary aspect in logic and arithmetic. Comp just  
<br />
show that things are far more complex than physicalist, or even some  
<br />
mathematicalist, tend to think.
<br />
Comp provides a relatively easy theory of mind (computer science, self- 
<br />
reference logics and their intensional nuances) but present a big  
<br />
problem : extracting the qubits from a relative dreaming property of  
<br />
numbers.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Your argument however seems to be based not on the physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implementation but the 'immaterial' computation to which it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; postulated - per standard comp - to be equivalent.  Is this right?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (More on this below.)
</em><br />
<br />This is unclear. UDA1-7 can be based on the physical implementation of  
<br />
the devices presented in the protocol of the thought experiment. UDA-8  
<br />
eliminates that assumption.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; necessarily requires
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; *some* physical activity to transform inputs to outputs (e.g. in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; terms
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; of logic gates).  Step 8, however, seems to take a step beyond  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; this by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; proposing that a running computation can take the form of (as  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; opposed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; to merely being described by) a machine *state*: i.e. without the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; requirement of activity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; No, activity is required. But activity is just a function from N to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; set of states. The movie graph show that a machine cannot distinguish
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; physical activity from such an arithmetical activity. A computation  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; an infinite set of numbers such that there is a universal number
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; generating that sequence.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; When you say that &quot;activity is just a function from N to set of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; states&quot;, you again seem to refer to 'immaterial activity'.  It seems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to me that what you are saying amounts to this:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If it is the case that, per comp, it is the 'immaterial' activity of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the running program, regardless of specific implementation,
</em><br />
<br />Careful: the mind needs specific implementations, but below its  
<br />
substitution level, all implementations acts simultaneously, from its  
<br />
perspective (in case it decides to take a look below its level, he  
<br />
should see this).
<br />
<br />Once the reversal is done the word &quot;physical&quot; is reduced to something  
<br />
very specific, which includes a (perhaps to high) first person  
<br />
indeterminacy.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implements the function and hence the mind, then this is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indistinguishable by the machine from it simply *being* the function
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and hence the mind.
</em><br />
<br />The mind (the 1-mind, not the numbers) is distributed in the set of  
<br />
all computations, you cannot really attach it in any single  
<br />
computation, unless you have reasons to think it is correlated to your  
<br />
own histories. Remember that at UDA-8 we abandon the physical  
<br />
supervenience for a comp supervenience, which is hard to describe  
<br />
without the minimum amount of math I was talking about.
<br />
I may insist that the 1-person, nor its consciousness, is never  
<br />
attached to any thing which can be represented. Only its third person  
<br />
vehicles are, and the person can make relative and local bets on those  
<br />
vehices and their relative stabilities.
<br />
<br />This is recover and made consistent by the nuance between the prover  
<br />
Bp and the knower Bp &amp; p (and the feeler, Bp &amp; p &amp; Dt); which by  
<br />
construction are the same, yet they cannot know that.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Standard comp is then seen to refute - or at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; least make irrelevant - its own basis in materiality.  Is this right?
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;comp + physicalism is either contradictory or epistemologically  
<br />
empty (person eliminativist).
<br />
<br />The proof is constructive. It gives the place where you can studied  
<br />
where the appearance of physics come from.
<br />
This will provide jobs for mathematicians of the next millenia.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; And in any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; case, in what way is step 08 intended to extend intuition beyond my  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; argument, which - as I have tried to show - also elicits the insight
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; that the direct supervention of 'functional' relations on functions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; themselves - not on their arbitrarily-defined physical tokens - is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; central to the recovery of 'mind' from computation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; See above.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Have I succeeded in answering my own question?
</em><br />
<br /><br />I let you judge.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The discovery of the universal machine is the creative bomb which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; makes comp possible and plausible. Universal machine, like computers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and brains, are not trivial mathematical object at all. To study comp
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; without computer science, is like doing cosmology without QM and GR.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Of course we can have the deepest intuition right, by experience, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to make a sharble verifiable theory, I am afraid we cannot dismiss
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; some math ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Vous avez raison cher maitre, j'en suis sur.
</em><br />
<br />You mean &quot;Vous avez raison cher maître, j'en suis sûr.&quot;
<br />
Stickler in French is &quot;pointilleux&quot;, which means literaly asking for  
<br />
the correct accents!
<br />
<br />I cannot wait for your questions on step 8 :)
