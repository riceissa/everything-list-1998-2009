Hi,
<br />
<br />STATHIS
<br />
Your argument that only consciousness can give rise to technology loses
<br />
validity if you include &quot;must be produced by a conscious being&quot; as part of
<br />
the definition of technology.
<br />
<br />COLIN
<br />
There's obvious circularity in the above sentence and it is the same old
<br />
circularity that endlessly haunts discussions like this (see the dialog
<br />
with Russel).
<br />
<br />In dealing with the thread....
<br />
<br />Re: How would a computer know if it were conscious?
<br />
<br />....my proposition was that successful _novel_ technology....
<br />
<br />i.e. a entity comprised of matter with a function not previously observed
<br />
and that resulted from new - as in hitherto unknown - knowledge of the
<br />
natural world
<br />
<br />.... can only result when sourced through agency inclusive of a phenomenal
<br />
consciousness (specifically and currently only that that aspect of human
<br />
brain function I have called 'cortical qualia'). Without the qualia,
<br />
generated based on literal connection with the world outside the agent,
<br />
the novelty upon which the new knowledge was based would be invisible.
<br />
<br />My proposition was that if the machine can do the science on exquisite
<br />
novelty that subsequantly is in the causal ancestry of novel technology
<br />
then that machine must include phenomenal scenes (qualia) that depict the
<br />
external world.
<br />
<br />Scientists and science are the way to objectively attain an objective
<br />
scientific position on subjective experience - that is just as valid as
<br />
any other scientific position AND that a machine could judge itself by. If
<br />
the machine is willing to bet its existence on the novel technology's
<br />
ability to function when the machine is not there doing what it thinks is
<br />
'observing it'... and it survives - then it can call itself conscious.
<br />
Humans do that.
<br />
<br />But the machines have another option. They can physically battle it out
<br />
against humans. The humans will blitz machines without phenomenal scenes
<br />
every time and the machines without them won't even know it because they
<br />
never knew they were in a fight to start with. They wouldn't be able to
<br />
test a hypothesis that they were even in a fight.
<br />
<br />and then this looks all circular again doesn't it?....this circularity is
<br />
the predictable result....see below...
<br />
<br /><br />STATHIS
<br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, why does your eye generate visual qualia and not your big toe?
</em><br />
It's because the big toe lacks the necessary machinery.
<br />
<br />COLIN
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I am afraid you have your physiology mixed up. The eye does NOT
</em><br />
generate visual qualia. Your visual cortex  generates it based on
<br />
measurements in the eye. The qualia are manufactured and simultaneously
<br />
projected to appear to come from the eye (actually somewhere medial to
<br />
them). It's how you have 90degrees++ peripheral vison. The same visual
<br />
qualia can be generated without an eye (hallucination/dream). Some blind
<br />
(no functioning retina) people have a visual field for numbers. Other
<br />
cross-modal mixups can occur in synesthesia (you can hear
<br />
colours, taste words). You can have a &quot;phantom big toe&quot; without having any
<br />
big toe at all....just because the cortex is still there making the
<br />
qualia. If you swapped the sensory nerves in two fingers the motor cortex
<br />
would drive finger A and it would feel like finger B moved and you would
<br />
see finger A move. The sensation is in your head, not the periphery. It's
<br />
merely projected at the periphery.
<br />
<br />STATHIS
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Of course all that is true, but it doesn't explain why neurons in the
</em><br />
cortex are the ones giving rise to qualia rather than other neurons or
<br />
indeed peripheral sense organs.
<br />
<br />COLIN
<br />
Was that what you were after?
<br />
<br />hmmm.... firstly..... didactic mode....
<br />
=====================================
<br />
Qualia are not about 'knowledge'. Any old piece of junk can symbolically
<br />
encode knowledge. Qualia, however, optimally serve _learning_ = _change_
<br />
in knowledge but more specifically change in knowledge about the world
<br />
OUTSIDE the agent. Mathematically: If KNOWLEDGE(t) is what we know at time
<br />
t, then qualia give us an optimal (survivable):
<br />
<br />d(knowledge(t))
<br />
-----------
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dt
<br />
<br />where knowledge(t) is all about the world outside the agent. Without
<br />
qualia you have the ultimate in circularity - what you know must be based
<br />
on what you know + sensory signals devoid of qualia and only interpretable
<br />
by your existing knowledge. Sensory signals are not uniquely related to
<br />
the external natural world behaviour (law of electromagnetics
<br />
Laplacian/Possions equation) and are intrinsically devoid of qualia
<br />
(physiological fact). Hence the science of sensory signals (capturing
<br />
regularity in them) is NOT the science of the external natural world in
<br />
any way that exposes novelty in the external natural world= a recipe for
<br />
evolutionary shortlived-ness.
<br />
=========================================
<br />
<br /><br />Now... as to
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Of course all that is true, but it doesn't explain why neurons in the
</em><br />
cortex are the ones giving rise to qualia rather than other neurons or
<br />
indeed peripheral sense organs.
<br />
<br />Your whole concept of explanation is causal of the problem! Objects of the
<br />
sense impressions (contents of consciousness) cannot predict the existence
<br />
of the sense impressions. All the 'cells' etc are objects of sense
<br />
impressions! All description, no explanation. You will never explain them
<br />
that way by definition.
<br />
<br />The only way out of the circularity is to ask yourself  (as I suggested in
<br />
the first post)
<br />
<br />&quot;What kind of universe must I be in/made of would, in the form of observed
<br />
cells and cell behaviour, deliver observation of the kind that reveals
<br />
itself as cells behaving as they do?&quot;
<br />
<br />I hold the huge and exquisitiely structured electromagnetic field in
<br />
normal human cranial excitable cells (neurons and astrocytes)to be
<br />
responsible for qualia. 'The word 'electromagnetic' is just a label for a
<br />
sense artefact. There is no such 'thing' as electromagnetism. There is
<br />
only SOMETHING (stuff) behaving in a an electromagnetic fashion that we
<br />
all agreed is deserved of the label..
<br />
<br />....The trick is to propose all manner of kinds of 'stuff' (nothing to do
<br />
with any'thing' ever proposed by science) in a collection that has an
<br />
intrinsic capacity to deliver observation (the one thing totally
<br />
unexplained by science) and to recognise in that STUFF what the property
<br />
delivering observation actually is. This sounds weird but it's quite
<br />
practical and invaldates no existence science at all. Existing science can
<br />
be used to validate all such propositions for STUFF. It's what I am set
<br />
about to do - make a conscious chip - and prove it is conscious (has
<br />
qualia happeneing in it) - by making it (actually several of them all
<br />
connected to each other) do science and get it right.
<br />
<br />Science hasn't even begun to do this an any structured, explicit
<br />
fashion...which is a shame, for it causes all the circularity.
<br />
<br />So in order to tell you the answer to your question I have to tell you
<br />
what the universe is made of. And the answer consistent with brain
<br />
material's ability to deliver observation is simple: the fluctuation. End
<br />
of story. Except you need a whole pile of them (largely but not perfectly)
<br />
synchronised.
<br />
<br />I can never tell you &quot;it's X,Y,Z contents of consciousness-based
<br />
generalisation&quot; that delivers the contents of consiousness&quot;.
<br />
<br />The circularity (dare I say symmetry!) argument is broken by breaking our
<br />
epistemology into 2 distinct halves, each valid depictions of the natural
<br />
world. One half (a) scientifically says what it is made of and the other
<br />
half (b) scientifically says how it will appear when you are made of it,
<br />
inside it _because_ it is made of (a) stuff.
<br />
<br />I am doing (b). I can't use sense objects like cells and molecules and
<br />
atoms to explain it because it is meaningless to do so. I can tell you
<br />
that the delivery of sense impressions (qualia) is definitely as a result
<br />
of specific bahaviours related to what we observe as neural cell firing,
<br />
but not entirely so. The model also scientifically says why your big toe
<br />
has no qualia and what a rock or a computer (current architectures) does
<br />
not.
<br />
<br />The boundary of the underlying natural world/universe and how it appears
<br />
is literally in brain material. It's the only 'real' we can claim to have.
<br />
Ignoring it as evidence of the underlying universe is just plain dumb.
<br />
Down the track we're all going to say &quot;geeze what WERE we thinking all
<br />
those centuries!!&quot;
<br />
<br />My formula for machine consciousness validation stands as a valid
<br />
scientifically testable proposition.
<br />
<br />The real test will happen within 5 years - a nest of tiny little benchtop
<br />
artificial scientists in the form of chips with a novel architecture -
<br />
that will scientifically demonstrate science to us and therefore be
<br />
justifyably the possessors of qualia. Upon failure of the test the 'STUFF'
<br />
I have chosen must be the wrong STUFF and that will be scientifically
<br />
refuted. In any event real science will be done.
<br />
<br />gotta go.
<br />
<br />cheers
