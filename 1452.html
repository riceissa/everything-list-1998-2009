<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people believe that according to the many-worlds theory of QM, we 
<br />
are immortal.  The basic idea behind this is that when we die our existance 
<br />
ends in that world, but because there exists a nearly identical world in 
<br />
which we don't die, we still experience that world, and therefore never 
<br />
experience death.  However, this idea goes against the many-worlds theory 
<br />
because it implies that each version of us in different worlds is somehow 
<br />
'connected', whereas the MWI implies that no one in any world is 'connected' 
<br />
in any way to anyone else.  What I mean by 'connected' is that two or more 
<br />
concious beings in different worlds are really the same concience, but are 
<br />
unaware of each others' existance simply because the lack of each 
<br />
concience's awareness of the other parts of the whole concience is part of 
<br />
the experience of that concience.  In contrast, the MWI assumes that no 
<br />
worlds are connected in any way, and therefore different conciences in 
<br />
different worlds are not smaller parts of the whole, but rather individual 
<br />
conciences on their own.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So how does any of this actually affect our reality?  The answer is a 
<br />
great deal.  While the MWI allows us to compute probabilities of which world 
<br />
will be ours, the immortal idea of connected conciences does not.  Rather, 
<br />
all you can say is that you will experience both worlds, guaranteed.  For 
<br />
example, with the MWI you can say that world A has a 90% probability of 
<br />
happening and world B has a 10% probability of happening.  But with the 
<br />
connected conciences interpretation (CCI), each world has a 100% probability 
<br />
of happening.  The fact that the probability of both worlds adds up to 
<br />
greater than 100% seems to indicate that the CCI is impossible, but this can 
<br />
be explained by the fact that in the CCI, probability does not exist.  It is 
<br />
actually not correct to give each world a 100% probability because no 
<br />
probability is associated with each world (my previous example was just to 
<br />
give you an idea of what I was talking about).  Rather, all you can say is 
<br />
that you WILL experience every possible world.  If you ask, &quot;Will a white 
<br />
rabbit suddenly start flying throughout the room within the next second?&quot;, 
<br />
the answer will be YES, just as the answer to the question, &quot;Will the 
<br />
universe continue to act just as it should within the next second?&quot; will be 
<br />
YES.  You will experience both of these worlds at the same time, and the 
<br />
only reason it doesn't seem like you are experiencing both of them at the 
<br />
same time is because part of the experience of each concience is the lack of 
<br />
awareness of each other one.  The fact that probability does not exist in 
<br />
this interpretation implies that it does not matter how many more lawless 
<br />
worlds there are than lawful ones; along with the lawless worlds, you will 
<br />
still necessarily experience the lawful one, and within that world (and 
<br />
every other one) it will feel like that is the only world, due to the 
<br />
condition of lack of awareness of the other parts of the whole concience.  
<br />
In a nutshell, that is why our universe is lawful according to the CCI.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could extend the CCI to include ALL conciences in ALL worlds.  This 
<br />
would imply that we are all really one single concience, made up of 
<br />
countless parts, each of which aren't aware of the others' experiences.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only assumption made in this theory is that conciences are connected 
<br />
into one single concience.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me know what you think of this theory.
