<br />I agree.

Remember comp entails that comp is forever undecidable. It

will always need sort of act of faith. (Like most theories).
<br />
I guess you agree that common sense also relates a subjective process 
<br />
(consciousness) to an objective one (a body). Of course it is 
<br />
questionable too.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The only objective-like feature is the ability

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to react &quot;like a human&quot; (Turing test) including counterfactuals.
</em><br />
<br />I agree.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you forbid any question implying a link between subjective and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;objective notions, it follows immediately that zombies can not exist.
</em><br />
<br />By acting on a brain through electric needle we can today provoke
<br />
fear or laugh on people. There are obvious (and objective, statistically
<br />
&nbsp;well established, cf Penfield's book) link between subjective reports and
<br />
'apparently objective brain'. If you forbid any question implying a link 
<br />
between subjective and objective notions, even modest science like
<br />
neurophysiology will not progress.
<br />
You know, by forbidding all questions there is no more problems at all.
<br />
Are you telling us that the 'consciousness problem' is a false problem ?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Concerning Olympia, my suggestion is the following : as consciousness is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;subjective notion, there is no clear-cut between conscious and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;non-conscious systems.
</em><br />
<br />I hope you mean there is no OBJECTIVE clear-cut between conscious and
<br />
non-conscious systems.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From the point of view of the conscious system there is an important
</em><br />
SUBJECTIVE clear-cut between being conscious or not.
<br />
If you are conscious it is ethically wrong for people to bury yourself,
<br />
for exemple.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The amount of consciousness we recognize to a system
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;will depend on the number of counterfactuals it can properly handle (much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;like someone drunk will not react properly to normal inputs). So the amount
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of consciousness we recognize in Olympia depends on what she is able to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;handle, with or without Karas.
</em><br />
<br />Without the Klaras, Olympia cannot handle anything. With the Klaras, 
<br />
Olympia
<br />
can handle things like you and me (abstraction made of her body handicap).
<br />
And I agree with you, our attribution of consciousness depends of her
<br />
ability to manage counterfactuals.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The key point (and the flaw in the paradox) is that replay experiments are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;NOT well-suited to test consciousness, unlike the tests of a software ! If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I say something to you, and you answer me, you will probably not answer the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;same if I ask again the same question.
</em><br />
<br />This is unfair ! In our thought experiment we ask the same question after
<br />
a resetting of the machine. That is possible because we use comp (if only 
<br />
to
<br />
refute comp, I mean comp is part of the argument, remember that Maudlin's 
<br />
goal is to refute comp). 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The fact that a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;system replays the same output with the same input is rather a proof of NON
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;thinking (actually that is exactly for this reason that we consider usually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;our computers as non-thinking).
</em><br />
<br />... from a non-computationalist point of view.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Consciousness implies the absence of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;preprogrammed output to be compared with. So from the beginning you cannot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;deduce that Olympia is conscious from the fact that she (it) reproduced a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;precomputed output.
</em><br />
<br />... from a non-computationalist point of view. Or maybe should I include
<br />
here some Mallah's physical computationalist point of view ?
<br />
<br />This could be interesting but I am waiting for his physical criteria for
<br />
well-implemented computations. Clearly the correct handling of 
<br />
counterfactuals
<br />
is not sufficient, because it leads to Maudlin's trap.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;You could consider that Olympia with Karas is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;conscious, but in fact Karas is but not Olympia.
</em><br />
<br />Are you not making  Searle's error in the chineese room where he 
<br />
attributed
<br />
consciousness to the executor and not the executed. (cf Mind's I).
<br />
Look at the (system-) reply given by Hofstadter and Dennett.
<br />
But why suddenly do you attribute subjective consciousness to objectives
<br />
Klaras. And why the Klaras,  when we are speaking to Olympia ?
<br />
Maybe you will convince my brain, but not me :-)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Olympia is like a computer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that I would have programmed to answer selectively some advertising
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;messages that I am bored to read, with a preselected answer, and without me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;knowing that I ever received them. If I were reading them, I would of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;course have answered the same thing, but nevertheless we would not consider
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that my computer is conscious. And of course my computer with my dead
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;corpse is not able to answer anything else that the programmed mails.
</em><br />
<br />Are you not making the 'Ada Lovelace' error. A computer cannot think
<br />
because it does only what we tell him to do. (see Turing article in 
<br />
Mind'I for a good reply).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;That's completely linked to a previous argument that I proposed to exclude
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the duplication of really conscious systems, since consciousness implies a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;self-representation in space-time.
</em><br />
<br />It is clearly linked to your non-computationalist prejudice. I think.
