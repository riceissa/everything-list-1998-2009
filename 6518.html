Dear Bruno,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for your showng of &quot;necessity&quot; of a 1st personviewpoint , I still do 
<br />
not understand your argument and that is a failure on my part. ;-) As to 
<br />
Pratt's ideas, let me quote directly from one of his papers:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://boole.stanford.edu/pub/ratmech.pdf">http://boole.stanford.edu/pub/ratmech.pdf</a>
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Some of the questions however remain philosophically challenging even 
<br />
today. A central tenet of Cartesianism is mind-body dualism, the principle 
<br />
that mind and body are the two basic substances of which reality is 
<br />
constituted. Each can exist separately, body as realized in inanimate 
<br />
objects and lower forms of life, mind as realized in abstract concepts and 
<br />
mathematical certainties. According to Descartes the two come together only 
<br />
in humans, where they undergo causal interaction, the mind reflecting on 
<br />
sensory perceptions while orchestrating the physical motions of the limbs 
<br />
and other organs of the body.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crucial problem for the causal interaction theory of mind and body 
<br />
was its mechanism: how did it work?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Descartes hypothesized the pineal gland, near the center of the brain, 
<br />
as the seat of causal interaction. The objection was raised that the mental 
<br />
and physical planes were of such a fundamentally dissimilar character as to 
<br />
preclude any ordinary notion of causal interaction. But the part about a 
<br />
separate yet joint reality of mind and body seemed less objectionable, and 
<br />
various commentators offered their own explanations for the undeniably 
<br />
strong correlations of mental and physical phenomena.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malebranche insisted that these were only correlations and not true 
<br />
interactions, whose appearance of interaction was arranged in every detail 
<br />
by God by divine intervention on every occasion of correlation, a theory 
<br />
that naturally enough came to be called occasionalism. Spinoza freed God 
<br />
from this demanding schedule by organizing the parallel behavior of mind and 
<br />
matter as a preordained apartheid emanating from God as the source of 
<br />
everything. Leibniz postulated monads, cosmic chronometers miraculously 
<br />
keeping perfect time with each other yet not interacting.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These patently untestable answers only served to give dualism a bad 
<br />
name, and it gave way in due course to one or another form of monism: either 
<br />
mind or matter but not both as distinct real substances. Berkeley opined 
<br />
that matter did not exist and that the universe consisted solely of ideas. 
<br />
Hobbes ventured the opposite: mind did not exist except as an artifact of 
<br />
matter. Russell [Rus27] embraced neutral monism, which reconciled Berkeley's 
<br />
and Hobbes' viewpoints as compatible dual accounts of a common neutral 
<br />
Leibnizian monad.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This much of the history of mind-body dualism will suffice as a 
<br />
convenient point of reference for the sequel. R. Watson's Britannica article 
<br />
[Wat86] is a conveniently accessible starting point for further reading. The 
<br />
thesis of this paper is that mind-body dualism can be made to work via a 
<br />
theory that we greatly prefer to its monist competitors. Reflecting an era 
<br />
of reduced expectations for the superiority of humans, we have implemented 
<br />
causal interaction not with the pineal gland but with machinery freely 
<br />
available to all classical entities, whether newt, pet rock, electron, or 
<br />
theorem (but not quantum mechanical wavefunction, which is sibling to if not 
<br />
an actual instance of our machinery).&quot;
<br />
<br />and
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We have advanced a mechanism for the causal interaction of mind and 
<br />
body, and argued that separate additional mechanisms for body-body and 
<br />
mind-mind interaction can be dispensed with; mind-body interaction is all 
<br />
that is needed. This is a very different outcome from that contemplated by 
<br />
17th century Cartesianists, who took body-body and mind-mind interaction as 
<br />
given and who could find no satisfactory passage from these to mind-body 
<br />
interaction. Even had they found a technically plausible solution to their 
<br />
puzzle, mind-body interaction would presumably still have been regarded as 
<br />
secondary to body-body interaction. We have reversed that priority.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One might not expect mind-body duality as a mere philosophical problem 
<br />
to address any urgent need outside of philosophy. Nevertheless we have 
<br />
offered solutions to the following practical problems that could be 
<br />
construed as particular applications of our general solution to Descartes' 
<br />
mind-body problem, broadly construed to allow scarecrows and everything else 
<br />
to have minds.&quot;
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are his own words!
<br />

<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;    Two points: I am pointing out that the &quot;non-interactional&quot; idea of

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;necessity&quot; of 1st person viewpoints.
</em><br />
<br />You know that the &quot;necessity&quot; of 1st person viewpoints is what I
<br />
consider the most easily explained (through the translation of the
<br />
Theaetetus in arithmetic or in any language of a lobian machine).
<br />
You refer to paper as hard and technical as my thesis. You should
<br />
explain why you still believe the 1 person is dismissed in comp or any
<br />
monism.
<br />
Also, Pratt seems to me monist, and its mathematical dualism does not
<br />
address the main question in philosphy of mind/cognitive science. Its
<br />
paper is interesting but could hardly be refer as an authority on those
<br />
question at this stage.
