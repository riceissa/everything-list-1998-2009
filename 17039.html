<br />
Thanks to everyone who responded to my initial sally on dreams and
<br />
machines.  Naturally I have arrogated the right to plagiarise your
<br />
helpful comments in what follows, which is an aphoristic synthesis of
<br />
my understanding of the main points that have emerged thus far.  I
<br />
hope this will be helpful for future discussion.
<br />
<br />THE APHORISMS
<br />
<br />We do not see the mind, we see *through* the mind.
<br />
<br />What we see through the mind - its contents - is mind-stuff: dreams.
<br />
<br />Hence dream content - i.e. whatever is capable of being present to us
<br />
- can't be our ontology - this would be circular (the eye can't see
<br />
itself).
<br />
<br />So the brain (i.e. what the eye can see) can't be the mind; but the
<br />
intuition remains that mind and brain might be correlated by some
<br />
inclusive conception that would constitute our ontology: Kant's great
<br />
insight stands.
<br />
<br />It is similarly obvious that 'identity' theories and the like are
<br />
non-sense: it would indeed be hard to think of two descriptions less
<br />
'identical' than brain-descriptions and mind-descriptions: hence
<br />
again, any such identification could only be via some singular
<br />
correlative synthesis.
<br />
<br />Hence any claim that the mind is literally identical with, or
<br />
'inside', the brain can be shown to be false by the simple - if messy
<br />
- expedient of a scalpel; or else can be unmasked as implicitly
<br />
dualistic: i.e. the claim is really that 'inside' and 'outside' are
<br />
not merely different descriptions, but different ontologies.
<br />
<br />By extension of our individual introspecting, a plurality of minds,
<br />
and the 'external world' that includes brains, can be conceived as
<br />
correlated in some way - to be elucidated - in a universal synthesis
<br />
or context: that context being our mutual ontology.
<br />
<br />Such a universal context, or in common terms 'what exists', cannot be
<br />
fully known (i.e. can't be exhausted by description) although - or
<br />
rather because - it constitutes what we are, and by extension what
<br />
*everything* is.
<br />
<br />Nonetheless we may seek a logic of dreaming so far as it goes, and
<br />
this will indeed be as far as anything goes in the way of knowledge
<br />
claims.
<br />
<br />Mathematics may be deployed as a dream-logic: but mathematical
<br />
physics, restricted to 'physical heuristics', prototypically gets
<br />
stuck at the level of describing the content and behaviour of dreams,
<br />
not their genesis.
<br />
<br />To go further and deeper we need an explicit mathematical
<br />
specification of dreamers and their dreams, and of generative
<br />
mechanisms by which dreamers and their dream contents can be
<br />
constructed.
<br />
<br />Such a schema will by its nature form an analysis of how we come to
<br />
believe that we and our world are real, and in what terms: i.e. how we
<br />
come to know a world in a present and personal manner.
<br />
<br />Consequently such a schema must subsume within its universe of
<br />
discourse: being, knowing, perceiving, acting and intending - as the
<br />
foundations of what it means to be real: i.e. it must be capable of
<br />
invoking the Cheshire Cat *to the life*, not merely leave its grin
<br />
hanging in the void.
<br />
<br />Moving beyond bare analysis and description, any move to universalise
<br />
and 'realise' the axioms of such a schema is to make a claim on
<br />
ontological finality.  It has not been completely clear (to me)
<br />
whether COMP necessarily makes such a stipulation on realisation, in
<br />
the sense of a claim that its axioms *literally are* what is present
<br />
and personal (i.e. RITSIAR).
<br />
<br />However I'm coming to suspect that it does not in fact make such a
<br />
claim, although it allows any one of us to take this as a personal
<br />
leap of faith, specifically through the acid test of saying yes to the
<br />
doctor.
<br />
<br />COMP may turn out to be false in its specific predictions - i.e. empirical tests
<br />
could rule out the possibility of our being finite machines; or
<br />
perhaps we can never be sure one way or the other.
<br />
<br />Nonetheless, the inescapable implication is that any alternative
<br />
schema must from the outset explicitly and fearlessly address the same
<br />
problem space or else run foul of the same intractable 0-1-3 person
<br />
ontological and epistemological issues.
<br />
<br />This has profound implications for virtually all current cosmological
<br />
TOEs: i.e. a view from nowhere turns out to be nobody's view.  As has
<br />
been observed in other writings, our understanding remains profoundly
<br />
obscured and distorted unless we restore the personal to the view from
<br />
nowhere.  Only then can we conceive why indeed there is somewhere
<br />
rather than nowhere.
