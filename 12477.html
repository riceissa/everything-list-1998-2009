SP: 'The brain manages to maintain identity from moment to moment 
<br />
without perfect copying or infinite computing power... '
<br />
<br />MP: True, up to a point, but I want to quibble about that later [maybe 
<br />
below, maybe in another posting]. And upon more, [and more, and more,] 
<br />
mature reflection I can see that we are leading each other up the garden 
<br />
path, [or is it just you laughing - with justification I admit - at me?  
<br />
:-]  We have to distinguish between identity as evidenced by finger 
<br />
prints [if we have been naughty], driver's license, Medicare number, 
<br />
birth certificate, account numbers + PIN, etc., and the belief I have in 
<br />
the story of me which I rehearse and act out during my waking hours. 
<br />
Then there is the identity of Identity Theory.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* The first identity above is social identity - consisting of what I
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;know about myself, what others know about me, and a whole host of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;social relations which constrain what I may do, assert what I
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ought to do and anchor me as a responsible citizen of Australia
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and if I don't act responsibly then I will be HELD responsible. It
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is who and what I am deemed to be by those who might care. It is a
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;story, stored in several brains, computers and filing cabinets,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which focuses on my person and is epitomised and focused on my
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;body and what it does.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* The second is my personal beliefs about me and in particular those
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;qualia which embody my sense of self from moment to waking moment.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously this overlaps with my social identity in the part of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that which lodges in my head. The essential nature of this is that
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of a story; my life is NOT LIKE a story, my life IS a story. I
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;suppose I can say that the qualia of sense of self make my story a
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'graphic novel' [which sounds so much more posh than 'picture
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;story' doesn't it  :-]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* The identity of qualia with the activity of neural networks
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;appears to be something that you either believe or you don't. I do
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so life is much simpler for me than it is for many people who
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contribute to discussions about consciousness. It is in this
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;particular subject area, if you like, that the issue of exactitude
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in copying becomes truly relevant. In the first two dot points, it
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is not necessarily the most important point, indeed may not matter
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;greatly or at all depending on how we view the ethics of the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;situation.
<br />
<br />When I wake up each morning, I am brought back to my habitual view of 
<br />
things and feelings of being here by external and internal stimuli. My 
<br />
clock radio sounding out ABC Radio National breakfast program or 'AM', 
<br />
the view of our bedroom ceiling, the sensations of the doona** resting 
<br />
on my body, the pressure of a full bladder ... Sometimes it is a bit 
<br />
fuzzy at first and very occasionally, such as happened a month or so 
<br />
ago, I might have awakened out of a powerful dream the effects of which 
<br />
do not leave me so that I am still wrapped in suspension of disbelief 
<br />
and can find myself thinking quite weird thoughts. But that is a 
<br />
digression.
<br />
<br />What would be the affect on me if I awoke in a totally unfamiliar place? 
<br />
How would I know I was me? If I remembered being somewhere in particular 
<br />
and being told that I would wake up far away in Beijing for example this 
<br />
would be helpful if in fact that was where I found myself. If on the 
<br />
other hand a glitch in the system caused my data to be sent to the wrong 
<br />
destination I would be very confused. Furthermore, if the quality of the 
<br />
copying was not up to scratch, I might be feeling very fuzzy indeed or 
<br />
very sick. Without external clues to tie in with what memories I had of 
<br />
my life story leading up to the last time I went unconscious, I would be 
<br />
very dependent on staff at the read out station to tell me what was 
<br />
happening. It is around about here that the location of a person or 
<br />
thing can be seen to be a very important component of its/his/her identity.
<br />
<br />So back to the question: can I be copied? Answer: More or less yes.
<br />
Next question: Is the edition of me that gets copied then flushed away 
<br />
committing suicide? Answer: Yes
<br />
Next question: If the copying did not destroy the original of me then 
<br />
who is the new edition of me in Beijing or wherever? Answer: [and this 
<br />
is simple] He is my identical twin brother. That is the easy 
<br />
philosophical answer. His legal status will depend on what the law has 
<br />
evolved to prescribe about the situation.
<br />
<br />And there we have it! THAT was the answer I have been looking for for 
<br />
years actually, ever since reading /Reasons and Persons/ [well ... 
<br />
reading most of, because the first half or one third of the book is VERY 
<br />
dry]. Twin brothers, or triplets, whatever. What could be conceptually 
<br />
simpler than that?!
<br />
<br />MP: And here I was going to quibble: The first two dot points above 
<br />
relate processes of ASCRIPTION. This is important. This is still true 
<br />
but I don't care any more. I just wandered off to commune with nature 
<br />
and spent some time running fantasy scenarios in my mind- 'tutorial' 
<br />
type scenes with me holding forth - and the whole thing has slotted into 
<br />
place. As follows:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Assuming that it is in principle feasible to 'copy' a person and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;either store the data obtained without deterioration or transmit
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the data without noticeable loss, then when that data is used to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reconstitute a medically and legally acceptable facsimile, the new
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;copy is NOT the original it is his/her identical twin brother or
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sister.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* In this scenario, if the original which is copied ceases to exist
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at the place of copying, he/she has died. If the copying took
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;place without destruction of the original then he/she is [ceteris
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;paribus] the same person and unchanged. The legal status of the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new twin will be the subject of common or statute law provoked by
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the invention of the new technology.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* In a discussion with one of my son's friends just now we agreed
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the 'Star Trek' version of the teleporter is a rather odd
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beasty in which not just the information/data concerning the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;structure and dynamics of a crew member's body was sent to a
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;destination but the actual atoms of the body were sent also. This
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;might seem like a tidy sort of solution to someone who didn't want
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to think too deeply about it, but the sending of the original's
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;atoms would add an enormous overhead to the system, firstly the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;amount of energy required to accelerate all the particles to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;something close to the speed of light would be enormous, and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;secondly it would not change anything significant because it is
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not the fact of it being those particular atoms which is
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;important  but which kind of atoms and exactly where should they
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be. So when 'Scotty' or whoever beams them up, they die on the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;planet's surface and their identical twins are created in the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spaceship.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* This whole scenario actually works to support the contention of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steven Lehar that the identity of a thing includes its location
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and that this fact is a reflection of how our brains work in
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;creating the phenomenal reality of our experience [see
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://cns-alumni.bu.edu/~slehar/webstuff/bubw3/bubw3.html#compmech">http://cns-alumni.bu.edu/~slehar/webstuff/bubw3/bubw3.html#compmech</a>

<br />
<br /><br />I think that is enough for now!

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; SP: 'Getting back to the original question about teleportation

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; experiments, are you saying that it would be impossible, or just 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; technically very difficult to preserve personal identity whilst

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; undergoing such a process? As Brent pointed out, technical difficulty

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is not an issue in thought experiments. ,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; MP: I have answered this, in responding to Brent. In summary I say: 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; if it is just A [any old] rendition of a human you want, then given 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that thought experiments allow that all practical challenges can be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; overcome, the answer is Yes!  On the other hand if the strict 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; requirement of an exact copy of a particular person is required to be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; output then it becomes a question of whether or not truly infinite 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; computing power is required to calculate the changes occurring within 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the original at scan time. If it is then the answer is NO, because 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; infinity is infinity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I think Derek Parfit's copier [Reasons and Persons Ch 10] was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'usually' producing complete and accurate copies, because one of his 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; scenarios addresses what would happen if there was a fault in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; transmission.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The brain manages to maintain identity from moment to moment without

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very good copying and very great computing power, but this is

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different in kind, not just in degree, from perfect copying and

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; infinite computing power.
