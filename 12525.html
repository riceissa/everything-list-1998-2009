MJ:
<br />
I find it an excellent addage to identify Ccnss, thank you. 
<br />
I was searching for 'self' and found a similar trait, adding &quot;self reflective relation&quot; to it. I would change &quot;an&quot; into &quot;the&quot; and call environment the totality - but this is a minor change in wording. In the 'self' I struggled with 'closer' and 'less closely' related ambience as pertaining to the 'strength of the relationship, which would vote for Brent's &quot;an&quot; rather than my &quot;the&quot;. 
<br />
I was talking about &quot;conscious&quot;, as frequently used not identically to the adjective of Ccness,(e.g. 'unconscious' in sleep retains some Ccness for an alarm clock.) 
<br />
Is the 'addage' all of Ccness? Like another Brent-post
<br />
I have to recall:  Brent's excellent proposition some time ago, about &quot;why go further from a (timeless?) world we cannot really kidentified as 'originated', into a similarly uniodentified 'creator' (approximate paraphrasing), why can we not stop there and speak about 'the world' only? 
<br />
(Meaning: isn't one level of unknowable enough?) 
<br />
&nbsp;Of course that rang the bell of pantheism.

<br />
I skip the rest of the 'rock-physics'. 

<br />
Regards

<br />
John M

&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a view that seems to me to be slightly different.  Consciousness requires interaction with an environment; consciousness implicitly requires a distinction between &quot;I&quot; and &quot;the world&quot;.  So when you attribute consciousness to a rock, incorporating &quot;the world&quot; as part of the rock, while the remainder of the rock is &quot;conscious&quot; that raises problems.  We can say that this part of the rock is conscious of that part; making some arbitrary division of the rock.  But then it's not conscious in/of our universe.  

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;When you say there is no canonical syntax, which is what allows anything to be a computation of anything else, I think that is overstates the case.  Suppose a particular pair of iron atoms in the rock are magnetically aligned and the syntax counts that as &quot;0&quot; while anti-aligned counts as &quot;1&quot;.  Then what computation is implemented by &quot;0000000...&quot;?  The arbitrariness of syntax supposedly allows this to be translated into &quot;27&quot; or some other number.  But then the translation has to have all possible words in it and the relational meanings of those words; including the words for all the numbers in that world.  This places a pretty strong restriction on the size of the rock-world - there are only some 10^25 atoms to do all this representing.
