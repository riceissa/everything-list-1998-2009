Brief comments on Gilles Henri &quot;against computationalism&quot;
<br />
Original message below.
<br />
<br /><br />Comp, as I conceive it, is analogous to 'comp1 OR comp2', with a non
<br />
constructive OR. It means I am open to a high level of substitution
<br />
and I am open to a low level of substitution (I survive a
<br />
fonctionnal substitution at that level)
<br />
... but I will NEVER know that level.
<br />
<br />Note that when you say:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;comp2 : all the physical world is EXACTLY equivalent to some computation of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;its analogic properties at a finite level.
</em><br />
<br />It is still a &quot;physicalist&quot; description. It is less misleading
<br />
to replace &quot;physical world&quot; by psychological histories&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;However, I want to stress here that comp2 is indeed a huge jump: in fact it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;does not COMPLEMENT but rather CONTRADICT comp1; it is the source of all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;paradoxes and worst, it it completely useless to understand the origin of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consciousness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;comp2 contradicts comp1 because the essence of comp1 is the independance of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the results with respect to the material implementation, whereas comp2
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;requires the precize definition of this implementation (of course the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;simulation made in comp2 could be runned on any TM, but the object of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;simulation must be one precise physical system).
</em><br />
<br />Only your &quot;physicalist&quot; conception makes you confuse &quot;comp2&quot; with
<br />
Jacques Mallah's physical computationalism. The difference between comp1 
<br />
and
<br />
comp2 is a matter of degree. It is the difference between comp high level 
<br />
and comp low level. My resoning is independant of the level.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;insure the proper handling of counterfactuals which is in fact nothing else
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;than the self-construction of consciousness.
</em><br />
<br />I like that very much. Note that the concept of computation gives (with 
<br />
CT) an absolute way of defining counterfactuals. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;This is NOT to be taken as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;formal definition of consciousness but only a possible restriction to get
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;an actually conscious device. It would not be pure computationalism because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it would put restrictions on the kind of implementations it requires.
</em><br />
<br />So you get a Mallah sort of implementation problem.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;It makes it still worse because abandoning the idea of physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reality (Marchal) means also the impossibility of linking a computation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with a physical state, which is the starting point of comp2 and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Tegmark-Schmidhuber and co..theory!!!
</em><br />
<br />It is the contrary. It is the very impossibility to link 'conscious 
<br />
computation'
<br />
with a physical activity, which makes possible for me (without Occam 
<br />
razor)
<br />
to abandon the need in a 'physical universe' or 'physical reality'.
<br />
This follows *also* from the PE-OMEGA thought experiment + Occam Razor.
<br />
The only difference between TEGMARK-SCHMIDHUBER and me, is (I deduce it 
<br />
from comp BTW) that it is not possible to use a particular execution of a 
<br />
program
<br />
to individualise (single out) a 'particular' consciousness, so that 
<br />
conciousness and all possible subjective experiences (always 
<br />
indexicalised: all the 'here, now and me') are always defined by the 
<br />
whole set of computational histories. In fact I reduce the 
<br />
'consciousness' problem to the
<br />
problem of the origin of the physical sensations and laws.
<br />
Tegmark can be made coherent by the abandon of computationalism.
<br />
Schmidhuber, IMO, should realise that with comp he MUST reduces the 
<br />
physical laws to the machine's law of dreaming (let us say). 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;So
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;how to found Bruno's &quot;computational psychology ?
</em><br />
<br />Generally in computer/information/communicability/prouvability sciences.
<br />
Precisely in my chapter 5 :-)
<br />
<br />Bruno
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />--- original message by Gilles ---
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I'd like to expose some arguments against computationalism - mainly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;elaborated through the various discussions on this list, many thanks to all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;contributors!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I think we should distinguish between two forms of computationalism, which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are unfortunately often confused in many discussions:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;comp1 : the brain is an EXACT implementation of some digital computation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;equivalent to a TM. The running of this computation on any equivalent TM
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would produce exactly the same output.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In other words, we are just running a very complicated digital program
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(much like Word but still more complicated!) that could run on any platform
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(complicated enough). Like our ordinary computers, the implementation must
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be independant of the material structure of the platform, and thus the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;information must lie at a (much) higher level than the molecular one, most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probably at the level of a neuron state, just like the bits of a computer.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I think we will all agree that the experimental facts from neurobiology are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;enough to conclude that comp1 is FALSE, because a neuron state can not be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;defined in a discrete, deterministic way. The firing pattern depends also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;on many analogic quantities (temperature, concentration of various
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;neurotransmettors,  possible drugs) and has a strong probabilistic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(pseudo-random) behaviour.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Most of you seem to conclude : &quot;ok, no problem. We know that all these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;analogic parameters can be modelized by deterministic equations; it's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;enough to implement the solution of these equations to produce the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;output as the brain, and THUS consciousness, and that's it.&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Most of the (if not all) devices dicussed as &quot;artificial conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;machines&quot;,(including Bruno's &quot;crackpot&quot; dreaming machine) are based on this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;assumption.  As the brain is in fact interacting with the outer world (a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;point that would deserve more discussions : I think that even dreams or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;hallucinations would not be possible if the brain had NEVER interacted with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;its environment), you soon realize that the equations must take into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;account the whole Universe, a la Schmidhuber. To recall last Tegmark's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;quote:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;   Let us imagine a hypothetical Universe much larger than our own,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;   which contains a computer so powerful that it can simulate the time-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;   evolution of our entire Universe.  BY HYPOTHESIS (*I emphasize*), the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;humans in this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;   simulated world would perceive their world as being as real as we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;   perceive ours, so by definition, the simulated universe would have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;   PE [physical existence].
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  So you are led to another hypothesis, that I will call comp2, which is in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;fact Bruno's &quot;comp&quot; postulate.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;comp2 : all the physical world is EXACTLY equivalent to some computation of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;its analogic properties at a finite level .
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;As Bruno shows it magnificently, comp2 leads inevitably to the actual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;disappearance of the physical world, replaced by a world of computations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;However, I want to stress here that comp2 is indeed a huge jump: in fact it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;does not COMPLEMENT but rather CONTRADICT comp1; it is the source of all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;paradoxes and worst, it it completely useless to understand the origin of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consciousness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;comp2 contradicts comp1 because the essence of comp1 is the independance of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the results with respect to the material implementation, whereas comp2
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;requires the precize definition of this implementation (of course the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;simulation made in comp2 could be runned on any TM, but the object of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;simulation must be one precise physical system).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;One of the problem is to find the actual level at which this simulation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;should be made. As I already stressed, the physical laws we are using do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not describe the REALITY, but only our REPRESENTATION of it. Although it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;plausible that there is SOMETHING objective, we have no idea what this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;could be (&quot;das Ding an sich following Kant). So which representation to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;choose ? The chemical description ? The QM state ? String theory  ?(with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the supplementary difficulty that beyond the QM level, no measurement of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the Q-state is possible). You could try to accept any level giving an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;acceptable output, but then isn't Hans right when he assumes that even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Teddy bears and movies characters have &quot;acceptable enough&quot; outputs to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;considered as conscious?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Note that this first difficulty did not exist with comp1, but we are facing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it inevitably with comp2.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Assume you have solved this difficulty, either by finding a known (e.g.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;electro/chemical) level at which the brain evolution IS predictible, or by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;finding a (subquantum) TOE reproducing exactly all know features of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Universe. You may hope to describe your brain at this level and calculate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;its evolution. You may think (with comp2) that a TM calculating the state
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of your brain would actually be conscious LIKE YOU.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I will not recall all paradoxes associated with this hypothesis (for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;example Olympia/Karas paradox) But taking again just the chinese room
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;example, let think of the case where your brain would be actually simulated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not by a machine but BY SOMEBODY ELSE ? Who or what would feel your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consciousness ? You could imagine a situation where the entirely state of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;your brain at some instant is stored in a huge library, and somebody (for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;example me) is put in charge to calculate its evolution (for example
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;applying id\psi/dt = H \psi to a quantum state). What do I have to do for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this device to actually think (like you, not me) ? Must I write the output
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of my calculation somewhere? with a pen? on a magnetic tape? what if I read
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a stored file of a previous calculation ? And if it is read by somebody
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;else that does not know what it represents? Please tell me ! I am paid for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this job and I don't want to be fired!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Of course I just point out again the contradictions between comp2 and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physical supervenience, but abandonning Phys-sup does not solve the first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;point. It makes it still worse because abandoning the idea of physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reality (Marchal) means also the impossibility of linking a computation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with a physical state, which is the starting point of comp2 and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Tegmark-Schmidhuber and co..theory!!!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;A third and last difficulty is that comp2 does not solve the problem of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consciousness. For if everything is assimilable to computations, what makes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;some computations or parts of computations conscious or not (see Wei)? So
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;how to found Bruno's &quot;computational psychology&quot; ? What is the dream of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;string? Complexity is not enough, because for example the chemical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;evolution of a thinking brain is not more complex to that of a dead brain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;leading to putrefaction. At the analogic level of comp2, you have lost the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;information level of comp1 ! I agree that the problem is the same with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;materialism - I just point out that it is not easier with comp2.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So I think that pure computationalism, either comp1 or comp2, is very hard
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to maintain. Another comp3 proposition?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;One remark is that all &quot;thinking&quot; devices based on digital simulations of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the analogic state of the brain handle in fact much more (and too much)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;information than the brain itself, which is totally unaware of its own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;material structure. A very important fact is that they ALL require an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;external structure able to store the relevant information and program them
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;adequately, which is NOT the case of actual brains (and I guess of possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;future thinking machines).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So my guess is that consciousness requires not only a proper handling of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;information, but that this handling must be a natural consequence of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physical evolution without ANY interaction with an external storage of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;information about its own structure, even for its construction. This would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;insure the proper handling of counterfactuals which is in fact nothing else
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;than the self-construction of consciousness. This is NOT to be taken as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;formal definition of consciousness but only a possible restriction to get
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;an actually conscious device. It would not be pure computationalism because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it would put restrictions on the kind of implementations it requires.
