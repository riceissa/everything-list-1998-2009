Bruno,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've often wondered why neither Dr. Deutsch nor Alan Forrester has commented on your theory of UDA and AUDA. I certainly would be interested in their views. A theory that has execised some of the best minds on this list for months on end certainly deserves serious consideration. Best,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;martin a.

<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Even with politics operating behind the scene (which you have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hinted), I can't imagine that nothing of the work is publishable.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I already discussed proposition of publishing &quot;Conscience et  
<br />
Mécanisme&quot; with three publishers, before my thesis was judged not  
<br />
receivable (meaning no private defense, nor public defense, I have  
<br />
*never* met those who criticize, not even my work, but a product of  
<br />
their imagination). Then silence, even after the defense in Lille, and  
<br />
even more after the paradoxical price in Paris.
<br />
<br />I cannot explain. Or I can explain except that here reality is far  
<br />
beyond fiction as usual, but also more sad, and rather delicate if  
<br />
only because that story is not finished.
<br />
My life is more unbelievable than any thing I assert in my works. It  
<br />
took me 22 years to understand what happened in 1977, and since then.
<br />
<br />I feel responsible to let them build they own trap, and then  get  
<br />
myself a bit worried seeing them to protect themselves from Brussels  
<br />
to Paris!
<br />
<br />It is not because I have done an &quot;original work&quot; (say) in Brussels,  
<br />
that I got problems there. It is because I got problems in Brussels  
<br />
that I have done an original work. In 1977, they give me no chance,  
<br />
not even getting out of Belgium.
<br />
In 1994, my work was criticize vaguely as &quot;not original&quot;, &quot;too much  
<br />
simple&quot;,  and then &quot;delirious&quot;. And now already &quot;not from him&quot; in some  
<br />
place. Which again shows the problems is not related with my findings,  
<br />
except it belongs to the kind of things you can easily use to treat  
<br />
you as a fool (Gödel's theorem, Quantum mechanics, consciousness: few  
<br />
understand so it is easy to say &quot;not serious&quot;).
<br />
<br />The little scandal has grown up all the time and is too big, now. It  
<br />
is the kind of manipulation which makes everyone feel responsible,  
<br />
from corporatist reflex to corporatist reflex, when actually there is  
<br />
only one, very clever, but very bad,  guy.
<br />
Now that &quot;little scandal&quot; has become big enough to throw light on  
<br />
other really bigger scandals. There are &quot;cadavres dans les placards&quot;,  
<br />
as we say in French (corpses hidden in boxes). Mean of pressures.
<br />
<br />I still believe in academies, but like in School &quot;serial killer&quot; can  
<br />
exist. When you see the time made by religious institution to protect  
<br />
their member of their hierarchy from their much grave behavior, I  
<br />
estimate it could take a long time if ever to understand and recognize  
<br />
what happened.
<br />
And I have no problem with serious academicians and scientists which  
<br />
understand enough to understand it is &quot;serious&quot;, even if probably  
<br />
wrong, which I have myself never ceased to believe plausible (which  
<br />
explains why I am eager to discuss the validity of the UDA steps, with  
<br />
people interested). I did defend the work as PhD thesis. I was asked  
<br />
many questions, I answered them and everyone got the idea. Some people  
<br />
takes time, but most get enough to trust the interest of the work.  
<br />
Still today, few get both UDA and AUDA.
<br />
<br />UDA is almost easy, but not so easy. AUDA is very *simple*, once you  
<br />
understand enough standard logic (which I have discovered is  
<br />
excessively rare). The whole thing is strongly interdisciplinary, and  
<br />
between disciplines, rumors circulate more quickly than &quot;scientific  
<br />
bridge&quot;,  which often makes people feeling being aggressed on their  
<br />
territories. Even more so when the work approaches question  
<br />
traditionally qualified as &quot;philosophical&quot;.
<br />
<br />My initial power comes from the fact that in 1977, I did abandoned,  
<br />
for bad reasons (but it will take many years to understand that), the  
<br />
idea of doing academic research, and so I did come back to the very  
<br />
fundamental questioning I have always been living. I didn't and don't  
<br />
complain (my weakness probably).
<br />
And it is the Academy, 20 years later, which will push me back again,  
<br />
and again. I have never submitted publications by myself. All have  
<br />
been asked by people, having heard I said something new, sometimes  
<br />
insisting gently. Nowadays, since those events, even ordered paper (or  
<br />
jobs) get jeopardized quickly. Last year I was asked to write a paper  
<br />
for a book in homage to the late logician Jean Ladrière, (who offered  
<br />
to me its formidable book on Gödel theorems: Les limitations internes  
<br />
des formalismes&quot;), and then ... nothing again. I am used to it.
<br />
<br />Thanks for your interest,
<br />
<br />Bruno
