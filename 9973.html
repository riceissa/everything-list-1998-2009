<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is this requirement just to avoid saying that everything implements

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; every computation?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Jacques Mallah makes that point some years ago (in this list), and I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; think Hal Finney has developed that point. I think their argument are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; valid. But then I don't think the Putnam-Mallah-Chalmers is really a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; problem once you get the idea that the physical world emerge from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; mathematical world of computations. Personally I have never seen a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; convincing argument that everything implements every computations,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; perhaps some tiny part of some computations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I will postpone saying more on the movie-graph/Olympia type of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; argument
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; (if only to avoid to much simultaneous threads and to modulate the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; difficulties).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; It seems to me trivially obvious that any sufficiently complex
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; system implements any finite &gt;computation, just as any sufficiently
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; large
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; block of marble contains every marble statue of a given &gt;size.  The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; difference between random noise (or a block of marble) on the one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; hand and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; a well-&gt;behaved computer (or the product of a sculptor's work) on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; is that the information is in the &gt;latter case presented in a way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; that can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; interact with the world containing the substrate of its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;implementation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; But I think that this idea leads to almost the same conclusion that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; reach: it really &gt;seems that if any computation can be mapped to any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; physical substrate, then that substrate is &gt;superfluous except in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; that tiny
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; subset of cases involving well-behaved computers that can handle
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; counterfactuals and thus interact with their environment, and we may
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; well say that every &gt;computation exists by virtue of its status as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; platonic object. I say &quot;almost&quot; because I can't quite see &gt;how to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; prove it,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; even though I suspect that it is so.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But just because you can map any physical activity to any computation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the right mapping function, that doesn't necessarily mean that some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; processes don't contribute more to the measure of certain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; observer-moments
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; than others--Chalmers would say that there are &quot;psychophysical laws&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; governing the relationship between physical processes and conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; experiences, and they might specify that a physical process has to meet
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; certain criteria which a rock doesn't in order to qualify as an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; instantiation of a given mind.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Those specifications have to make physical processes NOT turing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;emulable, for Chalmers' idea being coherent. The price here would be an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;explicit NON-COMP assumption, and then we are lead outside my working
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;hypothesis. In this way his dualism is typically non computationalist.
</em><br />
<br />Why would Chalmers' version of dualism be non-computationalist? As I 
<br />
understand him, he does argue that there is a one-to-one relationship 
<br />
between computations and conscious experiences, and he certainly believes 
<br />
that a sufficiently detailed simulation of a brain would *behave* just like 
<br />
the original.
<br />
<br />Anyway, without tying my argument to closely to Chalmers' beliefs, what I 
<br />
meant when I talked about &quot;psychophysical laws&quot; was just a rule for deciding 
<br />
when a copy of a particular computation has been instantiated physically, 
<br />
with each instantiation contributing to the total measure of that 
<br />
computation. You don't even have to postulate a special &quot;physical universe&quot;, 
<br />
you could just ask how frequently copies of a smaller computation are being 
<br />
instantiated in a larger computation (like a computation representing the 
<br />
evolution of the universal wavefunction, or a computation representing the 
<br />
universal uovetailer). For example, let's say I identify a given 
<br />
observer-moment with a particular computation O which represents all the 
<br />
computations going on in the observer's brain during that moment (with a 
<br />
'moment' of subjective experience presumably corresponding to computations 
<br />
spread out over tens or hundreds of milliseconds in the physical brain) 
<br />
which are relevant to what the observer subjectively experiences in that 
<br />
moment (and there might be plenty of things going on in the physical brain 
<br />
that *aren't* relevant, like random thermal vibrations of atoms in neurons). 
<br />
Suppose I also have a larger computation E which is a detailed simulation of 
<br />
a physical environment that happens to include a brain that seems to be 
<br />
doing what appears to be a similar set of computations; in this case the 
<br />
&quot;psychophysical laws&quot; would be some rules that would tell us whether the 
<br />
larger computation E does in fact contain an &quot;instantiation&quot; of O within it. 
<br />
And if we postulate some ultimate base-level computation representing 
<br />
&quot;objective physical reality&quot;, like the simulation of the universal 
<br />
wavefunction or the universal dovetailer, this might contain instantiations 
<br />
of every possible program, but it might instantiate some more frequently 
<br />
than others, thus giving some observer-moments higher measure than others. 
<br />
Finally, even if we reject the idea of a single base-level computation, the 
<br />
idea of larger computations containing instantiations of smaller ones within 
<br />
them might still be relevant, since if you identify observer-moments with 
<br />
particular computations, some observer-moments might contain copies of 
<br />
smaller ones within them, and this would have to be taken into account in 
<br />
the sort of &quot;measure battle&quot; that you talk about in other posts.
<br />
<br />So, do you think that the idea of &quot;psychophysical laws&quot; whose sole purpose 
<br />
is to decide if larger computations contain instantiations of smaller ones, 
<br />
and therefore contribute to their overall measure, violates 
<br />
&quot;computationalism&quot; as you understand it? If so, why?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I met David Chalmers in Brussels in 2000 (at the Brussels ASSC
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;meeting). He *is* indeed quite coherent, in the sense that he considers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that in the self-duplication Washington/Moscow experiment the first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;person must feel to be at the two places simultaneously.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This is coherent also with his dualist interpretation of Everett. Now,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I personally agree with Hans Primas, and David Deutsch, that Everett's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;move is motivated by a search for a monistic view of (quantum) reality.
</em><br />
<br />What do you mean by &quot;feel to be at the two places simultaneously&quot;? As in, I 
<br />
would have a single subjective experiences of looking out of two pairs of 
<br />
eyes in two bodies, even though each of the bodies acts as if they have no 
<br />
knowedge of what the other body is experiencing? This seems at odds with his 
<br />
general ideas about subjective experiences tracking with actual third-person 
<br />
reports of one's experiences, which play a critical role in his &quot;dancing 
<br />
qualia&quot; argument, for example (see <a href="http://consc.net/papers/qualia.html">http://consc.net/papers/qualia.html</a> ). If 
<br />
he didn't explain in detail what he meant, is it possible you misunderstood 
<br />
him? Perhaps he just meant that both copies would have equal claim to be 
<br />
later versions of the original, not that they would have any subjective 
<br />
knowledge of each other's experiences.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Although there is some difficulty figuring
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; out exactly what these criteria would be (matching counterfactuals, for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; example?), it doesn't seem obviously hopeless,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Only by jeopardizing the comp hyp., and introducing an explicit dualism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(as he does).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I have no problem with that. I respect all hypothesis, but I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;concentrate myself on the comp hyp.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I only rarely argued in favor of comp, or of any hypotheses. I prefer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to study their consequences. Now, I could say that I find Chalmers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;approach as an highly speculative approach build just to save the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Aristotelian conception of physics/nature/reality, which I already
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;known to be incoherent with comp.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The point is that Chalmers approach is coherent with mine: he just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;proposes a different theory.
</em><br />
<br />Well again, leaving aside the details of Chalmers' ideas, do you think there 
<br />
is anything non-computationalist about the type of &quot;psychophysical laws&quot; I 
<br />
suggest above, which are solely concerned with the question of how larger 
<br />
computations contribute to the measure of smaller ones by containing 
<br />
instantiations of them? Such laws might very well say that the movie-graph 
<br />
or the ticking of a clock does not qualify as a valid instantiation of some 
<br />
complex computation corresponding to a particular observer-moment.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; which is why I'm not ready to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; accept Bruno's movie-graph argument or Maudlin's Olympia argument.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;OK, but my feeling is that you need to abandon comp to be able to cut
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;down such form of reasoning. Or you should perhaps point on some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;precise step you judge not convincing.
</em><br />
<br />Can you repost that link to the steps of your argument in order? Thanks.
<br />
<br />Jesse
