==================================================
<br />
<br />Dear At et al.,
<br />
<br />&quot;Consideration&quot; is a dual-process, not 'either-or'.
<br />
<br />When mapped vis a vis &quot;holism&quot; that is requisitely true.
<br />
The consideration of a 'particular' occurs because
<br />
such 'particular' -is a representative member- of the
<br />
extended, unvoiced, unspecified set(s) it is resident
<br />
and member of, and - and even as -, the cognitive
<br />
focus/consideration -process- seemingingly truncates
<br />
out and disregards that which is not present and or
<br />
not obvious.
<br />
<br />Think of it in regard to the field-ground graphic
<br />
images used in exploring cognitive psychology.
<br />
<br />Do you see the old woman or the young one?  Do you
<br />
see the cup or the two faces?  Do you see the individual
<br />
torso-figures or do you see the single face?
<br />
<br />The whole is implicitly present in -all- those, 
<br />
and any, cases under all conditions.  
<br />
<br />Simply because one cannot avoid collapsing waves
<br />
functions when -participating- interactively with 
<br />
existence -- doesn't mean that relationships between
<br />
'uncollapsed wave functions' are both/either 
<br />
'unaccessable' OR 'un-considerable' ; that such
<br />
relations are 'non-existent'.
<br />
<br />Not only -must- such relationships exist, but because
<br />
the -whole- of existence .. -to be- pandemically, 
<br />
exhaustively, &quot;whole&quot; .. must have universal
<br />
consistencies and coherencies (which are 'communcation
<br />
properties') that infuse all events and processes and
<br />
occurences .. invariantly and without exclusion.
<br />
<br />The structure and nature of 'existence' .. persistence
<br />
maintainable/maintained during communing relations ..
<br />
requires the above conditions and properties.
<br />
<br />And it is _those_ conditions~properties that all that
<br />
we discuss and consider are representatives of.  It
<br />
is the state of existence within which General Systems
<br />
ideations voices its eminence.
<br />
<br />The holo-relations I've written out above comprise
<br />
the existential proposition I have been making for
<br />
decades nows, enunciating it as a post-Godel paradigm.
<br />
Even in the face of a global community of thinkers
<br />
which identifies Godel via his Incompleteness Theorems
<br />
as the pinnacle of logic.
<br />
<br />The flaw in Godel's logic rests in his trying to
<br />
account for information accessiblity that is limited
<br />
-after- interaction/wavecollapse/truncation.
<br />
<br />When, in point of fact, such i/wc/t cannot even occur
<br />
if there is an absence of properties through which
<br />
information pandemically -is accessible- with -all-
<br />
of its Potentia.  Which means, that the properties
<br />
of the whole _supercedes_ any limitiations occurring
<br />
as a result of i/wc/t.  Which properties -must existentially
<br />
continue and be concurrent with- all events, states and
<br />
conditions -after- any such i/wc/t.
<br />
<br />The properties of 'the whole' are imminent and inferrable
<br />
and discernable even in limited sets.
<br />
<br />My Integrity Paradigm has consistently maintained this
<br />
extensiveness, as I've presented varieties of notions
<br />
to you all over the years.  One issue has been and
<br />
still is, very clear:   in order to achieve a unitary
<br />
science~logic~wisdom~sensibility about the universe
<br />
it will be necessary to step beyond Godel's Incompleteness
<br />
Theorems.  His ideas are -not incorrect-.  They are 
<br />
-self incomplete-.  They are still synchrontic with the 
<br />
universe (by default of the propositions I explicated above),
<br />
but they are pre-limiting and deficient to handle the
<br />
properties which are now obvious and require -inclusion-
<br />
in a universal schemata of being.
<br />
<br />To restate it as I've presented it here and elsewhere before:
<br />
<br />&quot;We -know something- {about the qualities and operant properties}
<br />
of realms of existence which we have never -explicitly experienced
<br />
or made part of our 'known/established information' set- and
<br />
which Godel('s logic) would demand of us that we exclude and
<br />
abstain from making -any statements- about.&quot;
<br />
<br />We 'know something' that Godel would claim that we could
<br />
not know and demand we not conversantly include.  We have
<br />
real access to information that his Zeno-ic logic would 
<br />
restrict us from even acknowledging~recognizing.
<br />
<br />Godelian proponents and practioners must re-think their
<br />
positions.  If not entirely abandon the Incompleteness 
<br />
Theorems as a quaint artifact of logic, explored on the
<br />
way to a Univera.
