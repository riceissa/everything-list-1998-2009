<br /><br />Ok. How about:
<br />
<br />The multiverse is a very long qubit-string. (This is an informal 
<br />
statement to drive intuition.)
<br />
<br />Being a qubit string it simultaneously exhibits all of its potential 
<br />
information-states.
<br />
<br />If there is something like this qubitstring simultaneously exhibiting 
<br />
all possible information
<br />
states, then note that to do computation, within that qubit-string, no 
<br />
actual computational
<br />
process need take place. Any tour through any subset of the information 
<br />
states (i.e.
<br />
&quot;visiting&quot; one information-state after another after another...) can be
<br />
considered equivalent to a computation. Any tour through a subset of the 
<br />
information
<br />
states which is such that the &quot;direction&quot; of the tour is restricted to 
<br />
only those successor
<br />
information-states Si+1 (of the state Si we're currently at) which are 
<br />
different from Si
<br />
by only a single bit-flip in a single position in the bitstring, and 
<br />
where that bit-flip
<br />
would only happen based on some function of only the state of the bits 
<br />
in a local vicinity
<br />
of the flipping bit, can be considered equivalent to a computation which 
<br />
is comprised
<br />
solely of localized operations, similar to the kinds of computation we 
<br />
understand.
<br />
<br />So the universe (or any observable universe) could be a tour through a 
<br />
subset of the
<br />
information-states of the qubit-string multiverse, which is such that 
<br />
the tour
<br />
computes only self-consistent spaces and objects, perhaps using only 
<br />
local computational
<br />
steps (part this computational locality is part of the secret of 
<br />
ensuring consistency, locality,
<br />
metric etc properties of the space and the objects, prehaps).
<br />
<br />Observers which were self-aware substructures WITHIN  the set of objects 
<br />
computed
<br />
in a &quot;consistent&quot; tour, maybe can only observe other information states 
<br />
which are also
<br />
within that tour.
<br />
<br />TIME AND LIGHTSPEED
<br />
As Wolfram postulates, the concept of time and speed of light c within 
<br />
such an
<br />
informational universe may be related to how fast the informational 
<br />
changes (from one
<br />
state to another) can propagate (across the qubitstring) using only 
<br />
local computations
<br />
as the medium of state-change propagation. It is wrong to suppose that 
<br />
this implies
<br />
&quot;computational time&quot; outside of the qubitstring. &quot;How fast state-change 
<br />
propagates&quot;
<br />
is purely a question of how the metric spacetime that the consistent 
<br />
tour defines
<br />
can evolve in form within a consistent tour.
<br />
<br />The tour itself could be imagined to be real if you like (with the
<br />
qubitstring really in some god-quantum-computer-thingy which has a 
<br />
god's-now-program-
<br />
pointer which moves from state to state in the consistent tour).
<br />
But it is better to think of the consistent tour as a virtual tour, an 
<br />
abstraction,
<br />
defined by nothing more nor less than its BEING a subset of information 
<br />
states, and an order
<br />
of traversal of those (very large) information states which is such that 
<br />
the ordered set
<br />
of information-states IS and CONJURES reality.
<br />
<br />OBSERVERS, AND TOUR-TRAVERSAL AS THE TIME ARROW FOR OBSERVERS
<br />
<br />An OBSERVER is a set of local subsets of the some of the set of 
<br />
information-states in the
<br />
consistent tour which is the universe. The notion of locality there is 
<br />
information-distance.
<br />
<br />OBSERVERS can observe any aspect (part) of the information states in the 
<br />
tour which has
<br />
the following properties:
<br />
<br />1. The observable substates must be within a light-cone of the observer. 
<br />
Photons or waves of light are
<br />
information travelling through the set of information-states. They are 
<br />
closely related to the putative
<br />
&quot;local computations&quot; which are imagined as defining sensible localized 
<br />
change between sets of
<br />
information states. So the observable substates are those that are 
<br />
reachable from the observer
<br />
states by local computations. These observation computations are 
<br />
computations that can
<br />
affect the observer-part of the &quot;now&quot; information-state based on the 
<br />
prior-to-now configuration
<br />
&nbsp;of other adjacent-to-the-observer parts of the prior-to-now information 
<br />
states, with the information
<br />
moving at a speed of one local computation (or is that one bitshift) per 
<br />
information-state-distance
<br />
in the consistent tour. Confusing? Yes I'm confused too. This bit's 
<br />
hard. (Pun intended)
<br />
<br />2. Argument 1 implies that only parts (in some informational locality to 
<br />
the observer within the
<br />
information-states) of PRIOR-IN-THE-TOUR information-states can be 
<br />
observed by the observer.
<br />
That's what being in the light-cone from the observer implies: 1. 
<br />
Informationally-local to the observer's
<br />
own states, and also 2. PRIOR in the consistent tour to the 
<br />
&quot;now-in-tour&quot; state of the observer.
<br />
<br />In fact we will stand these arguments on their heads now, and say that 
<br />
the consistent-tour direction
<br />
must be one in which an observer cannot observe (via light i.e. 
<br />
information packets moving by local
<br />
computation) forwards in the tour direction, but can observe (local 
<br />
parts of) information-states that are
<br />
backwards in the tour direction.
<br />
--------
<br />
The time-arrow (state-tour direction) is that direction of 
<br />
information-state-change in which the
<br />
changes are like local computations which can communicate information 
<br />
across from one part of the
<br />
qubit string to an observer who is (is in?) another part of the qubit 
<br />
string.
<br />
--------
<br />
<br />Consistent tour direction (through a very large, or infinite?) set of 
<br />
very large (or infinite) discrete information
<br />
states has a  lot to do, I think, with  the information-theoretic 
<br />
concept of entropy, and if this whole
<br />
quantum-comp hypothesis is correct, I think we'll find that 
<br />
information-theoretic entropy is in fact identical
<br />
to thermodynamic entropy.
<br />
<br />Particle interactions are analogous to local computations.
<br />
<br />The entropic time arrow must have to do with the fact that the 
<br />
computations only appear to be
<br />
a self-consistent-classical-reality-producing set of computations when 
<br />
the info-state-changes are considered
<br />
to be going in certain of the info-change directions that they could.
<br />
<br />The direction that the consistent tour chooses (and that the particle 
<br />
interactions choose when observation
<br />
from within the tour forces them to decohere into classical state) is a 
<br />
direction imposed by consistency
<br />
constraints. In fact, the direction is DEFINED BY the 
<br />
consistency-of-classical-reality constraints AND
<br />
BY NOTHING ELSE.
<br />
<br />A way of thinking about where &quot;NOW&quot; is in the tour of information states 
<br />
is that the PAST in the tour
<br />
is CLASSICAL (experiments have been conducted, quantum events have 
<br />
actually chosen a path
<br />
from their probability distributions) and the FUTURE in the tour is 
<br />
quantum-mechanical. The possible
<br />
successor-states have probabilities WHICH ARE BASED ON THEIR 
<br />
INFORMATION-DISTANCE
<br />
from the now-state in the tour.
<br />
<br />But the notion of the now-state in the tour is ILL-DEFINED as a global 
<br />
concept (just as it is in physics).
<br />
We really just have a NOW-state of a local part of an information state 
<br />
in the tour.
<br />
We can say that, as a definition,
<br />
&nbsp;the consistent tour visits those information states all of whose parts 
<br />
can choose a successor part-state
<br />
by local computation IN A WAY THAT IS GLOBALLY CONSISTENT AT THE SPEED OF
<br />
LOCAL-COMPUTATION INFORMATION-CHANGE (i.e. at the speed of light.)
<br />
<br />So ALL of the choices of successor-state for each informationally local 
<br />
part of the &quot;now&quot; information-state
<br />
in the tour must be consistent with each other, at least in the 
<br />
retrospect that will happen when those
<br />
future states can be inspected (at info-lightspeed) by any observer 
<br />
within the tour-states.
<br />
THAT is the transformation of quantum potentialities into classical 
<br />
realities.
<br />
<br />----------
<br />
So all in all I think I agree with Frank. The simulation DOES diverge 
<br />
from regularity, but
<br />
the diverging simulation is just one of many &quot;virtual tours&quot; through the 
<br />
&quot;all-information-states&quot;
<br />
qubitstring. Some other simulation, defined precisely as that one (or 
<br />
few) which does not
<br />
diverge from regularity, is also simultaneously happening (or existent, 
<br />
as an ordered subset)
<br />
in the qubitstring. And that non-diverging-into-noise simulation 
<br />
(info-state-tour, I prefer
<br />
because it implies passivity (no computer needed))  is the universe.
<br />
<br />So can there be other universes?
<br />
<br />One way of rephrasing this question is to put it as the question of 
<br />
whether there is
<br />
more than one &quot;lightspeed--globally-consistent&quot; tour through a set of 
<br />
all possible
<br />
information states, where light is defined as communication, from one 
<br />
part of the
<br />
qubitstring to another via local computations, of information.
