<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;As Bertrand Russell pointed out long ago, the existence of a &quot;self&quot; who 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;has&quot; the experiences is an inference.
</em><br />
<br />grrr! It doesnt matter how long ago anyone pointed anything out! Things do 
<br />
not get truer or falser as they get older. They come in and out of vogue.
<br />
<br />Russell's (wasnt it Bernard Williams'?) criticism of the cogito is just to 
<br />
say that Descartes added non certainties to his certainty. The assumption of 
<br />
an 'I' to recieve the 'Thoughts'. Nevertheless, with regards to the hardcore 
<br />
'realist', this isnt going to be much comfort. As much as possible he wants 
<br />
the world to be as it seems to be, so he side steps problems about 
<br />
perception and subjectivity and very much wants to avoid any introspection 
<br />
whatsoever. But, one would think that the existance of a self at every 
<br />
space/time crosshair of 'here' by 'now' was most likely one 'reality' he 
<br />
could swallow about introspection. But, sure enough, the 'I' is assumed. It 
<br />
isnt certain. The realist should start banging his drum again.
<br />
<br />But subjectivity is certain. That right here and right now, bang in the 
<br />
center of my universe at least, thoughts are occuring, sensations are being 
<br />
felt. And the rest of the world - to whatever degree it exists at all - is 
<br />
blind to that. These happenings belong to this (pointing at me) linguisticly 
<br />
conventional 'I'. Any of the thoughts experienced whose content infers a 
<br />
public and objective space are after this fact.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;English demands a subject/object sentence construction which makes it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;impossible to grammatically express the occurence of experiences without 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;something &quot;having&quot; the experiences. But as the Navajo just say &quot;raining&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;instead of &quot;it is raining&quot;, they would say &quot;experiencing!&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Language itself is inherently dualistic in a sense, just in so far as it 
<br />
categorises the world into here and there, us and them, dog and cat. Still, 
<br />
maybe that makes alot of sense? Isnt matter supposed to coagulate into 
<br />
chunks of qualitatively different things? What kind of analysis are the 
<br />
Navajo going to give 'experiencing' without recourse to some kind of notion 
<br />
of subjectivity? - if not personal identity. I'ld like to see it, though I 
<br />
imagine, in truth, their conceptual scheme and ours are utterly 
<br />
incommensurable - we only ever get a grip on what we think they think. 
<br />
Besides, as the reference to the Navajo makes clear denying a self is more 
<br />
commonly part of mysticism than &quot;realism&quot;, surely. Which is not at all meant 
<br />
perjoritively. I mean they get there without atom smashers I understand.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;How, you might ask, could the existence of a &quot;self&quot; who &quot;has&quot; the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;experiences be false.
</em><br />
<br />maybe the self is like a snowflake, an order out of entropy that crystalises 
<br />
into existance and then evapourates from it into thin air. A pattern. Most 
<br />
Platonists would be happy about that. But what is important here is that 
<br />
*subjectivity* is certain. That it is experience, whether that entails an 
<br />
'I' or not, that is immediate.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I'm a realist and I certainly don't dismiss them (nor do I know any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;realists who do).
</em><br />
<br />Lee is someone who does. ( at least when harranging platonists).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;But it is a problem of language - not of reality.  I see it as just two 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ways of talking about the same thing.  Just as to my computer the preceding 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sentence is just a string of one's and zero's, but to me it expresses a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;thought - which from another point of view is a complex of neurons firing.
</em><br />
<br />The computer simply doesnt care. Its not even ones and zeros, its flip flop 
<br />
transistors. On or offs. Depending on where the data is sent, or how it is 
<br />
cast, it will be interpreted differently. Send the ons and offs to a sound 
<br />
card and you will get some sound or other. cast the string &quot;He's gone 
<br />
chicken oriental!&quot; as an integer, and you can happily multiply it by 10. It 
<br />
has no conception about the data. We do when we encounter it through some 
<br />
peripheral or other, or manipulate it in code.
<br />
<br />With regards to neurons firing. Whats pain? Neurons firing. Whats pleasure? 
<br />
Neurons firing. Whats the idea that electrons are little balls? Neurons 
<br />
firing. These qualitively disparate experiences are in fact just the same 
<br />
thing? What then is the difference between a pain and a pleasure and 
<br />
theoretical physics - which is of course both these things and more? These 
<br />
qualitative differences derive from different patterns?,  different syntax? 
<br />
That alone?
<br />
<br />I dont believe that.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;We could invent a word that meant both equally, but that hasn't been useful 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;because we don't know much about the complex of neurons firing.
</em><br />
<br />Yes. We have not succeeded in doing it. So why accept it? And if a realist 
<br />
can accept what he has no evidence for, or can not really do, what then is 
<br />
the problem with other theories that for the moment seem unfalsifiable? 
<br />
Mathematical Platonism for instance.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Suppose we built a conscious robot (see John McCarthy's website), then 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;experience would be transistor gates switching.
</em><br />
<br />what about if we just built a robot, and then ask ourselves whether it is 
<br />
conscious. We dont want to put the cart before the horse. Im not so sure 
<br />
about Turing tests myself. I dont buy it. I can accept I might be fooled by 
<br />
a dead machine, I wouldnt know whether I was playing Kasperov or CrayBox 13 
<br />
for instance, but I'ld assume everytime I was playing a master. I dont think 
<br />
the chess computer has any concept of what it is doing.
<br />
<br />But I can see this very clearly:
<br />
<br />I think, therefore I am.
<br />
<br />Now, if realists are prepared to accept inferences from perception about an 
<br />
uncertain - at least indirectly witnessed - external realm, why cant they 
<br />
accept an inference about mentality that is no less certain than that? What 
<br />
do I have to choose between platonism and realism here? It seems to me we 
<br />
are all picking and choosing theories we ought to be agnostic about.
<br />
<br />Best Regards
<br />
<br />Chris.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;That I exist is more certain than any scientific truth. This is what I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;said. We can argue about experiences, illusions and being misled by

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;perception if you like, the argument that will come back is that the very 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;fact I am being misled by perception or undergoing an illusion proves 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;beyond doubt to me that I exist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;As Bertrand Russell pointed out long ago, the existence of a &quot;self&quot; who

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;How, you might ask, could the existence of a &quot;self&quot; who &quot;has&quot; the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;experiences be false.  The construct of a self depends on continuity and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;congruity of experiences over time.  If &quot;your&quot; experiences were incongruous 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;over time, as they can be when you're hallucinating, would &quot;you&quot; still 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;exist?  This isn't just hypothetical; it's what happens in multiple 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;personality disorder.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;Experiences are one source of knowledge, but their coherence with other 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;knowledge is important too.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;The point is that given the certainty of 'I exist' subjective experience 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;can not just be dismissed by the realist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I'm a realist and I certainly don't dismiss them (nor do I know any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;realists who do).  Subjective experience is epistemologically basic - but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it can still be ontologically derivative.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Given its certainty, it demands some kind of explanation, but the realist 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;recoils from providing any because marrying objective language with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;subjective language has been an intractable problem.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But it is a problem of language - not of reality.  I see it as just two 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ways of talking about the same thing.  Just as to my computer the preceding

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;because we don't know much about the complex of neurons firing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;If they are going to do that, they should admit how certain and central 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;subjective experiences are, how the enlightenment was forged by those who 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;dealt with them, and the poverty of their own theories in being unable to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;explain them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;They may be basic, but they're not certain.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Its not that beliefs are true through being had. Thats not a position Im 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;interested in. Thats relativism, that truth is subjective. I dont see many 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;people defending that. The unfalsifiable but nevertheless absolutely 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;certain fact that i exist is just derived from the fact there are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;experiences, it doesnt derive from the content of those experiences - 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;however 'deluded' they may be. I want to ask what is a delusion? what is a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;dream? Nuerons firing?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;All human experience is (I think) neurons firing - in a certain physical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;context.  Suppose we built a conscious robot (see John McCarthy's website), 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;then experience would be transistor gates switching.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I suppose it is hard to build from the cogito. Descartes didnt manage it. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;However, to ignore it altogether is just lazy and is hardly a argument 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;against those who dont.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I don't know what you mean.  Physics is just common sense pursued rigoursly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and common sense in built on perceptions.
