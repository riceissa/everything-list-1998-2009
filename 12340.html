OK Stathis, I happily concede your point in relation to our word 
<br />
'logical', but not in relation to 'reason'. Logic belongs to the 
<br />
tight-nit language of logico-mathematics but reason is *about* the real 
<br />
world and we cannot allow the self-deluding bullies and cheats of the 
<br />
world to steal *our* language!
<br />
<br />I like the way Dr Dorothy Rowe, a psychologist and writer [ another 
<br />
useful Australian export **] puts it: &quot;Power is the ability to get 
<br />
others to accept your description of the world.&quot; The cynical 
<br />
manipulators and spin doctors have no qualms about abusing language, in 
<br />
big part because they have no intention of accepting responsibility for 
<br />
all their actions. Of course none of us is guiltless in this regard but 
<br />
it falls to us who stand well away from the levers of power to speak the 
<br />
truth. We who are forced to watch as OUR hard earned tax dollars and 
<br />
investment savings [superannuation savings for example] get splurged on 
<br />
grand projects, invasions, and so forth, have a duty to SAY what is 
<br />
right. We may be wrong about some details but we sure as hell are not 
<br />
wrong when insisting that the truth be told.
<br />
<br />I certainly agree also that, in the case of the person standing on the 
<br />
parapet, what he or she believes about what they are doing - if we can 
<br />
find it out -  should cause us to try different methods of persuasion. 
<br />
Quite how one would tackle the 'logic' of the superhero's thinking, I 
<br />
don't know, perhaps offer to make improvements to his cape to improve 
<br />
the effect?  :-)   Whatever the details, I think that one aspect of the 
<br />
interaction that either type would require is the establishment of 
<br />
rapport, some degree of mutual empathy; not easy.
<br />
<br />The economist preparing to make war not love is very like the supposed 
<br />
scientists cooking up ever more 'attractive' tobacco products 'for our 
<br />
smoking pleasure'. I think that the only way people can bring themselves 
<br />
to do this is by cutting themselves off from those others who will 
<br />
become the victims. This is like so many other situations where a group 
<br />
or social class cuts it/themselves off from another class of persons. It 
<br />
may seem 'reasonable' where everyone involved in the planning agrees 
<br />
that there is no real alternative, or that the potential disadvantages 
<br />
accruing from not doing so will be too heavy a burden to bear. But it 
<br />
also entails a denial of empathy, and a closing off from a part of the 
<br />
world, an objective assertion that 'they are not us and we are not 
<br />
them'. This contains within it also a diminution of self, something that 
<br />
may not be recognised to start with and perhaps never understood until 
<br />
it is too late.
<br />
<br />Regards  
<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mark,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would still draw a distinction between the illogical and the foolish 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or unwise. Being illogical is generally foolish, but the converse is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not necessarily the case. The example I have given before is of a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person who wants to jump off the top of a tall building, either 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because (a) he thinks he is superman and will be able to fly or (b) he 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is reckless or suicidal. In both cases the course of action is unwise, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and we should try to stop him, but in (a) he is delusional while in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (b) he is not. It isn't just of academic interest, either, because the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; approach to stopping him from doing it again is quite different in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; each case. Similarly with the example of the economist, the approach 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to stopping him will be different depending on whether he is trying to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ruin the economy because he wants to or because he is incompetent or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; making decisions on false information.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; And yet I persist ... [the hiatus of familial duties and seasonal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; excesses now draws to a close [Oh yeah, Happy New Year Folks!]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; SP: 'If we are talking about a system designed to destroy the economy 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of a country in order to soften it up for invasion, for example, then 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; an economist can apply all his skill and knowledge in a perfectly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; reasonable manner in order to achieve this.'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; We should beware of conceding too much too soon. Something is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; reasonable only if it can truly be expected to fulfil the intentions 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of its designer. Otherwise it is at best logical but, in the kinds of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; context we are alluding to here, benighted and a manifestation of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; fundamentally diminished 'reason'. Something can only be 'reasonable' 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; it its context. If a proposed course of action can be shown to be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ultimately self defeating - in the sense of including its reasonably 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; predictably final consequences, and yet it is still actively 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; proposed, then the proposal is NOT reasonable, it is stupid. As far 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; as I can see, that is the closest we can get to an objective 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; definition of stupidity and I like it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Put it this way: Is it 'reasonable' to promote policies and projects 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that ultimately are going to contribute to your own demise or the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; demise of those whom you hold dear or, if not obviously their demise 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; then, the ultimate demise of all descendants of the aforementioned? I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; think academics, 'mandarins' and other high honchos should all now be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; thinking in these terms and asking themselves this question. The 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; world we now live in is like no other before it. We now live in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Modern era, in which the application and fruits of the application of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; scientific method are putting ever greater forms of power into the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; hands of humans. This process is not going to stop, and nor should we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; want it to I think, but it entails the ever greater probability that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the actions of any person on the planet have the potential to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; influence survival outcomes for huge numbers of others [if not the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; whole d*mned lot of us].
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I think it has always been true that ethical decisions and judgements 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; are based on facts to a greater extent than most people involved want 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to think about - usually because it's too hard and we don't think we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; have got the time and, oh yeah, 'it probably doesn't/won't matter' 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; about the details of unforeseen consequences because its only gonna 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; be lower class riff -raff who will be affected anyway or people of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the future who will just have to make shift for themselves. NOW 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; however we do not really have such an excuse; it is a cop-out to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; purport to ignore the ever growing interrelatedness of people around 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the planet. So it is NOT reasonable to treat other people as things. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; [I feel indebted to Terry Pratchett for pointing out, through the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; words of Granny Weatherwax I think it is, that there is only one sin, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; which is to treat another person as a thing.] I think a reasonable 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; survey and analysis of history shows that, more than anything else, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; treating other people as things rather than equal others has been the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; fundamental cause and methodology for the spread of threats to life 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and well being.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; You can see where I am going with this: in a similar way to that in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; which concepts of 'game theory' and probabilities of interaction 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; outcomes give us an objective framework for assessing purportedly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'moral' precepts, the existence now of decidedly non-zero chances of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; recursive effects resulting from one's own actions brings a deeper 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; meaning and increased rigour the realms of ethics and 'reason'. I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; don't think this is 'airy-fairy', I think it represents a dimension 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of reasoning which has always existed but which has been denied, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ignored or actively censored by the powerful and their 'pragmatic' 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; apologists and spin doctors. To look at a particular context [I am an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; EX Christian], even though the Bible is shonk as history or any kind 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of principled xxxxxxological analysis, it is instructive to look at 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the careers of the prophets and see how each involved a seemingly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; conventional formative period and then periods or a whole life of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; very risky ministry AGAINST the establishment because being true to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; their mission involved the prophet denouncing exploitation, greed and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; corruption.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; So let me wave my imaginary staff and rail from the top of my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; imaginary mountain:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'Sin is against reason! And that's a fact! So THERE! And don't you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; forget it, or you'll be sorry, or at least your children and their 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; children will become so! Put that in your pipes all you armchair 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; philosophers!'

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Stathis,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I am not entirely convinced when you say: 'And the psychopath is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; right: no-one can actually fault him on a point of fact or a point of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; logic'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; That would only be right if we allowed that his [psychopathy is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; mostly a male affliction I believe] use of words is easily as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; reasonable as yours or mine. However, where the said psycho. is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; purporting to make authoritative statements about the world, it is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; not OK for him to purport that what he describes is unquestionably 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; factual and his reasoning from the facts as he sees them is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; necessarily authoritative for anyone else. This is because, qua 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; psychopath, he is not able to make the fullest possible free 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; decisions about what makes people tick or even about what is reality 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; for the rest of us. He is, in a sense, mortally wounded, and forever 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; impaired; condemned always to make only 'logical' decisions. :-)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The way I see it, roughly and readily, is that there are in fact 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; certain statements/descriptions about the world and our place in it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; which are MUCH MORE REASONABLE than a whole lot of others. I think 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; therefore that, even though you might be right from a 'purely 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; logical' point of view when you say the following: 'In the *final* 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; analysis, ethical beliefs are not a matter of fact or logic, and if 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; it seems that they are then there is a hidden assumption somewhere'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; in fact, from the point of view of practical living and the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; necessities of survival, the correct approach is to assert what 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; amounts to a set of practical axioms, including:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  *   the mere fact of existence is the basis of value, that good and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; bad are expressed differently within - and between - different 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; cultures and their sub-cultures but ultimately there is an objective, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; absolute basis for the concept of 'goodness', because in all normal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; circumstances it is better to exist than not to exist,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  *   related to this and arising out of it is the realisation that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; all normal, healthy humans understand what is meant by both 'harm' 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and 'suffering', certainly those who have reached adulthood,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  *   furthermore, insofar as it is clearly recognisable that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; continuing to exist as a human being requires access to and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; consumption of all manner of natural resources and human-made goods 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and services, it is in our interests to nurture and further the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; inclinations in ourselves and others to behave in ways supportive of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; cooperation for mutual and general benefit wherever this is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; reasonably possible, and certainly not to act destructively or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; disruptively unless it is clear that doing so will prevent a much 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; greater harm from occurring.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It ought to be clear to all reasonable persons not engaged in self 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; deception that in this modern era each and everyone of us is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; dependent - always - on at least a thousand other people doing the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; right thing, or trying to anyway. Thus the idea of 'manly', rugged, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; individualism is a romantic nonsense unless it also incorporates a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; recognition of mutual interdependence and the need for real fairness 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; in social dealings at every level. Unless compassion, democracy and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ethics are recognised [along with scientific method] as fundamental 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; prerequisites for OUR survival, policies and practices will pretty 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; much inevitably become self-defeating and destructive, no matter how 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; well-intentioned to start with.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; In the interest of brevity I add the following quasi-axioms.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  *   the advent of scientific method on Earth between 400 and 500 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; years ago has irreversibly transformed the human species so that now 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; we can reasonably assert that the human universe is always 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; potentially infinite, so long as it exists and we believe it to be so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  *   to be fully human requires taking responsibility for one's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; actions and this means consciously choosing to do things or accepting 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that one has made a choice even if one cannot remember consciously 
</em><br />

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  *   nobody knows the future, so all statements about the future are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; either guesswork or statements of desires. Furthermore our lack of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; knowledge of times to come is very deep, such that we have no truly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; reasonable basis for dismissing the right to survive of any persons 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; on the planet - or other living species for that matter - unless it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; can be clearly shown that such killing or allowing to die, is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; necessary to prevent some far greater harm and the assertion of this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is of course hampered precisely by our lack of knowledge of the future
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; This feels incomplete but it needs to be sent.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I agree with you as far as advice for how to live a good life goes, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; but I guess where I disagree is on the technical matter of what we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; call reasonable. Peter Jones said that a system of economics designed 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to create universal poverty is not reasonable. I would agree *given* 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that the purpose of an economic system is not to create poverty. If 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; we are talking about a system designed to destroy the economy of a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; country in order to soften it up for invasion, for example, then an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; economist can apply all his skill and knowledge in a perfectly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; reasonable mannner in order to achieve this. The human values driving 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; an economic system, although we can predict what they might be in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; majority of cases, are subjective states and are beyond reason: this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is what I want, this is what I like, and you can't tell me otherwise. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; This stands in contrast to empirical statements such as &quot;the Earth is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; flat&quot;, which is true or false independently of what anyone thinks or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; wants.
