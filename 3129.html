<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;You continue to characterize those who disagree with you on this issue

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;as insane.  Do you mean this literally?  Or is it just a rhetorical

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    No, it's not a rhetorical technique.  Why would it be advantageous in

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;an

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;argument to be rude?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    I do mean it quite literally.  As far as I can tell, there people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;believe in illogical and dangerous things, for no apparent reason.  It's no

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;different than if they believed they can fly.
</em><br />
<br />I don't understand your objection. It seems to me that it is perfectly 
<br />
coherent to imagine a TOE which includes both a universal &quot;objective&quot; 
<br />
measure on the set of all observer-moments and also a relative conditional 
<br />
probability which tells me what the probability is I'll have experience B in 
<br />
the future if I'm having experience A right now. In statistics we have both 
<br />
absolute and conditional probability, so what's wrong with having the same 
<br />
thing in a TOE? I suppose one objection might be that once we have an 
<br />
objective measure, we understand everything we need to know about why I find 
<br />
myself having the types of experiences I do, and that defining an additional 
<br />
conditional probability measure on the set of all observer-moments would be 
<br />
purely &quot;epiphenomenal&quot; and inelegant. Is that what your problem with the 
<br />
idea is? I have my own pet theory about why a TOE including both absolute 
<br />
and conditional probability measures could actually be quite elegant, with 
<br />
each type of probability measure defining the other (like solving a large 
<br />
set of simultaneous equations to find the only self-consistent way to assign 
<br />
values to each variable), but I'll save that for another post.
<br />
<br />Another possible objection to the notion of a conditional probability 
<br />
measure would be the one you mentioned earlier, that it would seem to imply 
<br />
some weird idea of a propertyless &quot;soul&quot; that leaps around between different 
<br />
observer-moments (each defined as a certain computation, perhaps). I would 
<br />
point out, though, that there is a nice symmetry between this difficulty and 
<br />
a similar difficulty in understanding the meaning of the self-sampling 
<br />
assumption--what does it mean to say that &quot;I&quot; should reason as if I had an 
<br />
equal probability of being any one of all possible observer-moments? How 
<br />
could I be any observer-moment but the one I actually am? Perhaps a skeptic 
<br />
would caricature the self-sampling assumption by imagining a bunch of 
<br />
propertyless souls that have to draw straws to decide which observer-moment 
<br />
they'll end up &quot;becoming,&quot; but I don't think the difficulty visualizing what 
<br />
the SSA means really counts as a strong argument against it. Similarly, I 
<br />
don't think the difficulty with visualizing what &quot;conditional probability&quot; 
<br />
would mean is a strong objection to the idea, &quot;leaping&quot; nonwithstanding. 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From a first-person perspective you can see pretty clearly what it would 
</em><br />
mean--if I am about to step into a machine that will replicate one copy of 
<br />
me in heaven and one copy in hell, then as I step into the imaging chamber I 
<br />
will be in suspense about where I will find myself a moment from now, and if 
<br />
the conditional probability of each possible future observer-moment is 50% 
<br />
given my current observer-moment, then I will interpret that as a 50/50 
<br />
chance that I'm about to experience torture or bliss.
<br />
<br />Surely you agree that there is nothing *mathematically* incoherent about 
<br />
defining both absolute and conditional probability measures on the set of 
<br />
all observer-moments. So what's your basis for calling the idea &quot;crazy?&quot;
