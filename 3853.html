<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Causality is a fascinating topic and one I hope to learn

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more about, perhaps via the Pearl book Tim mentioned or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; another that someone might recommend. Here are some very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; random and disorganized thoughts on the topic.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Googling on &quot;causality&quot; led to a brief web page that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; summarized 2000 years of philosophical thought in a few
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; paragraphs,

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://www.helsinki.fi/~mqsalo/documents/causalit.htm">http://www.helsinki.fi/~mqsalo/documents/causalit.htm</a>.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Generally there seem to be two schools of thought; one is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that causality is an artifact of our minds' efforts to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand and interpret the world; the other is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; causality has objective reality.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The modern philosopher's definition of causality has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; always struck me as somewhat backwards: &quot;The cause of any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; event is a preceding event without which the event in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; question would not have occurred.&quot; This means that &quot;A
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; causes B&quot; is equivalent to A happening before B, plus the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logical proposition, &quot;if B then A&quot;. You'd think that A
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; causes B would mean &quot;if A then B&quot;. But philosophers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interpret it to mean &quot;if not-A then not-B&quot;, as stated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; above (I've read this elsewhere also), which is equivalent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to &quot;if B then A&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So if we say &quot;heavy rains cause flooding&quot; we mean that if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there were no heavy rains then there would be no flooding;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or equivalently, if there is flooding then there must have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; been heavy rains. This is consistent with there being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; heavy rains and no flooding. It really doesn't make sense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to me.
</em><br />
<br />Such definitions of &quot;causality&quot; seem to miss the point that
<br />
every event has mulitple causes and constraints and that
<br />
any one of them is neither necessary nor sufficient.  As
<br />
commonly used &quot;the cause&quot; is something(s) we consider could
<br />
have been otherwise.  Heavy rains may be rare and so it is
<br />
easy to suppose their absence.  In that case we would say
<br />
heavy rains caused the flooding.  But if you lived where
<br />
heavy rains were the rule, you'd more likely say something
<br />
like, &quot;The flooding was caused by insufficient foresight in
<br />
providing drainage.&quot;
<br />
...
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The real mystery is why our physical laws are time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; symmetric. A priori it does not seem to be absolutely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessary for life to evolve. I mean, of all sets of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical laws that allow life to evolve, will most be time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; symmetric? I'm not aware of any reason why this should be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the case.
</em><br />
<br />Some physicists (Hartle, Penrose, Gell-Mann) regard quantum
<br />
mechanics as defining an arrow of time more basic than the
<br />
statistical increase of entropy.  This QM AoT is defined by
<br />
the decoherence or 'collapse of the wave function'.  I
<br />
suppose the splitting of MW would be the same. However,
<br />
Bohm's QM is deterministic and doesn't have this QM AoT
<br />
even though it gives the same predictions as
<br />
non-relativistic QM. 
<br />
<br />...
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This elevates causality to having a functional role in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical world! It makes the difference between a system
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; having a mind and just being an elaborate tape recorder.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It means that we cannot view causality as just an artifact
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of our perceptions, it must be a true element of reality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That would put significant constraints on how philosophers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; treat the concept of causality.
</em><br />
<br />I don't see how a concept of causality can solve this
<br />
conundrum.  The 'computation' can be causal and yet so
<br />
simple that the mapping still does all the work.  I think
<br />
the answer lies in embedding computation within an
<br />
environment.  The reason the mapping can apparently do all
<br />
the work is because it is all at a symbolic level.  If you
<br />
imagine building a robot, the the 'brain' of the robot must
<br />
do computation taking information from sensors and
<br />
producing signals to actuators. Then it seems the question
<br />
of whether the robot has done a computation has operational
<br />
meaning and the conundrum doesn't arise.

There are two ways to write error-free programs.
<br />
Only the third one works.
