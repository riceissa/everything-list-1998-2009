<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Suppose there are only two logically possible deterministic universes A

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that until time T the history of these two universes are identical. At
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time T an experiment will be done in both universes. In universe A the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; outcome of the experiment will be &quot;a&quot;, and in universe B the outcome will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be &quot;b&quot;. If before time T you were given an opportunity to bet $10 that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; outcome is &quot;a&quot; at 1:1 odds, so that in universe A you would gain $10, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in universe B you would lose $10, Would you take the bet?
</em><br />
<br />Measure is not supposed to be just an abstract number that is attached
<br />
to a universe.  It has meaning in terms of our own perceptions and
<br />
experience in that universe.  The all-universe theory includes both a
<br />
model of universes which exist, and a way of relating our experiences of
<br />
consciousness to those universes.  In the theory, if there is a physical
<br />
system in the multiverse which is isomorphic to our own mental state, then
<br />
the probability of experiencing subjective consequences which correspond
<br />
to changes in that system will be proportional to its measure.  This is
<br />
a crucial linkage for the theory to have explanatory power, otherwise
<br />
our experiences would not need to have any connection to measure and it
<br />
would be a meaningless parameter.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The standard answer is yes, you should take it because A has greater
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure. But that assumes you care more about universes that have greater
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure than universes that have less measure. But you could say that you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't care about what happens in universe A, only about what happens in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe B, in which case you wouldn't take the bet. So it seems that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure only affects your decisions if it enters into your utility
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; function somehow, and it's not clear that it must.
</em><br />
<br />Think of a single-universe model with ordinary probability, where you
<br />
have a bet with a 90% chance of outcome A and 10% chance of outcome B.
<br />
Conventionally you should take the bet which maximizes your expectations
<br />
based on A occuring.  But you could imagine someone who only cared about
<br />
what happened if outcome B happened, and bet on B so that he would do
<br />
well in that unlikely case.  It's rational in a certain sense, but it
<br />
is going to lead to bad consequences in practice.
<br />
<br />These two examples are similar in that in each case you have to face the
<br />
reality that you are likely to subjectively experience outcome A.  In the
<br />
multiverse model that is part of the theory which relates subjective
<br />
experience to the physical model.  You can't escape the fact that the
<br />
subjective consequences of your actions will be based on measure.  So
<br />
I don't think you can ignore it or treat it as a parameter to be dealt
<br />
with as you like.
