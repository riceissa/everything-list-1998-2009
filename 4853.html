Hi,
<br />
<br />----- Original Message ----- 
<br />
From: &quot;Pete Carlton&quot; &lt;pmcarlton.domain.name.hidden&gt;
<br />
Subject: Re: Quantum accident survivor
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But in this case there is clearly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; no 'soul' or anything other than the configuration of atoms
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to describe what we call 'ourselves'. In any branching of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the multiverse there are multiple copies of my body being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; produced. Nevertheless, I only experience one of those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; states. Therefore, I guess the best I could say is that ' I '
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is one of the instances of this configuration.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; When it becomes difficult to say things about &quot;I&quot;, I find it helps to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attempt to cast the entire situation into 3rd-person terms.  I would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; say here that under MWI (and UD, and the rest..) there is a ensemble of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entities more or less similar to Eric.  Some of these are different 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; enough that they could be considered different people (such as the Eric 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; who inherited a billion dollars when he was 12 years old), some of them 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quite similar (such as the Eric who lives where the ambient room 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; temperature is 2 degrees colder) and some of them are so similar 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (different only temporarily or unnoticeably, or at the quantum level) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that they can't be told apart.  &quot;Individual Eric&quot;s within the ensemble 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can be seen to actually each consist in a fuzzy set of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indistinguishable Erics.  The &quot;boundaries&quot; between sets demarcate where 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; differences at the finest-grained levels start to make a difference at 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; levels that an Eric can notice, given the kinds of observations he's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; making.  The boundaries being &quot;fuzzy&quot; means just that there is no fact 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the matter which other copies are really &quot;you&quot; and which are not.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is not a problem!  Well, it is a problem if you insist on some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definition of &quot;I&quot;, like that of Descartes, that rules this out; then 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you must argue for that definition.
</em><br />
<br />In a materialistic framework, ' I ' am a bunch of atoms. These atoms
<br />
happen to constitute a system that has self-referential qualities that
<br />
we call consciousness. If it happened that these atoms temporarily 
<br />
(like in a coma or anesthesy) or permanently (death) lose this quality,
<br />
so will ' I '.
<br />
It is not useful to talk about 1st person experiences in 3rd person
<br />
terms, since when we do that we lose the very thing that we want
<br />
to study.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Let me stress this point: *I am, for all practical purposes,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; one and only one specific configuration of atoms in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; specific universe. I could never say that ' I ' is ALL the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; copies, since I NEVER experience what the other copies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; experience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here I think you're making an assumption. You are certainly not ALL the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; copies, but then it doesn't follow that you are only 1.  &quot;You&quot; could be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a fuzzy set of copies that have experiences so similar that they cannot 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be told apart.  That is, they cannot be told apart &gt;yet&lt;.  Unnoticeable 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; differences eventually can percolate up and make a noticeable 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; difference, or they can be made noticeable by making more sensitive 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observations.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, I am making an assumption, and working through it. The 
<br />
assumption is that there is nothing external to the physical body to
<br />
account for consciousness. A particular atom interacts with the atoms
<br />
or other particles in its universe only (interference is not interaction).
<br />
Therefore a set of atoms do the same. All experience comes from the
<br />
interactons that take place in a particular universe. There are certainly
<br />
a set of universes so similar that cannot be told apart. But after any
<br />
event (like a particle's interaction with another, or someone's death at
<br />
a larger scale) these universes have decohered enough so that you
<br />
cannot equalize them anymore.
<br />
I think that when people respond to this question they forget the
<br />
assumption that I am making and argue assuming other philosophical
<br />
framework.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; When some people suppose that our next experience is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; necessarily one of the alive ones, they are tacitly assuming
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a dualistic position.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think they are indeed making an assumption, but not necessarily a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dualistic one.  They are making the assumption that there is always a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;way out&quot; - that in every set of &quot;I&quot;'s who encounter a dangerous 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; situation, there is always at least one that has a continuation.  There 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is no need to postulate some &quot;soul&quot; leaping from one body-copy to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; another.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If a large set of Eric-equivalents encounter a really dangerous 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; situation, most will not continue, but as long as this assumption holds:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;(The set of reasonably similar Eric-equivalents) contains
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (The set of Erics who are unnoticeably different from you) which 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contains
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (The set of Erics who have a living continuation after event X)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which has at least one member.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then you will not experience yourself dying.  I think this is how 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; materialism can accomodate QTI.  I do think a better attack on QTI is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the final part of the above assumption (the last set has at least 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one member) isn't well-argued for.  Even if these Eric-sets are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; infinite there may not be an Eric who survives, say, the sun exploding; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just as the infinite set of composite numbers doesn't contain any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; primes.
</em><br />
<br />I do partially agree with the above. I am not disputing the fact that
<br />
there will be 'Erics' who will survive any dangerous situation. But we
<br />
are forgetting the fact that most of them will in fact die! And the
<br />
probability that I am one of them is just the measure of those universes
<br />
where I die. Do you agree that SOME people die? If you are not a
<br />
solipsist and you are a materialist, then you must agree that those
<br />
people, which had nothing external to their bodies, have just lost their
<br />
consciousness and will never regain it, even if in other universes, a copy
<br />
of these people do in fact survive. So since you are no different from
<br />
the other people, you must agree that you have the same probability of
<br />
dying at any event.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But if we decide to accept a dualistic framework QTI would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; probably be the least probable scenario. We could as well say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that the next experience would be of many other kinds: in other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; bodies, reincarnation, or any transcedental experience like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; going to heaven - there is no reason to decide between these.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   I think this reduces to the white rabbit problem again.  The next 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience could *always* be of many other kinds, whether we've just 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; had a dangerous event or not.  I think it is an interesting question 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; though, for surviving a fall from a cliff, say, certainly seems like a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;white rabbit&quot; event.  Perhaps one would conjecture that under QTI, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;white rabbit&quot; events that allow incredible survival must still be as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mediocre as possible.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; For instance, QTI poses a difficulty for the dualist: at each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; moment, if QTI and is true, an infinity of 'souls' is merging into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; one single body, since this body is dying at an infinity of other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; universes. How does this square with the common definition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of a 'soul' as an immaterial *individuality*?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think this is the least of dualism's problems..=)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Best regards,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Pete
