</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Laugh if you want but one day we will be obliged to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;put clearly our ontological carts on the table [...]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Well, let me recall you mine: numbers. (natural numbers,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;positive integers).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;[...]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;And I am a classical platonist about the truth on numbers and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;their relations, definable or relatively definable ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;My scientific (third person) ontology = numbers and their relations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But then I accept intensional interpretations, which adds
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in my set of &quot;ontological truth&quot; the whole of computer science,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;provability logics, ... and ... you and me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;First person ontology includes the physical laws and you, and me.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not sure what you mean by much of the above.  e.g. 3rd person, 
<br />
numbers' relations, &quot;accept&quot;, intensional interpretations, 1st person.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a platonist, like I said.  The specifics of my position will be 
<br />
clarified below.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;I take it, from your above statement, that you do not object to my use of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the term &quot;implemented&quot;.  It seems that, in fact, your claim that while I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have a problem because I need a precise definition of &quot;implementation&quot;, you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;supposedly don't, was totally groundless.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Implementation must be some sort of relative computations.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know what you mean by the above, or why you said it.  Also, it 
<br />
does not seem to be a response to my above point.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;    It's hard to define &quot;existence&quot;, isn't it?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;No. Positive integers exists. Nothing else.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must point out that you in no way addressed the question of defining 
<br />
&quot;existence&quot;.  I am sure you do not mean to say that it is defined as 
<br />
positive integers!  To be pedantic, it is obvious that &quot;the square of 2&quot; is 
<br />
defined to be &quot;2 x 2&quot; and is not just defined to be &quot;4&quot;, even though we 
<br />
agree (after laborious calculation!) that the number 4 has the property in 
<br />
question.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I have no problem if you want more, but in general I don't need it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The &quot;right&quot; frontier is somehow arbitrary.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arbritrary ain't good.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Certainly, I would say that whatever structure is responsible for my own 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;thoughts must exist in this sense.  I only distinguish a &quot;strong sense&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;from the weaker sense used in mathematics, which basically just means 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;self-consistent.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Consistency is an attribute of theories or machines or talking ducks,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not of mathematical object like numbers.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We seem to disagree on what a mathematical object is.  For me, anything 
<br />
that can be described mathematically counts as a mathematical structure.  Of 
<br />
course, an inconsistent description does not describe any math structure.  
<br />
It is not always obvious whether a given description is consistent or not, 
<br />
and one way discussion of such a question is often framed is in terms of 
<br />
whether the hypothetical structure that would be described 'exists'.  (e.g. 
<br />
&quot;Does a power series expansion for f(x) exist?&quot;)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Your use of &quot;basically&quot; hide a confusion between an object and a machine's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;conception of that object.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't think so.  (Whatever you mean.)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are perhaps three kinds of 'existence' to distinguish.  
<br />
If a mathematical structure could (in principle) be described, then it 
<br />
exists in the weakest sense.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A classical Platonist would say that the structure belongs in Plato's 
<br />
heaven of math; it's a feature of the world which is logically necessary.  
<br />
This is an intermediate form of existance.  (Such an object need not have 
<br />
any finite description, BTW.)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's define a quantum Platonist as one who goes a step further and says 
<br />
Plato's realm of math is no heaven, but includes our Earth.  This implies 
<br />
the AUH.  Unlike the classical position, this requires a unique and 
<br />
inevitable *measure distribution* on the set of mathematical structures.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My position is that either the classical or the quantum Platonist 
<br />
position is true, with the latter being more likely (as it explains why 
<br />
we're here, but in its disfavor it demands a measure distribution).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;You cannot just say physical = mathematical.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I agree of course, but it is not obvious. It is part of our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;work to make that clear. In particular, in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that case, we must be able to prove F = ma, or SE.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  We use &quot;physical&quot; to refer to the structure that we guess exists in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;strong sense.  If you believe in the AUH, then the distinction disappears.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Most people don't.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The distinction disappears ontologically only, but the appearance
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the distinction does not disappear and must be explained.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would certainly like to be able to do that.  Unfortunately, as I have 
<br />
argued in other posts, the AUH is not falsifiable, so even if we prove that 
<br />
F=ma is very unlikely for us to see with the AUH, we are still stuck with 
<br />
the AUH.  But it would be very unsatisfactory, of course.  We need to derive 
<br />
F=ma not to prove the AUH, but to make ourselves happy with it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;    Leave Everett alone, he is dead and can't defend himself against your 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;abuse of his name.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;How dare you saying that! And beside have you read Everett?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I quote it:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&lt;&lt;We shall be able to introduce into the theory systems which represent 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observers. Such systems can be conceived as automatically functioning 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;machines (servomechanisms) possessing recording devices (memory) and which 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are capable of responding to their environment. The behavior of these 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observers shall always be treated within the framework of wave mechanics. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Furthemore, we shall deduce the probabilistic assertions of Process 1 [the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;collapse] as *subjective* appearances to such observers, thus placing the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;theory in correspondence with experience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;We are then led to a novel situation in which the formal theory is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;objectively continuous and causal while subjectively discontinuous and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probabilistic.&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(The theory of the universal wave function, Everett in DeWitt &amp; Graham
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;page 9).
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For me the key word is &quot;appearances&quot;.  I am sure Everett did NOT believe 
<br />
in any discontinuous or probabilistic elements in his interpetation.  
<br />
Rather, he believed that, for a _typical_ observer-moment, that thought 
<br />
would include _seemingly random_ information which gave the _illusion_ or 
<br />
randomness, just like a typical member of the ordered set 000 001 010 011 
<br />
100 101 110 111 &quot;looks like&quot; a random #.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My interpretation of Everett is proved by his statement that &quot;The 
<br />
behavior of these observers shall always be treated within the framework of 
<br />
wave mechanics.&quot;  This indicates that he did NOT intend to introduce any 
<br />
&quot;mind-like hidden variables&quot; - and thus, no &quot;1st person&quot; merde about 
<br />
consciousness &quot;flowing&quot; from one observer-moment to another.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;In my thought experience (UDA and the like) I use *exactly* the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Everett notion of subjective/objective. I call them first person and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;third person as in classical philosophy of mind.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You just don't understand Everett, it appears.  As far as I can tell, 
<br />
his beliefs were normal (as opposed to crackpot/1st person/mind-like hidden 
<br />
variable/QTI).  Of course, his model of the observer is seriously flawed (it 
<br />
is not a computationalist model and does not address the reasons for 
<br />
considering a given set of states to be a 'memory'), but I am sure he would 
<br />
be the first to admit that it was a good first iteration in what he knew, 
<br />
right from the beginning, would be a long process toward a truly precise 
<br />
interpretation of QM.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;I'm sure that ... he would find my approach to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;be the logical next step for the MWI.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now I have the definitive evidence that you or your ancestor are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;french, Monsieur Jacques Mallah, le roi Lion.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bien sur.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Sure. Yes. UD implements all computations, and even all 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;implementations of all computations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  Great.  So you need a precise definition of &quot;implementation&quot; in order 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to find the measure distribution.  So much for your claim not to need it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It is the other way round. I know it is hard to swallow or even just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to realise I'm serious (and not just poetical) but the physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;emerges from the wole set of possible consistent continuations, so that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the &quot;physical implementation&quot; appears only in the logical end.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;An another way to put it is that the physical world is defined by all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;implementations with the weaker sense of any relative computation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;No first person can ever know how it is implemented.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;With comp the solidity of the physical worlds is a result of the complete 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;invariance of first person experience for change among implementations.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stand by my above statement.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Anything real can be stated in objective terms.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I totally agree with you. In particular subjective experience are real,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and objective proposition can be stated on them (through informal or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;formal definition).
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is an objective measure distribution, therefore no QTI or 
<br />
other '1st person' nonsense.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;If you say, prior to the duplication &quot;I will either end up
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;in Washington xor in Moscow&quot;, that's an objectively false statement.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Correct. I hope you will agree that if you say , prior to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;duplication, &quot;I will feel myself ending up
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in Washington xor in Moscow&quot;, that's an objectively true statement.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(objectively with comp).
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.  (Or at least, incomplete.)  It all really depends on the definition 
<br />
of &quot;me&quot;.  At this point I can think of three reasonable ways to define it, 
<br />
but none of them would lead to that statement.  The simplest definition is 
<br />
to define 'me' as a thought; then I exist only for a moment and never leave 
<br />
my home city.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The closest to what you want would be to define 'me' as a particular 
<br />
implementation of a computation.  I believe that in this case, some of 'us' 
<br />
would die, some of us would end up in Moscow, while the rest of 'us' would 
<br />
end up in Washington.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But because the total measure increases in the copying process, bear in 
<br />
mind that a # of implementations must also be created.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say that the original implementations would die or split up, but be 
<br />
joined by their newly created brothers in the new cities.  (Mathematically, 
<br />
recall that I am referring to sets of mappings which satisfy the transition 
<br />
rules in question.  A mapping could refer both to my original body and to 
<br />
the particles used to create a new body; such a mapping could survive the 
<br />
transition.  I should study this more carefully, e.g. to find out if the 
<br />
fraction that do this is large or negligable.)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I could define 'me' as the set of all such implementations.  
<br />
Then I should say &quot;I will feel myself ending up in Washington and not in 
<br />
Moscow, _as well as_ in Moscow and not in Washington.&quot;  (In different 
<br />
observer-moments, of course.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The difference between the first person and the third person is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; basically the same as the difference between having an headache and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;having a friend having an headhache.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;    The above statement makes no sense, unless it is the same as the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;difference between having a headache, and having had a headache.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Perhaps. Sure if you are willing to believe there is eventually only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;one person. I am open to that idea but quite not convince yet.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's all a matter of definition, but I have always thought the above to 
<br />
be a problem for the '1st person' view.  What does differentiate different 
<br />
people?
