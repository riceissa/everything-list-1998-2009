<br />I agree with Jerry here. What paradox ? What error ?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The first shift in coordinate has to do with 1st and 3rd person.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Jerry does not see that awareness is a 1st person phenomenon. 
</em><br />
<br />I'm not sure that Jerry does not see that awareness is a 1st person 
<br />
phenomenon.
<br />
When Jerry says:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Are you arguing that a program has to be run before SAS's embodied 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  in that program experience consciousness? I totally disagree with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  this approach, which some people call'computationalism'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  (confusingly), don't they?
</em><br />
<br />I guess that he is talking about Jacques Mallah type of physical
<br />
&nbsp;computationalism where there is a need for a &quot;real physical running&quot;
<br />
of the machine for consciousness to appear, and so there is a need
<br />
for a &quot;real universe&quot; whatever that means.
<br />
<br />GSLevy:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So those 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;creature in the universe of Life believe themselves to be conscious ( in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;first person) 
</em><br />
<br />OK.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;but from the Great Programmer perspective (3rd person) or from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;any sophisticated external observer they are not.
</em><br />
<br />Why do you want making these poor little creatures to be
<br />
wrong ? And wrong about their own feelings. 
<br />
<br />How could someone believe to be conscious without being conscious ? 
<br />
Consciousness is a &quot;pure&quot; first person phenomenon.
<br />
<br /><br />You *do* believe in 
<br />
zombies, don't you ? I mean you think that those creatures are
<br />
exactly like us, but that they are unconscious ?
<br />
<br />Schmidhuber's, not to talk about Tegmark's, universes, or the little 
<br />
simple big
<br />
everything, all that would be full of creatures believing wrongly they 
<br />
feel ?
<br />
<br />And how could you know you are not among those creatures?
<br />
<br />(Of course in the UDA it is an *hypothesis* that those machines are 
<br />
(relatively) correct.)
<br />
<br />\begin{for the modalist}
<br />
But even without that hypothesis you can also just modelize the 
<br />
correcteness 
<br />
of the machine by []p -&gt; p, or just by consistency &lt;&gt;T. 
<br />
(Jacques Baihache suggests me that I use [] for the modal box and &lt;&gt; for 
<br />
the
<br />
diamond.) Remeber that [] and &lt;&gt; are interdefinissable: &lt;&gt;p can be seen 
<br />
as an 
<br />
abreviation of -[]-p, and []p can be seen as an abreviation of -&lt;&gt;-p)
<br />
Remember that in classical propositional logic -p is equivalent to p-&gt;F, 
<br />
so that &quot;[]F - &gt;F&quot; is equivalent to -[]F, which is equivalent to &lt;&gt;T.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
And let us interview the SRC machine through G and its Guardian Angel G*.
<br />
(SRC = self-referentially-correct)
<br />
Well the machine seems to remain silent on &lt;&gt;T. The Angel tell us the 
<br />
machine is correct (G* proves []p -&gt; p), and consistent (G* proves &lt;&gt;T), 
<br />
and he did tell us  that the machine cannot know it, nor justify it 
<br />
(G* proves -[]([]p-&gt;p) and G* proves -[]&lt;&gt;T).
<br />
Quite the reverse of you, it seems. The little SRC creature seems a little
<br />
bit wiser about what she know.
<br />
\end{for the modalist}
<br />
<br />This will not convince you, nor is it intended to convince you. Just to 
<br />
tell
<br />
you my opinion and the SRC machine's opinion, and its Guardian Angel's, 
<br />
opinion. Which is Jerry's opinion too if I
<br />
understand and interpret him correctly.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The second shift has to do with the action of running the program. Before 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computer is started, these creatures in the Life Universe do not exist in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;our 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;*time*. Their time is frozen - compared to ours - so from our point of view 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;they are not conscious. They are just a bunch of inert bits. When the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computer runs, their time becomes like ours and now they appear to be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;conscious.
</em><br />
<br />&quot;Running&quot; a machine is a modality which makes sense only relatively
<br />
to you. That relative running makes it possible for the machine to
<br />
manifest its consciousness relatively to you. It makes possible
<br />
to entangled and share computationnal histories. But consciousness per se
<br />
is not linked to the dynamical physical activity itself.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Resolution of this paradox illustrates the relativistic issues in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observation process and in particular the relativistic quality of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;1st/3rd 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;person point of view.  
</em><br />
<br />I don't understand.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The relativity of information in terms of mutual 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;information as defined by Claude Shannon has deep consequences in physics 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that, I feel, should be explored. In this context, Hawkings has made a major 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;breakthrough in the understanding of black holes by relating entropy to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;their 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;size.
</em><br />
<br />I agree although I'm not sure to see the relevance here.
<br />
<br />Perhaps you are correct on all the points in which case comp should
<br />
be wrong (or my reasoning!).
<br />
