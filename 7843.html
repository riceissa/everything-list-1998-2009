<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Well, maybe some of the above helped to explain it. Basing stuff
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;on &quot;1st person&quot; has a long history. That's what everyone, it seems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;to me, did before the scientific era (about 1600?). So far as I know, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;nothing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;has ever come of it.
</em><br />
<br />Its been the cornerstone of modern philosophy since the 1600's. It defines 
<br />
the moment the 'scientific era' begins. In the realm of indubitable facts, 
<br />
that I exist is one of them. It is established to me, for myself if not you, 
<br />
just by the fact I have 1st person experiences going on. No doubt you know 
<br />
this, perhaps it will incur your ire that Im reminding you of it, but this 
<br />
subjective fact unfalsifiable though it is, has more certainty than any 
<br />
'objective' scientific truth. Why not build from this certainty?
<br />
<br />wrt sarcasm, because it is common amungst scientific realists and their ilk. 
<br />
It isnt really sarcasm at all, its exasperation - directed at themselves. It 
<br />
stems from the fact that they cant marry third person descriptions with 
<br />
first person descriptions. They cant reduce the one to the other in any 
<br />
appreciable way. To employ realist form to a non realist position one might 
<br />
sigh, and go 'Oh come on! how can a description of cells, chemicals and 
<br />
compounds ever match up with the feeling that corresponds to being apart 
<br />
from a lover, or whatever'.
<br />
<br />To be sure, psychological facts might ultimately be found to reduce to to 
<br />
phisiological facts, but right now, phisiological language simply has not 
<br />
accrued the explanatory or descriptive power, for all the Daniel Dennets, to 
<br />
do the same to psychological language. I cant see that the latter reduces to 
<br />
the former at all.
<br />
<br />Ofcourse, linguistically trained goats might yak on about their perceptions, 
<br />
as Lee points out, but is that reason to ignore 'subjective experience'? The 
<br />
perjorative nature of words like 'yak' do not change the fact the goats are 
<br />
yakking about something certain to them, whilst all else they yakked about 
<br />
would be to a greater or lesser degree uncertain. Its true, we should expect 
<br />
them to yak on as they might, but im not sure that gets us anywhere, because 
<br />
Newton was not suprised when the apple fell. There are suprising results in 
<br />
science but they are reached by a consideration of what is normal and 
<br />
expected.
<br />
<br />Realism is the philosophical equivolent to Ebenezer Scrooges dictum 'Bah 
<br />
Humbug!'. The intractability of phenomenology leads realists to ignore it 
<br />
entirely. Notice that the argument is weaker than a complete denial of 
<br />
phenomenology - sometimes it gets that absurd - but rather a conclusion that 
<br />
it is 'irrelevent' to any meaningful description of the world. 'Meaningfull' 
<br />
no doubt has a pragmatic definition in such arguments, and 'pragmatic' 
<br />
implies some sense of 'ability to manipulate the world'. Whatever, I think 
<br />
the feeling that definitions are being pushed on us is natural. Knowledge is 
<br />
being limited semantically, through narrower and narrower definitions.
<br />
<br />Even here its odd, mental abberations like blind sight help us moderate our 
<br />
third person descriptions of how brains operate only by recourse to 1st 
<br />
person accounts of what has been perceived. So, these useless things have 
<br />
some use. Perhaps this is evidence for quantum mind theories? the existance 
<br />
of a phenomenological use/useless duality. Perhaps Realism is just a bit 
<br />
inconsistant.
<br />
<br />Private subjective experiences exist more certainly than the objective and 
<br />
public world. It requires a satisfactory explanation, it isnt that 
<br />
convincing to watch it continually ignored . Futhermore, in ignoring it, 
<br />
disciplines that have every right to be described as scientific, rational 
<br />
and illuminating suddenly become 'soft' and suspect.
<br />
<br />Regards
<br />
<br />Chris.
