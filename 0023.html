<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I now think that I was probably wrong about this, but I still don't

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand why. Suppose our administrator takes the universal wave

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; function (which assuming the Everett Postulate never collapses during
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; normal evolution), collapses it into a position eigenfunction according to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the familiar probabilistic rules, and then examines the resulting position
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; eigenfunction, treating it a sort of snapshot. Now if he just picks a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; random volume of space to look at, chances are he would see some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unstructured interstellar gas. But with probability of about 2^-L, where L
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is the length of a complete uncompressed description of my brain (WDB),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the volume of gas he sees would by coincidence turn out to have the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; positional structure as WDB. If I'm to believe that I'm much more likely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to be currently instantiated as a brain made of organic chemicals rather
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than of interstellar gas, it must be that the probability of finding the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; organic brain is much higher than 2^-L, which implies that it takes much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; less than L bits of information to find a description of WDB in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universal wave function. However I do not know how to derive this from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; principles of quantum mechanics.
</em><br />
<br />So, the idea is that there is some probability that your brain could
<br />
form spontaneously in intergalactic space, and that probability per
<br />
brain-volume would be approximately 2^-L?
<br />
<br />One thing I note is that you have introduced the idea of an &quot;uncompressed&quot;
<br />
description of the brain, which is not clearly defined.  Earlier you had
<br />
just asked about the information needed to describe the brain, without
<br />
reference to whether it was compressed or not.  Probably there is no upper
<br />
limit on ways of writing a description of the brain in uncompressed form,
<br />
so L as described here is ambiguous.
<br />
<br />For this particular case, you need to look at the actual physical
<br />
nature of the intergalactic medium in order to calculate the odds of it
<br />
spontaneously forming some structure.  This will no doubt be related
<br />
to the complexity of the structure, but I'm not sure it would simply
<br />
be exponential in the length of a description of the structure.  Or at
<br />
least you would have to set up your description language in a certain way.
<br />
<br />For example, intergalactic space is composed almost entirely of hydrogen
<br />
atoms.  The occasional carbon or oxygen is going to be very, very rare.
<br />
So the form of the description language would have to take that into
<br />
consideration.
<br />
<br />Then there is the extremely low density, which is going to have to
<br />
increase by something like 30 orders of magnitude over the norm in
<br />
order to form your brain.  Does that just mean you have to look at 10^30
<br />
volumes the size of your brain?  I don't think so.  You'd have to look
<br />
at a lot more than 10 brain-volumes to find one with a density ten times
<br />
the norm.  I think there may be an exponential factor just based on
<br />
the density.  (Sorry to be so vague; it's been a long time since I've
<br />
studied thermodynamics.)  So somehow the length L would have to become
<br />
longer to reflect the higher density of your brain, which doesn't seem
<br />
like a natural way for a description to behave.
