</em><br />
<br />That describes different proposals for physical mechanisms for efficiently
<br />
solving NP-complete problems: things like quantum computing variants,
<br />
relativity, analog computing, and so on.  He actually looked at a claim
<br />
that soap bubble films effectively solve NP complete problems and tested
<br />
it himself, to find that they don't work.
<br />
<br />He also discusses time travel and even what we call quantum suicide,
<br />
where you kill yourself if the machine doesn't guess right.
<br />
<br />I am skeptical though about something he says in conclusion:  &quot;Even many
<br />
computer scientists do not seem to appreciate how different the world
<br />
would be if we could solve NP-complete problems efficiently....  If such
<br />
a procedure existed, then we could quickly find the smallest Boolean
<br />
circuits that output (say) a table of historical stock market data,
<br />
or the human genome, or the complete works of Shakespeare.  It seems
<br />
entirely conceivable that, by analyzing these circuits, we could make
<br />
an easy fortune on Wall Street, or retrace evolution, or even generate
<br />
Shakespeare's 38th play.  For broadly speaking, that which we can compress
<br />
we can understand, and that which we can understand we can predict....
<br />
if we could solve the general case - if knowing something was tantamount
<br />
to knowing the shortest efficient description of it - then we would be
<br />
almost like gods.&quot;
<br />
<br />This doesn't seem right to me, the notion that an NP solving oracle
<br />
would be able to find the shortest efficient description of any data.
<br />
That would require a more complex oracle, one that would be able to
<br />
solve the halting problem.
<br />
<br />I think Aaronson is blurring the lines between finding the smallest
<br />
Boolean circuit and finding the smallest efficient description.  Maybe
<br />
finding the smallest Boolean circuit is in NP; it's not obvious to me
<br />
but it's been a while since I've studied this stuff.  But even if we
<br />
could find such a circuit I'm doubtful that all the rest of Aaronson's
<br />
scenario follows.
