<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; see

<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the universe as &quot;NOT COMPUTER&quot;, not some function of the

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; X,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the model. Eg The first person perspective of a register in a

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; computer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; holding a quantity N must be that of being a register in a

computer,
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; that of 'being' a quantity N.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; Interestingly you see it as the perspective of the register, rather
</em><br />
than some computational entity within X. Does this imply some sort of
<br />
hardware/ substrate experiential dependency, rather than a purely
<br />
relational 'program-level' view?
<br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Sort of...but I think the word 'hardware' is loaded with assumption.
</em><br />
I'd
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that universe literally is a relational construct
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A timeless relational construct or an evolving relational construct ?
</em><br />
<br />Evolving. The evolution of the construct from state to state makes it feel
<br />
like there is time.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and that it's appearance
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; as 'physical' is what it is like when you are in it. .ie.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Presumably, what is *necessarily* like when you are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in it , since there is no contingency in Platonia.
</em><br />
<br />Platonia has not been instantiated. Our universe has. Our universe may
<br />
act, somewhere, somehow, as if it were interacting with entities in
<br />
platonia, but that does not make platonic entities 'real' any more than
<br />
real/imaginary power vectors delivered out your power-outlet make the
<br />
square root of -1 real.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I await an apriori deduction of qualia from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relational structures....
</em><br />
<br />Why stop there? What about an a-priori deduction of mass from relational
<br />
structures? Or space? Or electric fields? Or gravity? All the same...and
<br />
none of these have been predicted by any abstract model or 'lumpy/thingy'
<br />
ontological thinking. The abstract model predicts things that behave
<br />
'model'-ly. Parameters/variables in the model match adequately when
<br />
compared to reality. They do not describe what it is actually made of....
<br />
<br />f = ma says nothing about what mass is. It says what mass _does_.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; There's no such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'thing' as a 'thing'. :-) It doesn't mean that behaving 'as if' there
</em><br />
are
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; such things as things is not useful...we survive that way...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'Substrate' in my intended context would mean more like 'whatever it is
</em><br />
that
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the universe is, it is that'. Our predisposition to assume isolated
</em><br />
lumpy
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'thingness' is rather pervasive.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course: it is well founded empirically. We have abundant
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evidence that only certaint things exist within a given spatial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; volume (contingency) that they endure through time, and so on.
</em><br />
<br />No. We have abundant evidence of some'thing' behaving as per an
<br />
abstraction of 'thing' at the scales we explore. We have NOT proven that
<br />
these laws apply at all scales..indeed we have abundant evidence to the
<br />
contrary! Absense of evidence is not evidence of absense.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Timeless universe, universes where everything that can exist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does exist, are not well founded empirically.
</em><br />
<br />No they are not. Again a mathematical model (quantum mechanics) that seems
<br />
to imply multiple universes does not mean that they exist....Only that the
<br />
model makes it look like it does. I can imagine any number of situations
<br />
where the fuzziness of the ultra-scale world obeys the rules of a QM-like
<br />
model.
<br />
<br />For example, the perfectly deterministicly repeated trajectory of whatever
<br />
an electron is made of through 35.4 spatial dimensions is going to look
<br />
awfully fuzzy to critters observing it as course scales within 3
<br />
dimensions. QM depicts fuzziness... and 'aha' the universe is made of QM?
<br />
Not so. It merely appears to obey the abstraction QM provides us.
<br />
<br />QM says nothing about what the universe is actually constructed of. It is
<br />
not constructed of quantum mechanics! It is constructed of something that
<br />
behaves quantum mechanical-ly.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Perhaps this:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Waving a bit of it ('stuff', the relational-substrate) around in a
</em><br />
circle
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (for example) in indirect 'as-if' symbolic representation as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; computation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of an abstraction X in no way instantiates X or Xness,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why not? What *does* implementation consist of ?
</em><br />
<br />Being the stuff, the substrate. It's the only thing actually instantiated.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  it instantiates
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'being_waved_around_in_a_circle_ness' from the point of view of being
</em><br />
the
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'stuff' (1st person) and the behaviour 'waving_around_in_a_circle_ly'
</em><br />
(3rd
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; person). Note that the 3rd person is actually derived from the 1st
</em><br />
person
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; perspective of the observer! This third person can pretend
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'waving_around_in_a_circle_ly' is X, but that's all there is...play
</em><br />
acting.
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The third person perspective is manufactured in the eyes of the
</em><br />
beholder.
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Perhaps rather than '1st Person Prime' as an assertion, maybe '3rd
</em><br />
person
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; not prime' is a lesser and more justified position. The fact is that
</em><br />
there
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is no such thing as a 'third person'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ontologically ?
</em><br />
<br />No, experientially.
<br />
<br />Nobody experiences 'third person'. Everybody has a 1st person experience
<br />
only. There is no such thing as an objective view. There is merely
<br />
behaviour called objectivity which serves to extract regularities which
<br />
subsequently become described with natural laws. If you care to treat the
<br />
collection of natural laws as a kind of 'lens' through which to view the
<br />
universe, then that view could be regarded as a 'third person view'. But
<br />
nobody ever has that view. The universe thus viewed does not exist. The
<br />
ontology of that view does not exist.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; What you have is a communicable 1st
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; person perspective that yet another 'first person perspective' can find
</em><br />
if
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; it looks. No-one ever has a 'third person' perspective.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Epistemologically ?
</em><br />
<br />No. Experientially.
<br />
<br />See above. The collection of laws as a set of beliefs is _not_ a third
<br />
person perspective. Adopting the beliefs results in behaviours that enable
<br />
the prediction of 1st person experiences (the behaviour of the natural
<br />
world as observed). This is how science works. This behaviour (acting as
<br />
if the natural laws ran the universe) instantates the causal ancestry of
<br />
all our technology. It really works ..but..
<br />
Any further attribution of natural laws beyind the status of (albeit
<br />
highly structured and systematically calibrated) beliefs is not justified.
<br />
=======================
<br />
<br />The fundamental and, IMO fatal assumption being made here and throughout
<br />
this thread, is that a _description_ of the universe acquired/validated
<br />
with 1st person experience (= our only and entire source of scientific
<br />
evidence) necessarily means that a natural law thus established is
<br />
literally involved in the structure and causal necessities of the
<br />
universe. This is plain unjustified nonsense.
<br />
<br />What we get with empirical laws is a model/abstraction that the universe
<br />
_appears_ to obey. The models are very predictive and useful. But they are
<br />
devoid of causal necessity and say nothing about the underlying
<br />
composition of the universe. Natural laws say WHAT but are mute as to WHY.
<br />
<br />Take any laws of the natural world X. The physics of it is called Xics.
<br />
(eg quantum mechanics). The natural world is _not_ constructed of Xics.
<br />
The natural world merely behaves Xically in the specified context.
<br />
<br />That we happen to have a universe that is describable in models .ie. that
<br />
happens to implement the necessary calculi in the context of our
<br />
observations... this is a simply a property of the universe not yet
<br />
explored. The so-called 'unreasonable effectiveness' of mathematics has us
<br />
duped into a mass delusion that somehow the natural world is literally
<br />
constructed of our abstractions.
<br />
<br />Furthermore it also seems to have us duped that further considerations of
<br />
mathematical idealisations and abstractions in general likewise tells us
<br />
something about the composition of the actual underlying natural world....
<br />
for example that it is the result of a computer running one of our
<br />
abstractions.
<br />
<br />As a result, instead of exploring the native structure of the universe as
<br />
a natural mathematics in its own right with all its axioms established in
<br />
a 'big-bang', we are diverted into mental machinations of entities whose
<br />
relationship with the actual universe is merely an assumption.
<br />
<br />I'm hoping this also addresses some of David Nyman's queries.
