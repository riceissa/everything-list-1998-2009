<em class="quotelev1">&gt;TIME AND LIGHTSPEED
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;As Wolfram postulates, the concept of time and speed of light c &gt;within
</em><br />
such an informational universe may be related to how fast &gt;the informational
<br />
changes (from one state to another) can propagate &gt;(across the qubitstring)
<br />
using only local computations as the &gt;medium of state-change propagation. It
<br />
is wrong to suppose that &gt;this implies &quot;computational time&quot; outside of the
<br />
qubitstring. &quot;How &gt;fast state-change propagates&quot; is purely a question of how
<br />
the metric &gt;spacetime that the consistent tour defines can evolve in form
<br />
within &gt;a consistent tour.
<br />
<br />this is particulariliy interesting to myself personlly, i'm doing research
<br />
on what i call the 'temporant nexus' or how time works as a sort of sixth
<br />
sense or negative cumulative sense, i.e. if one we're to combine all of the
<br />
frequency inputs of sensory receptions of the mind, and calculate the
<br />
derivative prime of their mean sum frequencies and use that as a directive
<br />
or regulatory sense to the overall body relation of the percetions of
<br />
passage of time.
<br />
<br /><br />anyway, i'm wondering what you think about the opinion of sensory data being
<br />
construed along this qubit string from the viewpoint of the living human
<br />
being type animal or whatever. anyway, this sensory data is necessarily
<br />
relevant only to the human beings perceptions of a temporal universe, .:
<br />
preceivable only by the human being itself. Anyhow, our attempt to postulate
<br />
a simulation of the universe is the resolve an attempt at creating a
<br />
stimulus based simulation of the universe which matches our perceptual
<br />
understanding of being universally 'now'.
<br />
<br />anyhow, the sensory data would be stacked on the qbitstring along different
<br />
frequency algorythms, perceptual stages or ratios of temporant compression
<br />
in a pyramid like fashion. (fig.a)
<br />
<br /><br />[qbit connection point]

<br />
-------------------------
<br />
[serial data strings]
<br />
<br />at node points long the string, kind of like having little tiny pyramid
<br />
shaped grapes growing off of a grape vine.
<br />
<br />anyway, as the perceptions of the individual pass over the qbit string
<br />
throughout 'time', they 'cross' through these data bit nodes,
<br />
thusly creating a form of distributive frequency sine wave relating qbit
<br />
string as 0 and information bits as 0&lt;x&gt;1 or =+1
<br />
<br />the regressive function of of time then returns the information bit to the
<br />
qbit string, resetting it at 0.
<br />
<br />as the humans perceptions pass over the qbit string through time, or
<br />
conversely, the qbitstring passes 'temporally' through the mind of the
<br />
human, then perceptually referennt information bits or sellectively pulled
<br />
off of the qbit string and recognized as symbolic mind states of that human
<br />
being sensory referrant passage through time 'universally' as a singular
<br />
instance of now.
<br />
<br />: the universe itself is not actually simulated by the qbit string, but
<br />
instead is attributed through random data node representational instances
<br />
along that q bit string.  (fig. b)
<br />
<br />∞----•--•-----•-----•-•------→
<br />
<br />where information nodes are related to the q bit string as such
<br />
(i assume by some quantum instance of relative derivation of temporant
<br />
relation) (fig. c)
<br />
<br />-------•--------
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;past|_|_|future
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/ /|\ \
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;[see fig. a]
<br />
<br /><br />and as 'a' perceptual reference or performing information processor roams or
<br />
passes over the q bit string in it's 'mentality' through time, it creates a
<br />
signal process by temporant manouver which can then be 'experienced' by the
<br />
'body' in terms of biorythms and interprative behaviours.   (fig.d)     _
<br />
_
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_                        /   \                 /
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/  \                    /         \            /
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/     \                /               \       /
<br />
∞-/-----\•\-------/•/------------\•\-/•/----
<br />
\_/           \          /                     \_/
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\      /
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\_/
<br />
<br />if you put fig. c on top of fig. b and then run fig.d over (bc),
<br />
then you achieve some sense of the rythm of time passing
<br />
as a perceptual node of reference, through the qbit string.
<br />
ammassing itself upon little bits of extranuous perceptual
<br />
data by which the observer mentally 'recognizes' the perceptual
<br />
flow of time (by the mind)
<br />
<br />thusly, the singular multiversally continous qbit string:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Being a qubit string it simultaneously exhibits all of its potential
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information-states.
</em><br />
<br />and it is that temporally perceptual 'stringing' {what i refer to
<br />
perceptually as temporal tyning or [frequency selective mind travel by time
<br />
into future mind states now by the presence of active state information
<br />
processing/handling [mind] theory of mind]}
<br />
which enlightens the sensory mind states of awarenessess
<br />
such as that they are then able to recognize their own temporal sequencing
<br />
processing states within [functional] time [passage], enabling them to
<br />
conduct their own 'time' planning and 'resequencing' movements.
<br />
<br />thusly there exists, as primer to life, this qbit string, and upon selective
<br />
developments of life, additional information data sets are attached to the
<br />
qbit string [data] nodes. the frequency states of the life then slectivelevy
<br />
approach these perceptual nodes as they advance mentally•//biophysically
<br />
through space time in realtion to the 'supposed' temporant advances of the
<br />
qbit string.
<br />
<br />at the level of human life, this would likely yield an interesting effect
<br />
in such that the perceptual observers would develop a 'mind' instance, by of
<br />
having a multitude of perceptual observers picking up data information sets
<br />
from this qbit 'perceptual reality' string
<br />
all at the same time now, yielding different perceptual frequencies and
<br />
temporal inputs or amplitudes, would then share some simultaneous mental
<br />
consciousness of symbolic memory instances by which the effective yield of
<br />
previous/past reality instances of the perceptual pickup of the data sets of
<br />
the qbit string would be remembered and thus repercieved as indefinately new
<br />
present tense perceptual instance of 'now' time reality, thusly creating a
<br />
mind based symposium of noises and temporant reflections or static by which
<br />
the mind state of the perceptual observers becomes transluted from reality,
<br />
or then has the accuracy or alignments of their sensory-mental systems
<br />
[perceptual reference guides] mixed up or confused with other human being's
<br />
sensory perceptual points of information pickup and memory.
<br />
there would infact become a sensory shadow as an indefinative past present
<br />
instance which would in turn temporally relect the sum cumulative negative
<br />
instance of all the people refernt percetual analyses of now in relation to
<br />
the activity or time passage of that q-bit string.
<br />
<br />anyhow,... i havn't really done a lot of work with qbit string, but i
<br />
understand a little bit about q-architectures and planning from a physical
<br />
standpoint, in order to become referently perceptual to the human being (in
<br />
terms of colour percetion theory and mind-word (mind sound) reception states
<br />
[as temporal•//quantum] instances.
<br />
<br />i was wondering how this temporant architecture database →perceptual theory
<br />
mixup would work in terms of temporal alignments or timing with qbitstring
<br />
architecture in terms of a cognitive metaphor from the percetual reality of
<br />
what it's actually like to 'be' a qbit string?
<br />
<br />The End
<br />
<br />p.s. is the entire universe itself within space by function, or is space
<br />
something such that it itself composes an entity of the composite structure
<br />
of the universe, thereby necessating some form of external boundary 'around'
<br />
the instance in which we are alive now as human beings on earth within [of]
<br />
that space.
