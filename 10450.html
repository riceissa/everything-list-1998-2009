<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; just as , in a world consisting of every possible picture, there will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; be pictures containing pictures-within-a-picture.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is a big topic difficult to do justice to. I'm sure we've both had
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the experience of re-perusing various treatments of the alternatives
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; without necessarily being completely persuaded either way, but I for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one have accomodated my intuitions to this fairly successfully.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There's a brief discussion of this in 'not the roadmap' with Bruno and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Colin which addresses these issues from the perspective of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'gestalt'. The points discussed all seem paradoxical from the pov of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; classical 'nameable 1st person', and this is IMO a powerful strike
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; against this position.
</em><br />
<br />I have no idea what a  'classical nameable 1st person' is suppose to
<br />
be.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; BTW, I have a question for you re 'intrinsically dynamic' views of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality. It has always seemed to me that this view commits one to a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sort of continual annihilation of each state by the succeeding one.
</em><br />
<br />It doesn't. The present does need a special status, but
<br />
its status can be unerwritten by its being the most
<br />
recent existing moment, not by its
<br />
being the only existing moment.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; both 'past states' and 'future states' are 'radically absent'. My
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; question is: what is left to be 'present'? Recent developments in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; string theory (M-theory) picture time in terms of a 'cinematographic'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; view of Planck-time segments. If these are all that exist at any given
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'point in time', then haven'tf we as-near-as-dammit banished the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe from substantial existence?
</em><br />
<br />A small time-slice is not an infinitessimal time-slice,
<br />
an infinitessimal time-slice is not a zero time-slice.
<br />
You &quot;near as dammit&quot; is not supported by maths,
<br />
indeed it is  opposed by maths.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  After all, 'structure' when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; decomposed is in fact extraordinarily dense action - energy IOW.
</em><br />
<br />Is it ? what is dense about a photon sailing thorough empty space for
<br />
amillion years ?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  In the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'salami-slicer' model, aren't we left the grin without the cat?
</em><br />
<br />I don't think so.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It seems to me also that our subjective experience of 'the specious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; present' entails the compresent existence of Vast numbers of such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; temporal atoms - say one to one 1/2 seconds-worth.
</em><br />
<br />Or maybe it means that time isn't so atomic in the first place,
<br />
<br />Or maybe it means that the specious present is based on
<br />
nothing more mysterious than physical latencies in our
<br />
ultra-parallel, but rather slow, brain.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Again, if we try to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; imagine our experience in the face of the razor of dynamic time, does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it seem anything like this? Have you an alternative presentation of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dynamic model that resolves these issues?
</em><br />
<br />I think I have offered two models:
<br />
<br />1) dynamic time is not necessarily salami-sliced time
<br />
<br />2) even so, salami sliced time can be a smeared-out time-capsule.
<br />
There are no restrictions on what a time-capsule can contain.
<br />
if it can contain &quot;memories&quot; of harry Potter siutations, it
<br />
can certainly contain memories of a blurry, specious present.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; That doesn't mean all contrast leads to dynamism !
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You can get stasis out of dynamism by slowing things dwon to a halt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; it is still a paradox to get dynamism out of stasis.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Substrate/ differentiation is also a global/ local distinction.
</em><br />
<br />How?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Locality is manufactured out of information and its manner of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; propagation. The global/ local contrast is inherently dynamic.
</em><br />
<br />Then everything else is inherently dynamic, presumably.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; expect dynamism to reduce to primitive 'dynamic atoms'. It emerges from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the tension between two contrastable states.
</em><br />
<br />Why ?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; So the argument is:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 1) David is a person.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 2) Because David is a person, some parts of David are conscious, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; others unconscious.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 3) Some parts of the universe are conscious, and others unconcisous.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 4) Therefore the universe is a person, too.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4) should read: therefore the universe manifests personhood in macro as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; David does in micro.  'Indexical David' is a lens through which the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious/ unconscious personhood of the universe concentrates a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particular perspective.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Errmm, yes. But the problem is the basic argument is invalid.
<br />
it is like saying &quot;salt is white&quot; &quot;sugar is white&quot;, &quot;therefore, salt is
<br />
sugar&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  1) Persons aren't irreducible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Persons are defined and delimited by the intersection of structure and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; substrate.
</em><br />
<br />Isn't everything else as well ?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Or in dynamic language, persons are substrate behaving
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; personally. Neither element is dispensible. It depends what you mean by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reducible.
</em><br />
<br />It depends on what your grounds are for making first-personness
<br />
ontologically fundamental.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; A substrate that adopts personal indexicality in this way,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that claims 'I am indexical David', is something I 'take personally'.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 2) Qualia aren't structural.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Qualia are the instantiated experience of persons defined indexically.
</em><br />
<br />All of the experience ? Where does the redness/squareness contrast [*]
<br />
come from?
<br />
And what is experience anyway ?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; They are the appearance of the substrate behaving personally.
</em><br />
<br />What is appearance ?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; They are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the analogic instantiation of information. Information is derived from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; their mutual relations, and these relations are structural/
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behavioural.
</em><br />
<br />What are the relata ?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; They are the carriers of the metaphoric 'aboutness' of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; substrate-as-meaning. The meaning they express is 'like this!' From
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; these origins all 'what it's like' is synthesised through structure/
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behaviour/ process.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 3) There needs to be some sort of Hard Problem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; attached to peronhhod to justify the manoeuvre of making the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 1st-pesoanl
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; primary. If a person is just a particualr structure, or a 1st person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; statement is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; just a  statement made by a person, that is not the case.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The HP is not hard if qualia are understood to be the substrate's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unmediated, reflexive, self-referential, self-revelation of its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; internal structure/ behaviour.
</em><br />
<br />So why do qualia seem non-structural ?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Each of the advectives I have used is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non-dual in its intent. Even if the limitations of language create the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; artefact of an apparent dualism in the notion of 'self-reference', this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is a linguistic mirage. We're talking equivalence, not 'property'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; BTW I don't mean by this that we will ever 'understand' why qualia have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any 'absolute' as opposed to relative appearance.  This is in principle
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unanswerable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 4) Strenuous avoidance of dualism. Not all dualisms have the problems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of Cartesian dualism. There are dualisms within physicalism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As soon as we allow 'dual ontology'
</em><br />
<br />Dual property ontology ? Dual substance ontology ?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; we let in the notion of mediation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between two realities, and an unstoppable regression of mediating
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; processes.
</em><br />
<br /><br />uh-huh. So haow does that affect the duality of
<br />
electricity and magnetism ? Or of fermion and boson ?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 5) How the apparent duality between the Easy problem and the Hard
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Problem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; emerges, if not from some other dualism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The only 'duality' is substrate/ differentiation, or whole/ part. I've
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; said before that though substrate is implied by differentiation, it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doesn't necessitate its existence; indeed its origin is paradoxical in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; causal logic. From this 'primitive duality' all other apparent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dualities arise. I know this puzzles you and perhaps you think it's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nonsense. But the 'subjective/ objective' duality arises directly from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it by the construction of the world-as-information (virtual) within the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world-as-appearance (situated). The pervasive but illusory independence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of these 'realms' creates the apparent ontic duality, but both are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; artefacts of substrate/ differentiation.
</em><br />
<br />Which is a dualism...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />[ * ]
<br />
<br />Colours and Shapes: Exactly What Qualifies as a Quale ?
<br />
Because qualia are so often used to argue against physicalism (or at
<br />
least physical communicability), it is often assumed that they
<br />
must be mysterious by definition. However Lewis's original definition
<br />
pins qualia to the way external objects appear, and it least s
<br />
ome of those features are throughly unmysterious,such as the shapes of
<br />
objects. A red square seems to divide into a mysterious redness
<br />
and an unmysterious squareness. This does not by itself remove any of
<br />
the problems associated with qualia; the problem is that some
<br />
qualia are mysterious. not that some are not.. There is another,
<br />
corresponding issue; not all mysterious, mental contents are the
<br />
appearances of external objects. There a re &quot;phenomenal feels&quot; attached
<br />
to emotions, sensations and so on. Indeed, we often use the
<br />
perceived qualaities of objects as metaphors for them -- sharp pains,
<br />
warm or cool feelings towards another person, and so on.
<br />
The main effect of this issue on the argument is to hinder the
<br />
physicalist project of reducing qualia to the phsycally-defined
<br />
properties of external objects, since in the case of internal
<br />
sensations and emotional feelings, there are not suitable external
<br />
objects.
