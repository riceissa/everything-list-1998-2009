<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1. do we have a REAL argument against solipsism?
</em><br />
<br />Let me express how solipsism can be analyzed in the model where physical
<br />
reality is part of mathematical reality.
<br />
<br />Let us adopt Bruno's UDA perspective: the Universal Dovetailer (UD)
<br />
is an abstract machine that runs all possible computer programs.
<br />
In this way it creates all possible universes, and more... it creates
<br />
all possible information objects: all of mathematics, logic, all written
<br />
texts, everything.  In particular it creates the information patterns
<br />
of conscious entities like you and me.
<br />
<br />Let us assume that this in fact represents the reality of the multiverse,
<br />
that what we perceive and experience is all caused by the operation
<br />
of the UD, when it creates information patterns that correspond to
<br />
those experienes.  I know that many people here reject this hypothesis,
<br />
but let us follow it forward to see what it can say about solipsism.
<br />
<br />The first thing to notice is that within the UD, each person exists more
<br />
than once.  There are many programs that include a particular information
<br />
pattern in their output, in fact an infinite number of programs.  Some of
<br />
those programs will look much like the kind of model a physicist might
<br />
construct for a &quot;theory of everything&quot;.  It would include the physical
<br />
laws and initial conditions that define our universe.  Running that
<br />
program forward would create the entire history of our universe, including
<br />
the experiences of all of its inhabitants.
<br />
<br />However there are other kinds of programs that would also create the
<br />
patterns of our conscious experiences.  Some might do it purely by random
<br />
chance: they might produce enormous outputs and somewhere buried in there
<br />
will be the pattern that corresponds to a portion of our experience.
<br />
Others would include bizarre universes such as one inhabited by aliens
<br />
who create computer simulations of other kinds of beings, and who have
<br />
created us.  Yet another example would be a universe composed only of one
<br />
person, with all that is outside of him being supplied by the computer
<br />
program, perhaps from some kind of table of sensory impressions, so that
<br />
only he is real within that universe.
<br />
<br />Solipsism is the doctrine that only I exist, that everything else is an
<br />
illusion.  In the context of the platonic multiverse, it would correspond
<br />
to that last case: a portion of the UD program where only the one person
<br />
is in his universe, and nothing else in the universe is real.
<br />
<br />So this raises the question: given that I exist multiple times within
<br />
the UD structure, and given that in some of them the universe I see
<br />
around me is real and in some of them it is an illusion, which is the
<br />
reality for me?  In which one do I actually exist?
<br />
<br />I believe Bruno argues, and I agree, that this is a meaningless question.
<br />
You exist in all of them.  There is no single instance of your information
<br />
pattern which is &quot;really you&quot;.  Your consciousness spans all of the
<br />
places in the UD where it is instantiated.  However, there is a related
<br />
question which is relevant: what will happen next?  If some of your
<br />
consciousness is in the real universe, and some of it is in universes
<br />
where you are an alien simulation, some in a universe where it is a
<br />
random fluctuation, and some in a universe where you are all there is,
<br />
how can you make a prediction about the future?  In the random universe
<br />
you would expect to disintegrate into chaos.  In the aliens, they might
<br />
open up the simulation and start talking to you.  In the solipsism case,
<br />
various bizarre things might happen.  And in the &quot;plain vanilla&quot; universe,
<br />
you would expect things to go along pretty much as you remember them.
<br />
<br />Here is where I may depart from Bruno, although I am not sure.  I argue
<br />
that you can in fact set up a probability distribution over all of the
<br />
places in the UD where your mind exists, and it is based roughly on the
<br />
size of the part of the UD program that creates that information pattern.
<br />
Recall that the UD in effect runs all programs at once.  But some programs
<br />
are shorter than others.  I use the notion of algorithmic complexity
<br />
and the associated measure, which is called the Universal Distribution
<br />
(an unfortunate collision of the UD acronym).  Basically this says that
<br />
the measure of the output of a given UD program of n bits is 1/2^n.
<br />
<br />This gives us a probability distribution over all the places our minds
<br />
are implemented, such that the shortest program(s) get the bulk of
<br />
the probability.  This has relationships to such traditional notions as
<br />
Occam's Razor, as Russell Standish has emphasized.  Just as we say that
<br />
the simplest explanation for our observations is likely to be correct,
<br />
so we can say that the simplest program which creates our experiences
<br />
is likely to be the one that governs what will happen next.
<br />
<br />In principle, it should become possible eventually to turn this reasoning
<br />
into at least rough quantitative form.  We will eventually have a
<br />
complete model for our physical universe, so we can compute its measure
<br />
and determine how big a contribution that part of the UD makes to our
<br />
experiences.  Likewise we could create a model of the solipsist universe,
<br />
where only the person is real and all of his external experiences are
<br />
provided by the program.
<br />
<br />It is very likely that it will turn out that the real-universe program
<br />
will be much smaller than the solipsist one.  The solipsist program has
<br />
to have an enormous table to supply all of the sensory experiences a
<br />
person will receive.  It also needs to have some mechanism to compute
<br />
his brain patterns, and probably the simplest will be to have an actual
<br />
physical universe model.  Building the brain patterns into an internal
<br />
table is another way to do it but will probably be even larger.  Any way
<br />
you look at it, the solipsist program is going to be enormous.
<br />
<br />Reasoning in this way, we will not only be able to basically reject
<br />
the solipsist hypothesis, we can actually do so in a quantitative way!
<br />
We will be able to say, the fraction of your experiences due to the
<br />
solipsist universe, or equivalently the probability that it is true,
<br />
is this extremely tiny number.  And it will very likely be an incredibly
<br />
small number, 1/2^(10^20), perhaps.  (I wrote a long posting last year
<br />
which effectively estimated this number.)
<br />
<br />This, then, is an example of the power of the assumption about the
<br />
platonic universe, that physical and mathematical reality are the same.
<br />
It not only sheds light on ancient and seemingly insolvable conundrums
<br />
such as solipsism, it should allow us to in principle produce quantitative
<br />
estimates of the role of solipsist universes in the larger reality.
<br />
If as I wrote yesterday we are able to eventually verify predictions of
<br />
this model in terms of physical observations, we would have achieved
<br />
a unification of physics and philosophy far deeper than has ever been
<br />
accomplished before.
