I start from a part of this post from David Barrett-Lennard (Mon,
<br />
3 Nov 2003 19:48:49) but I could probably hev selected several
<br />
similar other ones:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Given the &quot;source code&quot; for the simulation of our universe, it would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seem to be possible to add some extra instructions that test for a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certain condition to be met in order to tamper with the simulation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It would seem likely that there will exist simulations that match our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; own up to a certain point in time, but then diverge.  Eg it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible for a simulation to have a rule that an object will suddenly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; manifestitself at a particular time and place.  The simulated conscious 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; beings in such a universe would be surprised to find that induction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fails at the moment the simulation diverges.
</em><br />
<br />It seems to me that there is a very strong assupmtion here which
<br />
is that there should be some synchronicity between the &quot;time&quot; in the
<br />
postulated computer into which the universe would be simulated and
<br />
the time inside that simulated universe (as this is typically the
<br />
case when an electronic device is simulated).
<br />
<br />But such an assumption not only does not seem necessary in any way
<br />
but it also does not seem possibly consistent (or it would be very
<br />
arbitrary at least) with a universe like ours for what we know of
<br />
the implications of general relativity (it does not seem possible
<br />
to define any global time in any consistent way in our universe).
<br />
<br />Many other way of simulating the universe could be considered like
<br />
for instance a 4D mesh (if we simplify by considering only general
<br />
relativity; there is no reason for the approach not being possible in
<br />
an even more general way) representing a universe taken as a whole
<br />
in its spatio-temporal aspect. The mesh would be refined at each
<br />
iteration. The relation between the time in the computer and the time
<br />
in the universe would not be a synchrony but a refinement of the
<br />
resolution of the time (and space) in the simulated universe as the
<br />
time in the computer increases.
<br />
<br />Alternatively (though both views are not necessarily exclusive), one
<br />
could use a variational formulation instead of a partial derivative
<br />
formulation in order to describe/build the universe leading again to
<br />
a construction in which the time in the computer is not related at
<br />
all to the time in the simulated universe.
<br />
<br />It seems to me finally that the simulations in which there is a
<br />
synchrony between the time in this universe and the time in the
<br />
computer simulating it are very specific (if even existing) among
<br />
all other possible simulations of the same universe (at least
<br />
for the kind of relativistic universe we live in). I would even
<br />
conjecture that the measure of the set of synchronous simulations
<br />
is null within the set of all possible simulations of a given (not
<br />
so trivial) universe (if one can give a sound sense to this).
<br />
<br />I would be interested in reading the opinions of the participants
<br />
about that point and about the sense that could be given to the
<br />
question of what &quot;happens&quot; (in the simulated universe) in any non-
<br />
synchronous simulation &quot;when&quot; the simulation diverges ?
<br />
<br />Georges.
