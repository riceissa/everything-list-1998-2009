I tripped over my own boot-laces and stumbled – whacking my head.
<br />
Bent over to rub my head and retie the damn laces, all a sudden I had
<br />
the following quick rough thoughts for a paper:
<br />
<br />'Cognitive Reflectivity'

<br />Abstract
<br />
<br /><br />&quot;A change in the goal-system of an agent is equivalent to a change in
<br />
the way in which knowledge is represented by the agent.  It follows
<br />
that it is equivalent to a change in the complexity of the program
<br />
representing the agent.  Thus we require a method of comparing the
<br />
complexity of strings in order to ensure that relevant program
<br />
structure is preserved with state transitions over time.  Standard
<br />
probability theory cannot be used because; (1) Consistent probability
<br />
calculations require implicit universal generalizations, but a
<br />
universal measure of the complexity of  finite strings is a logical
<br />
impossibility (fromGodel, Lob theorems); and (2) Standard measures of
<br />
complexity (e.g Kolmogorov complexity) from information theory deal
<br />
only with one aspect of information (i.e.  Shannon information), and
<br />
fail to consider semantic content. The solution must resolve both
<br />
these problems.
<br />
<br />Regarding (2) the solution is as follows:, information theory is
<br />
generalized to deal with the actual meaning of information  (i.e . the
<br />
semantics of Shannon information) .The generalized definition of the
<br />
complexity of a finite string is based on the conceptual clustering of
<br />
semantic categories specifying the knowledge a string represents.  The
<br />
generation of hierarchical category structures representing the
<br />
knowledge in a string is also associated with a generalization of
<br />
Occam’s razor.   The justification for Occam’s razor and the problem
<br />
of priors in induction is resolved by defining ‘utility’ in terms of
<br />
‘aesthetic goodness’, which is the degree of integration of different
<br />
concept hierarchies.  This considers the process through which a
<br />
theory is generated;  it is a form of process-oriented evaluation.
<br />
<br />Regarding (1); The Godel limitation is bypassed by using relative
<br />
complexity measures of pairs of strings .  This requires generalizing
<br />
standard Bayesian induction ; in fact induction is merely a special
<br />
case of a new form of case-based reasoning (analogical reasoning) .
<br />
Analogical reasoning can be formalized by utilizing concepts from
<br />
category theory to implement prototype theory, where mathematical
<br />
categories are regarded as semantic categories. Semantic concepts
<br />
representing the knowledge encoded in strings can be considered to
<br />
reside in multi-dimensional feature space, and this enables mappings
<br />
between concepts; such mappings are defined by functors representing
<br />
conceptual distance; this gives a formal definition of an analogy.
<br />
The reason this overcomes the Godel limitation and is more general
<br />
than induction is because it always enables relative comparisons of
<br />
the complexity of pairs of strings. This is because case-based
<br />
reasoning depends only on the specific details on the strings being
<br />
compared, whereas induction makes implicit universal generalizations,
<br />
and thus fails.
<br />
<br />To summarize:  Induction is shown to be merely a special case of a new
<br />
type of generalized case-based (analogical) reasoning. Concepts from
<br />
category theory enable a formal definition of an analogy, which is
<br />
based on the notion of conceptual distance between concepts. The
<br />
notion of complexity is generalized to deal with semantics, where the
<br />
information in a string is considered to be a concept hierarchy. This
<br />
enables comparisons between pairs of strings; relations between
<br />
strings are defined in terms of the mappings between concepts, and the
<br />
mapping is evaluated in terms of its aesthetic goodness.  Godelian
<br />
limitations are overcome, since analogical reasoning always enables a
<br />
comparison of the relative complexity between any two finite strings.
<br />
Further the new metric of aesthetic goodness ensures that the relevant
<br />
program structure is preserved between state transitions and thus
<br />
maintains a stable goal system.&quot;
