<br />This is not very satisfactory...Does it mean that consciousness would exist
<br />
with any permutation of particles, for example in the first moments after

the Big Bang? (see below my remarks on Hal's reply)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;I am not sure what you mean &quot;The simplest program just enumerates

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;all integer numbers.&quot;

In Schmidshuber theory, a state of the Universe is a finite substring
<br />
(between two commas), that is an integer. As the information on past is
<br />
entirely stored in each present state, i.e. in each substring,  it is
<br />
independant on the rest of the string. A UD is of no use (I think the
<br />
problem comes from the confusion between the time of the &quot;Big Computer&quot;
<br />
that generates the bits and the time associated with a state of the
<br />
Universe, which has nothing to do with the former one. Of course with REAL
<br />
computer both times coincide!).  To generate all possible substrings, you
<br />
only have to enumerate  all integers. &quot;0,1,10,11...&quot; What I think, however,
<br />
is that a simple integer can not represent alone a Universe:

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; beholder.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I would say that there is a sense in which an integer describes something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in an objective sense, rather than just having it be subjective and in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;eye of the beholder.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Specifically, if the integer is very large, trillions of trillions of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;trillions of bits in size, and if it can be compressed down to a much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;smaller value via computational techniques, then that compression is an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;objective way of summarizing the information in the integer.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Suppose that the integer can be best compressed by treating it as the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;output of a program which implements some kinds of &quot;laws of physics&quot;,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;starting from some specified initial condition.  This integer could then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be considered as the result of actually running a universe simulation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This would be an objective interpretation, not dependent on a particular
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;beholder.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Looking at this objective interpretation of the integer as the history of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a universe, we might then be able to see space and time dimensions,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;an analog to entropy increase and an arrow of time, causation, evolution,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and information flow.  We might even be able to identify structures which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;process information and which behave in the same manner as intelligent,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;conscious minds like our own.  In that case we would have reason to say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that, in an objective sense, this integer represents a universe which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;has conscious minds.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Even our own universe can be considered as a four-dimensional space-time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;structure, which is in effect a static block of information.  It is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;known at this point whether the universe is fundamentally discrete or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;continuous, but certainly we cannot rule out the possibility that it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;discrete at the lowest level.  In that case our own universe can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;fully represented as an integer.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Hal
</em><br />
<br />It is almost true, but only almost. The Universe could be discrete. Assume
<br />
you have discrete cells at the Planck scale, 10^{-33} cm. You would like to
<br />
describe at least the visible Universe, about 10^{30} cm. If theory of
<br />
inflation is correct, it could be 10^{50} times as large, so 10^80 cm So
<br />
you need at least about N=10^400 cells for a 4-D space time.  Well there is
<br />
no limitation of available computing time. The problem is not here. The
<br />
problem is that if the principle of equivalence is true, any cell is in
<br />
principle equivalent to another one. You have no natural ordering. So if
<br />
you want to describe the Universe by a N bits string, you have to assign
<br />
arbitrarily a cell to  some rank in the string. But you can do also any
<br />
permutation in this assignement. It means that each of n1!*(N-n1)!
<br />
different strings with n1 &quot;1&quot; and (N-n1) &quot;0&quot; are equivalent. Basically you
<br />
are left with N different states instead of 2^N as expected, because of the
<br />
high degeneracy introduced by the freedom of the assignement.  This is
<br />
because you have no relationships between the bits that reproduce the
<br />
topological structure of the Universe and its physical laws. These are not
<br />
specified by a string (or equivalently an integer) alone, as long as it can
<br />
be. So I don't see how the compressibility of integers (which is by the way
<br />
generally unprovable) could be linked with the structure of space-time,
<br />
since there is no one-to-one correspondance between them.
<br />
<br />You can specify such a relationship, but it means that the state of the
<br />
Universe is not fully represented by the string but by the string PLUS the
<br />
mapping. The physics is not only in the string, but in the formal
<br />
relationships between the bits. But it is not conceptually simpler that
<br />
ordinary physics, because it doesn't say anything on the origin of the
<br />
relationships. You have only done a discretization of space-time, by the
<br />
way an interesting idea whose consequences would deserve discussion.
<br />
Computation, as meant as a succession of string, doesn't mean anything
<br />
since the information of time enclosed in each substring has nothing to do
<br />
with the other strings (as said above).  As I said before, it is somewhat
<br />
curious to explain a fundamental reality by the help of an apparatus that
<br />
exists only within this reality.
