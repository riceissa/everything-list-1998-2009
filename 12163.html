<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perhaps counterintuitively, a model of a brain can be closer to the real

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thing than a model of a storm. We don't normally see inside a person's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; head, we just observe his behaviour. There could be anything in there - a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain, a computer, the Wizard of Oz - and as long as it pulled the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person's strings so that he behaved like any other person, up to and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; including doing scientific research, we would never know the difference.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, we know that living brains can pull the strings to produce normal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; human behaviour (and consciousness in the process, but let's look at the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; external behaviour for now). We also know that brains follow the laws of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics: chemistry, Maxwell's equations, and so on. Maybe we don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *understand* electrical fields in the sense that it may feel like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something to be an electrical field, or in some other as yet unspecified
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense, but we understand them well enough to predict their physical effect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on matter. Hence, although it would be an enormous task to gather the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relevant information and crunch the numbers in real time, it should be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible to predict the electrical impulses that come out of the skull to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; travel down the spinal cord and cranial nerves and ultimately pull the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; strings that make a person behave like a person. If we can do that, it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should be possible to place the machinery which does the predicting inside
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the skull interfaced with the periphery so as to take the brain's place,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and no-one would know the difference because it would behave just like the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; original.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; -----------------------
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'd say it's here...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;and no-one would know the difference because it would behave just like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the original&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But for a subtle reason.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The artefact has to be able to cope with exquisite novelty like we do.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Models cannot do this because as a designer you have been forced to define
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a model that constrains all possible novelty to be that which fits your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; model for _learning_. Therein lies the fundamental flaw. Yes... at a given
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; level of knowledge you can define how to learn new things within the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; knowledge framework. But when it comes to something exquisitely novel, all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that will happen is that it'll be interpreted into the parameters of how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you told it to learn things... this will impact in a way the artefact
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cannot handle. It will behave differently and probably poorly.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's the zombie thing all over again.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's not _knowledge_ that matters. it's _learning_ new knowledge. That's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what functionalism fails to handle. Being grounded in a phenomenal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; representation of the world outside is the only way to handle arbitrary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; levels of novelty. No phenomenal representation? = You are &quot;model-bound&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and grounded, in effect, in the phenomenal representation of your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; model-builders, who are forced to predefine all novelty handling in an &quot;I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't know that&quot; functional module. Something you cannot do without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; knowing everything a-priori! If you already know that you are god so why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are you bothering?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Say you bring an artefact X into existence. X may behave exactly like a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; human Y in all the problem domains you used to define you model. Then you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; expose both to novelty nobody has seen, including you.... and that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where the two will differ. The human Y will do better every time. You
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can't program qualia. You have to have them and you can't do without them
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in a 'general intelligence' context.

</em><br />
I understand your conclusion, that a model of a brain won't be able to handle 
<br />
novelty like a real brain, but I am trying to understand the nuts and bolts of 
<br />
how the model is going to fail. For example, you can say that perpetual motion 
<br />
machines are impossible because they disobey the first or second law of 
<br />
thermodynamics, but you can also look at a particular design of such a machine 
<br />
and point out where the moving parts are going to slow down due to friction. 

<br />
So, you have the brain and the model of the brain, and you present them both 
<br />
with the same novel situation, say an auditory stimulus. They both process the 
<br />
stimulus and produce a response in the form of efferent impulses which move 
<br />
the vocal cords and produce speech; but the brain says something clever while 
<br />
the computer declares that it is lost for words. The obvious explanation is that 
<br />
the computer model is not good enough, and maybe a better model would 
<br />
perform better, but I think you would say that *no* model, no matter how good, 
<br />
could match the brain. 

<br />
Now, we agree that the brain contains matter which follows the laws of physics. 
<br />
Before the novel stimulus is applied the brain is in configuration x. The stimulus 
<br />
essentially adds energy to the brain in a very specific way, and as a result of this 
<br />
the brain undergoes a very complex sequence of physical changes, ending up in
<br />
configuration y, in the process outputting energy in a very specific way which 
<br />
causes the vocal cords to move. The important point is, in the transformations 
<br />
x-&gt;y the various parts of the brain are just working like parts of an elaborate 
<br />
Rube Goldberg mechanism. There can be no surprises, because that would be 
<br />
magic: two positively charged entities suddenly start attracting each other, or 
<br />
the hammer hits the pendulum and no momentum is transferred. If there is magic - 
<br />
actually worse than that, unpredictable magic - then it won't be possible to model 
<br />
the brain or the Rube Goldberg machine. But, barring magic, it should be possible 
<br />
to predict the physical state transitions x-&gt;y and hence you will know what the 
<br />
motor output to the vocal cords will be and what the vocal response to the novel 
<br />
stimulus will be. 

<br />
Classical chaos and quantum uncertainty may make it difficult or impossible to 
<br />
predict what a particular brain will do on a particular day, but they should not be 
<br />
a theoretical impediment to modelling a generic brain which behaves in an 
<br />
acceptably brain-like manner. Only unpredictable magical effects would prevent 
<br />
that.
