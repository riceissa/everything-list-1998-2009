<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, I cannot help but feel that consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;isn't an instantaneous thing. Vague, I know, but it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;does seem to be a process. Only when OM's are linked
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;together do they make &quot;sense&quot;. I think perhaps we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;don't need to throw out time; a Many Worlds type
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;static universe is, perhaps, simpler to implement
</em><br />
than &gt;the minds it contains.
<br />
<br />I thought about this the other day. How does one
<br />
express in a timeless existence. This is what I've
<br />
come up with...
<br />
<br />Our experiences are best described as frames. Outside
<br />
of these frames there is no time. What delineates
<br />
these frames is arbitrary. There can be frames within
<br />
frames. We use a kind of energy to pass from one frame
<br />
to the next. Each frame forms a kind of epoch. Our
<br />
decisions determine whether we cross one frame
<br />
boundary and which boundary we cross at. So our lives
<br />
might be described as chains of expression linked at
<br />
epoch boundaries.
<br />
<br />Now within each frame, we perceive time. I say we
<br />
perceive it, but it does not exist. It is simply an
<br />
expression method for those not ready for anything
<br />
else. Each time stamp we place on a thought or
<br />
instant, is a sub-frame. We form little epoch's within
<br />
major epochs. These are delineated by are attempts to
<br />
correlate our thoughts with time. Without the intent
<br />
to correlate conscious experience with time, no
<br />
temporally classified epoch is formed. We might be
<br />
forced into a state where external experiences impose
<br />
temporal partitioning, ie., watching a car go by or,
<br />
some bodily awareness. But I asert that this is simply
<br />
the formation of micro-frames or epochs bounded by our
<br />
brain's ability to partition or sample the experience.
<br />
<br />For someone standing outside your epoch/frame, they
<br />
would see your expressions anyway they chose to. They
<br />
might see you temporally expressing, if they constrain
<br />
their thoughts to temporal laws. They may simply see
<br />
all possibilities that lay before you constrained by
<br />
qualities they choose. The important thing to note is
<br />
that they make decisions and form frames based on
<br />
those decisions too. So in observing you, they change
<br />
as well. 
<br />
<br />If one thinks about the possibilities of this model,
<br />
it's staggering. This means people could learn to form
<br />
epochs around other instantiations or entities and
<br />
completely master the interactions between you and
<br />
them. An example might be whether you see a car in
<br />
time not to be run over. In another expression, you
<br />
are conscious of the car before the moment arrives,
<br />
even before the day or month arrives...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From a mystic standpoint, this makes sense. From my
</em><br />
studies I am told no time exists on the invisible
<br />
(non-physical world). This bugged me because I could
<br />
not conceive of how one would express. This model
<br />
seems to satisfy the issue for me. 
<br />
<br />It also explains experiences I have had in the past.
<br />
This entails my being conscious in two separate times
<br />
simultaneously. I've experienced these co-events with
<br />
separations in months. The most recent was separated
<br />
by over 20 years. One could say I was simply
<br />
adequately aware of the memories involving
<br />
consciousness in two operate times. I cannot argue
<br />
against this except to say that I doubt it's
<br />
physically possible for the human brain to record
<br />
experiences so completely as to support such a
<br />
phenomenon.
