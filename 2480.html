<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; [re: rock is a good implementation of any computation]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It depends what you mean by &quot;good implementation.&quot;  The context of my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; comment above was, *if* you believe there is a single true set of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; psychophysical laws, are the laws likely to be defined in terms of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;computation&quot; or not?  If you don't believe in these sorts of laws,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; then the question of what's a &quot;good&quot; implementation is somewhat
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; academic--it's really just a question of what's the neatest way to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; define our terms.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Many of the people on this list (in common with a lot of western
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;philosophy at least since Descartes) are hoping to construct their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;existence measures on the bedrock of the objectively decidable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;self-awareness.  They've built very interesting structures, but you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;may notice there's been no progress at all on stabilizing the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;foundation.  Instead we have on this list the same debates that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;endlessly, repetitively and inconclusively flood comp.ai.philosophy,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;never mind philosophy journals and books.
</em><br />
<br />But my position isn't just &quot;consciousness is real, therefore there must be a 
<br />
mathematical theory to describe it so it'll have firm foundations.&quot;  Rather, 
<br />
I was drawn to the idea of a &quot;theory of consciousness&quot; based on 
<br />
consideration of the anthropic principle, as well as &quot;continuity of 
<br />
consciousness&quot; thought-experiments like the one where I'll be replicated 
<br />
only if the coin falls heads.  In both cases we're dealing with 
<br />
probabilistic questions that seem to call out for a well-defined 
<br />
mathematical theory...in the replicator experiment, do you think there's a 
<br />
single true answer to the question of whether I should expect a 1/2 or 2/3 
<br />
(or something else) chance that I will see the coin fall heads?
<br />
<br />In any case, It might be useful to temporarily shift this debate away from 
<br />
the question of &quot;consciousness&quot;--what I want to know is, do you believe in a 
<br />
global &quot;existence measure&quot; at all?  As I said, the main problem I have with 
<br />
the TOE you've been advocating is that it seems as though it would be 
<br />
impossible to have a single global measure of any kind.  After all, you're 
<br />
not just saying that any physical system can be interpreted as implementing 
<br />
any computation--since you believe that the &quot;physical&quot; universe is itself 
<br />
just a sort of Platonic computation, you're essentially saying that any 
<br />
Platonic computation can be interpreted as any other Platonic computation, 
<br />
which would seem to make it impossible to put a global measure on this set.
<br />
<br />Without a global existence measure there's no way to talk about probability, 
<br />
and no reason at all to say I'm any more likely to find myself in a universe 
<br />
where the laws of physics will stay stable than one where they will suddenly 
<br />
go haywire.  So do you admit the possibility of *some* kind of global 
<br />
existence measure on &quot;everything?&quot;  If you do, then it's a separate argument 
<br />
as to whether or not the measure should be on all possible conscious 
<br />
observer-moments or on some other notion of &quot;everything.&quot; Personally, I 
<br />
think the measure needs to be on observer-moments to avoid having a 
<br />
fundamentally dualistic theory in which the existence measure is completely 
<br />
separate from anthropic considerations...but there wouldn't be much point in 
<br />
discussing this if you didn't even believe in a global existence measure in 
<br />
the first place.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Gerard O'Neill, the late Princeton physicist best known for his space
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;colony studies, once said that if you met a race that insisted that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;logical developments must be built step by step from a firm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;foundation, you could be pretty sure they were planet dwellers.  Races
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that live in space realize that it's perfectly OK to build structures
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that have no foundation at all.  They can be circular and unsupported,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;yet if you spin them they'll have gravity just like the ponderous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;planetary piles!
</em><br />
<br />I don't think that's such a good analogy--space station builders have to 
<br />
take into account the same &quot;foundations&quot; that planet-bound builders do, 
<br />
namely the laws of physics.  Anyway, anyone who believes in any kind of 
<br />
global existence measure is making just as much use of foundations as I 
<br />
am...it's just that I happen to think the measure should be on the set of 
<br />
all possible observer-moments, while others have some different notion of 
<br />
the appropriate set of &quot;everything&quot; to put a measure on.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I think your insistence on the absolute underpinning of an objective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consciousness is just planet-bound thinking.  Bruno's, Juergen's,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Russell's or Max Tegmark's analyses can just as well be built on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;arbitrary selections of what's conscious (Turing test passers?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;biological brains? red-haired people? teddy bears?).  The teddy bear
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;universes may have different probabilities than the biological brain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;universes or the Turing test universes, but so what?  Each is as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;likely to be self-consistent as another.
</em><br />
<br />True, once you have an existence measure you can then choose an arbitrary 
<br />
definition of &quot;observer&quot; and do a weighted sum over all universes to see 
<br />
where &quot;observers&quot; are most likely to be.  The problem is that you will get 
<br />
very different answers as to what's a &quot;likely&quot; universe depending on your 
<br />
original definition.  But the fact that I find myself in *this* particular 
<br />
type of universe doesn't depend on my own &quot;choice of reference class&quot;--it's 
<br />
thrust upon me by reality.  If you want to explain that, I think you need 
<br />
reality to have a single &quot;true&quot; definition of what it means to be an 
<br />
observer.
<br />
<br />With a weird definition of &quot;observer&quot; I could no doubt predict that I'm 
<br />
exceedingly likely to see the laws of physics break down within the next 
<br />
minute (perhaps by saying that those who don't observe such a thing don't 
<br />
count as 'observers' at all).  Is this definition as good as any other?  If 
<br />
so, why shouldn't I take this prediction as seriously as any other one?  
<br />
Again, the problem is that whatever we think about the matter, reality seems 
<br />
to have its own ideas, and a coherent TOE really should take this into 
<br />
account.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;i.e. You don't have to give up the goals of this list just because you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;don't believe there is an objective fact of the matter to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consciousness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; My question for you is, does your Platonic view of things rule out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the idea of a single global theory of consciousness?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Don't need it, don't want it.
</em><br />
<br />Is there any reason to predict that the laws-of-physics-going-crazy scenario 
<br />
is less likely than anything else in your theory?  If not I think you *do* 
<br />
need to modify your theory in some way, whether or not that involves a 
<br />
&quot;theory of consciousness.&quot;
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I believe that there is more to me than my outward actions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So does a lookup table.  Just ask it, it will tell you all about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;its complex motives and internal mental life.
</em><br />
<br />Well, I can build a program that just prints out &quot;I have a lot of complex 
<br />
feelings and thoughts that I'm not gonna tell you anything about, so nyeah 
<br />
nyeah.&quot;  And I suppose you'd say that under the right interpretation it does 
<br />
have such thoughts--but even so, the fact that it *says* it has these kinds 
<br />
of thoughts has zilch to do with anything, since according to you the same 
<br />
would be true of a clock or any other system.  That's basically the 
<br />
situation we have with a lookup table as well...what the lookup table does 
<br />
or doesn't say isn't relevant to your case here.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I'm making the assumption that there's *some* set of objective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; psychophysical laws, and that these laws would tell you a lookup
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; table doesn't give rise to the same experiences as a detailed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; simulation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Groundhog!  I make no such assumption.
</em><br />
<br />...Space cadet!  Seriously, I think good theories depend on a balance 
<br />
between &quot;spacey&quot; intuitive leaps and &quot;grounded&quot; critical standards...best 
<br />
not to pit one against the other in the first place.
