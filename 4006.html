</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; There are a few objections which I am aware of which have been raised
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; against the MWI.  The first is its lack of parsimony in terms of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; creating a vast number of universes.  We gain some simplification in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the QM formalism but at this seemingly huge expense.  The second is its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; untestability, although some people have claimed otherwise.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The latter is the more important. If, for example, the plurality of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; worlds are out of communication with each other, forever and always, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then it means nothing to assert that they &quot;actually&quot; exist.
</em><br />
<br />Worlds are never absolutely out of touch.  There is a small degree
<br />
of interference which is always present between worlds in the MWI.
<br />
Of course this is infinitisimal in practice and can't be observed between
<br />
macroscopically distinct worlds.  But there is a continuum from totally
<br />
disjoint worlds down to worlds which differ only microscopically and
<br />
where interference is easily observed, such as an electron double-slit
<br />
experiment.  As our technology improves, we will be able to detect smaller
<br />
and more subtle degrees of interference, corresponding to worlds which
<br />
are more and more macroscopically distinct.  Assuming the MWI is in some
<br />
sense &quot;correct&quot;, then eventually it will become increasingly difficult
<br />
to draw the line and say that, for example, small objects can be in
<br />
distinct superpositions, but large objects cannot.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In weaker forms of the MWI, where it's the early state of the Big Bang 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (for example) which are splitting off into N universes, De Witt and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; others have speculated (as early as around 1970) that we may _possibly_ 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; see some evidence consistent with the EWG interpretation but NOT 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consistent with other interpretations.
</em><br />
<br />I'm not familiar with the details of this.  But I know that much of
<br />
the impetus for increased acceptance of MWI models comes from the
<br />
cosmologists.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; And the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; third is that it retains what we might call the problem of measure,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that is, explaining why we seem to occupy branches with a high measure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; or amplitude, without just adding that as an extra assumption.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What's the problem here? I find it utterly plausible that we would be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in a universe where matter exists, where stars exist, where entropy 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; gradients exist, etc., and NOT in a universe where the physical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constants or structure of the universe makes life more difficult or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; impossible (or where the densities and entropy gradients mean that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evolution of complex structures might take 100 billion years, or more, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instead of the billion or so years it apparently took).
</em><br />
<br />The problem is more formal, that if we abandon measurement as a special
<br />
feature of the physics, there is no longer an axiom that says that
<br />
probability is proportional to amplitude squared.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  By the metrics we typically use for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; universe complexity, basically the number of axioms or the size of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; program to specify the universe, the MWI is in fact simpler and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; therefore
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; more probable than the traditional interpretation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This I'm not convinced of at all. I don't find the Copenhagen (aka 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Shut up and calculate&quot;) Interpretation requires any more axioms. So 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; long as we don't try to understand what is &quot;really&quot; happening, it's a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very simple system.
</em><br />
<br />The conventional formulation, as described for example at
<br />
<a href="http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/Mathematical_formulation_of_quantum_mechanics">http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/Mathematical_formulation_of_quantum_mechanics</a>,
<br />
has special axioms related to measurement.  Systems evolve according to
<br />
the Schrodinger equation except when they are being measured, when we
<br />
get wave function collapse.  MWI rejects the axioms related to observables
<br />
and collapse.  In the page above we can eliminate axiom 3 and probably
<br />
axiom 2 as well.  You are left with nothing but Hilbert space and the
<br />
Schrodinger equation.  It's a simpler set of axioms.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And, putting in a plug for modal/topos logic, the essence of nearly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; every interpretation, whether MWI or Copenhagen or even Newtonian, is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that observers at time t are faced with unknowable and branching 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; futures. (In classical systems, these arise from limited amounts of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information available to observers and, importantly, in limited 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; positional information. Even a perfectly classical billiard ball 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; example is unpredictable beyond a few seconds or maybe tens of seconds, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because the positions and sets of forces (turbulence in the air 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; currents around the balls, even gravitational and static electricity 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; effects, etc.) are only known to, say, 20 decimal places (if that, of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; course). Because the &quot;actual&quot; positions, masses, sphericities, static 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; charges, etc.  are perhaps defined by 40-digit or even 200-digit 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; numbers, the Laplacian dream of a suffiicently powerful mind being able 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to know the future is dashed.
</em><br />
<br />This is true in practice, but I think there is still a significant
<br />
difference between deterministic systems like classical physics or the
<br />
MWI, and inherently non-deterministic systems like the conventional
<br />
Copenhagen interpretation of QM.  In the latter you have the difficult
<br />
philosophical problem of explaining where all the information comes from.
<br />
This is what led Schmidhuber to suggest that quantum randomness is
<br />
generated by a pseudo random number generator; otherwise you can't
<br />
simulate the universe on a computer because computers can't create
<br />
true random bits.  The Copenhagen interpretation is fundamentally
<br />
non-computable.
