<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Do you imagine that it's possible that we could go to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; another star, and encounter beings who discoursed with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; us about every single other thing, yet denied that they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; had consciousness, and professed that they had no idea
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; what we were talking about?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The above question is a version of the zombie problem, and there are two 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; slightly different answers depending on whether you are talking about human 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; zombies or zombies from another planet. Human zombies are easy: they're not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; really zombies.
</em><br />
<br />I agree, and add the reasons you state to ones I already have.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would still say that even if it could somehow 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be shown that appropriate brain states necessarily lead to conscious states, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which I suspect is the case, it would still not be clear how this comes 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about, and it would still not be clear what this is like unless you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience the brain/conscious state yourself, or something like it.
</em><br />
<br />I anticipate that in the future it will, as you say so well,
<br />
be shown that &quot;appropriate brain states necessarily lead to
<br />
conscious states&quot;, except I also expect that by then the
<br />
meaning of &quot;conscious states&quot; will be vastly better informed
<br />
and filled-out than today.  In particular, the concept will
<br />
have migrated from a mix of 1st and 3rd person notions, to
<br />
entirely 3rd person notions. I speculate that after this
<br />
occurs, people won't consider the old 1st person notion to
<br />
be of much value (after all, you can't really use it to
<br />
communicate with anyone about anything).
<br />
<br />But of course, all that is just speculation.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You could dismiss this as unimportant, but I think it makes 1st person 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience fundamentally different from everything else in the universe.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, but I don't think that there is any answer to the &quot;hard problem&quot;.
<br />
Concretely, I conjecture that of the 100000^5000 or so possible strings
<br />
of 5000 words in the English language, not a single one of them solves
<br />
this problem. But if so, then even after the scientific problem of
<br />
learning what brain circuits are probably necessary and sufficient
<br />
to capture all conscious appearing behaviors, then there will still
<br />
be people who feel mystified.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; As for aliens, I don't see how we could possibly assume that organisms who 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; did not even evolve on our planet have anything in common with us mentally. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; They may be more fundamentally alien and different to us than bats or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lobsters are, and it may be completely impossible to empathise with them, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even if we could somehow tap into their minds.
</em><br />
<br />I agree that nothing is for sure; yet I'd expect that they'd have
<br />
incentives to metabolically survive, and have a will to exert 
<br />
control over their immediate environments just as we do. So there
<br />
would eventually be negotiations, and I'm confident that even
<br />
empathy for them would develop.
<br />
<br />In your other email you write
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; ...I would have to repeat my reply to Jonathan Colvin, which 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is that we basically agree on the facts of the matter but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; choose to appraise/ interpret/ describe them in a different way.
</em><br />
<br />It's possible that we have reached that point so far as I'm
<br />
concerned now; thanks for continuing.
<br />
<br />Lee
