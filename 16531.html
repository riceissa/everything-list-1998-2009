<br />So changes to neural structure and the concentrations of various
<br />
chemicals within neurons and around neural synapses is known to change
<br />
conscious experience in humans.  Ants have neurons that work along
<br />
similar lines as human neurons.  Surely this must affect the
<br />
probability that is assigned to the question of whether ants are able
<br />
to experience things like pain in a similar way that humans do.  It
<br />
certainly seems to me to be significant.
<br />
<br />So how does this extra information show up in your assessment of ant
<br />
consciousness?
<br />
<br />Again, it seems to me that SSA arguments are better than nothing.  But
<br />
their usefulness fades quickly as more sources of data become
<br />
available.  They might be a good first stab at answering a question,
<br />
but ideally will never be the final word.
<br />
<br />For instance, why would I believe your argument over something like
<br />
this:
<br />
<br />Fish Feel Pain, Study Finds
<br />
<br />When you hook a fish, does it hurt? Yes, a new study suggests.
<br />
<br />Some researchers have previously concluded that fish react to painful
<br />
stimuli without actually feeling pain in the conscious way humans do.
<br />
<br />In the new study, researchers gave morphine to one group of fish, and
<br />
injected the other group with a placebo (saline). Then the fish were
<br />
treated to burning sensations that were expected to be painful but
<br />
which did not damage any fish tissue.
<br />
<br />Both groups reacted the same, by wriggling.
<br />
<br />However, the fish that had been on morphine later went on about
<br />
business as if nothing had happened. The fish that had gotten the
<br />
saline were wary after the test.
<br />
<br />&quot;They acted with defensive behaviors, indicating wariness, or fear and
<br />
anxiety,&quot; said Joseph Garner, an assistant professor at Purdue
<br />
University.
<br />
<br />&quot;The experiment shows that fish do not only respond to painful stimuli
<br />
with reflexes, but change their behavior also after the event,&quot; said
<br />
Janicke Nordgreen, a doctoral student in the Norwegian School of
<br />
Veterinary Science. &quot;Together with what we know from experiments
<br />
carried out by other groups, this indicates that the fish consciously
<br />
perceive the test situation as painful and switch to behaviors
<br />
indicative of having been through an aversive experience.&quot;
<br />
<br />A study last month indicated that crabs feel pain, too.
<br />
<br />Garner and Nordgreen published their results in the online version of
<br />
the journal Applied Animal Behaviour Science.
<br />
<br />Garner figures the morphine blocked the experience of pain, but not
<br />
behavioral responses to the heat stimulus itself, either because the
<br />
responses were reflexive or because the morphine blocked the
<br />
experience of pain, but not the experience of an unusual stimulus.
<br />
<br />&quot;If you think back to when you have had a headache and taken a
<br />
painkiller, the pain may go away, but you can still feel the presence
<br />
or discomfort of the headache,&quot; Garner said.
<br />
<br />&quot;The goldfish that did not get morphine experienced this painful,
<br />
stressful event. Then two hours later, they turned that pain into fear
<br />
like we do,&quot; Garner said. &quot;To me, it sounds an awful lot like how we
<br />
experience pain.&quot;
<br />
<br />Then again, scientist don't fully understand pain in humans. It is
<br />
felt when electrical signals are sent from nerve endings to your
<br />
brain, which in turn can release painkillers called endorphins and
<br />
generate physical and emotional reactions. The details remain unclear,
<br />
which his why so many people suffer chronic pain with no relief.
