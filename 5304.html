It is perhaps not as easy to get the H2O boiling point right, but you did 
<br />
not convince me of any fundamental impossibility of scientific ethic. Now,  
<br />
I believe that if there is any scientific ethic
<br />
then it cannot be  normative and cannot give moral injunctions. It will only 
<br />
give theories, which can be applied to solve problems like &quot;if you agree 
<br />
with this and that principle of ethic then you should agree with such and 
<br />
such other principles&quot;. You tell me that there will be too much theories. 
<br />
But I can imagine that some will win, or that some will be deduced from 
<br />
other more basic principles.
<br />
-ENDQUOTE
<br />
<br /><br />Actually, that's very well put: &quot;if you agree with this and that principle, 
<br />
you should agree with such and such other principles&quot;. It covers everything 
<br />
from Euclidian geometry to physics and chemistry to ethics and aesthetics. I 
<br />
still believe there is at least a quantitative difference between the former 
<br />
and the latter, however. If I return to my example of alien civilizations, I 
<br />
would be surprised if an alien textbook of maths, physics or chemistry did 
<br />
not contain many items recognisable to humans when appropriately translated, 
<br />
and in fact this very expectation has been used by SETI - eg. looking for 
<br />
radio transmissions containing a sequence of prime numbers. On the other 
<br />
hand, I would be surprised if alien art or ethics were not very different to 
<br />
what we know as humans, as there are large differences even between human 
<br />
cultures, not to mention the differences between various terrestrial 
<br />
species. Borrowing a phrase from genetics, scientific statements are &quot;highly 
<br />
conserved&quot; between cultures, ethical and aesthetic statements are 
<br />
&quot;moderately conserved&quot;, while nonsensical statements merge into the 
<br />
background noise. This is a quantitative difference, but I still think there 
<br />
is a qualitative difference which I have not managed to convey properly. 
<br />
Take these two statements:
<br />
(a) Dulce et decorum est/ Pro patria mori (Wilfred Owen)
<br />
(b) He died in the trenches during WW I from chlorine gas poisoning
<br />
The former conveys feelings, values, wishes, while the latter conveys facts. 
<br />
The former is not true or false in the same way as the latter statement is. 
<br />
This has always seemed obvious to me and it has been stated in one form or 
<br />
another by philosophers of an empiricist bent since David Hume. Does anyone 
<br />
subscribing to this list really disagree that (a) and (b) are different at 
<br />
some fundamental level?
