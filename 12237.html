<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Well said!  I agree almost completely - I'm a little 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; uncertain about (3) and (4) above and the meaning of &quot;scope&quot;. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Together with the qualifications of Peter Jones regarding 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the lack of universal agreement on even the best supported 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theories of science, you have provided a good outline of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; development of ethics in a way parallel with the scientific 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; development of knowledge.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; There's a good paper on the relation facts and values by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Oliver Curry which bears on many of the above points:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; <a href="http://human-nature.com/ep/downloads/ep04234247.pdf">http://human-nature.com/ep/downloads/ep04234247.pdf</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is a well-written paper, particularly good on an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explanation of the &quot;naturalistic fallacy&quot;, covering what we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have been discussing in this thread (and the parallel thread 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on evil etc. with which it seems to have crossed over).  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Basically, the paper argues that Humes edict that you can't 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; get is from ought is no impediment to a naturalistic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explanation of ethics, and that incidentally Hume himself had 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a naturalistic explanation. Another statement of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; naturalistic fallacy is that explanation is not the same as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; justification: 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that while Darwinian mechanisms may explain why we have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certain ethical systems that does not constitute 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; justification for those sytems. To this Curry counters:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;In case this is all rather abstract, let me re-state the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point by way of an analogy. Suppose that instead of being 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about morality and why people find certain things morally 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; good and bad, this article had been about sweetness, and why 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; people find certain things sweet and certain things sour. The 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Humean-Darwinian would have argued that humans have an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evolved digestive system that distinguishes between good and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bad sources of nutrition and energy; and that the human 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'sweet tooth' is an evolved preference for foods with high 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sugar-content over foods with low sugar-content. If one 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; accepted this premise, it would make no sense to complain 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that evolution may have explained why humans find certain 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things sweet, but it cannot tell us whether these things are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; really sweet or not. It follows from the premises of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argument that there is no criterion of sweetness independent 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of human psychology, and hence this question cannot arise.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That's fine if we stop at explanation at the descriptive 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; level. But sweetness lacks the further dimension of &quot;ought&quot;: 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if I say &quot;sugar is sweet&quot; I am stating a fact about the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relationship between sugar and my tastebuds, while if I say 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;murder is bad&quot; I am not only stating a fact about how I feel 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about it, I am also making a profound claim about the world. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In a sense, I think this latter claim or feeling is illusory 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and there is nothing to it beyond genes and upbringing, but I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; still have it, and moreover I can have such feelings in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conflict with genes and upbringing. As G.E. Moore said (also 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quoted in the article), if I identify &quot;good&quot; with some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; natural object X, it is always possible to ask, &quot;is X good?&quot;, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which means that &quot;good&quot; must essentially be something else, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;simple, indefinable, unanalysable object of thought&quot;, which 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only contingently coincides with natural objects or their 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; properties. The same applies even if you include as &quot;natural 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; object&quot; commands from God. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />I was preparing a response to related questions from Stathis in a
<br />
separate post when I noticed that he had already done an excellent job
<br />
of clarifying the issue here.  I would add only the following:
<br />
<br />The fundamental importance of context cannot be overemphasized in
<br />
discussions of Self, Free-will, Morality, etc., anywhere that the
<br />
subjective and the objective are considered together.  Like
<br />
particle/wave duality, we can only get answers consistent with the
<br />
context of our questions.
<br />
<br />* Many have attempted to bridge the gap between is and ought, but
<br />
haven't fully grasped the futility of attempting to find the
<br />
intersection of a point of view and its inverse.
<br />
* Many have shaken their heads wisely and stated that is and ought are
<br />
entirely disjoint, so nothing useful can be said about any supposed
<br />
relations between the two.
<br />
* Very few have realized the essential relativity of ALL our models of
<br />
thought, that there is no privileged frame of reference for making
<br />
objective distinctions between is and ought because we are inextricably
<br />
part of the system we are trying to describe, and THAT is what grounds
<br />
the subjective within the objective.
<br />
<br />There can be no absolute or objective basis for claims of moral value,
<br />
because subjective assessment is intrinsic to the issue.
<br />
But we, as effective agents within the context of an evolving
<br />
environment, can *absolutely agree* that:
<br />
* subjective assessments have objective consequences, which then feed
<br />
back to influence future subjective assessments.
<br />
* actions are assessed as &quot;good&quot; to the extent that they are perceived
<br />
to promote into the future the present values of the (necessarily
<br />
subjective) assessor.
<br />
* actions are assessed as &quot;better&quot; to the extent that they are perceived
<br />
to promote &quot;good&quot; over greater scope of consequences.
<br />
* actions are assessed as &quot;right in principle&quot; (or &quot;moral&quot;) to the
<br />
extent that they are perceived to be &quot;better&quot; over greater context of
<br />
decision-making.
<br />
<br />So a pragmatic theory of ethics is clearly achievable, and by the very
<br />
nature of its subject, desirable.
<br />
<br />Key is that for any subjective agent there are no absolutes and there
<br />
never have been, while we continue to be pulled along in the direction
<br />
of increasing synergetic advantage.
<br />
<br />Paradox is always a matter of insufficient context--in the bigger
<br />
picture, all the pieces must fit.
<br />
<br />- Jef
