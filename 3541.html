<em class="quotelev1">&gt; try to maximize their measures according to some measure function will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tend to have large measures according to that measure function. So if

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multiverse according to a second measure function, you'll likely find

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; second measure function.

<br />This makes sense in a formal, mathematical way.  Given a sheaf of
<br />
universes you can apply any weighting function you want.  But I still
<br />
think you are taking too many degrees of freedom here.  My intuition is
<br />
that there must be some kind of constraint which keeps you from adopting
<br />
arbitrary measures.  But I don't have a good idea yet for what that
<br />
might be.
<br />
<br />A couple of possibilities occur to me.  One is that it might be
<br />
irrational to adopt other measures (for some definition of rationality).
<br />
For example, rationality might impose some consistency conditions on your
<br />
weighting function.
<br />
<br />Another possibility is that mathematics says that there is really only
<br />
one measure function, the universal measure, for all but an insignificant
<br />
fraction of worlds.  That is, all measure functions are arbitrarily
<br />
close to the universal measure, in the limit.  I thought I remembered
<br />
reading that this was a property of the universal measure.  If so then
<br />
it would mean that you can't really depart from it very much.
<br />
<br />There is also the point I and others have made, that you are not just an
<br />
observer from outside the universe, but a participant inside.  This ties
<br />
you to the universe in a way which might constrain you.  I think your
<br />
argument above makes more sense if you think of yourself as an observer
<br />
of a multiverse in which you are not participating, say some kind of
<br />
computer simulation.  Then the idea of measure seems pretty arbitrary.
<br />
However once you are inside you are influenced by the reality of measure.
<br />
I don't see how you can reconcile the notion that measure is arbitrary
<br />
with the observation that the laws of probability work.  Aren't these
<br />
phenomena tied together?  Living here in this world, aren't you forced
<br />
to either believe that the universe is fantastically improbable (because
<br />
we live in an extremely low-measure universe for some arbitrary measure),
<br />
or else that we do in fact live in a high measure universe, meaning that
<br />
measure is not arbitrary?
<br />
<br />I think you have answered this last objection already but I need to think
<br />
about it some more.  I don't know if any of these proposals really work.
<br />
