<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The Turing test is a rule of thumb, not a necessary or sufficient
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  condition. [for consciousness]
</em><br />
<br />Balderdash!!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The standard example is a huge look-up table (HLUT).  This is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; database that contains an answer that will be printed out (or voice
</em><br />
<br />I certainly consider the lookup table implementation of a
<br />
Turing-test-passer as conscious as any other implementation.
<br />
<br />An HLUT could be produced by a compiler expanding a &quot;conventionally&quot;
<br />
written AI program, unrolling loops and turning branches
<br />
into parallel code tracks, resulting in a unidirectional
<br />
code tree, each branchpoint switched by input or by time events.
<br />
The tree ends at every point where the consciousness is
<br />
deemed to &quot;die&quot;, presumably finite on all branches.
<br />
<br />Optimizing compilers do that sort of thing all the time (rarely to the
<br />
total extent of the HLUT, but that's just a compile-time parameter
<br />
setting!).  I would find it outrageous to classify two identically
<br />
behaving robots as one conscious and the other a zombie simply because
<br />
one had been compiled with a higher loop-unrolling constant than the
<br />
other (from the same source code).
<br />
<br />The confusion results from people trying to define consciousness
<br />
as an objective property, when it's not.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Let me repeat my firm position: consciousness is an attribution we
<br />
place on behavior, a subjective matter, not an objective fact.  Things
<br />
with the right behavior make the attribution natural.  ANY Turing test
<br />
passer can naturally be attributed consciousness, by virtue of its
<br />
conversation, irrelevant of how it achieves that internally.  We
<br />
project onto the behavior a &quot;psychological&quot; explanation involving
<br />
non-physical quantities like belief, feelings, motives, dislikes,
<br />
passions etc.
<br />
<br />Our own personal consciousness are the psychological states we
<br />
attribute to ourselves.  Since &quot;attribution&quot; and &quot;ourselves&quot; are
<br />
themselves psychological properties, the whole concept of
<br />
consciousness is circular, and exists only in its own fantasy.
<br />
<br />An alien not versed in &quot;consciousness lore&quot; could represent you or me
<br />
in purely mechanical terms, like wind-up-toys.  We do what we do and
<br />
make the noises we make simply because of the physical interactions of
<br />
our various parts, connected as they are.  No ridiculous &quot;mental
<br />
properties&quot; there at all.
<br />
<br />As long as people try to treat consciousness as an objective property,
<br />
they will remain confused, looking for some mysterious property
<br />
possessed by some machinery, and not by others.
<br />
<br />There's no such objective property.
<br />
<br />The attribution of consciousness is a matter of opinion, even though
<br />
we have a strong disposition to say certain things are, and certain
<br />
things are not.  When it comes to new things like robots, there is no
<br />
consensus, and need never be.  Engineers, analyzing the technical
<br />
diagrams, can look at any robot as a pure insensate machine, while
<br />
those that interact with the robot socially will worry about its
<br />
feelings, commiserating with its setbacks and rejoicing in its
<br />
successes.  When the latter asks the robot about its internal life,
<br />
they will interpret its answers (&quot;I have a pain in all the diodes on
<br />
my left side&quot;) as a consequence of its consciousness.  The engineers
<br />
will take the same sounds being produced as evidence of a certain
<br />
byte-stream being sent to the voice unit, those bytes coming from
<br />
line 7,588,678,201 of a phrase table, triggered by input condition
<br />
99,654,777,922. No consciousness there, only mindless machinery.
<br />
<br />Neither opinion is right or wrong, they're just different ways of
<br />
interpreting the same situation.
