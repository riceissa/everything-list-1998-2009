<br />Decaying to nothing is not a requirement. All that matters is that a 
<br />
particle can not know of other particles, and for the reason being 
<br />
that redshift has gone to zero energy because the (relative to the 
<br />
affected particle) universe then is inflating at a speed faster than 
<br />
light and so no particle can interact with that affected particle. 
<br />
The bottom line is that there is no way to take relative measurements 
<br />
in that situation. If energy is not relative to something else then 
<br />
it is nothing more than virtual energy. From my opening and following 
<br />
posts for this list topic, I'm saying that when that situation occurs 
<br />
the energy has not been lost but it has been returned to what I've 
<br />
chosen (for topic consistency) to call a meta universe and from which 
<br />
it originated.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The theory of supersymmetry predicted that protons would decay.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Experiments have put lower bounds on the life of the proton that are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;inconsistent with the simple forms of supersymmetry.  Some modified
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;version may still be possible.
</em><br />
...
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I think you are misled by cosmological discussions of inflation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;These generally assume a uniform, spherically symmetric solution to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Einsteins equations because that makes them explicitly solvalbe and 
</em><br />
it
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is a good approximation at very large scales.  In this 
</em><br />
approximation,
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;changes in the metric are uniform throughout space.  This might lead
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you to suppose that space is inflating even between quarks; but this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is an artifact of the simplifying approximation.  If the equations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;were solved exactly, taking into account of the lumpy distribution 
</em><br />
of
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;matter then there would be no expansion between nearby 
</em><br />
gravitationally
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;bound bodies (as in galaxies, much less atoms).  Of course it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;already known that Einsteins equations cannot be correct at atomic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;scales anyway because Einsteins theory is not consistent with 
</em><br />
quantum
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mechanics.
</em><br />
<br />Again you seem to argue that there is a threshold level of attraction 
<br />
(be it gravitational or nuclear) below which inflation can not occur. 
<br />
If that be the case then what mechanism can explain inflation near 
<br />
the initial creation time of the universe when density of all 
<br />
existing matter was so highly concentrated? But inflation certain did 
<br />
occur, then it slowed, then it sped up again and appears to continue 
<br />
doing so. Might there be two differing types of inflation? Inflation 
<br />
did occur when all matter was gravitationally bound together during 
<br />
the birth times of our universe, the equations must reflect that 
<br />
empirical evidence. Had it not been for inflation the gravitational 
<br />
binding would have resulted in an immediate collapse of the newly 
<br />
born universe.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;It seems to me that it is true that one reason behind a decay of 
</em><br />
any
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;particle (radioactive or not) is because of inflation rather than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;because of fuzzy quantum chance. The argument I put forth is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;any atomic arrangement is actually 100% stable until it is acted 
</em><br />
upon
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;by an external force, which does include inflation but could also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;include interaction with other energy sources.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;How is this argument consistent with the very accurate prediction of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;decay rates based on quantum analysis of potential barriers which do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not consider inflation or any other aspect of gravity?
</em><br />
<br />You refer to quantum mechanical tunneling, a probabilistic event? 
<br />
We're getting Spooky again! It's a form of expression related to 
<br />
Planck's constant. There is no &quot;in between&quot; state in QM, a particle 
<br />
is either here or it's there when it comes to the smallest packet of 
<br />
energy that can be expressed. When decay occurs due to a particle 
<br />
being &quot;there&quot; instead of being &quot;here&quot; (i.e. bound as it was to a 
<br />
nucleus) we are simply seeing QM probability on display. This is not 
<br />
the same mechanism of decay being caused by inflation. There is no 
<br />
uncertainty when it comes to inflation, because decay by that method 
<br />
is not dependant on QM and it is instead dependant to how much space 
<br />
volume has inflated within a region occupied by the constructs of a 
<br />
particle and how the increasing distance between those constructs is 
<br />
eventually expressed in the only way matter can do so - in units 
<br />
specified by Planck's constant.
