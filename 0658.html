<br />If we did find ourselves in such a world, near an ending at any one
<br />
state such as a vacuum, we should and would undoubtedly reason that all
<br />
space-time paths inevitably converge toward such a state, similar to how
<br />
we perhaps unconsciously assume that all other paths of space-time,
<br />
within in all the MW's of QM most likely begin highly similar to our
<br />
own, this versus expecting that other partially conceivable worlds exist
<br />
that are without temporal beginnings or perhaps a set of collapsing
<br />
worlds with no primordial phase of expansion.
<br />
<br />I can imagine a similar present day Earth where Fred Hoyle is known for
<br />
discovering the steady state of the universe and no one has heard of
<br />
Albert Einstein, yet I doubt this world's actual existence. I expect the
<br />
physics of our own space-time world reflects a single natural
<br />
superstructure, as follows.
<br />
<br />In recognizing that 100% of all possible worlds end at a common single
<br />
state we would then consider such a state as a sort of ultimate
<br />
attractor (Stuart Kauffman) within the Universe's overall or aggregate
<br />
state space (the set of all possible states).
<br />
<br />Presently the common notion is that the set of all possible states is
<br />
infinite and we conclude naturally that this means it is without
<br />
boundaries. Yet we recognize the early universe as a supremely ordered
<br />
state, possibly infinitely dense, which itself is a boundary within
<br />
aggregate state space. We do presently figure in that there is a state
<br />
of highest order.
<br />
<br />Some thus describe all states as a wedge, given shape by the single
<br />
state of highest order, yet there is an endless number of disordered
<br />
states as the wedge expands. Or the highest order state is a singular
<br />
central pattern and the sea of other possible states expands in any
<br />
direction away from that point. Such models lead us to envision the
<br />
reason behind the second law to be that time has a taste for disorder,
<br />
because there is always more disordered states than ordered states.
<br />
<br />Yet if we consider how we would envision nature itself, the universe we
<br />
live in, if we actually did find ourselves in a world where all probable
<br />
paths of time where converging toward a state of ever increasing
<br />
entropy, toward zero, we would indubitably consider that convergence to
<br />
be a universal process. Your proposition I think is intuited and real.
<br />
Now that we have discovered an increasing expansion rate, it is becoming
<br />
increasingly clear that an expanding universe (any expansion greater
<br />
than a decreasing rate) may have an ending just as it has a beginning,
<br />
and that ending will necessarily fall to an absolute zero energy state,
<br />
a physical condition the scientific community considered impossible only
<br />
months ago.
<br />
<br />If we found ourselves directly facing such a future we would then be
<br />
more inclined to study the qualities of absolute zero similar to how we
<br />
are increasingly able to relate to infinite density (no boundary
<br />
proposal), recognizing that the consistency of our normal mathematical
<br />
(plane) system and the laws of physics, our way of describing reality,
<br />
breaks down at extreme states.
<br />
<br />Absolute zero is a common point in nature, of zero energy, mass,
<br />
density, volume, curvature, and time. Yet spatially, the universe
<br />
expands ever nearer toward it. This omega point is the upper limit of
<br />
variation, at which point expansion loses its meaning and the Universe
<br />
becomes perfectly flat, empty of matter, even as space extends
<br />
infinitely in all directions.
<br />
<br />Like infinite density or the highest state of order, such is also an
<br />
extreme of possibility, a singular isolated state in the Universe's
<br />
aggregate state space, which means that there are two extremes which are
<br />
in a real sense boundaries. The set of all possible states is infinite
<br />
yet bordered by ultimate extremes, thus giving nature an ultimate shape
<br />
and a describable foundation from which we are able to derive basic
<br />
axioms and a mathematics.
<br />
<br />The concept of an omega point at the end of time is not new, but the
<br />
idea that there are boundaries to aggregate state space is perhaps a
<br />
fresh idea. If we recognize boundaries to the set of all possible states
<br />
it is immediately possible to then recognize the actual boundaries that
<br />
apply to a MWI of space-time, and then possible to know the actual
<br />
probabilities that regulate where an observer can exist.
<br />
<br />In my experience I have not found that fresh ideas are often welcomed
<br />
but I have been subscribed for a few months now and its about time I
<br />
posted something. Still, thanks for setting the tone enough to drag me
<br />
in. If I was able to seduce anybody into the absurd notion that infinity
<br />
has boundaries there's more at my website.
