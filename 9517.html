<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; OK.  I think I understand what you are saying, on a surface level.  Of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; course a surface level will never be able to expose any contradictions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  I'm just riding this wave as long as I can before deciding to get off.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It seems that there are very deep concepts here.  We are standing on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the shoulders of computability giants.  I think it would take a Godel
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; or a Church or Turing to find any problem with your whole argument, if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; there is any.  My feeling is that any &quot;problem&quot; is actually just lack
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of deep enough insight, either on the part of the attempting-refuter of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the argument, or on your part, or both.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; By the way, I am also cognizant that what you are covering here
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; actually is pretty standard stuff and actually has been pored over by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the giants of computability.  So like I said, I'm riding the wave.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; On a certain level, it bothers me that Church's Thesis is said to not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; have any proof.  But maybe it is sort of like Newton's gravity.  It is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; just a descriptive statement about what can be observed.  And yet... we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; still don't really understand gravity.  Here we are at the level where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; all there is is falsifiability.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK. Note that Church thesis has a unique status in math. I will come
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; back on this.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; And, by the same diagonalization
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; argument, you'd have to be God to falsify this &quot;stuff&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ah... but here you are wrong. Church thesis, although not entirely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical, still less physical, is completely refutable in the sense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of Popper (and thus &quot;scientific&quot; in the &quot;modern&quot; acceptation of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; word). To refute Church thesis it is enough to find a function F such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that you can show:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) F is computable, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) F is not Turing emulable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Some people, like Kalmar, has thought they got such a function, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this has been rebuked.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />I don't know much about Church Thesis, but I want to learn more.  Even
<br />
though it seems easy to recite, as in the existence of a Universal
<br />
Language, it seems very deep and mysterious.  Almost like stating a
<br />
Unified Field Thesis.  You just state it, and then see where it leads,
<br />
at least as far as you are able to follow it.
<br />
<br />But on the surface, the very prospect of someone trying to disprove
<br />
Church Thesis is funny to me.  Perhaps I am missing something.  To
<br />
think of a counterexample seems like a contradiction.  Didn't Turing
<br />
describe his Turing machine as equivalent to what a mathematician can
<br />
do with a pencil and paper?  But the counterexample would have to be
<br />
something that someone (probably a mathematician ;) could think up!  So
<br />
a counterexample would be a function F that
<br />
<br />1) a mathematician could think up
<br />
2) without using a pencil and paper!  Oooo.
<br />
<br />Actually, I am aware that people like Penrose actually say that
<br />
something is going on in the brain (quantum-mechanically) that could
<br />
never happen on a piece of paper.  But putting it in the above way
<br />
makes it sound funny.  And I think actually Penrose might claim that
<br />
the function G is just such a function.  He doesn't say much in his
<br />
Shadows of the Mind about Church Thesis.  But, Bruno, your posts on
<br />
this seem to be assuming Church Thesis and then seeing what the
<br />
conclusion is about G, which is perhaps the opposite of Penrose.
<br />
<br />Do you think that there is a possibility that Church Thesis has the
<br />
same status as the Continuum Hypothesis in this sense:  the Continuum
<br />
Hypothesis has been shown to be independent of the axioms of
<br />
arithmetic, i.e. both the truth and the falsity of the Continuum
<br />
Hypothesis is consistent with the axioms of arithmetic.  Could the
<br />
Church Thesis be independent of... what?... The problem is: what body
<br />
of knowledge is there that is in the pursuit of truth, and is also
<br />
intimately affected by the Church Thesis?  The mind-body problem, I
<br />
guess.  Could the Church Thesis be independent of the mind-body
<br />
problem?
<br />
<br />Tom
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Eliot Mendelson has argued that CT is provable, and sometimes I share a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; little bit that feeling. I did believe that CT is provable in &quot;second
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; order arithmetic&quot; for a time because it did seem to me that CT relies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; above all on the intuition of the finite/infinite distinction. But then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it could still be subtler than that, and I am not sure at all CT could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; really be proved.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Note that I talk only on the classical Church thesis, not about its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intuitonistic variants, which I do believe are false for the first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person associated to the machine (and this has been partially confirmed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by a result due to Artemov which shows that some &quot;computabiliy version&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of constructive mathematics (like the so called Markov principle) is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; false in S4Grz (with quantifiers). But intuitionist CTs really asserts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a different thing. The only roles intuitionistic CTs have in my work
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are for the explanation of why (first person) machine find so hard to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; say yes to the doctor and also to clarify the non-constuctivity feature
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the &quot;OR&quot; in &quot;Washington OR Moscow&quot; self-duplication experiments.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Godel did miss Church thesis, and he takes some years for him to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; eventually assess it and then to describe it as a &quot;sort of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; epistemological miracle&quot;. At the same time I would say Godel never got
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it completely because he will search for an equivalent miracle for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; provability notion, but this can be shown being highly not plausible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ... from Church thesis.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have evidence that Charles Babbage (and perhaps its friend Ada
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Lovelace) got Church thesis, once century before the others. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evidence comes from a book by Jacques Lafitte(*) who said in 1911 that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Babbage discovered that his notation system for describing its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; analytical machine was somehow cleverer than his machine. Now, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; first who really discovered explictly &quot;Church thesis&quot; and its relation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with both computability and provability, is Emil Post in 1922,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; according to my knowledge.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Must go now. I intend to comment Tom and Stathis' post  later, perhaps
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Saturday because I have exams all the day tomorrow.
