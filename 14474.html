'MCRT: An Upper Ontology for General Purpose Reality Modeling'
<br />
<br /><br />By Marc Geddes
<br />
Sydney, Australia
<br />
22th March, 2008
<br />
<br />Abstract
<br />
In this paper I explore the consequence of two assumptions:
<br />
(1)	A model of reality can be entirely captured by an Upper Ontology
<br />
and Data Models are Logical Communications
<br />
(2)	A method of general purpose reality modeling is equivalent to a
<br />
Universal Parser
<br />
<br /><br />Introduction
<br />
<br />To design a general purpose method of reality modeling I assume that
<br />
such a method is equivalent to a 'universal parser' - ie. A system of
<br />
translation between different logical representations of concepts.
<br />
High-level logical representations (ie data models) can be considered
<br />
as methods of logical communication.  Thus, the aim is the
<br />
construction of an Upper Ontology capable of encompassing all other
<br />
ontologies (ie a general purpose representation of the domain
<br />
'knowledge' which enables the translation between all other more
<br />
specific ontologies (ie general purpose ontology merging).
<br />
<br />Previously, I designed the skeleton out-line of the Upper Ontology
<br />
('Top Level Domain Model of the Mathematico-Cognition Reality Theory',
<br />
Marc Geddes, First correct version: 4th Dec, 2007, everything-list).
<br />
This is MCRT (the Mathematico-Cognition Reality Theory).  It appears
<br />
that the process of data modeling can be separated into three general
<br />
types: Mathematical (Software Development - or SD), Teleological (The
<br />
creation of value systems - ie. Story Narration - or SN) and Physical
<br />
(Virtual Reality - or VR).  The initial aim then, is the elaboration
<br />
of MCRT, the development of the triple-aspect ontology and the study
<br />
of the relationships between SD, SN and VR ontologies.
<br />
<br />Initial Knowledge Base: MCRT Ontology
<br />
<br />MCRT Upper Ontology provides a skeleton structure for the proposed
<br />
Upper Ontology .  This paper provides the beginnings of the
<br />
specification of MCRT Upper Ontology.
<br />
<br />MCRT is an Upper Ontology, an abstract top-level representation of
<br />
'reality' at the highest possible level of description.
<br />
<br />Knowledge Domains
<br />
<br />Sub-domains of reality are areas of 'Concept Space'(CS) classified by
<br />
three KR axes.
<br />
<br />1st Axis: Physics, Teleology, Mathematics
<br />
2nd Axis: Platonic, Cognition, Artifact
<br />
3rd Axis:  Independent, Relative, Mediating
<br />
<br />A brief description of each axis follows.  The meaning of each domain
<br />
is then elaborated on through references to known fields and examples.
<br />
<br />1st Axis:
<br />
<br />Physics (PHY): Domains related to material entities.  Concerned with
<br />
space and geometry - or the classification of whether things are
<br />
'Solid' or 'Empty'.
<br />
<br />Teleology (TEL): Domains related to goal directed entities.  Concerned
<br />
with values - or the classification of whether things are 'Good' or
<br />
'Bad' relative to agents.
<br />
<br />Mathematics (MAT): Domains related to knowledge itself (meta-data).
<br />
Concerned with logical    implications - or the classification of
<br />
models of reality as 'True' or 'False'.
<br />
<br />2nd Axis:
<br />
Platonic (PLA): Domains related to abstract universal entities. These
<br />
are entities which are postulated to be eternal and unchanging, and
<br />
cannot be located in any finite region of reality (they are
<br />
abstract).  This is simply anything which is 'abstract', 'constant',
<br />
and 'applicable to any region of reality'.
<br />
<br />Cognition (COG): Domains related to systems.  Systems have three main
<br />
characteristics: (i) Input, (ii)
<br />
Processing, (iii) Output.  Simply, the term means 'system' in the most
<br />
general sense.
<br />
<br />Artifact (ART): Domains related to particular things.  An artifact is
<br />
an instantiated object, a particular instance of something with
<br />
particular attributes and behaviours.  This is close to the meaning of
<br />
'object' in the sense of OOP (Object Oriented Programming).
<br />
<br />3rd Axis:
<br />
<br />Independent (IND): Domains related to intrinsic properties.
<br />
Properties of things in themselves,  without reference to external
<br />
objects.  An 'element' in the most general sense of the term.
<br />
<br />Relative (REL): Domains related to functional (external) properties.
<br />
The relation or effect something has on things external to itself. A
<br />
'function' or 'action' in the most general sense of these terms.
<br />
<br />Mediating (MED): Domains related to signifying (semantic) properties.
<br />
How something is represented or 'appears' to something else.  An
<br />
'icon', 'signal' or 'means of communication' in the most general sense
<br />
of the term.
<br />
<br />Reference: The third axis is similar to the ontological classification
<br />
scheme of Charles Pierce, hence, the same names have been used.
<br />
However the definitions given here are not identical to Pierces.
<br />
<br />The following summarizes the concepts that each axis attempts to
<br />
capture.
<br />
<br />1st Axis:
<br />
PHY  - Geometry
<br />
TEL  -  Value
<br />
MAT -  Implication
<br />
<br />2nd Axis:
<br />
PLA  - Universal (Abstraction)
<br />
COG - System (Process)
<br />
ART -  Particular (Object)
<br />
<br />3rd Axis:
<br />
IND -   Comprising (is made of)
<br />
REL -  Acting (functions as)
<br />
MED -  Signifying (appears as)
<br />
<br /><br /><br />The names and areas of knowledge referenced by pairs of the 1st and
<br />
2nd axes are as follows:
<br />
<br />Mathematico-Platonic:	Pure mathematics
<br />
Mathematico-Cognition:	Intelligence/Mind
<br />
Mathematico-Artifact:		Software
<br />
Teleo-Platonic:		Moral Ideals
<br />
Teleo-Cognition:		Agents/Society
<br />
Teleo-Artifact:			Memes/Culture
<br />
Physico-Platonic:		Laws of Physics
<br />
Physico-Cognition:		Physical Interactions
<br />
Physico-Artifact:		Concrete objects
<br />
<br />Classification of IT related knowledge domains by the MCRT
<br />
<br />The three KR axes combine to generate 27 'fundamental knowledge
<br />
domains'. The 27 knowledge domains resulting from the combination of
<br />
these axes is described as follows.  Examples are given of known
<br />
fields (often information technology (IT) related) which fit the
<br />
classifications.  Maintaining and developing an effective general
<br />
purpose knowledge base implies investigating the ontological
<br />
categories of all these fields.

<br />
<br />Relationship to other methods of data modeling
<br />
<br />Since MCRT represents the outline of a completely general type of data
<br />
modeling, the relationship between MCRT and other forms of data
<br />
modeling will be considered.
<br />
<br />MCRT and Unified Modeling Language (UML)
<br />
<br />There are 3 generic types of UML techniques: State Models, Behavior
<br />
Models and State Change Models.
<br />
State Models - Static views of a domain, constituting class diagrams.
<br />
Comparable to MCRT ontology as a whole.
<br />
Behavior Models - Models specialized for dealing with systems.
<br />
(Dynamic processes with input and output).  State Chart Diagrams focus
<br />
on state transitions, Sequence and Activity Diagrams focus on time
<br />
ordering and data flow, respectively, and Use Case Diagrams focus on
<br />
overall functional behavior.  These are all associated with the
<br />
'Cognition' (COG) level of MCRT.
<br />
<br />MCRT and Relational Schema such as Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD)
<br />
<br />The terminology used in relational database technology is motivated by
<br />
pure mathematical relations.  Pure relational databases lack
<br />
additional specialized techniques for dealing with dynamic systems.
<br />
Thus, relational schema such as ERD's effectively only deal with the
<br />
'Artifact' level of MCRT.
<br />
The 'Internal View' of ERD's corresponds to meta-data about the
<br />
database itself. It corresponds to the Mathematico-Artifact level of
<br />
MCRT.
<br />
<br /><br />MCRT			ERD
<br />
Mathematico-Artifact	Internal View
<br />
<br />MCRT and Software Architectures
<br />
<br />By considering knowledge domains as representing actual classes in an
<br />
object oriented software architecture, relations between MCRT and
<br />
software architectures can be discussed.
<br />
<br />Model-Controller-View (MCV) architecture
<br />
<br />Model - Models of objects external to the computer system  (analogous
<br />
to the 'Conceptual' view in relational modeling).
<br />
View - Particular presentation of some aspects of a model to a user
<br />
(or the system itself).
<br />
Control - Models of internal objects representing the computer system
<br />
itself ('Reflective schema') analogous to the 'Internal' view in
<br />
relational modeling).
<br />
<br />In MCRT, the domains on the Mathematico-Cognition (MAT, COG) level
<br />
correspond to the 'Control' classes of MCV.
<br />
MCRT				MCV
<br />
Mathematico-Cognition	Control
<br />
<br />Hierarchical Levels of Reality
<br />
<br />A most important feature of MCRT is that reality is hierarchical. MCRT
<br />
assumes that the 'concept space' representing reality is a hierarchy.
<br />
The more general concepts subsume (include and supercede) the more
<br />
specific.  There are levels of abstraction.
<br />
<br />The hierarchical ordering of the elements of the axes, from most
<br />
general to least general, is as follows:
<br />
<br />1st axis:
<br />
1st Mathematics (MAT)
<br />
2nd Teleology (TEL)
<br />
3rd Physics (PHY)
<br />
<br />2nd axis:
<br />
1st Platonic (PLA)
<br />
2nd Cognition (COG)
<br />
3 rd Artifact (ART)
<br />
<br />3rd axis:
<br />
1st Mediating (MED)
<br />
2nd Relative (REL)
<br />
3rd Independent (IND)
<br />
<br />If the scheme is correct, it is to be expected that fields of
<br />
knowledge classified as domains lower in the ontological hierarchy
<br />
should be subsumed by fields of knowledge classified as domains higher
<br />
in the ontological hierarchy.
<br />
<br />For example, Category Theory should be a more powerful type of
<br />
mathematics than Algebraic Fields, since Algebraic Fields are
<br />
classified at a lower level of ontological abstraction (Mathematics-
<br />
Platonic-Relative) than Category Theory (Mathematics-Platonic-
<br />
Mediating).  In turn, Algebraic Fields should be a more powerful
<br />
mathematics than Combinatorics, since Combinatorics (Mathematics-
<br />
Platonic-Independent) is classified at a lower level of ontological
<br />
abstraction than Algebraic Fields (Mathematics-Platonic-Relative).
<br />
Indeed, this is exactly what we find.  Category Theory is believed to
<br />
be a more general type of math than ordinary algebra, which in turn is
<br />
known to have superceded the ancient field of Combinatorics.  Thus, it
<br />
appears that the fields of mathematics can indeed be arranged
<br />
hierarchically.
<br />
<br />The fields of knowledge classified at higher levels of the ontological
<br />
hierarchy indeed appear to supercede the fields of knowledge
<br />
classified at lower levels of the ontological hierarchy, establishing
<br />
that knowledge can be hierarchically organized.  Checking the
<br />
postulated ontological hierarchy with respect to the examples of
<br />
classified fields of knowledge given earlier seems to establish the
<br />
consistency of the scheme.
<br />
<br />Bayesian reasoning is not sufficient to fully capture rationality
<br />
<br />Contrary to claims that 'Bayes is the secret of universe' among logic
<br />
aficionados (circa 2008), MCRT classification offers the intriguing
<br />
suggestion that Bayesian reasoning cannot possibly be a fully general
<br />
method of rationality.  Observe the classification scheme shown.
<br />
Bayesian reasoning is a field of knowledge classified as Mathematics-
<br />
Cognition-Relative (MAT, COG, REL).  This field indeed subsumes the
<br />
types of rationality classified as Mathematics-Cognition-Independent
<br />
(MAT, COG, REL), such as Predicate and Propositional Logic (see above
<br />
examples of fields of knowledge and hierarchical ordering of KR axes),
<br />
establishing that Bayes is more powerful than these earlier methods.
<br />
However, Bayes only deals with *Relative* reasoning and should itself
<br />
be superceded by the fields of knowledge classified as Mathematics-
<br />
Cognition-Mediating (MAT, COG, MED).  These fields of knowledge deal
<br />
with reflective reasoning, and include ontology merging and analogy
<br />
generation.  Thus, based on MCRT, we anticipate that ontology merging
<br />
and analogy generation are more powerful methods of rationality than
<br />
Bayes.
<br />
<br />Conclusion: MCRT - The 'Universal Parser'
<br />
<br />Recall that the basic theory motivating MCRT is two-fold:
<br />
(i)	Ontology (data models) are the 'language of logic'.
<br />
(ii)	A method of general purpose reality modeling is equivalent to a
<br />
'universal parser'
<br />
<br />Given only these two assumptions, it follows that a fully general
<br />
method of reality modeling can be entirely achieved with the design of
<br />
an 'Upper Ontology' (a general data modeling scheme for all
<br />
knowledge).  An upper ontology is capable of modeling any concept
<br />
within reality, since anything can be logically represented
<br />
(communicated) with a logical classification (ontology).  Ontology
<br />
(data modeling) is a method of *communication* enabling the
<br />
translation of any coherent logical representation of a concept in
<br />
some particular knowledge domain, into a representation in another
<br />
particular logical domain.
<br />
<br />In this paper I presented a preliminary description of the ontological
<br />
categories required to actually implement a general purpose system of
<br />
reality modeling.  I attempted to classify IT related fields using the
<br />
MCRT ontology. I found that MCRT is a scheme which is consistent,
<br />
clear and original.  It appears to be in principle capable of
<br />
classifying all knowledge. Based on the patterns of classification, I
<br />
found the surprising implication that Bayesian Reasoning may not be
<br />
the complete form of rationality that logic experts believe it is.
<br />
Instead, it appears that ontology merging and analogy formation may be
<br />
beyond the scope of Bayes, and my prediction that this will prove to
<br />
be so constitutes a logically testable hypothesis of MCRT.  I provided
<br />
brief preliminary descriptions of 27 fundamental ontological
<br />
primatives, with examples.
<br />
<br />The curious point warranting deep meditation is that a
<br />
representational ('Mediating') knowledge domain appears to reside at
<br />
the highest level of abstraction - this is the 'Category' (see MCRT
<br />
classification scheme - The domain Mathematics-Platonic-Mediating
<br />
(Category) is at the top of the abstraction hierarchy.  If the Tegmark
<br />
hypothesis that reality is at root mathematical, is entertained, some
<br />
surprising implications follow.  Mathematics is a representation, and
<br />
mathematical categories are 'representations of representations'.  A
<br />
double abstraction 'twice removed' from the substance.  But where is
<br />
the substance?  Like the old concept if the aether, it is not clear
<br />
that any substance is needed.  It appears that the whole of reality is
<br />
at root nothing more than a *representation of a representation*.
<br />
There is no substance *apart* from the representation.  It is *all*,
<br />
at root, a logical communication.
<br />
<br />Consider that MCRT is itself knowledge, which can be classified and
<br />
represented by a general purpose DP-Modeling scheme.  MCRT (at least
<br />
its representation) is itself classified under 'Mathematics-Artifact-
<br />
Mediating' (see MCRT classification scheme).  This enables MCRT to
<br />
model itself and understand its own operation.  This verifies that
<br />
MCRT is indeed a viable ontology for general purpose reality
<br />
modeling.
