<br /><br />The everything list is not a random sample. Unfortunately! 
<br />
Because frankly I appreciate the Americans here. 
<br />
I find them very sympa.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;You know how Americans on opposite sides of an issue tend to

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;behave.
</em><br />
<br /><br />The champion of biased arguments has been an European!
<br />
Note also that Jacques Mallah has never been dishonest. I am
<br />
just afraid by its lack of doubt on some fundamental questions.
<br />
I keep asking, because I have no prejudice.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;E.g. recounting of votes in Florida, 
</em><br />
<br /><br />This is a triumph of democracy ('course, it's not a triumph of 
<br />
organisation). In my opinion they should perhaps recount again.
<br />
Especially now.  
<br />
It is good USA have a lot of allies but then you must listen to
<br />
them, and reassure them. Expression like &quot;crusade&quot;, &quot;infinite
<br />
justice&quot; etc. are diplomatical errors. Worst: they are
<br />
strategical errors. Why?
<br />
(with comp they are of course G* error: never pretend the
<br />
good is on your side, especially when it is obvious).  
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;pro life versus pro choice...
</em><br />
<br /><br />And Death Penalty! God told them &quot;Thou shall not kill&quot;, and the
<br />
state himself shows the exemple of killing. Shocking. You got a
<br />
point. 
<br />
But I know there is a lot of Americans shocked by that too.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Unthinkable here in Europe!
</em><br />
<br /><br />Be careful. I'm afraid it is thinkable here in Europe. Perhaps
<br />
your country is very open minded, but I am afraid by the last
<br />
election in Italy. Even in part of Belgium some election have 
<br />
given frightful results. Extremism is not dead in our countries.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Anyway, there is nothing wrong with Jacques, he is behaving 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in a way you should expect from the MWI or your theory.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I don't know. I'm troubled by its persistence to negate the
<br />
distinction between first and third person point of view. But
<br />
you should not put him so quickly in a box. 
<br />
<br /><br />Of course you raise the question &quot;are the enemies the americans?&quot;.
<br />
Of course no. You know that americans are the victims here.
<br />
Still you can ask are *some* americans, and more generaly
<br />
some occidentals,  responsible?
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Of course. Islam has begun a secularisation process, with a
<br />
begining of separation of &quot;state and church&quot;, but this has been
<br />
stopped by the Wahabit (Saoudian) with the help of the occidentals.
<br />
So that the fanatical islamic schools have been favorised and 
<br />
are still now favorised, by the occident (who have justify this
<br />
by the cold war with the (ex) Soviet Union, but also by the need
<br />
of petrol).
<br />
But why to continue after the fall of Berlin wall? I don't
<br />
understand.
<br />
Other questions: when did USA stop supporting the 
<br />
Taliban? (After the Buddha destruction? after the 11 sept. ?)
<br />
<br />Apparently unrelated, but I'm afraid it is perhaps *the*
<br />
central question:
<br />
Why is hemp forbidden in most countries? (One century of lies and 
<br />
propaganda). The international Petrol/Health politics is criminal 
<br />
since a long time.
<br />
<br />You can compare the relation between Occident and Middle East
<br />
with the relation between the heroin-addict and its dealer.
<br />
I'm afraid the real hard dope on this planet could be petrol.
<br />
<br />Half-jokingly when Bush administration decides not to respect
<br />
the Kyoto protocol (signed by almost all countries in the world),
<br />
I told my friends that this was a declaration of war against the
<br />
whole planet!
<br />
<br />The concrete enemy, I am afraid, is international banditism.
<br />
We should depenalize all the dopes, if only to control black
<br />
money. Violence is of no use in this war. Its use will always
<br />
increase it and make it turn back. They are real technical
<br />
international problem which must be solved the most
<br />
pacificaly possible.
<br />
<br />If Georges Bush drops bombs on Afghanistan, there is a risk he
<br />
&nbsp;will be obliged to drop Bombs on Pakistan, then on Saoudians, then
<br />
&nbsp;... on Americans, who are the real protector of what happens
<br />
to be the roots of the hate of the occidental tolerance.
<br />
Let us hope GB will not fall in this diabolical trap.
<br />
<br />USA and the whole occident should profit on being victim for doing 
<br />
serious inquest in the whole world.
<br />
<br />The fanatics are dangerous. The cynics who help them in the
<br />
shadow, are much more dangerous. And they are, in part, among us, 
<br />
as it is more and more obvious days after days.
<br />
Nothing will be simple in this &quot;war&quot;. But please, in this
<br />
conflict the enemy is widespread in all countries. If you say it
<br />
is the Afghans, the Americans, the Occidentals, the Muslims,
<br />
etc. you will always miss the point.
<br />
<br /><br />Bruno
