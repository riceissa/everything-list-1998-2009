<br /><br />I told you my relief, but I begin to doubt ! Look at what you write:
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Recently, of course, I have been more concerned with the destruction

</em><br />
<br /><br />I understand your concern with NYC. I share with you the concern
<br />
of those terrible and crual 11 sept. events.
<br />
<br />Now a pecularity of this war consists in figuring out who
<br />
is the enemy, exactly.
<br />
<br />It looks like you have solved that problem too. The enemy are the
<br />
believers in immortality, the religious people !?!
<br />
<br />I am fearing amalgamations, like the amalgamations between Muslims and
<br />
terrorists (to name one which has been done by some). But you are the 
<br />
champion: the enemy are all religious people. The war between atheism 
<br />
and religion !?!
<br />
<br />Perhaps I should tell you what are, according to G*, the canonical
<br />
&quot;enemies&quot; of the sound universal machine.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[ ... and here a very long reasoning with lot of thought experiments,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;or a shorter formal reasoning where the main point consists in
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;distinguishing what G and G* say ... I don't want to bore you and 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;give you at once the &quot;result&quot; ...]:
<br />
<br />And it looks like you were almost right.
<br />
<br />The universal sound machines &quot;war&quot; is between the agnostic and the
<br />
*imposed* religion (whatever that religion is, atheism included).
<br />
<br />The sound machine is maximaly humble, she is agnostic on both
<br />
her own consistency and her own inconsistency. This entails two sort
<br />
of dangerous consistent extensions: 1) meeting a machine (perhaps 
<br />
itself) which feels superior, and 2) meeting a machine (perhaps itself)
<br />
which feels inferior.  (Meeting or becoming herself).
<br />
<br />That reminds me a &quot;theory of intelligence&quot; I developped years ago 
<br />
(still from G*): 
<br />
&nbsp;a machine is intelligent iff it is not stupid. And a machine is stupid
<br />
iff either the machine believes itself intelligent or the 
<br />
machine believes itself stupid.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;[with &quot;consistent (resp. inconsistent)&quot; in place of 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;intelligent (resp. stupid)&quot; those sentences are just rephrasing of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;particular instantiation of Godel second incompleteness theorem].
<br />
<br />The universal sound machine is forever undecided about any
<br />
of its possible ultimate worldview and, by doubting, never imposes
<br />
its religion or worldview on different machines. This should not prevent 
<br />
her to react against those imposing-view machines. That's just
<br />
self-defense. We can respect only those who respect ourselves, and
<br />
... reciprocaly.
<br />
<br />With comp any sound machine is condemned to doubt, forever.
<br />
A sound machine can neither be a believer in immortality nor be a
<br />
believer in mortality. The sound machine is forever agnostic on that
<br />
question. That is forever undecided. (and by consequence forever
<br />
undecided about comp of course: they can bet, fear or hope for comp
<br />
and/or for self-soundness, but that's personal). The sound machines
<br />
can also make reasoning with comp *as an hypothesis*.
<br />
<br />This is what I find very humanistic about comp: we are necessarily
<br />
more modest and ignorant about fundamental questions, and thus more
<br />
open and prudent with other's opinions. At the
<br />
same time we get tools for studying the geometry of that ignorance
<br />
and see precisely where &quot;matters&quot; come from, through the comp &quot;act of
<br />
faith&quot;.
<br />
<br />Precisely but uncertainly. Like any scientific approaches.
<br />
The consistent computationalist cannot *not* be moderate, like
<br />
the honnest scientific, which is also a professional doubter.
<br />
<br />Some people believe that doubting is a sign of lacking confidence
<br />
in oneself, or even lacking faith. Apparently (with G*) it is
<br />
the contrary. This is coherent with the apparent lack of doubt
<br />
of the fanatics, which above all does not even tolerate sign of doubts.
<br />
<br />Today I guess we have still the choice between a war between
<br />
moderates and fanatics and a war between fanatics and fanatics.
<br />
In the second case we loose the war at the start, isn't it?
<br />
<br />Do you agree with this last statement? Or are you really, Mister the
<br />
Devil's Advocate, a fanatical atheist?
<br />
<br /><br />Bruno
