<br />Yes. Even at the deepest level. Science transforms knowledge into  
<br />
belief by making us aware of the hypothetical nature of our mental  
<br />
construction.
<br />
I would say that science is the condition of genuine faith or bets.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Leibniz' Monadology can be considered as a way to think of this idea  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where each monad represents a 1-PoV.
</em><br />
<br />Difficult to make sense. Leibniz is a complex and variable author. I  
<br />
have read the Monadology and consult some expert of Leibniz, but it  
<br />
remains hard to figure out how it works.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; A synchronization of many such 1PoV, given some simple consistensy  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; requirements, would in the large number limit lead to a notion of a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;common world of experience&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />Don't you need some &quot;common world of experience&quot; to have a notion of  
<br />
synchronization?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     The 3PoV would follow from a form of inversion or reflection of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a 1PoV. For example, we form thoughts of or fellow humans from our  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; own experiences of ourselves. BTW: it seems to me that  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness, at least, requires some form of dynamic self-  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; modeling process. This implies that there is no such a thing as a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; static consciousness.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I can agree. And you know the way I proceed. I start from elementary  
<br />
arithmetic, the 3-elementary ontology. If only because 99,9% of the  
<br />
humans agree on it, and it is already Turing universal and contains  
<br />
the whole universal deployment. The epistemology is given by adding  
<br />
some induction schema to the machine in there. It is illustrated by  
<br />
the going from Robinson arithmetic to Peano Arithmetic (emulated by  
<br />
Robinson arithmetic). It is enough to generate all &quot;finite piece of  
<br />
histories&quot;, and we can get the many 1-pov by the &quot;Theaetetical variant  
<br />
of the logic of provability/consistency ...
<br />
<br />So, if you agree that all dynamics are contained in the block- 
<br />
arithmetical truth, consciousness is indeed related to &quot;internal  
<br />
information flux&quot;, and so we can say there is no static consciousness,  
<br />
in that sense. But here we mix the 3-description with the 1- 
<br />
description, and from this we cannot conclude that we cannot have a  
<br />
conscious experience of static-ity or static-ness. With comp, just  
<br />
because it remains a lot of work, the question of traveling in many  
<br />
different physical directions is just open (obviously).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Re the UD Measure problem: The idea i have is that we either  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have our infinity within each Monad or try to find a way to derive a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure of the infinity without reference to the only source of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definiteness that we have available: our conscious experience.
</em><br />
<br /><br />If I interpret favorably what you say, this is the passage from UDA to  
<br />
AUDA, where I substitute &quot;you working on UDA&quot;, by &quot;the lobian  
<br />
universal machine working on UDA&quot;.
<br />
<br />I don't insist on this because it can be misunderstood. AUDA looks  
<br />
like an elimination of the need to refer to &quot;consciousness&quot;, but AUDA  
<br />
without a prior understanding of UDA, would be like a confusion  
<br />
between theology and computer science, comp can only relate them, not  
<br />
identify them it would be an error, explainable in AUDA (!!!!!), to  
<br />
confuse them. Only God confuses them; in  sense, but a creature which  
<br />
confuses them is either a zombie, or a fake zombie, or a person  
<br />
eliminativist.
<br />
<br />You can regain consciousness in AUDA, by &quot;defining&quot; consciousness by  
<br />
the &quot;belief (hope, bet, faith) in a reality&quot;.  But the bet is  
<br />
unconscious itself, and this is partially why we are bounded, at some  
<br />
level, to confuse this very basic belief with a knowledge.
<br />
<br />Of course it is a knowledge, but only at the G* level, *we* cannot  
<br />
know that, once we bet there is a reality (whatever it is).
<br />
<br />All this does not mean that you could not try an alternate theory were  
<br />
the 3-pov emerge from the 1-pov, but with comp, the basic ontology is  
<br />
very simple (numbers, addition and multiplication). And then 1-pov, or  
<br />
OMs, appears very sophisticated. They are given &quot;intuitively&quot; by all  
<br />
possible computations passing to a &quot;current state&quot;, together with a  
<br />
topology derivable from the self-reference logic (I think you know  
<br />
that).

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     The comment that is made below seems to only involve a single

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; consciousness and an exterior &quot;reality&quot;. Could we not recover a

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; very similar situation if we consider the 1-PoV and 3-PoV relation

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to hold to some degree over a multitude of consciouness  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (plurality). In the plurality case, the &quot;objective doubtful but  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; sharable possible reality&quot; would be composed of a large  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; intersection of sorts of 3-PoV aspects that can be recognized by or  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; mapped to a statistical or generic notion of a 1-PoV. No?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes. May be. Why? You need something like that for the first person  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; plural, but you have to extract it in some precise way for solving  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the UD measure problem. You could elaborate perhaps.
