<br />
Numbers within numbers and points within points explored.
<br />
<br />1) Numbers within numbers:
<br />
<br />Take a binary coded number such as EX = 11001001101 as an example. This is 
<br />
a counting number. EX contains the counting numbers 0 and 1. The 0's and 
<br />
1's are still counting numbers simply because we are still using them as 
<br />
counters - how many 1's in EX, how many 2's in EX, how many 4's in EX etc. 
<br />
So EX is a compound number - a number containing numbers.
<br />
<br />2) Points within points:
<br />
<br />We represent numbers with a physical isomorphism to points on a line.
<br />
<br />Take a line of unit length and hang it in 3 space. Each point on the line 
<br />
will be associated with at least the following numbers:
<br />
<br />a) Its x coordinate
<br />
b) Its y coordinate
<br />
c) Its z coordinate
<br />
d) Its distance from one end of the line.
<br />
e) Its distance from the other end of the line.
<br />
<br />One could argue that in addition to these it is also associated with its 
<br />
coordinates in any other system for encoding an N dimensional space.
<br />
<br />However, for the moment let us ignore that.
<br />
<br />This leaves us with just &quot;d&quot; and &quot;e&quot; - the numbers derived from the 
<br />
geometric object with which we have associated the point.
<br />
<br />Now take another unit length line and intersect the first line with it at 
<br />
the point in question. If the intersection is asymmetric this point is now 
<br />
associated with four numbers:
<br />
<br />d) Its distance from one end of line 1.
<br />
e) Its distance from the other end of line 1.
<br />
f) Its distance from one end of line 2.
<br />
g) Its distance from the other end of line 2.
<br />
<br />How can the single point retain all these identities?
<br />
<br />Is it better to suppose there are actually four lines each with its own set 
<br />
of points and these points nest with each other in various ways?
<br />
<br />In any event lets continue to add unit length lines intersecting this same 
<br />
point without repeating any other intersection parameter.  Eventually we 
<br />
can associate the point with as many numbers as we care to.  Is this a 
<br />
suitable isomorphism for all those numbers or do we as I might suggest 
<br />
simply nest the points so each number has its own point - its own isomorphism?
<br />
<br />If we continue to a countably infinite number of lines do we have an 
<br />
&quot;Everything&quot;?
<br />
<br />How about if we just go the other way and eliminate all lines and all 
<br />
neighbor points. Go all the way down to just one point.  That is postulate 
<br />
a naked point.  Absent any relation at all it is as devoid of selection as 
<br />
a point that has all lines intersecting at it.  So it is isomorphic to all 
<br />
numbers or rather is an infinitely nested point.
<br />
<br />Given the above is the correct postulate: &quot;There exists a naked point.&quot;?
<br />
<br />The naked point contains multiply nested points and we select just those 
<br />
that are isomorphic to FAS as the states of universes.  The sorting dynamic 
<br />
I use as the basis of my model then becomes just points changing their 
<br />
nesting level.
<br />
<br />A space without space, a dynamic without change.
<br />
<br />Any comments on any of this speculation?
