Colin,
<br />
Thanks for expressing &quot;my ideas&quot; so eloquently.
<br />
However... (of course!)
<br />
I may interspace some remarks (as usual) on details. (I am more lenient on
<br />
the oldies (do rely on them less) because our epistemic enrichment could
<br />
work only on the 'timely' level of comprehension (buildability-up on the
<br />
'then' cognitive inventory and mind-function skills). Don't expect from me
<br />
to be too appreciative on our present level though. We try, as much as we
<br />
can.
<br />

<br />
I will insert initials.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; BTW Plato followed Heraclitus, who was already onto this.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Surely Plato's view more astute model to assemble an understanding of the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appearances we get and our descriptions of it....furthemore

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The arisotlian view is clearly anatomically untenable anyway! If the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe was literally made of appearances then when we opened up a brain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we would see them. We do not. What we see is the brain in the act of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; delivering appearances. No 'appearance' of a brain is in any direct
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relation to the appearances it delivers to us in the 1st person. Ergo the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure and the appearances are not the same thing or at least are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; validly explored on that basis.
</em><br />
[JM]:
<br />
I will come back to that darn &quot;structure&quot;.  With a 'better look' we may
<br />
&quot;see&quot; more, just as we see more today than when that legendary king had the
<br />
brain of his philosopher sliced up to see all those smart ideas). The modern
<br />
neurologists claim to see it 'all' - including the term: &quot;somehow&quot;.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is empirical proof that at least in this small piece of thought
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Plato's position was correct and Aristotle is just plain wrong. And Kant
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; too. The noumenon is most definitely real and scientifically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tractible.(see below)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The practical upshot of this is that the universe does not,  for example,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have atoms in it. It is made of some underlying structure behaving
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;atomly&quot; within our appearances. It is only us that insist on making it a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'thing'.
</em><br />
[JM]:
<br />
After 1/2 century pioneering in making a new type of polymers: I agree.
<br />
I use a slightly different wording, but for the same idea.
<br />
You use &quot;structure&quot; - which is a term of our (present) imaging of what we do
<br />
not see. I don't go that far, don't assign our 'structureal' image to the
<br />
still unknown. Our present mental capability may be immature to categorize
<br />
it.
<br />
&quot;Our structure&quot; comes from a mathematical evaluation of that (partial) image
<br />
we so far exerienced within that limited model we pretend to observe.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;That structure also behaves 'neutrino-ly' outside the scope of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our direct perceptions (qualia). The appearances (qualia) are likewise
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; delivered as behaviour of the very same structure. Plato's position
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unifies matter and qualia as different behaviours of the same underlying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure. So simple and obvious and practical and fits the evidence.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; A question from grandma:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Since this deeper, unknown reality must forever be inaccessible to our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; direct probing, I agree when you suggest that this may better be thought
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of as theology, or at least metaphysics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Juicy stuff here:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Since this deeper, unknown reality must forever be inaccessible to our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; direct probing&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The words 'direct probing' assume that indeed we are at some point
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;directly probing&quot;. If you can justify any account that we directly probe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (whatever that means!) anything I'd like to see it!
</em><br />
[JM]:
<br />
Amen. Me too.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I would hold that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'apprearances' we have and the 'underlying structure' are on an _equal_
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; epistemological footing in that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a) Depictions of regularity in appearances
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; b) Depictions of structure of a putative underlying natural world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; both have equal access to qualia as evidence. It is the underlying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure that delivers qualia into the brain. The two descriptive realms:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appearances and structure are on an equal footing and qualia unifies them
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; into a consistent set. The 'evidence', qualia, is evidence for BOTH
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; domains. Whatever the structure is, it must simultaneously a) deliver
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; qualia and all the rest of the structure in the universe and b) deliver
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the contents of qualia (appearances) that result in our correlations of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appearances that we think of as empirical laws.
</em><br />
[JM]:
<br />
Maybe reverse: we THINK about a structure because the 'qualia' reaching our
<br />
mind suggest such ideas. We are 'probing' the unkowable with the little we
<br />
derived in our interpretation and 'think' it is the &quot;truth&quot;.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Therefore we have not one but 2 scientifically accessible realms of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scientific description of the natural world:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) Statistics that are correlation of appearances
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) Statistics that are depictions of structure
</em><br />
[JM]:
<br />
We have some limited features to think about - in ways as our existing level
<br />
of mentality allows. We compose them into our &quot;model of the (physical?)
<br />
world and count the qualia we so far identified. This we call STATISTIX.
<br />
Increase the amount of features: the 'counting' will occur differently. It
<br />
shows in any statistically evaluable feature over historical epoques.
<br />
Statistics is the beloved occupation of the mathematically impaired minds
<br />
(OOPS - no offense meant, I esteem them) because it allows beautiful
<br />
mathematics.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Qualia are produced by 1) and enable 2) and tie both descriptions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intimately together as a consistent set. Currently we call 1) science and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; slag off at 2) as 'mere metaphysics' or theology. This is just soooo
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wrong! Indeed at least in a linguistic sense 2) is physics and 1) is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meta-physics (about it)! :-)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Since this deeper, unknown reality must forever be inaccessible to our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; direct probing&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ...is quite correct, but that does not stop us doing valid science on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure! Put another way this limitation in access does not justify
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; calling attempts to formulate theories of the structure as non-science.
</em><br />
[JM]:
<br />
Are you comfortable to call 'science' the (in?)direct observation of
<br />
figments we derive from interpretations of the unknown? No matter how many
<br />
DID agree in the past, I like to keep it open to generate a different way of
<br />
thinking We cannot crowl out from our (mental) skin and speculations are
<br />
limited to what epistemy offered so far. Yet I want to keep it open for more
<br />
and better, not regulate it quantitatively into an equational &quot;science&quot; of
<br />
the limited.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Can you see how riddled with historical baggage our thinking is, how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; biased our language is? This crazy situation has been going on for 2500
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; years. enough already!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

Thanks, Colin, you seem to start at the old Greeks, they based their
<br />
thinking on earlier thoughts, think of those who did not even leave written
<br />
documents (Dravidians, etc.) so our epistemic enrichment (from the 'old
<br />
Ape') is just a continuous process with origins back to those of living
<br />
creatures at all.
<br />
I see our job to make ONE step applicable to our present mental make-up.
<br />
cheers
