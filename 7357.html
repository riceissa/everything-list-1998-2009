<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; pay a good fraction of my net worth for this opportunity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Why?  Why would I do it?  Because logic grabs me by the throat and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;*forces* me to   :-)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What is the logic here exactly, though? From a third person point of view, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; why is it objectively &quot;better&quot; to have a lot of copies of you having 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; identical good experiences than it is to have only a single copy have the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; same good experience?
</em><br />
<br />First, I think that it's important to remove the qualifier &quot;identical&quot;
<br />
here. Would two copies cease to be identical if one atom were out of
<br />
place?  Hardly.  On another tack, you are the same person, etc., that
<br />
you were five minutes ago where strict identicalness isn't even close.
<br />
<br />Second, suppose that someone loves you, and wants the best for you.
<br />
There are a number of ways to describe this, but the infinite level
<br />
one universe is a good one. The person who loves you (and so has such
<br />
a true 3rd person point of view) sees you die here on Earth, and is
<br />
sad for you. Yet she understands totally that you are still alive in
<br />
many, many places 10^10^29 from here. Her most logical retort is that
<br />
you should be alive *here* too; that an extra Jesse here is simply
<br />
good for Jesse, no matter what is going on far away.
<br />
<br />If she finds out that although dead on Earth, you've been copied into
<br />
a body out near Pluto, (and have the same quality of life there), she's
<br />
once again happy for you.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; After all, if they lied to you and never made any copies at all,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no version of you would ever know the difference.
</em><br />
<br />Well, lots of things can go better or worse for me without me
<br />
being informed of the difference. Someone might perpetrate a
<br />
scam on me, for example, that cheated me of some money I'd
<br />
otherwise get, and it is still bad for me even if I don't know
<br />
about it.
<br />
<br />So this is why I subscribe to the descriptions involving measure;
<br />
namely, it's better when my measure goes up, and worse when it
<br />
doesn't.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Also, wouldn't the same logic tell you that if we lived in a utopian society 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where pretty much everyone was happy, it would be immoral to use birth 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; control because we want to make the number of people having happy 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiences as high as possible?
</em><br />
<br />Yes, exactly.  Each time we can rescue someone from non-existence,
<br />
we should (given that other things are equal).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; That doesn't seem like a position that anyone who rejects first-person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thinking would automatically accept.
</em><br />
<br />They may not. But the two great moral revolutions/revelations of my 
<br />
life--- (i) cryonics  (ii) the Hedonistic Imperative (www.hedweb.com)
<br />
--- lay down that life is better than death, and pleasure is better
<br />
than pain.  And that we need not be shy about uniformizing and
<br />
extending these concepts as far as we can.
