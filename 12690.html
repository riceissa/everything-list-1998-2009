<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; I don't disagree with that. But that means that a conscious, 1st &gt; &gt; &gt; person, pair of experiences, i.e. pair of numbers can have no order &gt; &gt; &gt; other than the inherent order of the numbers. And if an experience &gt; &gt; &gt; corresponds to just a number, then experiences are discrete and can't be &gt; &gt; &gt; chopped finer than some limit.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The order of a pair of experiences is set by the fact that one is &gt; &gt; considered first and the other second, perhaps because there is a &gt; &gt; subjective sense of the passage of time, perhaps because the second &gt; &gt; experience contains a memory of the first, perhaps due to some other &gt; &gt; subtle aspect of the content of the experiences. &gt; &gt; But on this view an experience is a complex thing, far from the atomic perception of a red flash, and even includes parts that are not conscious. This comports with my speculation that a conscious atom is fairly complex and has a significant duration such that it overlaps the conscious atoms before and after. This overlap provides the ordering and the sense of time and continuity.
</em><br />
No doubt even a red flash experience is more than just a red flash, containing at least a vague sense of personal identity, past experience, an understanding of what &quot;red&quot; means, etc. Also, it must have a subjective duration because however long a perception is, it can't be instantaneous. However, I don't see why it is necessary to speculate that there must be overlap, or even what overlap could possibly mean in this context. Static frames in a film and the infinitesimals studied in calculus give the impression of continuous motion without the need for overlap, so why not perception? By analogy with frames in a film, I would say that machine states S1,S2,S3 give rise to perceptual states P1,P2,P3 such that a single state (analogous to a single frame) does not give rise to an experience, but a pair of states P1,P2 or P2,P3 does. This defines an apparent overlap, but without a need for actual overlap.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; In the real world, the &gt; &gt; subjective content reflects brain activity which in turn reflects &gt; &gt; environmental input (that's why the sense of order evolved in the first &gt; &gt; place), but this relationship is only a contingent one. &gt; &gt; Well that's the question isn't it. Comp assumes it, but comp also leads to strange if not absurd conclusions. &gt; &gt; &gt; If the pair of &gt; &gt; experiences are experienced in the order AB there is no way for the &gt; &gt; experiencer to know whether they were actually generated in the order AB &gt; &gt; or BA, unless reversing the order changes the content in some &gt; &gt; significant way.&gt; &gt; That assumes the experiences can be discretely separated with not overlap. Certainly there are instances like that: the experience just before you lose consciousness due to a concussion and the experience just as you regain it are disjoint in this way. You only recover continuity through accessing memories and there is a gap even in that memory. But in ordinary circumstances the continuity might be inherent in the overlap of conscious atoms.
</em><br />
I don't think actual situations where you lose consciousness are a good example, because for technical reasons the &quot;cut&quot; cannot be clean and instantaneous. This is where thought experiments are useful. If you were instantaneously disintegrated in mid-thought and later reconstituted with every atom in exactly the same configuration, so that e.g. every action potential travelling down an axon continues where it left off, then I don't see how it is possible that you would experience a discontinuity.
<br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt; &gt; This means there is no natural order of physical states (or abstract &gt; &gt; machine states): the order can be anything, and the subjective order of &gt; &gt; experience will be unchanged. It also means there is no natural order of &gt; &gt; subjective states: that which seems first, seems first and that which &gt; &gt; seems second, seems second. This is good, because it doesn't depend on &gt; &gt; any theory or assumption about consciousness.&gt; &gt; No natural order of physical states? Are you denying causality?
</em><br />
I meant that you can't necessarily work back from the mental states to determine the order of the physical states underpinning them.
<br />
<em class="quotelev3"> &gt; &gt; &gt; I guess I need a more explicit idea of how experiences occur in &gt; &gt; arithmetic Platonia. Are we to imagine that some large number &gt; &gt; 3875835442... is a single, atomic experience and another number &gt; &gt; 3876976342... is another single, atomic experience and they have no &gt; &gt; other relation than their natural order? In that case, they would be &gt; &gt; experiences in a certain bundle of streams of consciousness just in &gt; &gt; virtue of having some digits in common or having factors in common or &gt; &gt; what? Or are we to imagine another Platonic object, a Turing machine, &gt; &gt; that generates both these numbers in a certain sequence (maybe the &gt; &gt; reverse of their natural order) - and that's what makes them parts of &gt; &gt; the same experience bundle?&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Brent Meeker&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I would say that the relationship between abstract machine states does &gt; &gt; not have anything to do with how mental states are ordered or even if &gt; &gt; they belong to the same person, except insofar as related machine states &gt; &gt; may lead to mental states with related content.&gt; &gt; That's the question I was intending to raise. If comp is true then a computation may instantiate some consciousness, i.e. associates a number and a conscious state in one model anyway. Are these states ordered by inherent properties of the numbers? Or are they ordered by their order of generation by the machine? I think you favor the former; that states of consciousness exist timelessly in Platonia. But each one is so complex that there is an inherent ordering, as though each one contained pointers to successors and/or predecessors. I can understand that, but seems to me make conscious states much more complex than &quot;observer moments&quot; and to include much that is not conscious.
</em><br />
Suppose that you are reciting the alphabet A,B,C,D... and for the duration that would have been &quot;C&quot; your brain activity is suspended while a separate copy of your brain (maybe a digital computer, maybe a biological brain - whatever it takes) fills in the missing letter. It seems that you are suggesting this process might produce a break in continuity. If this is so, then there would be something about the inserted letter that marks it as being not quite right: perhaps the memory of &quot;B&quot; or anticipation of &quot;D&quot;, or the subliminally present sense of the passage of time, or the sense of personal identity shift a little. But all this would mean is that there is a technical problem in correctly implementing the &quot;C&quot;. Done properly, so that *every* aspect of the conscious experience is exactly as it would have been originally, what evidence of the discontinuity could there possibly be?
