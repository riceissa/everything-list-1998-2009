<br />New-Found Old Galaxies Upsetting Astronomers' Long-Held Theories on the Big
<br />
Bang
<br />
By KENNETH CHANG
<br />
<br />ATLANTA, Jan. 7 — Gazing deep into space and far into the past, astronomers
<br />
have found that the early universe, a couple of billion years after the Big
<br />
Bang, looks remarkably like the present-day universe.
<br />
Astronomers said here on Monday at a meeting of the American Astronomical
<br />
Society that they had found huge elliptical galaxies that formed within one
<br />
billion to two billion years after the Big Bang, perhaps a couple of billion
<br />
years earlier than expected.
<br />
<br />A few days earlier, researchers had announced that the Hubble Space
<br />
Telescope had spotted a gathering cloud of perhaps 100 galaxies from the
<br />
same epoch, an early appearance of such galactic clusters.
<br />
On Wednesday, astronomers at the meeting said that three billion years after
<br />
the Big Bang, one of the largest structures in the universe, a string of
<br />
galaxies 300 million light-years long and 50 million light-years wide, had
<br />
already formed. A light-year is the distance that light travels in one year,
<br />
or almost six trillion miles.
<br />
That means the string is nearly 2,000 billion billion miles long.
<br />
<br />Some astronomers said the discoveries could challenge a widely accepted
<br />
picture of the evolution of the universe, that galaxies, clusters and the
<br />
galactic strings formed in a bottom-up fashion, that the universe's small
<br />
objects formed first and then clumped together into larger structures over
<br />
time.
<br />
<br />&quot;The universe is growing up a little faster than we had thought,&quot; said Dr.
<br />
Povilas Palunas of the University of Texas, one of the astronomers who found
<br />
the string of galaxies. &quot;We're seeing a much larger structure than any of
<br />
the models predict. So that's surprising.&quot;
<br />
<br />In the prevailing understanding of the universe, astronomers believe that
<br />
slight clumpiness in the distribution of dark matter, the 90 percent of
<br />
matter that pervades the universe but still has not been identified, drew in
<br />
clumps of hydrogen gas that then collapsed into stars and galaxies, the
<br />
first stars forming about a half billion years after the Big Bang. The
<br />
galaxies then gathered in clusters, and the clusters gathered in long
<br />
strings with humongous, almost empty, voids in between. The first such
<br />
string, named the Great Wall, was discovered in 1989 about 250 million
<br />
light-years away.
<br />
<br />The newly discovered string lies in a southern constellation, Grus, at 10.8
<br />
billion light-years away, and represents what the universe looked like 10.8
<br />
billion years ago, or three billion years after the Big Bang.
<br />
The international team of researchers identified 37 very bright galaxies in
<br />
that region of space and found that they were not randomly distributed, as
<br />
would be expected, but instead appeared to line up along the string.
<br />
Such structures are rarely seen in computer simulations of the early
<br />
universe, said Dr. Bruce E. Woodgate of the NASA Goddard Space Flight
<br />
Center, a member of the team.
<br />
<br />&quot;We think it disagrees with the theoretical predictions in that we see
<br />
filaments and voids larger than predicted,&quot; Dr. Woodgate said.
<br />
<br />Dr. Robert P. Kirshner of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics
<br />
said the findings were interesting, but that it was too early to eliminate
<br />
any theories. What is probably needed was a better understanding how of a
<br />
clump of dark matter leads to the formation of stars.
<br />
<br />&quot;What we're seeing here,&quot; Dr. Kirshner said, &quot;is the beginning of the
<br />
investigation how structure grows.&quot;
<br />
At the astronomy meeting on Monday, another team of researchers reported
<br />
finding a large number of large elliptical galaxies. As part of an
<br />
investigation known as the Gemini Deep Deep Survey, the astronomers explored
<br />
300 faint galaxies dating from when the universe was three billion and six
<br />
billion years old. The large elliptical galaxies are supposedly a merged
<br />
product of smaller spiral galaxies.
<br />
<br />Yet not only did they exist that early in the universe, but the stars within
<br />
these galaxies also appeared a couple of billion years old already, implying
<br />
that they had formed as early as a billion and a half years after the Big
<br />
Bang.
<br />
&quot;Massive galaxies seem to be forming surprisingly early after the Big Bang,&quot;
<br />
said Dr. Roberto Abraham of the University of Toronto and a co-principal
<br />
investigator on the team. &quot;It is supposed to take time. It seems to be
<br />
happening right away.&quot;
<br />
<br />The data actually fit better with the views that astronomers held before the
<br />
rise of the current dark-matter models, when they theorized that the largest
<br />
galaxies formed first.
<br />
<br />&quot;If we presented this to astronomers 25 years ago,&quot; Dr. Abraham said, &quot;they
<br />
wouldn't have been surprised.&quot;
<br />
A third team of astronomers found two clusters of galaxies that also point
<br />
to a precocious universe. Using the Hubble telescope, the astronomers
<br />
spotted a cluster of at least 30 galaxies dating from when the universe was
<br />
younger than two billion years old and extending three million light-years
<br />
across.
<br />
<br />&quot;Which is similar in size to what we see today for the size of a cluster,&quot;
<br />
said Dr. Marc Postman, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science
<br />
Institute in Baltimore and a member of the team.
<br />
Present-day clusters contain hundreds to thousands of galaxies.
<br />
<br />The same team found a second cluster, from when the universe was five
<br />
billion years old that was almost indistinguishable from modern clusters.
<br />
<br />&quot;It says these structures, which are common in the universe today, were
<br />
essentially being constructed very early on,&quot; Dr. Postman said.
<br />
<br />The galactic cluster findings were reported in Oct. 20 issue of The
<br />
Astrophysical Journal and the Jan. 1 issue of Nature.
<br />
<br />For now, the findings do not directly contradict the models that predict
<br />
that some structures should form, but rarely. But if many more start showing
<br />
up in observations, Dr. Postman said, &quot;then you might get into a bit of a
<br />
problem explain how you get so many.&quot;
