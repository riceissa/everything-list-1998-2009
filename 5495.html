<br />I didn't mean to suggest that you actually believe only one of the copies 
<br />
can be the &quot;real&quot; you, but rather that the way we use language forces us 
<br />
into this way of thinking, as you aknowledge.

<br />Yes, you're right about this, which is why I was shying away from explicitly 
<br />
addressing &quot;the problem of personal identity&quot;. But since you brought it up 
<br />
(and Saibal Mitra in another recent post also addresses this question), I 
<br />
think that the only position which does not lead to confusion and paradox is 
<br />
to say that there is no such thing as personal identity in the way we 
<br />
normally use the term, i.e., as a special quality different to mere 
<br />
similarity between two putatively identical individuals. This is an 
<br />
extension of neo-Lockean theory expounded, for example, by Derek Parfit in 
<br />
his 1984 book &quot;Reasons and Persons&quot;. It is equivalent to saying that we 
<br />
effectively die every moment, to be replaced by near-replicas who share our 
<br />
memories, and usually (but not necessarily) our bodies. We entertain the 
<br />
fiction of continuity of identity because that is how our minds have 
<br />
evolved: an organism would not get very far if it had no concern for what 
<br />
was going to happen to it in the next millisecond because that would be 
<br />
someone else's problem. The fact that it IS a fiction would be immediately 
<br />
evident if we could meet our past and future selves, and if mind/body 
<br />
duplication with or without teleportion were a common event. With this 
<br />
position, it would be obvious that questions about whether the copy &quot;really 
<br />
is you&quot; are meaningless. The copy has most of your memories and thinks he is 
<br />
you; what else can you say beyond this?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Ok, one last stab. You are going to be copied and teleported to 1000 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;different planets. Only your body and your brain will be copied. On 999 of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;these planets, everyone speaks Spanish, and on one planet, everyone speaks 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;French. You don't know either language, and you are only allowed to learn 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;one of them before your departure. From my perspective, learning Spanish is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the correct choice. From your perspective, there's no reason to chose one 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;over the other. Is there?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;-- Kory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />I would learn Spanish before teleportation, in order to give my descendants 
<br />
the best chance of success; but going on what I said above, I shouldn't care 
<br />
at all, because I'll be dead and someone else (or 1000 others) will take my 
<br />
place!
