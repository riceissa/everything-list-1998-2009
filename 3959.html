<em class="quotelev1">&gt; itself in need of explanation.&quot; (p 37)
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;In sum, the puzzle is not about how the universe reaches

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a state of high entropy, but about how it comes to be

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; starting from a low one.&quot; (p 40)
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;For all their intrinsic interest, then, the new methods

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of nonlinear dynamics do not throw new light on the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have failed to grasp the real puzzle of

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; see that no symmetric theory could possibly yield the kind

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of conclusions they claim to draw.&quot; (p 44)
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;There is no separate problem as to why entropy in branch

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; systems always increases towards the future, in other

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; place.&quot; (p 45)
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And so on. Price repeatedly bases many arguments on his
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dissatisfaction with assuming a state of high order. (To
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be fair, his book is an interesting romp through many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theories of time asymmetry, touching on Feynman-Wheeler
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; absorber theories, delayed choice experiments in quantum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mechanics, psychology, etc. Not a bad place to get exposed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to a lot of the current issues. Just don't take his
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particular &quot;crotchet&quot; too seriously, is my advice.)
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Frankly, I don't worry how the beer got in the bottle (one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of his example, about gas expanding out of a beer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bottle...Price worries that the analysts of time are not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; asking proper questions about how the beer came to be in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the bottle in the first place...most of us, dullards that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we are, assume that a bottling company _put_ the beer in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the bottle!.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm not being flip. It's an observed fact of our universe,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and likely derivable from anthropic arguments, that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there's a lot of &quot;free energy&quot; around: a lot of unfused
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hydrogen, a lot of gravitational potential energy, a lot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of stored chemical energy, etc. How this came to be from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;first principles&quot; from an initial singularity is of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; course unknown at this time.
</em><br />
<br />Have a look at Vic Stenger's work-in-progress
<br />
<br /><a href="http://spot.colorado.edu/~vstenger/Nothing/06After.pdf">http://spot.colorado.edu/~vstenger/Nothing/06After.pdf</a>
<br />
<br />He argues that the net energy in the universe is zero; not
<br />
an original idea, many GR theorists think this is the case.
<br />
&nbsp;Since the net energy is zero the universe could have come
<br />
from nothing.  Then he makes a plausibility argument that
<br />
more symmetric states are unstable relative to symmetric
<br />
ones (Frank Wilczek has made the same observation) and
<br />
hence the void (as he calls it) being completely symmetric
<br />
is unstable.  The universe arises from a spontaneous Planck
<br />
scale fluctuation that breaks the symmetry and produces a
<br />
de Sitter (empty, exponentially expanding) universe.  Then
<br />
further symmetry breaking causes matter to condense out of
<br />
the de Sitter space (as proposed by Guth) and produces the
<br />
universe we see.  In this model the initial low entropy
<br />
comes about because the initial Planck fluctuation *has as
<br />
much entropy as it can possibly have* - it's not low
<br />
entropy for its size - but the expansion of the universe
<br />
increases the *possible maximum entropy* much faster than
<br />
the actual entropy increases.  So we find the universe very
<br />
far from equilibrium and structures like galaxies and
<br />
ourselves can form. I don't think any part of this model is
<br />
original with Vic, although maybe putting it altogether in
<br />
one place is.  Each part has been around awhile and has
<br />
stood up to theoretical scrutiny - which is not to say it's
<br />
true.
<br />
<br />It was on the basis of this model that I proposed that new
<br />
universes will pop into existence as this universe thins
<br />
out into an empty space = void again.  As I understand it,
<br />
this kind of event is suppressed in the presence of
<br />
interaction with a mass producing field like the Higgs
<br />
field - which is why the universe must thin out to
<br />
essential emptiness before new universes can spontaneously
<br />
expand.
<br />
<br />...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't _know_ where the free energy or high initial order
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the universe came from. But I sure don't believe that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 10^80 or more particles in the Universe, following
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 10^10^10^10^10^.....10 different ballistic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; trajectories--not even counting Planck-scale effects, will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;every now and then fluctuate into this low entropy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; configuration that is us.&quot; (my phrasing, not Price's)
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But there are other interesting things in the book, more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so than in many other books on time and time asymmetry. As
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I said, a good read.
</em><br />
<br />I'm about half way through H. D. Zeh's &quot;The Physcial Basis
<br />
of Time&quot;.  It's fairly mathematical and pretty rough going
<br />
for me, but it's very good.

The universe is not tuned to life. Life is tuned to the

universe.
