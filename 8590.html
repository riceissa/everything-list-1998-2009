<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Hi,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;My paper has been published and should be available
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;on the site of Elsevier (not freely, except if your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;institution has a free acces on Elsevier Journals).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The official reference are:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Marchal B. Theoretical computer science and the natural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;science, Physics of Life Reviews, Vol 2/4, pp. 251-289.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
Congratulations, at least from this one data point of reading the
<br />
above note.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I will probably be busy until end of January. In the meantime
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I can give little exercises and then correct it. I know that a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mailing list is not necessarily the best place for teaching. I do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it because, at least concerning the approach I'm following, it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is a path which can hardly be avoided. But I'm sure also this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;can be useful for a deepening of many everything-like issues,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;even if just to introduce the work of David Lewis (one of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;main non quantum many-worlders).
</em><br />
<br />What I will say is of course obvious from third-person
<br />
hind-sight, but it helps me to guard against delusion to
<br />
point out the limitedness of email list dialogue when it comes
<br />
to accomplishing anything &quot;significant&quot;.  I think that the significance
<br />
is in becoming better at expressing ourselves.  So, Bruno, I've been
<br />
bewildered for a while at why you are going to all this trouble to
<br />
help lowly list participants like me in learning the rudiments of modal
<br />
logic.  Yes, I know English, and I could perhaps help with basic English
<br />
usage.  But when it comes to insider questions like &quot;machine 
<br />
psychology&quot;,
<br />
aren't there English-speaking philosophers out there that already know
<br />
what you're trying to get at?  You seem to be implying that there
<br />
are not.  This is surprising.  What is this &quot;path which can hardly be
<br />
avoided&quot; you talk about?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Stathis has already shown that IF (W,R) is reflexive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;THEN (W,R) respects Bp -&gt; p.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;And Tom Caylor agrees that IF (W,R) is symmetric
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;THEN (W,R) respects p -&gt; BDp.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Is it OK for everyone?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Tom, Stathis, could you show the inverse ? That is:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;IF (W,R) respects Bp -&gt; p, THEN the multiverse is reflexive.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;IF (W,R) respects p -&gt; BDp, THEN the multiverse is symmetric.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Could you show that all multiverse (W,R) respects B(p -&gt; q) -&gt; (Bp -&gt; 
</em><br />
Bq) ?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I recall that a multiverse (W,R) respects a formula A
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;if A is true in all illuminated (W, R, V).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;That is, whatever the illumination you choose
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(= whatever the value of the sentence letters
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you choose in each world) A is true in all the world of the 
</em><br />
multiverse.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Please feel free NOT trying to solve those problem.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;First the UDA, which is not technical, is enough, it seems to me,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;for a complete understanding that comp entails the reversal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;between physics and computer science/machine-psychology/theology
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(we can discuss naming issue later(*)). The math is needed ONLY for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;making *explicit* the derivation of physics from comp, showing that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;comp (or weaker) is a scientific hypothesis, i.e. comp is testable.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;(*) Well, I'm certainly interested in that naming issue, and perhaps
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I could ask you right now what expression do you find the less 
</em><br />
shocking:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;Physics is derivable from machine psychology&quot;, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;Physics is derivable from machine theology&quot; ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;'course, you can put &quot;computer science&quot; or &quot;number theory&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;instead of machine psycho or theology, but then the reference
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to a soul or a person is eliminated, and giving the current tendency
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of many scientist to just eliminate the person from the possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;object of rational inquiry, I prefer to avoid it. Note that in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;conscience and mechanism&quot; I have used the expression
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;theology&quot;, and in &quot;computability, physics and cognition&quot;,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I have been asked to use &quot;psychology&quot; instead. I find &quot;theology&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;much more correct and honest, but then I realise (empirically) that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it it could seem too much shocking for some people (especially the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;atheist). What do you think?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I have already avoid &quot;metaphysics&quot; because it is confusing in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;metamathematical (Godelian) context, and also I'm in a country
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;where the word &quot;metaphysics&quot; already means &quot;crackpot&quot;. Does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the word &quot;theology&quot; means &quot;crackpot&quot; in some country ? I don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;think so, but please tell me if you know about such practice.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Bruno
</em><br />
<br />The word &quot;theology&quot; is made from the root &quot;theo&quot;, God, and this in my 
<br />
country is loaded with the historical baggage of puritanical (&lt;-hint to 
<br />
what my country is) &quot;whatever went wrong when I was growing up&quot;.  We 
<br />
use theology/religion as the scapegoat for &quot;whatever went wrong when I 
<br />
was growing up&quot;.  Some readers' blood pressure is already starting to 
<br />
rise.  So we put on our &quot;scientist&quot; hat so we can &quot;objectively&quot; step 
<br />
aside from &quot;whatever went wrong when I was growing up&quot; that I don't 
<br />
want to deal with any more, as purely subjective, lumping it all into 
<br />
the &quot;religious&quot; pot, or at least the &quot;ignore&quot; pot, until it comes out 
<br />
on our medical bill.  Yes, some of us out of necessity deal with some 
<br />
of it through the psychological label (or even &quot;mystical&quot; in a 
<br />
therapeutic sense), until we reach our personal saturation point, and 
<br />
then lump the rest of it into the &quot;religious&quot;/&quot;ignore&quot; pot.
<br />
<br />So I would say that both &quot;theology&quot; and &quot;psychology&quot; will not do if you 
<br />
are talking to the general audience.  (Just to toss something out 
<br />
there, how about &quot;machine introspection&quot;?)  Of course, depending on who 
<br />
your audience is, even the words &quot;machine&quot; and &quot;physics&quot; are 
<br />
problematic.  The term &quot;physics&quot; is particularly problematic because it 
<br />
is interpreted in the reductionist sense, which may or may know include 
<br />
the mind.
<br />
<br />Now here is where I will ask some questions, and then it will be clear 
<br />
that I am missing the point because I am still an outsider when it 
<br />
comes to this self-referential self-enlightened machine stuff.  Why are 
<br />
you afraid of &quot;eliminating the person&quot;?  I know you define personal 
<br />
identity through logic (&quot;double-diagonal&quot; stuff etc.)  But it sounds 
<br />
like you say, contrary to the reductionist view, that there is 
<br />
something essential to the person that cannot be completely described 
<br />
&nbsp;from the bottom-up, at least that there is something to a person that 
<br />
is &quot;forever incomplete&quot;.  Again, this is something contrary to the 
<br />
prevailing reductionist view, strengthened by simplistic popular 
<br />
desire, and a desire by some on this list, to have a COMPLETE 
<br />
explanation for everything.
<br />
<br />Tom
