</em><br />
<br />I think this variation points to the major flaw in this thought
<br />
experiment, which is the implicit assumption that copying is possible yet
<br />
is not used.  In fact, if copying is possible as the thought experiment
<br />
stipulates, it would tend to be widely used.  The world would be full of
<br />
people who are copies.  You would be likely to be an nth-generation copy.
<br />
There would be no novelty as Jesse's variation suggests in allowing you
<br />
to experience (presumably for the first time!) being copied.
<br />
<br />I keep harping on this because copying increases measure.  It is different
<br />
from flipping a coin, which does not increase measure.  Your expectations
<br />
going into a copy are different.  To the extent that this language makes
<br />
sense, I would say that you have a 100% chance of becoming the copy and
<br />
a 100% chance of remaining the original.  This is different from flipping
<br />
a coin.
<br />
<br />You may think that it would feel the same way, but you've never tried it.
<br />
Fundamentally, our perception of the world, our phenomenology, our sense
<br />
of identity and our concept of future and past selves are not intrinsic,
<br />
but are useful tools which have *evolved* to allow our minds to achieve
<br />
the goals of survival and reproduction.  In a world where copying
<br />
is possible, we would evolve different ways of perceiving the world.
<br />
I believe that in such a world, we would perceive the aftermath of copying
<br />
very differently than the aftermath of flipping a coin.  The effects
<br />
are different, the evolutionary and survival implications are different.
<br />
<br />In the world of this thought experiment, if the additional copies are
<br />
(via special dispensation) going to be treated well and given a good
<br />
chance to survive and thrive, then yes, most people would press the
<br />
button like crazy.  It's just like today, if a bachelor were given
<br />
the opportunity to have sex with a dozen beautiful women, he'd jump
<br />
at the chance.  It's not because of any intrinsic value in the act,
<br />
it's because evolution has programmed him to take this opportunity to
<br />
increase the measure of his genes.  In the same way, pressing the button
<br />
would increase the measure of your mind, and it would be equally as
<br />
rewarding.
<br />
<br />In the spirit of this list, let me offer my own variation.  It is like
<br />
the original, except instead of torture you are offered a 50-50 chance
<br />
to experience a delicious meal prepared by an expert chef.  Or you can
<br />
press the button to make some copies, in which case you get a 100% chance
<br />
of having the meal.  For me, pressing the button is a win-win situation,
<br />
assuming the copies will be OK.  I certainly don't think that pressing
<br />
the button reduces the measure of my enjoyment of the food.
