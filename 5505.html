<br /><br />Yes, you could say that we die every moment and are replaced by near-exact 
<br />
replicas. You could imagine a situation where this is made more explicit: 
<br />
alien scientists stop the world every second, make copies of everyone, kill 
<br />
all the originals, put the copies in their place, and repeat the procedure 
<br />
in another second. They could have been doing this for years, without anyone 
<br />
suspecting anything unusual was going on. If you are suddenly given this 
<br />
information, and you know that the aliens are going to continue doing this 
<br />
indefinitely (and there is nothing anyone can do to stop them or escape), 
<br />
would you suddenly stop caring about anything that happens in the future, 
<br />
because you'll be dead in one second anyway, and so will everyone you have 
<br />
ever known?
<br />
<br />There is a single idea underlying much of the confusion in discussions of 
<br />
personal identity: the belief in a soul. I use this term for a quality or 
<br />
substance which resides in a person throughout his life and is somehow 
<br />
responsible for his identity, and which (here is the problem) is not 
<br />
captured by a complete description of the person's physical and 
<br />
psychological state. Often, it is a hidden assumption.
