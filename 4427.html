<br />I agree that I didn't spend as much time as I could have on this point.
<br />
<br />Consider what would happen if MWI communication/travel happened in our 
<br />
timeline.
<br />
<br />First, let's distinguish between what I'll &quot;weak MWI communications&quot; 
<br />
and &quot;strong MWI communications&quot; (or travel, which is essentially 
<br />
isomorphic to communication):
<br />
<br />* Weak MWI communication. Strange, cryptic, ghostly sorts of 
<br />
communications, somewhat like the &quot;I Ching&quot; pentagrams and fleeting 
<br />
glimpses of &quot;close&quot; worlds in Dick's &quot;The Man in the High Castle,&quot; 
<br />
Echoed in the James Hogan novel from 1997, &quot;Paths to Otherwhere, and in 
<br />
a time travel version in Greg Benford's &quot;Timescape,&quot; where a 
<br />
future/branch a century in the future attempts to communicate via 
<br />
particle physics with the &quot;present&quot; to stop/alter an outcome.
<br />
<br />* Strong MWI communication. Full communication with other branches, 
<br />
including substantive exchanges of information. Heinlein's &quot;Glory Road&quot; 
<br />
is a somewhat fantasy-oriented take on this, but the notion is clear: 
<br />
&quot;Queen of the Nine Billion Universes,&quot; etc.
<br />
<br />Imagine what will happen if strong MWI communication happens in our 
<br />
universe, our branch:
<br />
<br />-- presumably access to all of the manifold knowledge from every 
<br />
universe which has done science, engineering, etc.
<br />
<br />-- vast amounts of technology  (as some universes are &quot;ahead&quot; because 
<br />
the Newtonian revolution happened in 535 A.D., etc.)
<br />
<br />-- like a quantum computer, every calculation run a bunch of times, 
<br />
answers already known
<br />
<br />A summary of the Hogan book captures a bit of the impact:
<br />
<br />&quot;The well-worn sf notion of parallel universes receives a 
<br />
computer-driven update in Hogan's latest novel. Berkeley research 
<br />
scientists Hugh Brenner and Theo Jantowitz are just beginning to make 
<br />
startling progress in siphoning information from other universes by 
<br />
means of sophisticated computer technology when their funding 
<br />
disappears. Fortunately but not fortuitously, they are recruited by a 
<br />
secret Defense Department research arm to continue their work under the 
<br />
umbrella of Project Octagon. Joined by a motley team of brilliant 
<br />
minds, including a Buddhist philosopher, the two quickly develop the 
<br />
means to shift their awarenesses to other versions of themselves in the 
<br />
&quot;multiverse&quot; and to preview thereby future outcomes for their home 
<br />
universe ...&quot;
<br />
<br /><br />This is why is it seems reasonable to me that MWI communication would 
<br />
dramatically a civilization's technology.
<br />
<br />(Not saying this knowledge would cause them to colonize the 
<br />
universe...maybe they'd give up in despair, or contemplate their 
<br />
navels, whatever. But contact with 10^10^N other worlds sure could be a 
<br />
kick in the pants, a kick that puts a civilization drastically ahead of 
<br />
any civilization which is still evolving &quot;unitarily.&quot;)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;From Hal's reference to Mike Price's document (which I read several 
<br />
years ago, so I'd forgotten or had not read his bit about MWI and 
<br />
Fermi), it looks like Price reached the same conclusion.
<br />
