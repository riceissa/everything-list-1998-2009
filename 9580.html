<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK, I think I'm clear on what you're saying now. But suppose I argue
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that I will not survive the next hour, because the matter making up my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; synapses will have turned over in this time. To an outside observer the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person taking my place would seem much the same, and if you ask him, he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will share my memories and he will believe he is me. However, he won't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be me, because I will by then be dead. Is this a valid analysis? My view
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is that there is a sense in which it *is* valid, but that it doesn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter. What matters to me in survival is that there exist a person in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an hour from now who by the usual objective and subjective criteria we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; use identifies as being me.
</em><br />
<br />The problem is that there seems to be no basis for judging the validity
<br />
of this kind of analysis.  Do we die every instant?  Do we survive sleep
<br />
but not being frozen?  Do we live on in our copies?  Does our identity
<br />
extend to all conscious entities?  There are so many questions like
<br />
this, but they seem unanswerable.  And behind all of them lurks our
<br />
evolutionary conditioning forcing us to act as though we have certain
<br />
beliefs, and tricking us into coming up with logical rationalizations
<br />
for false but survival-promoting beliefs.
<br />
<br />I am attracted to the UD+ASSA framework in part because it provides
<br />
answers to these questions, answers which are in principle approximately
<br />
computable and quantitative.  Of course, it has assumptions of its own.
<br />
But modelling a subjective lifespan as a computation, and asking how
<br />
much measure the universe adds to that computation, seems to me to be
<br />
a reasonable way to approach the problem.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Even if it were possible to imagine another way of living my life which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; did not entail dying every moment, for example if certain significant
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; components in my brain did not turn over, I would not expend any effort
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to bring this state of affairs about, because if it made no subjective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or objective difference, what would be the point? Moreover, there would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be no reason for evolution to favour this kind of neurophysiology unless
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it conferred some other advantage, such as greater metabolic efficiency.
</em><br />
<br />Right, so there are two questions here.  One is whether there could be
<br />
reasons to prefer a circumstance which seemingly makes no objective or
<br />
subjective difference.  I'll say more about this later, but for now I'll
<br />
just note that it is often impossible to know whether some change would
<br />
make a subjective difference.
<br />
<br />The other question is whether we could or should even try to overcome
<br />
our evolutionary programming.  If evolution doesn't care if we die
<br />
once we have reproduced, should we?  If evolution tells us to sacrifice
<br />
ourselves to save two children, eight cousins, or 16 great-great uncles,
<br />
should we?  In the long run, we might be forced to obey the instincts
<br />
built into us by genes.  But it still is interesting to consider the
<br />
deeper philosophical issues, and how we might hypothetically behave if
<br />
we were free of evolutionary constraints.
