<em class="quotelev1">&gt; gaol and hypnogic myoclonus have different 1- and 3- effects?
</em><br />
<br />Actually I think that one of my posts, the relevant one, has
<br />
disappeared altogether so I enclose a attachment of it. The
<br />
differences between time in jail and hypnagogic myoclonis are
<br />
less from each other in this context, than insofar as they would
<br />
have different 1- and 3- effects. i.e. they would both have a
<br />
different effect in a 3-world to what they would in a 1-world,
<br />
very loosely. In the case of time in jail I loosely rely on
<br />
Parfit's ideas, whilst using it as an example. For hypnagogic
<br />
myoclonus - well it was chosen as an example with a clear
<br />
qualia feeling about it, amongst other things.
<br />
<br />In other words the person with it would very clearly feel the effect,
<br />
as a 1-effect, different from a simple 3-effect (descriptive). But we
<br />
still have imprecisely defined notions of these 1-effects and
<br />
3-effects.But this is all AFAIK.  I know of no set of clear axioms
<br />
or similar which will help, for 'strong mechanism', with clear
<br />
descriptive statements thrown in. 'Strong mechanism'  is not all
<br />
that clear or definite, and even if it were it is probably
<br />
counterintuitive.
<br />
<br />Perhaps slightly OT: for Category theory I am trying out GDCT
<br />
<a href="http://mathcs.mta.ca/research/rosebrugh/gdct/userguide.htm">http://mathcs.mta.ca/research/rosebrugh/gdct/userguide.htm</a>
<br />
First impressions are that it greatly simplifies category theory
<br />
usage, but whether it turns out like that in practical use
<br />
I don't yet know.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I understand why lucid dreaming is an issue (I think), even if I

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't know how to resolve it.
</em><br />
<br />I notice now that this group has several postings on lucid dreams. Now
<br />
they are really quite interesting and not just as science fiction.
<br />
<br />I am at present studying quite a different phenomenon, but just as
<br />
strange, that of synaesthesia. That became an issue in the study
<br />
of functionalism and both Jeffrey Gray (who was Eysenck's
<br />
replacement at the Institute of Psychiatry here in London) and
<br />
myself took a great interest in it and indeed I still do. Briefly,
<br />
lucid dreams could be an equally interesting subject to help decide
<br />
some of the issues in MWI. The reasons for study are to some
<br />
extent similar though, to the reasons for studying synaesthesia.
<br />
Gray in his book on the Hard Problem, gave some of his
<br />
reasons for that kind of line of study and I have others, some
<br />
of course relevant to lucid dreams. I have spoken to, tested,
<br />
and interviewed a number of synaesthetes but have not yet
<br />
got to the point of interviewing lucid dreamers, if indeed I do.
<br />
<br />I will put more details in my newsgroup and blog when I find the time.
<br />
The blog is at
<br />
group is at <a href="http://ttjohn.blogspot.com/">http://ttjohn.blogspot.com/</a>  and the egroup at
<br />
<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ttj">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ttj</a>   Several members of this group have
<br />
joined.already but it is not a fast moving group like this one.
<br />
<br />Sorry all this is a bit brief so far, but we can puruse details as
<br />
required.
