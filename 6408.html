Greetings to Wei Dai and many old friends. I'll post a
<br />
JOIN letter soon.
<br />
<br />Meanwhile---as is no doubt usual on the Everything list
<br />
---much ado is being made of much ado!  :-)

<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I wonder if Davies is not on to something when he posits
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that &quot;strong emergent&quot; phenomena that congeal at various
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; levels of complexity - like consciousness? -  may be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inexplicable via existing physical &quot;laws&quot;.; 
</em><br />
<br />Well, it's of course always *possible* that what we see
<br />
cannot really be explained by current knowledge. Even
<br />
Galileo must have wondered if yet further laws were
<br />
really governing his falling objects, laws beyond
<br />
d = (1/2)t^2 and g = at.  (He would have been right to
<br />
wonder, of course, since in 1905 and 1915 we learned that
<br />
there was a bit more to it.)
<br />
<br />But I would have had to side with a believer at the time:
<br />
&quot;You've done it, Galileo! So far as we can tell, you have
<br />
nailed it, to the greatest extent that we can measure it!&quot;
<br />
Yes, I too would have &quot;wondered&quot;, but not for long: &quot;Absence
<br />
of evidence is not evidence of absence&quot;, I'd say.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; this because, like Wolfram's &quot;strong digitalist&quot; pseudo-random 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generators, such phenomena are effectively algorithmically 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;incompressible&quot; given time and resource constraints.
</em><br />
<br />Still nothing, though, that says quantum mechanics and GR
<br />
aren't perfect in their respective arenas? (Not, of course,
<br />
that the reconciliation isn't a big problem itself.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Davies cites Lloyd's &quot;softer digitalism&quot; in his estimate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the Landauer-Lloyd limit on the computational capacity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of &quot;this&quot; universe given light's speed limit and concludes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that, although such phenomena may not be purely random,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there's not enough functionally available computing capacity 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exploitable by Laplace's demon to unravel them.
</em><br />
<br />I'm probably not following. Is it or isn't it the case that
<br />
in the laboratory we have phenomena which there is serious
<br />
reason to believe cannot be explained by QM? Can a skeptic
<br />
really point to any 3rd person phenomenon and say, &quot;clearly
<br />
QM can't explain that!&quot;?
<br />
<br />As for 1st person phenomena, a number of people, I among them,
<br />
don't believe that there is really a &quot;problem&quot;. Just as sitting
<br />
next to Galileo I would not have believed that there was any
<br />
problem.
<br />
<br />(Now, granted, 1st person experiences for me have an incredible
<br />
consequence: it means that causality must exist, and that there
<br />
must be *time*! As to why I believe that such strong conclusions
<br />
can be drawn, I'm sure that you all have been talking about the
<br />
data already, and probably others have already explicated this
<br />
viewpoint.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Therefore Davies suggests a new set of principles may well
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; need to be coined regarding such strong emergent processes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The &quot;mechanics&quot; of consciousness may indeed be a case in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point and the attempt to &quot;crack&quot; it's code with existing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical principles the wrong tools for the right job.
</em><br />
<br />If consciousness is the strongest card that can be played
<br />
to support the idea that we need new laws of physics, then
<br />
I'll join those who think that it's not much. It wouldn't
<br />
make sense on evolutionary grounds for typical mammals
<br />
such as ourselves to be unable to report internal
<br />
impressions, plans, feelings, and anticipations. 
<br />
