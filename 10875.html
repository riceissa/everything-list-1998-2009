<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm not necessarily talking about every possible computation being implemented by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; every physical system, just (at least) the subset of finite computations implemented by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a physical computer or brain. I think this is another way of saying that a recording, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a single trace of a computation branching in the multiverse, can be conscious. To prevent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a recording being consious yoiu can insist on counterfactual behaviour, but that seems an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ad hoc requirement introduced simply to prevent the &quot;trivial&quot; case of a recording or any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; physical system implementing a computation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; The requirement that computations require counterfactuals isn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; ad hoc, it comes from the observation that computer programmes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; include if-then statements.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; The idea that everyting is conscious unless there is a good
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; reason it isn't -- *that* is ad hoc!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; No, it follows from the idea that anything can be a computation. I think this is trivially obvious,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; like saying any string of apparently random characters is a translation of any English sentence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of similar or shorter length, and if you have the correct dictionary, you can find out what that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; English sentence is.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But that is actually quite a dubious idea. For one thing there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is an objective basis for claiming that one meaning is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;real&quot; meaning, and that is the meaning intended by the writer.
</em><br />
<br />There might have been a particular meaning intended by the writer, but remember materialism: all 
<br />
you have really is ink on paper, and neither the ink nor the paper knows anything about where it 
<br />
came from or what it means. Suppose a stream of gibberish is created today by the proverbial 
<br />
monkeys typing away randomly, and just by chance it turns out that this makes sense as a novel in 
<br />
a language that will be used one thousand years from now. Is it correct to say that the monkeys' 
<br />
manuscript has a certain meaning today? Or is it meaningless today, but meaningful in a thousand 
<br />
years? If the latter, does it suddenly become meaningful when the new language is defined, or when 
<br />
someone who understands the new language actually reads it? What if the manuscript never comes 
<br />
to light, or if it comes to light and is read but after another thousand years every trace of the language 
<br />
has disappeared?
<br />
<br />I don't think it makes sense to say that the manuscript has intrinsic meaning; rather, it has meaning in 
<br />
the mind of an observer. Similarly, with a computation implemented on a computer, I don't think it makes 
<br />
sense to say that it has meaning except in its interaction with the environment or in the mind of an 
<br />
observer. Any string of characters or any physical process can be seen as implementing a language or 
<br />
a computation, if you have the right &quot;dictionary&quot;. There is a very interesting special case of this if we 
<br />
allow that some computations can be self-aware, in the absence of any environmental interaction or 
<br />
external observer: by definition, they are their own observer and thus they bootstrap themselves into 
<br />
consciousness. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For another, your translations would have to be complex
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and arbitrary, which goes against the ususal modus operandi
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of seeking simple and consistent explanations.
</em><br />
<br />It may be inefficient, but that does not mean it is invalid.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This is analogous to finding an alien computer which, when power is applied,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is set into motion like an inscrutable Rube Goldberg machine. If you get your hands on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; computer manual, you might be able to decipher the machine's activity as calculating pi.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You might not need the manual. Numbers don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have arbitrary semantics in the same way words do.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That's why SETI uses mathematical transmissions.
</em><br />
<br />Mathematical truths are eternal and observer-independent, but mathematical notation certainly is not. 
<br />
SETI assumes that there will likely be greater similarities in how different species express mathematical 
<br />
statements than in their non-mathematical communication. There is nothing to stop the aliens using a 
<br />
mathematical notation that varies according to the moods of their emperor or something, making their 
<br />
broadcasts of mathematical theorems seem completely random to us. Maybe that's why we haven't 
<br />
recognised them yet.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is also something Everythingist arguments rely on.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You can't exist as a computation in a numbers-only universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if computations require external interpretation.
</em><br />
<br />The computation is a mathematical object that exists in Platonia. The implementation of a computation on 
<br />
a physical computer so that we can observe it is something else. It is like the difference between the 
<br />
number 3 and a collection of 3 oranges.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Moreover,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; you might be able to reach inside and shift a few gears or discharge a few capacitors and make it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; calculate e instead, utilising the fact that the laws of physics determine that if the inputs change,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the outputs will change (which, I trust you will agree, is the actual physical basis of the if-then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; statements).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Now, in human languages as in machine design, there are certain regularities to make things
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; easier for user. It might be possible, albeit difficult, to decipher a foreign language or figure out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; what an alien computer is computing by looking for these regularities. However, it is not necessary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that there be any pattern at all: the characters in the unknown language may change in meaning
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; every time they appear in the string in accordance with a random number generator, a cryptographic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; method called a &quot;one-time pad&quot;. Similarly, the meaning of the physical states of the alien computer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; could change with each clock cycle according to some random number sequence, so that if you had
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the key you could figure out that the computer was calculating pi, but if you did not its activity would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; seem random.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Assuming that computational states have an external semantics like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; words.
</em><br />
<br />Of course they do. Does Intel or Microsoft follow some universal rule of computer design? Any computer 
<br />
can be emulated on a UTM, but that doesn't mean the computer can't be based on otrageously bizarre 
<br />
and unpredictable rules, inscrutable to anyone not in the know.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  I don't think it would be reasonable to say that the computer is only calculating pi when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; you have the manual at hand ready to refer to, even though without the manual the computer is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; completely useless to you if you want to calculate the area of a circle, for example.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Remember, even the apparently random computer handles counterfactuals, in that if a gear or a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; semiconductor junction were changed, the whole subsequent activity of the machine would change,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and the manual would tell you how the computation had changed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You could dismiss the computations of random physical systems as trivial or useless, but what if you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; believe that some computations can be conscious? It would be no easier for us to observe or interact
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; with these computations than it would be for us to observe or use the pi calculation, but by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; definition the conscious computations *themselves* would be self-aware.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The difficulty is artifical. It comes from your willingness to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; put baroque interpretations on things.
</em><br />
<br />I am talking about what is theoretically possible, not what is sensible or efficient.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is an established method of finding the simplest and most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consistent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical structure that maps a physical system, and that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; We might say in the above cases that the burden of the computation shifts from the physical activity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of the computer to the information in the manual. The significance of this is that the manual is static,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and need not even be instantiated if we don't care about interacting with the computer: it is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; mathematical object residing in Platonia.
