<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; And does it even have to be very good?  Suppose it made a sloppy copy 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of me that left out 90% of my memories - would it still be &quot;me&quot;?  How

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; much fidelity is required for Bruno's argument?  I think not much.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The argument does not depend at all of the level of fidelity. Indeed I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; make clear (as much as possible) that comp is equivalent to the belief 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is a level of substitution of myself (3-person) such that I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (1-person) survive a functional substitution done at that level. Then I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; show no machine can know what is her level of substitution (and thus 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has to bet or guess about it).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is also the reason why comp is not jeopardized by the idea that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the environment is needed: just put the environment in the definition 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of my &quot;generalized brain&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Imagine someone who say that his brain is the entire galaxy, described 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at the level of all interacting quantum strings. This can be captured 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by giant (to say the least) but finite, rational complex matrices. Of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; course the thought experiment with the &quot;yes doctor&quot; will look very 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non-realist, but *in fine*, all what is needed (for the reversal) is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the Universal Dovetailer get through the state of my generalized 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain, and the UD will get it even if my &quot;state&quot; is the state of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whole galaxy, or more.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If it happens that my state is the galaxy state AND that the galaxy 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; state cannot be captured in a finite ('even giant) way(*), then we are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just out of the scope of the comp- reasoning. This is possible because 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comp may be wrong.
</em><br />
<br />This is right, and it is perhaps a consequence of comp that computationalists 
<br />
did not brgain on. If the functional equivalent of my brain has to interact with 
<br />
the environment in the same way that I do then that puts a constraint what sort 
<br />
of machine it can be, as well as necessitating of course that it be an actual 
<br />
physical machine. For example, if as part of asserting my status as a conscious 
<br />
being I decide to lift my hand in the air when I see a red ball, then my 
<br />
functional replacement must (at least) have photoreceptors which send a signal 
<br />
to a central processor which then sends a motor signal to its hand. If it fails the 
<br />
red ball test, then it isn't functionally equivalent to me. 
<br />
<br />However, what if you put the red ball, the hand and the whole environment inside 
<br />
the central processor? You program in data which tells it is seeing a red ball, it sends 
<br />
a signal to what it thinks is its hand, and it receives visual and proprioceptive data 
<br />
telling it it has successfully raised the hand. Given that this self-contained machine 
<br />
was derived from a known computer architecture with known sensors and effectors, 
<br />
we would know what it was thinking by eavesdropping on its internal processes. But 
<br />
if we didn't have this knowledge, is there any way, even in theory, that we could 
<br />
figure it out? The answer in general is &quot;no&quot;: without benefit of environmental interaction, 
<br />
or an instruction manual, there is no way to assign meaning to the workings of a machine 
<br />
and there is no way to know anything about its consciousness. The corollary of this is 
<br />
that under the right interpretation a machine could have any meaning or any 
<br />
consciousness. 
<br />
<br />You can't avoid the above problem without making changes to (standard) computationalism. 
<br />
You can drop computationalism altogether and say that the brain + environment is not 
<br />
Turing emulable. Or, as Bruno has suggested, you can keep computationalism and drop the 
<br />
physical supervenience criterion.
