<br />
I disagree with the reasoning of Jacques Mallah regarding quantum suicide.
<br />
Jacques claims that in a Many-Worlds universe, someone has no reason
<br />
to expect the results of a suicide attempt to be different from what
<br />
they would be if there were just one world.  I and many other people
<br />
argue, instead, that in a MW universe, suicide would eliminate you from
<br />
some successor &quot;branches&quot;, but that you would go on living in others.
<br />
Since you cannot experience your own nonexistence, those successor
<br />
branches where you do not exist are irrelevant to you (just as are
<br />
branches where all life is impossible).  Your personal experience is
<br />
that the suicide never works.
<br />
<br />(Of course this prediction is completely different from in a single-world
<br />
model, where the outcome would be that you continue to remain alive in
<br />
the single world with some probability, or that you completely cease to
<br />
exist, forever and completely.)
<br />
<br />As with many of us, I conceived of these ideas independently.  For me
<br />
it was when I was in college, about 25 years ago.
<br />
<br />There are a number of points on which I believe we can agree:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;- When you attempt a quantum suicide, you remain alive in some
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;branches but die in others.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;- The measure of those branches of the world in which you are alive
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;afterwards is less than the measure of the branch in which you
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attempted the suicide.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;- In some branches where there are continuations of your present
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;existence, you live forever.  However the measure of these branches
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is very small.
<br />
<br />These depend implicitly on a certain flavor of the MWI, to wit:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;- The universe is composed of multiple distinct worlds, each of which
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is continually branching into multiple daughter worlds.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;- A person's consciousness splits when the universe splits (just like all
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the other parts of the universe do).  Each person has continuations
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which are the future versions of themselves, which are separate
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consciousnesses in each daughter branch of the universe.
<br />
<br />Jacques also makes another point, which I find somewhat questionable but
<br />
which may be valid:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;- Our current conscious experiences can be taken to be &quot;typical&quot; in
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that they are drawn randomly from the set of all of &quot;our&quot; conscious
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;experiences, over all the universes.
<br />
<br />I question this for a couple of reasons:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;- This is similar in flavor to the Carter-Leslie &quot;Doomsday&quot; argument which
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;says that we are typical specimens from the entire history of our race,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and hence the human race is likely going to die out in a few hundred
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;years.  This argument is not at all well accepted among philosophers.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;- In the MWI example, it's not clear whether I should be a random sample
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;among all instances of &quot;me&quot;, or perhaps I should be a random sample
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;among all conscious observers in all the universes, human, alien, or
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other.  It seems harder to draw conclusions in the latter case.
<br />
<br />Jacques has suggested that if you were going to live forever, this last
<br />
argument would predict that you would already find yourself very old
<br />
(exactly what is predicted with regard to the human race in the Doomsday
<br />
argument).  However if we assume that the measure of those branches in
<br />
which you live forever is small (as it almost surely would be), then
<br />
in fact the observation that you are relatively young is consistent with
<br />
there being branches where you will live forever.
<br />
<br />I would be interested in hearing to what extent Jacques (or anyone
<br />
else who disagrees with the conclusion of the quantum suicide argument)
<br />
agrees with the various points above.
<br />
<br />Hal
