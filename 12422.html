Bruno Marchal writes:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; which invokes an argument discovered by Bruno and Tim Maudlin 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; demonstrating that there is a problem with the theory that the mental 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; supervenes on the physical. It seems that to be consistent you have to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; allow either that any computation, including the supposedly conscious 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ones, supervenes on any physical activity,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm afraid this does not follow from Maudlin (1989) or me (1988). It is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more related to the Putnam, Chalmers, Mallah (in the list) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implementation problem.  Maudlin shows that if comp is true and if 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical supervenience is true then consciousness supervenes on no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical activity at all. From this absurdity he derives a problem for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comp. Having comp as main hypothesis, I derive from such absurdity the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; difficulty of maintaining the physical supervenience theory. But even 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with just quantum mechanics, the notion of physical supervenience is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not entirely clear.
</em><br />
<br />Maudlin starts off with the assumption that a recording being conscious is 
<br />
obviously absurd, hence the need for the conscious machine to handle 
<br />
counterfactuals. If it were not for this assumption then there would not 
<br />
have been much point to the rest of the paper. Actually, Putnam and 
<br />
Chalmers also think that the idea of any physical system implementing 
<br />
any computation is absurd. I am not sure of Mallah's position (he seems 
<br />
to have disappeared from the list after I joined), but Hal Finney seemed 
<br />
to give some credence to the idea, and outside the list Hans Moravec and 
<br />
Greg Egan seem also to at least entertain the possibility that it is true. I 
<br />
would be interested if anyone is aware of any other references. 
<br />
<br />Although you have clearly stated that the two ideas - consciousness 
<br />
supervening on all physical processes and consciousness supervening on 
<br />
no physical process - are completely different I think they are related in 
<br />
that in both cases matter is irrelevant to consciousness, and we may as well 
<br />
say that what is important is computation as platonic object, not its accidental 
<br />
correlation with (putative) real world processes. They are also closely related 
<br />
in that the main argument against them is &quot;that's absurd&quot;. A second argument 
<br />
against them is also the same: the difficulty explaining why we don't suddenly 
<br />
find ourselves in &quot;white rabbit&quot; universes.   
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; or that computations do not supervene on physical activity at all but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; are complete in themselves, consciousness included, by virtue of their 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; status as Platonic objects. Bruno concludes that the latter is the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; case, but Maudlin appears to take both possibilities as obviously 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; absurd and thus presents the paper as a problem with computationalism 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; itself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, if you read carefully Maudlin, he concludes that throwing out 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comp does not solve his problem. He is aware that the problem is more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; related to physical supervenience than with comp. What is strange, with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maudlin, is that he wrote an excellent book on Bell's inequality and he 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seems aware that &quot;matter&quot; is not an easy concept too (so I don't 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand why he feels so sorry for abandoning physical supervenience, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; when such a concept is not even clear once you understand that &quot;quantum 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter&quot; is not well defined.
</em><br />
<br />Throwing out comp throws out physical supervenience as well, so it can eliminate 
<br />
the problem. Keeping comp and throwing out physical supervenience is the tricky 
<br />
thing.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; MP: Why are we not zombies? The answer is in the fact of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; self-referencing. In our case [as hominids] there are peculiarities 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; of construction and function arisen from our evolutionary history, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; but there is nothing in principle to deny self-awareness from a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; silicon-electronic entity that embodied sufficient details within a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; model of self in the world. The existence of such a model would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; constitute its mind, broadly speaking, and the updating of the model 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; of self in the world would be the experience of self awareness. What 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; it would be like TO BE the updating of such a model of self in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; world is something we will probably have to wait awhile to be told  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; :-)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It seems reasonable to theorise that if an entity could behave like a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; conscious being, it must be a conscious being.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is the no-zombie theory. One question is:  &quot;could behave like&quot; for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; how long?  Now this question makes sense only for those who take the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical supervenience for granted. But then with comp, accepting my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argument + Maudlin (say),  there is no problem at all: consciousness of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one individual supervene on an infinity of immaterial computations, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; never on anything singularized, by Matter or anything else. Matter's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; role consists in &quot;assembling&quot; coherent dream so that consciousness can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; manifest themselves relatively to other consciousness. The &quot;essence&quot; of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter relies in the possibility of inter-subjective constructions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; However, the theory does not have the strength of logical necessity. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It is quite possible that if nature had electronic circuits to play 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; with, beings displaying intelligent behaviour similar to our own may 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; have evolved, but lacking consciousness. This need not lead to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; usual criticism: in that case, how can I be sure my fellow humans are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; conscious? My fellow humans not only behave like me, they have a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; biological brain like me. We would have to invoke magic to explain how 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; God has breathed consciousness into one person but not another, but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; there is no such theoretical problem if the other person turns out to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; be a robot. My personal view is that if a computer simply learned to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; copy my behaviour by studying me closely if it were conscious it would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; probably be differently conscious. If the computer attempted to copy 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; me by emulating my neuronal activity I would be more confident that it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; was conscious in the same way I am, although I would not be 100% 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; certain. But if I were copied in a teleportation experiment to a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; similar tolerance level as occurs in normal moment to moment living, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; it would be absurd to seriously contemplate that the copy was a zombie 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; or differed significantly in his experiences from the original.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, ok.
