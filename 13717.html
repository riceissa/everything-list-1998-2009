</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; right ... (if you know the work of Fuchs).
</em><br />
<br />What I meant was something looser, a tautology perhaps.  That is,
<br />
whatever we postulate as giving rise to our personal 'reality' must
<br />
thereby be 'real' in just this sense: it 'underpins' that reality.  I
<br />
recall your various debates with Peter on this issue, and whatever
<br />
else was at issue, I just felt that at least implicitly this must be
<br />
entailed by the 'realism' part of AR.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK, but not only (there are also the relations between numbers, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relation between the relations between the numbers, etc.)
</em><br />
<br />You are more precise (and correct!)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK. (Technically it is not obvious how to define in arithmetic such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-relation: the basic tool is given by the recursion or fixed point
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theorems).
</em><br />
<br />My basic notion of self-relative existence equates I think to
<br />
Plotinus' One as you describe it in the Sienna paper.  I postulate it
<br />
to stand for 'existence' independent of other causality. I see the big
<br />
One as 'self-differentiating' through spontaneous symmetry breaking,
<br />
as the basis for all subsequent categorisation whatsoever, except the
<br />
original - and unique - ontic category of self-relative existence.
<br />
This entails that all such subsequent categorisation is in some
<br />
fundamental sense epistemic: i.e. how the One 'gets to know' itself.
<br />
So I agree with Plotinus that the One can't be said to 'know' anything
<br />
without such differentiation.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am not sure how could grandma have a feeling about that, except if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; grandma get Church Thesis and the UDA.
</em><br />
<br />Well, I'm working on the technicalities.  But the 'feeling' comes from
<br />
what I've said above.  If all categories of 'process' or 'structure'
<br />
are epistemic - i.e. forms of self-relative 'coming to know' - this
<br />
entails that everything arises as an interpretation from a 'point of
<br />
view'. So what is revealed in any given context and - at least as
<br />
importantly - what is obscured, must then be characteristic of that
<br />
specific point of view, in no sense 'absolute reality' (whatever that
<br />
could mean).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The point is just that physics appears as a sort of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sum on your lobian ignorance.
</em><br />
<br />I think this is what I mean by 'obscured'.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; As I said this is a point where I would like to disagree with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lobian machine. The fact is that even the lobian machine warns us on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the possibility of zombie. Certainly the current artificial cops on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; road are zombie. Tomorrow we will be able to build artificial skin for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; androids capable of making us believe they are normal humans citizens,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ... We should distinguish &quot;local zombie&quot; which are capable to fail you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; during some finite time, and &quot;theoretical global zombie&quot; which are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; capable to fail you, in principle, for ever (like Torgny try to make us
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; believe he belongs too: nobody can prove him wrong).
</em><br />
<br />You're right, we must distinguish zombies.  The kind I have in mind
<br />
are the kind that Torgny proposes, where 'everything is the same' as
<br />
for a human, except that 'there's nothing it is like' to be such a
<br />
person.  My key point is that this must become incoherent in the face
<br />
of self-relativity.  My reasoning is that a claim for the 'existence'
<br />
of something like Torgny's B-Universe is implicitly a claim for
<br />
self-relative existence: i.e. independent of other causality, like the
<br />
One.  When Torgny proposed the Game of Life as an example of 'another
<br />
universe', I pointed out that GoL clearly doesn't possess independent
<br />
existence: it's just a part of the A-Universe.  If one is to postulate
<br />
a universe suitable for the thought experiment, one must in effect
<br />
propose 'another One' - i.e. an independently self-relative
<br />
'B-Universe'.
<br />
<br />It follows that, given the other assumptions of 'sameness',
<br />
conversations with machines in such a B-Universe must then proceed
<br />
exactly as they do in the A-Universe, because they depend on
<br />
self-relation in the same ways.  Now, it may seem that - beyond all
<br />
relativity - the question still remains of the 'absolute' quality of
<br />
'what it's like' to be 'One' in the context of such
<br />
self-individuation.  I leave it for you to judge whether - if a
<br />
machine can report just as we do on what it's like to be itself, with
<br />
exactly the same self-relative justification - it can then remain
<br />
coherent to claim that 'it's not like anything' to be that machine.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Before a long time (despite Kurzweyl) we just can do it, even at a high
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; level. A brain is *very* complex, for any theory. In the future people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will just bet on the available theory through some Pascal wag.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is possible that there is some &quot;zombie&quot; gap, and that the first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person having an artificial brain will not be conscious ... (I doubt
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this, but apparently the lobian machine say so .... according to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definition I gave).
</em><br />
<br />Yes, I agree.  And if the machine can justifiably and honestly pass
<br />
all examinations of 'what it's like' to be itself, I would be
<br />
reluctant to accuse it of zombiehood, based on my own criteria above.
<br />
How we would judge its 'justification' and 'honesty' is an interesting
<br />
question.  For example, if a machine was a Huge Lookup Table, it might
<br />
be able to pass the test, but neither honestly nor justifiably, in my
<br />
terms.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Are you considering neural processing as a behavior?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Are you considering that some platonic and static relations between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; numbers can be seen as behavior?
</em><br />
<br />I'm saying essentially that 1-personal self-relation is
<br />
'characteristically' temporal.  I have no other justification than an
<br />
inability to imagine how else it could be differentiated: 'dynamic'
<br />
self-relation seems to be the defining characteristic of 'qualitative'
<br />
existence.  This seems to be at the heart of 'what it's like' to exist
<br />
1-personally: we 'sense' self-relation as 'action'.  So 'neural
<br />
processing' - i.e. as an aspect of the 'physical brain' perceived
<br />
1-personally - can be behaviour in this sense. Platonic and static
<br />
relations between numbers are 0-personal, and - self-relative to the
<br />
One - this is perhaps structural or eternal.  This is why I (and
<br />
perhaps Plotinus) don't believe that the One 'knows' anything
<br />
distinctly from the knowers and knowledge created by its own
<br />
self-differentiation: there has to be emergence at the 1-personal
<br />
level for an 'act of knowing' to unfold 'in time'.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Recall that the nameable lobian master always insist on  &quot;I will say a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stupidity or I could say a stupidity&quot;       (is that english?)

<br />If I meet the Buddha on the road.....

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; doctor, you are gambling on a level of substitution. At the same time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; you make a &quot;gamble&quot; on the theory comp itself. There is double gamble

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; here. Now, the first gamble, IF DONE AT THE RIGHT COMP SUBSTITUTION
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; LEVEL, is comp-equivalent with the natural gamble everybody do when

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; going to sleep, or just when waiting a nanosecond. In some sense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;nature&quot; do that gamble in our place all the time ... But this is

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; somethjng we cannot know, still less assert in any scientific way, and

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that is why I insist so much on the &quot;theological&quot; aspect of comp. This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is important in practice. It really justify that the truth of the &quot;yes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; doctor&quot; entails the absolute fundamental right to say NO to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; doctor. The doctor has to admit he is gambling on a substitution

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'substitution level' can in principle be 'gambled' on by cloning, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; by evolution (because presumably it has been, even though we can't say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; how).  But by engineering or design???  Would there ever be any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; justification, in your view, for taking a gamble on being uploaded to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; an AI program - and if so, on the basis of what theory?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, if you are willing to believe in &quot;neurophilosophy&quot;, you can bet
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on some high level description. If you bet on Hammerof's theory, you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have to duplicate the qunatum state of the brain (and this is of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; courese not possible). I don't think we are concerned with those

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a specific AI theory, that some AI program instantiated by a

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Before a long time (despite Kurzweyl) we just can do it, even at a high
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; level. A brain is *very* complex, for any theory. In the future people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will just bet on the available theory through some Pascal wag.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is possible that there is some &quot;zombie&quot; gap, and that the first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person having an artificial brain will not be conscious ... (I doubt
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this, but apparently the lobian machine say so .... according to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definition I gave).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The second question I have is summarised in my recent posts about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'sense and 'action'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What you say is interesting, but honestly I am far from extracting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; notion like &quot;action&quot; in the lobian frame. I have no time, nor space,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just bit of promising algebra confirming the quantum principle.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Essentially, I've been trying to postulate that the correlation of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; consciousness and physics is such that the relations between both sets
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of phenomena are a necessary entailment, not an additional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; assumption.  ISTM that this is essential to avoid all the nonsense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; about zombies.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As I said this is a point where I would like to disagree with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lobian machine. The fact is that even the lobian machine warns us on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the possibility of zombie. Certainly the current artificial cops on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; road are zombie. Tomorrow we will be able to build artificial skin for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; androids capable of making us believe they are normal humans citizens,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ... We should distinguish &quot;local zombie&quot; which are capable to fail you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; during some finite time, and &quot;theoretical global zombie&quot; which are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; capable to fail you, in principle, for ever (like Torgny try to make us
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; believe he belongs too: nobody can prove him wrong).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; And not only this, but to show that the reciprocity between experience
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; - e.g. suffering  - and behaviour (indeed the whole entailment of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'intentionality') is a necessary consequence of fundamental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; self-relation (arithmetical relations, in the comp frame).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am not sure about that. Again you develop your intuition where I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; force to ask the machine, and I am far away to tackle a notion like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;behavior&quot;, except in very rough way (where a behavior would be defined
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by a generable set of input-outputs).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Are you considering neural processing as a behavior?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Are you considering that some platonic and static relations between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; numbers can be seen as behavior?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Now, my attempt to do this has been to postulate that 'sense' and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'action' are simply observer-related aspects of a non-decomposable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; fundamental self-relation, which in the comp frame would equate to a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; set of number-relations.  But ISTM that for this to be true, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; observer and physical narratives would somehow need to follow an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'identical' or isomorphic trajectory for their invariant relation to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; emerge in the way that it seems to.  Do you think that this idea has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; any specific sense or relevance in the comp frame?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Given that the physical is defined by the invariant of the observable,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it would be a pity not having such invariant, but I am a bit prisoner
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of my methodology here. Feel free to pursue your intuitive exploration.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; BM:  Does this help? I assert some propositions without justifying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; them,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; because the justification are both already on the list, or in my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; papers. But, please, don't hesitate to ask for more if interested. From
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; what I understand about your intuition, you are quite close to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;natural first person discourse&quot; of the lobian machine. And the closer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; you are, the more severe my comments will be on the details, so please
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; indulge my critical way of talking ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Yes, absolutely!  I feel I'm making progress in resolving some of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ambiguity in my understanding, so be as severe as necessary, cher
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; maitre.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Recall that the nameable lobian master always insist on  &quot;I will say a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stupidity or I could say a stupidity&quot;       (is that english?)
