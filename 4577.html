Slashdot is commenting today on an article by Martin Rees which discusses
<br />
the multiverse,
<br />
<a href="http://www.edge.org/documents/archive/edge116.html">http://www.edge.org/documents/archive/edge116.html</a>.
<br />
<br />One point Rees made is the same one that Paul Davies got upset about in
<br />
the recent NY Times article discussed here,
<br />
<a href="http://archive.nytimes.com/2003/04/12/opinion/12DAVI.html">http://archive.nytimes.com/2003/04/12/opinion/12DAVI.html</a>.  That is the
<br />
conclusion that we might very well be living in a simulation, if among
<br />
the multiverse are universes which run computational simulations of
<br />
other universes.
<br />
<br />Maybe there is no well-defined &quot;fact of the matter&quot; as to whether we
<br />
are actually living in a &quot;real&quot; universe, or in a simulated one, if
<br />
infinite numbers of both exist.  However what would happen is that to
<br />
get the measure of a universe, we would add together the measure of the
<br />
universe itself (perhaps based on Kolmogorov complexity), plus measure due
<br />
to additional copies of the universe being simulated in other universes.
<br />
<br />We might also assume that simulations would be preferentially focused on
<br />
&quot;interesting&quot; universes, especially those where life evolves, and even
<br />
more those where intelligent life evolves and does interesting things.
<br />
The net effect is that those universes get a sort of boost in their
<br />
measure.  I'm not sure how large it would be.
<br />
<br />How would you relate the measure due to the base-level computation of a
<br />
&quot;real&quot; universe against the measure of a simulation of that same universe
<br />
as part of another universe?  Are they equal, since both run the same
<br />
program?  Does the simulation get reduced by a factor due to the measure
<br />
of the universe that hosts it?  And is there a further reducing factor
<br />
due to the simulation using only a tiny fraction of the resources of
<br />
the host universe?  It's not clear how to answer those questions.
<br />
<br />However if we take the first view, that all computations are equivalent,
<br />
then this could be a very strong, indeed overwhelming effect.  The measure
<br />
of intelligent-life-containing universes would be vastly greater than for
<br />
those which are unconscious.  Intelligent life could and would conspire
<br />
to make itself more common in the multiverse.
