Hi,
<br />

<br /><br />It was perhaps not pedagogical to say &quot;big&quot; and &quot;very big&quot;.
<br />
Here John Mikes would be accurate to say those are not problems,
<br />
but koans. So you can *meditate* on it ...
<br />
My intent in the use of the word &quot;big&quot; was more to point on the fact
<br />
that ,going from the preceding problems to those new one is,
<br />
as you can guess, the passage from  ordinary logic
<br />
to  modal  logic, giving that &quot;knowing&quot; and &quot;believing&quot; are modalities.
<br />
Still we do have intuition on what knowledge and believe can be, and
<br />
we can try to get some conclusion.
<br />
<br />Let us try the problem 5. Just to be sure let me know if you agree
<br />
that the proposition:
<br />
<br />You will not know that Lance Amstrong has win the &quot;Tour de France&quot;,
<br />
is false. I mean the negation of &quot;You will not know p&quot; is &quot;you will know p&quot;.
<br />
<br />OK then. Suppose the native is a knave. Then it means he is lying when
<br />
he say that &quot;you will never know I am knight&quot;. But that means I will know
<br />
he is a knight. But I cannot *know* he is a knight if he is a knave, so he 
<br />
cannot be
<br />
a knave, and thus he is a knight. But having reach that conclusion I know
<br />
he is a knight, but then he was lying (giving he told me I will never
<br />
know that. So he is a knave, yes but we have already show he cannot
<br />
be a knave. It looks like we are again in an oscillating state of mind.
<br />
Is it a tourist again? No. I told you it is a native and all native are,
<br />
by the definition of the KK island, either knight or knave. So what?
<br />
<br />I will give many critics later on some &quot;less good&quot; chapter of FU, (ex:
<br />
the chapter &quot;the heart of the matter&quot; is too short, or when he identify
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;a reasoner with a world in his possible world chapter, etc.)
<br />
But Smullyan's discussion on the problem 5 is really quite instructive.
<br />
Its attack of the problem 5 is quite alike my attack on the mind body
<br />
problem, Smullyan will interview &quot;reasoner&quot; (actually machine) on those
<br />
questions. And he goes on very meticulously by defining a hierarchy
<br />
of type of  reasoner, making those problem, mainly the problem 6 more
<br />
and more interesting.
<br />
Indeed, with the problem 5, we are  quickly done, giving that the
<br />
problem 5 leads toward a genuine contradiction even with the reasoner
<br />
of lowest type: the one Smullyan calls the &quot;reasoner of type 1&quot;.
<br />
<br />A reasoner, or a machine, or a system (whatever) will be said to be
<br />
of type 1 if by definition the following conditions hold:
<br />
<br />1) he believes all classical tautologies (our lowest type of reasoner
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is already a platonist!)
<br />
2) if the reasoner ever believes both X and X -&gt;Y, he will believe Y.
<br />
<br />I will also say, following Smullyan and ... Theaetetus, that a reasoner
<br />
know p, in the case the reasoner believes p and p is true, that is when
<br />
the reasoner correctly believes p.
<br />
There is nothing metaphysical in our use of the word &quot;believe&quot;. You can
<br />
substitute it by &quot;prove&quot; or even just &quot;print&quot;. That would mean you are
<br />
in front of a sort of theorem prover which will, for any classical tautology,
<br />
print it one day or an other (condition 1), and, in case it prints X and X-&gt;Y,
<br />
it will, soon or later, print Y. That is he prints a proposition if and
<br />
only if he believes it.
<br />
<br />To transform the &quot;koan 5&quot; into a genuine problem, I must explain what it
<br />
means for a reasoner to believe in the rules of the island. It means that
<br />
if he met a native asserting a proposition p, then he believes the proposition
<br />
&quot;the native is a knight if and only if p is true&quot;.
<br />
We will write Bp for the reasoner believes p, and Kp for the reasoner
<br />
knows p.   For exemple we have Kp &lt;-&gt; p &amp; Bp
<br />
<br />problem 5' (ameliorated version):
<br />
A visitor of type 1 meets, on the KK island, a native telling him
<br />
&quot;you will never know I am a knight&quot;. Convince yourself that this
<br />
really cannot happen. Derive a contradiction.
<br />
<br />Problem 6' (new version):
<br />
A visitor of type 1 meets, on the KK island, a native telling him
<br />
&quot;you will never believe I am a knight&quot;. Convince yourself that this
<br />
can happen. Derive as many conclusions as you can (note that
<br />
all FU will follow, and even my thesis!!! (if you are patient enough).
<br />
The idea is to give more and more self-awareness to the visitor ...
<br />
Curiously enough that path converges.
<br />
<br />Bruno
<br />
<br />PS Those who feels overwhelmed can wait I come back on problem 4,
<br />
when I will recall a little bit more matter on propositional logic. Apology for
<br />
my post to Jesse which could look a little bit &quot;advanced&quot; for many
<br />
(it presupposes FU and a little bit more). Actually writing this stuff helps me
<br />
for my paper. I thank you in advance.
