</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; disgust, loathing or something completely different &gt; that no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; biological organism has ever experienced?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; I'd assess them according to their function in analogy with biological 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; system experiences.  Pain = experience of injury, loss of function.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Disgust = the assessment of extremely negative value to some event, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; but without fear.  Loathing = the external signaling of disgust.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Would this assessment be accurate?  I dunno and I suspect that's a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; meaningless question.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; That you can describe these emotions in terms of their function implies 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that you could program a computer to behave in a similar way without 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; actually experiencing the emotions - unless you are saying that a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; computer so programmed would ipso facto experience the emotions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That's what I'm saying.  But note that I'm conceiving &quot;behave in a similar way&quot; to include more than just gross, immediate bodily motion.  I include forming memories, getting an adrenaline rush, etc.  You seem to be taking &quot;function&quot; in very crude terms, as though moving your hand out of the fire were the whole of the behavior.  A paramecium moves away from some chemical stimuli, but it doesn't form a memory associating negative feelings with the immediately preceding actions and environment.  That's the difference between behavior, as I meant it, and a mere reaction.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Consider a simple robot with photoreceptors, a central processor, and a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; means of locomotion which is designed to run away from bright lights: 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the brighter the light, the faster and further it runs. Is it avoiding 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the light because it doesn't like it, because it hurts its eyes, or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; simply because it feels inexplicably (from its point of view) compelled 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to do so? What would you have to do to it so that it feels the light 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; hurts its eyes? 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Create negative associations in memory with the circumstances, such that stimulating those associations would cause the robot to take avoiding action.
</em><br />
<br />Would this be enough to make the light painful? The robot might become 
<br />
sophisticated enough to talk to you and say that it just doesn't like the 
<br />
light, or even that it has no particular like or dislike for the light but feels 
<br />
compelled to avoid it for no reason it can explain other than &quot;I have been 
<br />
made this way&quot;. Compulsions in conditions such as OCD can be stronger 
<br />
motivators than physical pain or other negative consequences. What special 
<br />
feature of the robot and its programming would make the light actually painful?
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Once you have figured out the answer to that question, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; would it be possible to disconnect the processor and torture it by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; inputting certain values corresponding to a high voltage from the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; photoreceptors? Would it be possible to run an emulation of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; processor on a PC and torture it with appropriate data values? 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think so.  Have you read &quot;The Cyberiad&quot; by Stanislaw Lem?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Would it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; be possible to cause it pain beyond the imagination of any biological 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; organism by inputting megavolt quantities, since in a simulation there 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; are no actual sensory receptors to saturate or burn out?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Pain is limited on both ends: on the input by damage to the physical circuitry and on the response by the possible range of response.
</em><br />
<br />Responses in the brain are limited by several mechanisms, such as exhaustion 
<br />
of neurotransmitter stores at synapses, negative feedback mechanisms such 
<br />
as downregulation of receptors, and, I suppose, the total numbers of neurons 
<br />
that can be stimulated. That would not be a problem in a simulation, if you were 
<br />
not concerned with modelling the behaviour of a real brain. Just as you could build 
<br />
a structure 100km tall as easily as one 100m tall by altering a few parameters in an 
<br />
engineering program, so it should be possible to create unimaginable pain or pleasure 
<br />
in a conscious AI program by changing a few parameters. Maybe this is an explanation 
<br />
for the Fermi paradox: once a society manages mind uploads, it becomes a trivial 
<br />
exercise to create heaven, and the only thing they ever have to worry about again is 
<br />
keeping the computers running indefinitely.
