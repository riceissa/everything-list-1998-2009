<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     I think that consciousness requires:

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     1) A model of the self (This condition opens the pandora's box of

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; recursion and self-referentiality)

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     2) A Turing Machine or the equivalent, which would attempt to simulate

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the self using the available model. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; These two conditions lead to an explanation of free will and the feeling of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the &quot;I&quot;, &quot;Le Moi&quot; in French. (The English expression &quot;to be reflexive&quot;, to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; think, is a clue that we are looking at the mental model of our selves in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; certain thinking situations.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I think this is too strong a definition for consciousness, in that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it focuses on just one form of consciousness but does not get at the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;essential mystery of the phenomenon.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It describes what George calls &quot;reflexive consciousness&quot;, or awareness of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the self as an actor.  It is intimately tied in with the concept of free
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;will, which again is fundamentally based on actions taken.
</em><br />
<br />I am willing to agree until here.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But consciousness need not be active.  It can be passive, and it can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;composed of awareness of the outside world, not necessarily awareness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the self.
</em><br />
<br /><br />How could we be aware of the outside world, or even of *an* outside 
<br />
world?
<br />
To point toward the &quot;outside&quot; (a very instinctive pulsion) is still 
<br />
an indirect way to refer to the self inside. But because we are 
<br />
doing this automatically we are almost unaware that we are &quot;dreaming&quot; 
<br />
or just &quot;infering&quot;, &quot;imagining&quot; and still just hoping or betting 
<br />
we are correct relatively to a &quot;putative&quot; &quot;intellectual,
<br />
outside world. 
<br />
<br />I mean the outside world you touch hear or see is still the border of 
<br />
yourself.
<br />
Even if most of our inference beyond that border are correct.
<br />
<br />Like you I would distinguish self consciousness and passive 
<br />
consciousness.
<br />
But (and this is a kind of return to George Levy) I take passive 
<br />
consciousness as consciousness of the border of the self. The busy 
<br />
planning self-consciousness is much more at the center of the self, or 
<br />
self-centered. 
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;People sometimes experience such conscious states.  While meditating,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;or sometimes while viewing something of great beauty, or maybe simply
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;watching a movie, television, or reading a book, we are drawn into a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;passive and observing state.  We do not make decisions, we do not think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;about ourselves.  We simply and calmly observe what is before us.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Imagine sitting and watching a beautiful sunset.  There is no particular
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;awareness of the self, no free will in this state.  One is entranced by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the sight, the slow changes in the magnificent colors.  This takes up all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the conscious awareness.
</em><br />
<br /><br />This happens in dream. Have you notice? I would even say that in most
<br />
dreams (with the exception of lucide or hyper-realiste dream) we are
<br />
in general less aware of the center-self and more involved in the direct
<br />
happenings, which in a dream is clearly not &quot;outside&quot;. Some dreams can 
<br />
make you totaly passive too. As you say, music
<br />
can do that too. As can a good novel or a good movie. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Surely we will agree that this is a fully conscious state.  But there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is no need for a self model or an internal TM to run that model.
</em><br />
<br />There is no need for a self model but there is a need for a model, which 
<br />
one is a (deep) inferential construct of the self from its looking at 
<br />
his border and infering beyond. 
<br />
Like in the dreams, there is no need for awakening the self centered hero.
<br />
<br />Even when you are completely active in something that can happens.
<br />
<br />If by meditation or by dance you are able to &quot;pacify&quot; completely 
<br />
the self, the distinction between inside and outside will dissolve 
<br />
too, it seems to me. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Of course, with people such states are only temporary, and it could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;perhaps be argued that consciousness *inherently* requires the ability to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;move beyond this state and be in our normal, busy, self-thinking, planning
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;state.  While this may be biologically true for us (at least for most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;people), it does not seem inherently true to me, not true enough to let
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;us begin a philosophical exporation of consciousness with the assumption
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that it requires this &quot;busy&quot; self-reflexive state that George describes.
</em><br />
<br />I attribute consciousness to the animals, and that is why I agree with
<br />
the importance of your distinction. (Animals does not seem to have the
<br />
reflexive thought).
<br />
But the animal will not insist on the distinction inside/outside. 
<br />
(Though it can be very self-centered; like a dog jealous of a baby.)
<br />
Even the animal makes unconscious, automatic, inferences of his
<br />
self-concistency but the animal is quite unaware of that inference
<br />
and its relation with itself.
<br />
Consciousness is always self-consciousness but can be center or border
<br />
focusing. I think.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From the little mammifere to the primate there is a change of focus
</em><br />
going from the border to the center.
<br />
<br />It is not solipsism because I have never say that the inference are
<br />
necessarily wrong or illusory. I have no doubt there is some sort of 
<br />
&quot;outside realm&quot; whatever it is.
<br />
<br />Bruno.
