</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Not very closely, unfortunately. Regarding &quot;quantum immortality&quot;, my view 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is that if MWI is true, we have to reinterpret &quot;x desires that p&quot; as &quot;x 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;desires that p-branches should have a high amplitude&quot;. With this simple 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;translation, we may continue as if nothing had happened.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I take it you don't believe in &quot;quantum immortality&quot; or the &quot;RSSA&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;<a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m560.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m560.html</a> you say: [snip] You also 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;said in that post you weren't sure how to combine the QM probabilities with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the SSA, but in your last post to RS you seemed reconciled to doing so.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Consider first a partially analogous case, where we assume MWI is false.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Suppose there are a trillion planets (analogous to different branches on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the wavefunction), and an Adam and an Eve doing the experiment on each of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;these planets. On the vast majority, no deer turns up, but on one in ten 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;thousand planet, the trick works. Now, if Adam knows that this is the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;setup, then he should not think that the trick will work. The reason is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that the no outsider requirement is not satisfied: to apply SSA with a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reference class consisting only of the humans living on his planet would be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;wrong. Once we take the reference class to contain all these actual 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observers living on some planet or other, then it is easy to see that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;applying SSA will not give Adam any reason to think that a wounded deer 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;will appear.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;If this is a good analogy to the MWI-case, then the paradox would not arise 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;under that assumption. But that is not clear to me at all. For the branches 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the wavefunction aren't simply so many different actual worlds, but they 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;come with a measure. I take it that we need to assume that this measure is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;related to SSA by assigning sample densities to observer-moments that is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;proportional to the measure of the branches on which they are living.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;This means that observers living on small-measure branches will only weakly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;contribute to the violation of the no outsider requirement; that is, if one 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the alternative hypotheses under consideration is only true on branches 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;which have a small measure, then the no outsider requirement can for all 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;practical purposes be regarded as satisfied.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Therefore, if Adam is uncertain whether his world is one where the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;deer-branch has a high or a low amplitude (but thinks that with 99,99%
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probability it has a low amplitude), then when he considers his position, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;he gets reason to think that the deer-branch has high amplitude, since that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would concentrate a greater sampling weight on observers that are observing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;what Adam observes. (On the other hand, if Adam were certain about the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;shape of the wave function, then the above argument would not show that he 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;should think that he will next observe a wounded deer. But why assume that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Adam knows the shape of the wave function? If he doesn't, then it seems to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;me that my paradox obtains also in the context of the MWI.)
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's the point you seem to be missing.  Suppose, without the MWI, he 
<br />
would know that on a usual day a deer is 1% likely to turn up.  But since 
<br />
this is not a usual day, but the day that will determine whether he gives 
<br />
rise to a race, he would think a deer probably will turn up which then means 
<br />
he won't reproduce.  (And not reproducing would give his own case more 
<br />
effective probability, which is why he thinks it's likely.)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he believes the MWI however, then he knows there is a branch where a 
<br />
deer turns up and one where it doesn't.  He knows that for a usual day the 
<br />
effective probability of a deer turning up is about 1%.  Since he has no 
<br />
reason to believe the laws of nature are specially configured to correlate 
<br />
the amplitude of the wavefunction's branches with his actions (especially 
<br />
since such correlation would be hard to reconcile with QM), he will still 
<br />
believe the effective probability of a deer turning up is just 1%.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, in QM there will be many branches even before that day.  So 
<br />
it's also true that branches will exist, with about equal amplitude to his 
<br />
own where e.g. maybe the weather was different and he chose a different day 
<br />
to go &quot;deer hunting&quot;, where the Earth has two moons, or indeed where the 
<br />
first man's name was Jack, etc.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These sort or branches do act exactly like regular old alien worlds for 
<br />
this purpose.  Thus even if someone hands him a spin 1/2 particle, state 
<br />
unknown, he should not consider it just to have some wavefunction which he 
<br />
could apply the &quot;Adam paradox&quot; to like a classical coin; he must also 
<br />
consider the already parrallel branches where the equivalent particle has 
<br />
some other wavefunction, and there are other versions of him there to see 
<br />
it.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{If he was really ahead of his time, and foreshadowing this list he did 
<br />
consider the hypothesis that what is called on this list a White Rabbit 
<br />
exists in the laws of nature, such that the deer and him really are 
<br />
specially correlated, and if he were to calculate it the way I would, he 
<br />
would have to consider this possibility to be lower in probability (compared 
<br />
to the assumption that there is no such WR) by 2^(-l), where l is the length 
<br />
in bits of the extra information that would need to be encoded into the laws 
<br />
of physics in order to create such a correlation.}
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I mean that few people would think that SSSA-R stands or falls with MWI.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Just as it is no good reply to the Adam&amp;Eve paradox that Adam and Eve 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probably never existed, so it also seems to be unsatisfactory to dismiss 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the paradox by saying that it doesn't obtain if MWI happens to be true.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agreed.  As I've already said, the sense of &quot;paradox&quot; is really just a 
<br />
product of faulty intuition about an atypical case.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;    In the 'coin toss' case, the answer is obvious.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Yes, but different answers appear to be obvious to different people.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case I really can't imagine why.  It's a straightforward 
<br />
application of Bayesian probability theory.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;The main motivation is that it avoids certain consequences
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that most people regard as highly counterintuitive and unacceptable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Well, I've already stated that I regard those consequences as obvious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and intuitive.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So you accept that Adam should think that a wounded deer will turn up?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(Let's assume here for the sake of the argument that MWI is false.) You
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would probably be the only person who thinks that that is obvious and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;intuitive.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the MWI is known to be false, and it is known that there are really 
<br />
no other planets / universes / intelligent races on that planet / etc., and 
<br />
if it is known that there will be a one to one correspondence between 
<br />
whether the wounded deer turns up and whether he gives rise to billions of 
<br />
descendants, then he should believe that the deer will probably turn up 
<br />
because that hypothesis predicts his own situation while the hypothesis that 
<br />
he will reproduce does not.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course that's a one time thing.  If he tried it too often, then he 
<br />
certainly would have to reproduce eventually.  Knowing that, he wouldn't 
<br />
even think it would work the first time.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I do find the premise that he can be certain that no type of MWI can 
<br />
be true hard to swallow.  (As I've said previously on this list, the AUH is 
<br />
not experimentally falsifiable; as I see it, Occam's razor always favors 
<br />
it.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I would follow any advice I would give to Adam if I were
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in his	situation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It's quite interesting to know that there is someone who would do that. I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;though I would for a while, but after thinking more about this and making 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the situation vivid to my imagination, I came to the conclusion that this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;seemed crazy and that if there were any consistent way of avoiding it, then 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it should be avoided.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe if you keep thinking about it more and more, your beliefs will 
<br />
swing back again.  And if still more, then swing again.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Of course, everything I say in the thesis is compatible with accepting R=Ru 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(i.e. setting the reference class equal to the class of all observers) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;provided one is also willing to accept the Adam&amp;Eve paradox.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You still haven't presented any way to determine the proper &quot;reference 
<br />
class&quot;.  I suggest you use the logical approach: include all observers.
