<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;analogue machines, which I don't doubt will allow survival. One can

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;then replace these analogue devices by digital ones, simply by

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;discretising the analogue quantities in a suitably fine way. Note,

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;that there is still instrinsic randomness in the behaviour of the

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;I then asked you whether by digital device, you meant a &quot;Universal

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;that (1-)randomness has something to do with free will.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />We obviously have different meanings for the word digital. For me,
<br />
a digital device means a discrete state device. Not all such devices
<br />
are Turing emulable. An example of one that isn't is a radioactive
<br />
source, couples with a Geiger counter, plus a simple counter such that
<br />
when a radioactive decay is detected, the state of the counter is
<br />
output, and then the counter reset. This device generates true random
<br />
numbers according to a Poisson distribution.
<br />
<br />This is not abandoning the Church thesis, which is that there is a
<br />
distinct class of computations that are accessible from all universal
<br />
computers, and that a Universal Turing Machine is a model of such a
<br />
universal computer.
<br />
<br />Obviously, there is a well defined subset of digital devices that are
<br />
Turing emulable. Why not call these Turing emulable devices to avoid confusion?

<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm afraid I don't see how 1-randomness is related with free-will.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Suppose you are annihilated at some place and reconstituted in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; three different cities: A B and C. You know that you are the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subject of that experience and you try to concentrate yourself,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'exercising your free-will' to be the one reconstituted in A.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I suppose that the right level of substitution has been choosed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then, although the one reconstituted in A will tell me: &quot;you see
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my free will has worked out&quot;, I, as a computationalist (here) will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; say to the A-you: let us hear what the B-you and the C-you will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; say. And of course they will at least appear to be less sure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they free-will has work.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Unless, like Niklas has suggested, the B-you and the C-you will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be so much disappointed that they will become zombie :-)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />Firstly, free will is a 1-phenomenon. It is a category mistake to
<br />
attempt to understand it from a 3-person point of view. From the
<br />
3-person point of view, each of A, B and C will think they have chosen
<br />
the city of their destination (assuming you have set up the experiment
<br />
above so that the person has a choice - which seems unlikely given
<br />
your description above).
<br />
<br />More importantly, we each have the possibility of chosing what to
<br />
observe. We can chose what aspect of the universe we want to observe
<br />
(ie whether I walk into your contraption in the first place or not!)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You are consistent because you are willing to accept zombie.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But that is a too big price for me. 
</em><br />
<br />Tell me the existence of zombies is too high a price to pay? Is there
<br />
some pseudo-paradox I am unaware of?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then you must explain me what is not turing-emulable in the proteins.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You are slipping dangerously into Penrose-like non computationalism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; again here!
</em><br />
<br />Whether a synapse conducts or not is a statistical process that can
<br />
never be emulated completely accurately. Brain processes appear to be
<br />
chaotic, magnifying the effect of these statistical variations. It
<br />
hasn't been established whether these statistic effects hinder the
<br />
operation of the brain, or are essential to the brain's creativity and
<br />
free will. For COMP to hold, you had better hope the former is true.
<br />
<br />In a real computer, the random variations due to electron statistics
<br />
(Shot noise??), stray electromagnetic fields and consmic rays are
<br />
suppressed by deliberate engineering so as to approximate the ideal
<br />
computer (Turing machine) as best possible. There are no such
<br />
constraints for the brain, which is merely &quot;engineered&quot; by natural
<br />
selection to work.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Now, you are saying that the level of substitution implied in COMP is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;running the whole plenitude on a computer - Schmidhuber style. How
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;does this relate to substitution of analogue brains by Turing machines
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;within the individual observer world? It seems to me a case of chalk
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;and cheese - two things that have nothing to do with each other.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is really what the UDA explain. I remember that in one of the post
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you were adressing to me, you ask me to explain the white rabbit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem and it is fair enough because I have been rather short in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my explanation of it (cf PE-omega in the list).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; See below. I prefer first to answer your last remark to prevent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a misunderstanding concerning the relation between Schmidhuber's work
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and mine.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;It seems to me (although I haven't followed you argument to the nth
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;degree), that you are claiming in your thesis that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;COMP=&gt;Schmidhuber. That may be true, however, I would very much doubt
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;that Schmidhuber=&gt;COMP. You haven't advanced a poof of this.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I give you two proofs.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Remember that by COMP I mean there is a level of description of my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;generalized brain/body&quot; such that I survive a digital substitution of my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;generalized brain&quot; at that level. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Note that Digital = Turing machine, with Church thesis.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (To get the full power of Church thesis I accept also a minimal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; amount of arithmetical or mathematical platonism).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; By definition my &quot;generalized brain&quot; is the portion of the universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (if that exists) which is necessary to emulate to make my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness exists. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) First Schmidhuber clearly believes in a stronger version of comp,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as he told us:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &lt;&lt;According to the computability-oriented view adopted in this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; paper, life after death is a technological problem, not a religious 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one. All that is necessary for some human's resurrection is to record 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; his defining parameters (such as brain connectivity and synapse 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; properties etc.), and then dump them into a large
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computing device computing an appropriate virtual paradise.&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is at the end of his paper. He does not emphasize on it, but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; clearly he believes in the existence of a level of substitution.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course I explain and insist that it is both a technological
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem and a religious one. Comp is not provable as self-duplication
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiments illustrates. It need some act of faith.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />Fair enough. However, I interpreted this as some extra piece of
<br />
&quot;religious&quot; writing that didn't follow formally from the preceding
<br />
paper. In this discussion, we don't decide things on the basis of
<br />
faith, but rather by reason and quality of argument.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) But even if you forget he is telling us that explicitely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you can derived it from the rest (non philosophical part) of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; his paper. Indeed, suppose comp is wrong, then there is no level
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of substitution such that I survive ..., then the universe or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multiverse cannot be computable or turing-emulable and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'great programmer&quot; will never generated it (because I belong to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it). Schmidhuber's approach would not even be a plausible 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; candidate for an everything theory at all in that case.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />I believe this line of argument is a travesty of the word COMP. Let me
<br />
start by outlining the picture I have of what Schmidhuber's Plenitude
<br />
implies (taken from my Occam paper).
<br />
<br />i) There exists (Platonically perhaps) all possible computations.
<br />
<br />ii) The ensemble of all consistent FASes is contained within this
<br />
plenitude. The members of this ensemble have higher measure than the
<br />
others by means of the Universal Prior. Furthermore, an even vaster
<br />
number of computations are indistinguishable from the c-FASes by a
<br />
finite observer.
<br />
<br />iii) Assuming two propositions about conciousness (Time and
<br />
Projection/Selection) and Linearity, the anthropically viable FAS is
<br />
given by the QM multiverse.
<br />
<br />iv) Within the QM multiverse, each observer observes a universe, with
<br />
physical laws compatible with QM. However, QM does not imply the
<br />
physical laws, nor does it imply observers. The physical universe we
<br />
see is an interpretation i.e. the MWI :)
<br />
<br />Now, when you say I physically survive subsitution, I understand you
<br />
mean a subsitution done within level iv) - ie you actually replace my
<br />
physical brain with something. I don't expect you to change the
<br />
universe altogether. If you create another computation in the
<br />
Schmidhuber ensemble, with identical results, the if I had a terminal
<br />
brain tumour in the orginal world, I would still die in the copy (ie I
<br />
don't survive!).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Note also that COMP =&gt; Schmidhuber is ambiguous, because 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Schmidhuber postulates there is a (computable) universe.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I do not. (the existence of such a computable universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; follows from comp only in the case my &quot;generalised brain&quot; is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;entire universe&quot;).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;                                 ***
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The Universal Dovetailer Argument.  (UDA)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; UDA is a proof that:  COMP entails REVERSAL physics/psychology.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The reversal will be be epistemological: the branch &quot;physics&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will be a branch of machine's psychology, and ontological: matter 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will emerge from consciousness, in some sense, hopefully clearer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; later.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Indeed such a reversal will change the meaning of term
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like &quot;psychology&quot; and &quot;physics&quot; and the meaning is given ultimately
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by the proof itself. By 'proof' here, I mean argument which either
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should convince you, which means you are the only judge (no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; authoritative argument) or you should find an error. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course if you belief that the REVERSAL
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is an absurdity, you are free to interpret the proof as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; refutation of COMP (like Gilles Henri, BTW are you still here Gilles?). 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; COMP is the hypothesis that there is a level such that I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; survive a digital functional substitution of my generalised body/brain 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (see above)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; made at that level, + Church Thesis (digital = turing) + Arithmetical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Platonism (= the belief that arithmetical propositions obeys
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; classical logic, and this independently of my own cognitive ability).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To sum up: COMP = \exists n SURV-SUBST(n)    + CT   + AR
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Note also that I'm assuming a minimal amount of folk psychology (FOLK)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; without which such an enterprise would be meaningless. It is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; minimal amount of psychology to understand that you or someone else
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could, in some situation, accept an artificial-digital brain graft,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and to understand the intuitive difference between first and third
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person. (See below).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (the modal 'chapter 5' of my thesis can be interpreted as an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attempt (at least) to eliminate FOLK by substituting it by the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; godelian provability logics and its thaetetical variants). 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But the real goal of the  chapter 5 is to make the derivation of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics real and concrete.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To make the reasoning easy I introduce supplementary hypotheses.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I will eliminate these hypotheses in due course.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a) NEURO: The neurophysiologist hypothesis. This is a supposition that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the level of substitution is high, or that my generalised brain is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my biological brain (the one in my skull) relevantly described at the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; molecular level (let us say).
</em><br />
<br />As I stated above, I do not understand the meaning of COMP unless it
<br />
is identical with NEURO.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; b) CU: there is a Concrete Universe, whatever it is. This is need
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    for the decor.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; c) CUD: there is a Concrete running of a UD in the concrete universe.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; d) 3-locality: computations are locally implementable in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    concrete universe. That is it is possible to separate two 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    implementations of two computations in such a way that the result
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    of one of these computations will not interfere with the result
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    of the other one. Computations can be independent.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    More generally the result of a computation is independant of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    any event occuring a long way (out of the light cone) from that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    computation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; e) Conceptual OCCAM razor. I will not insist. That should be easy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    for many-worlder. The movie-graph argument in my thesis is really
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    an elimination of occam razor. See also Maudlin's paper.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    We talk about that in the discussion list (key word: Maudlin,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    movie, crackpot).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The proof.  (Apology for those who 'knows').
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) By COMP and NEURO you survive with an artificial digital (turing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emulable, with TC) brain. OK?  (CU is used implicitely).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) By COMP and NEURO you survive classical teleportation. This 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; follows from 1) where the building (reconstitution) of the brain is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; done a long way from the 'reading device' and the annihilation of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; original body. (CU is used implicitely).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3) By COMP and NEURO (and implicitely CU, I will not mention it again)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you survive teleportation with a delay. After the annihilation, your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; body and brain description is keep intact during one year, and then you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are reconstituted. An important point is that you (from your first 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person point of view) will not see the difference with the simple
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; teleportation case (case 2). But an exterior observator (third person)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will see the difference. Indeed for him the delayed teleportation 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; last one year.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4) You are teleported from the center of the galaxy to its border.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; At the opposite border a star explodes. This changes nothing: you still
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; survive. This follows easily from 3-locality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 5) You are teleported from the center of the galaxy to its border.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; At the opposite border you are reconstituted. (For exemple the scanned
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information has been send in opposite direction from the center of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the galaxy, and reconstituting machines has been put on the edge of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the galaxy). You still survive, by COMP and 3-locality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 6) You are duplicable. (Direct consequence of 5).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 7) Although your surviving does not depend on the faraway events,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from the first person perspective the event &quot;I survive at the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; left edge (let us say) of the galaxy&quot; could depend on the faraway
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other reconstitution. The duplicability entails first person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indeterminisme, although everything is determinate for a third
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person. (It is really the computationalist 3-determinateness 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which entails the computationalist 1-indeterminateness).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (exercise: show that the duplicability entails the unprovability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of COMP. Hint: consider teleportation without annihilation of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; original, with a delay, applied to a non-computationalist)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 8) You are 'read' and annihilated in Brussels and the information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is send to Washington and Moscow. You are reconstituted at Washington
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and the information is keep intact at Moscow during one year. Then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you are reconstituted at Moscow. (Duplication with assymmetric
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; delay). The point is the following: whatever the way you choose for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quantifying the 1-indeterminisme in the symmetric duplication, you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; must quantifify in the same manner the assymmetric duplication.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This follows from COMP and 3. The first person cannot be aware of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the delays.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 9) There is also a form of 1-non-locality. Although your surviving
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does not depend on faraway events, your expectation of personal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience does depend on faraway events. Here also, it is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; strict 3-locality which entail the 1-non-locality.
</em><br />
<br />I don't understand this point. However, maybe it is not important.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 10) Here is an old argument you can find in all idealist school
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of thought (Hindouist, Boudhist, Platon, Descartes, Berkeley, etc.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is based on the notion of dream, but today it is more easy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (especially with COMP)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to convey it with the notion of virtual reality. The point is:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For any neigborhood and any time interval, you can build a computing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine simulating  that &quot;space-time&quot; at such a level that a first 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person will not be able to see any difference. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (The computing machine preserves the relevant counterfactuals).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Roughly speaking a first person cannot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distinguish 'real neigborhood' with virtual (digitally simulated)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; neighborhood (for all level 'below' its own substitution level).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 11) To sum up: the way you quantify the indeterminisme is independent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the time, the place and the nature (real/virtual) of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reconstitution.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Note: the indeterminism is pure 1-indeterminism. Nevertheless, by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; duplicating entire population, the indeterminism can be made
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; third person 'verifiable' inside each multiplied population. This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; leads to what I call first person of the plural indeterminism. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (I would like to know a better english expression for that!).
</em><br />
<br />I'm not sure what this point means either.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 12) A Universal Dovetailer exists. (Extraordinary consequence of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Church thesis and Arithmetical Realism). The UD simulates all 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible digital devices in a quasi-parallel manner).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Adding a line in the code of any UD, and you get a quasi-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computation of its Chaitin \Omega number).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 13) So let us assume CU and CUD, that is let us assume explicitely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is a concrete universe and a concrete running of a UD in it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This need a sort of steady state universe or an infinitely expanding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe to run the complete infinite UD.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Suppose you let a pen falls. You want predict what will happen.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let us suppose your brain is in state S at the beginning of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiment. The concrete UD will go to that state infinitely often
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and compute all sort of computational continuations. This is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; equivalent to reconstitutions. It follows from 11 that your 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; expectation are undetermined, and the domain of the indeterminism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is given by the (infinite) set of reconstitutions. To predict,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with COMP, what will happen you must take into account all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible histories going through the state S of your brain. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And here clearly the NEURO hypothesis is not used. Even if your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; real brain state is the state of the actual concrete universe, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with COMP that state will be generated (infinitely often) by the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; UD. Same reasoning if your brain state is the quantum state of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the universe, so the reasoning works even if the brain is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non local quantum object (if that exists). So the physics is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; determined by the collection of your computational continuations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relatively to your first person actual state.
</em><br />
<br />See my heirarchy above. COMP \equiv NEURO. One's expectations are
<br />
constrained by the laws of the QM multiverse. Within that, naturally
<br />
there is 1-indeterminism. Not all brain states are reachable by
<br />
computational continuations from a given state.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 14) If 'that' physics is different from the traditional empirical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics, then you refute COMP. But with COMP you will not refute
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; COMP, isn't it? So with COMP you will derive the laws of physics,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; i.e. invariant and similarities in the 'average' continuations of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; yourself (defining the measure on the computationnal continuations).
</em><br />
<br />Why should apriori COMP not refute COMP? It would simply mean that
<br />
COMP is inconsistent - and is the basis of reductio ad absurdum.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Exercice: why should we search a measure on the computational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; continuations and not just the computational states? Hint: with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just the computational states only, COMP predicts white noise for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all experiences. (ok Chris ?). With the continuations, a priori 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we must just hunt away the 'white rabbit' continuations. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You can also show that Schmidhuber's 'universal prior' solution 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  works only in the case the level of substitution
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is so low that my generalised brain is the entire multiverse.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />Again, I do not know what you mean by this last comment.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 15) Once you explain why arithmetical machines are statistically right 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to believe in physical laws without any real universe, such a real 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe is redundant.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; By Arithmetical Realism and OCCAM razor, there is no need
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to run the concrete UD, nor is there any need of a real concrete
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Universe.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Or you can use the movie graph argument to show that a first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person is not able to distinguish real/virtual/and *Arithmetical*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nature of his own implementations, and this eliminates OCCAM.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;                                                 QED
</em><br />
<br />Fine - I have no problems arithmetical realism. The problem is when
<br />
you say COMP=Schmidhuber, when at first blush these appear to be
<br />
independent assumptions, and not well served by having identical
<br />
labels (which would immediately cause confusion).
<br />
<br />Incidently, I believe physics is dependent on psychology, however in
<br />
rather a different fashion. For example, time is a psychological
<br />
concept, it comes from the postulate that time is required for
<br />
conciousness. Much of the rest of physics is similarly anthropically
<br />
determined. This is really the argument I outline in my Occam
<br />
paper. Nevertheless, it relies on Schmidhuber and/or Tegmark
<br />
construction, which as I have repeatedly stated, seems to be
<br />
completely independent of the COMP assumption as you've stated it. I
<br />
was hoping for a transparent explanation of why you *believe*
<br />
COMP&lt;=&gt;Schmidhuber. 
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 16) Oh la la, I get tired. I'm sure I have forget things. I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would appreciate any comments, especially skeptical one.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The 'philosophical' proof really stop here. It is not a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; derivation of physics from the psychology of machine, it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a proof that physics MUST be derived from the psychology of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine OR COMP IS FALSE.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Later I will show you how to eliminate the FOLK psychology
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumption, by substituting folk psychology by the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; godelian provability logics and 'simulating' the first and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; third person variants with the Thaetetical variations...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ... and I will show how, by simulating the UD by the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sigma_1 arithmetical sentences, the arithmetical version
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the present proof leads naturally toward an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arithmetical version of quantum logic (almost).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; With an unexpected gift : a theorisation of the non
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; communicable part of the theory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Explaining qualia as uncommunicable part of the observable. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This will also show that George Levy is valid in his recent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; answer to James Higgo :-)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Am I dreaming ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Have a nice weekend,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
