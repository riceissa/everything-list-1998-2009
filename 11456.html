Ok David,
<br />
Let's start afresh and do this. At least give it a go. This is to be FUN.
<br />
Not work.
<br />
<br />I know enough about EC. You know enough about COMP. The goal is to get to
<br />
a more concrete formal understanding of the difference between reality and
<br />
computation, physics, logic, maths and 'being' through contrasting Entropy
<br />
Calculus (EC) as the actual logic of the noumenon (reality as a
<br />
mathematics, which becomes a physics when you are IN it, made of it,
<br />
trying to understand it) with COMP, as a 'master abstractor' of
<br />
everything.
<br />
<br />We can jointly address epistemological and ontological issues along the
<br />
way. We can do this incrementally, one posting at a time. Nice and slowly
<br />
so we can follow it and point to where we fly off into
<br />
respective weeds. I can pose symbols and relata. You can tear it to bits
<br />
and interpose COMP interpretations.
<br />
======================================================
<br />
STEP 1:    The noumenon that is EC
<br />
<br />In EC I would write U(.) (for universe)
<br />
<br />NOTES:
<br />
1) U(.) is our singular reality. It. The only one we truly know.
<br />
2) U(.) is not an abstracted computation.
<br />
3) U(.) is not a mathematical abstraction of reality.
<br />
4) U(.) is treated as a function for reasons of the later logic
<br />
5) U(.) is merely a symbol which 'points' to reality as a computation.
<br />
U(.) is an interpretive tool, not a generative tool.
<br />
6) U(.) is made of EC/recursive logic of a class as not yet defined.
<br />
7) U(.) is literally made of a relationship between the original axiomatic
<br />
origins.
<br />
8) U(.) has no 'appearance', is not an 'observation' of anything.
<br />
9) A side issue: U(.) can be regarded as a 'free-form' cellular automata
<br />
which manufactures its own cells and the cells and their relationships
<br />
emerge as collaborations of cells within cells. eg. At one level an 'atom'
<br />
is a cell. Also, if you collected all wolframs 'cellular automata
<br />
drawings' and condensed them into single cell in a new collective CA,
<br />
making whole CAs relate to each other ...and so on... to an arbitrary
<br />
depth, you can get an idea of where I'm headed.
<br />
====================================================
<br />
<br />STEP 2:  Ontological demarcation (notional virtual cells)
<br />
<br />In EC, if there is a chunk of noumenon that I would wish to depict I can
<br />
draw a completely fictional CLOSED boundary around any subset of U(.), say
<br />
X(.) and define its relationship to U(.) thus:
<br />
<br />U(.) = X(.) |+| NOTX(.)                      (1)
<br />
<br />NOTES:
<br />
1) |+| must be regarded as messy/complex.
<br />
2) |+| must be regarded not as addition, but SURGICAL RESECTION or JOINING
<br />
3) |+| includes all entropy in and out of X(.).
<br />
4) |+| is to be thought of as a 2 way interchange over a notional
<br />
boundary.
<br />
5) INPUTS to X(.) are OUTPUTS from NOTX(.). If X(.) was a human then |+|
<br />
includes inputs (food/water/photons/heat/potential/kinetic energy,
<br />
impacting nuetrinos, cosmic rays, everything)
<br />
6) OUTPUTS from X(.) are INPUTS to NOTX(.) waste material, heat energy,
<br />
phonons, kinetic energy dissapation, potnetial energy reliquishment and so
<br />
on).
<br />
7) |+|, despite all the above complexity, mentally can be conceptualised
<br />
as addition. Just a very very messy addition.
<br />
8) X(.) and NOTX(.), like U(.) are NOT abstractions. They are pointers to
<br />
real EC entities just like U(.)
<br />
9) boundary CLOSURE makes the whole system lossless in an entropy sense.
<br />
This means that |+|, as a 'joining' of X(.) and NOTX(.)
<br />
<br />10) The reality of EC is such that the |+| is NOT POSSIBLE! In other words:
<br />
&nbsp;X(.) cannot exist without NOTX(.). There is no real boundary. No real
<br />
separation. At the same time U(.) is not a continuum in the
<br />
spatial/mathematical abstraction sense, although for practical empirical
<br />
purposes, because of the sheer deth of the structure, it can be regarded
<br />
as a continuum at certain scales.
<br />
<br />11) 'fundamental building blocks are IMPOSSIBLE in EC. Fundamental
<br />
building blocks means that there exists X(.) and NOTX(.) for which no |+|
<br />
exists. This assumption is the 'biggee' about which science is curently
<br />
deluded.
<br />
<br />12) Having said (11) the 'axioms' are in fact 'fundamental'... but &quot;the
<br />
ways of the turtles&quot; offers a way out of this - which will become apparent
<br />
later (I hope!)
<br />
=============================================
<br />
<br />NEXT STEP:
<br />
I am going at this TOP-DOWN. When that is done the 'bottom up' axiomatic
<br />
beginnings will emerge. I hope. On route towards an empirically testable
<br />
outcome we'll look at what happens when X(.) is considered to be a human
<br />
and how to depict a human including all the layers of nested hierarchy
<br />
that we see as brain material. I'll also introduce a 'being' operator.
<br />
<br />We can later look at COMP equivalence at any level of what I have called
<br />
in the past 'Turing Granularity'. A bit like what Chalmers did in his
<br />
'silicon replacement' zombie thought experiments....Except at multiple
<br />
scales. At some point consciousness will be effected/affected. This will
<br />
be COMP replacement instead of silicon. Bruno(COMP)-granularity? :-)
<br />
======================================================
<br />
<br />Over to you. On with the fun.
<br />
<br />Colin Hales
