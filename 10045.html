&lt;snip, sorry&gt; 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'd say it's the other way around.  Self-awareness can't appear without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness.  My dog is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious in that he knows his name and he knows he's different from my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wife's dog, whose name he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; also knows.  But I don't think he has the reflexive self-awareness of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; human being, an &quot;inner
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; narrative&quot;.  I don't see how you could have self-awareness without being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious, but I'm often conscious without being self-aware.

<br />The obscuring factor here is of the two sorts of self awareness that might
<br />
benefit from elaboration. 
<br />
<br />First is the collection of phenomenal fields (the visual field, for
<br />
example). The scenes they provide in our head are centered on us as
<br />
cognitive agents. The emotion of thirst, for example, is an Omni
<br />
directional, isotropic, homogenous scene (you don't get thirsty in front or
<br />
behind!, its uniform and spherically delivered.). The visual scene is highly
<br />
anisotropic and inhomogenous.
<br />
<br />The 'self' in phenomenal scenes is implicit in that the scene is constructed
<br />
to appear to be centred on us. But beyond that _within_ the scene can be a
<br />
representation of our own body, once again appropriately delivered centred.
<br />
Out of body experiences are when the scene centering system gets moved. We
<br />
may then get an entirely different depiction of our complete self and still
<br />
know (in the sense to follow below) that it is 'me', my 'self'.
<br />
<br />Secondly, completely separate to the phenomenal scenes, but generated from
<br />
them via the action of extracting perceived regularities (what the brain
<br />
does really well) is knowledge. This knowledge is only made apparent in
<br />
behaviour - even such simple behaviour as the reporting of a belief (such as
<br />
recognition of a name). Within the complete collection of beliefs (which are
<br />
entirely devoid of phenomenal content) is a set of beliefs about &quot;self&quot; to
<br />
an arbitrary level of complexity.
<br />
<br />a) Phenomenal awareness (experience inclusive of a self model)
<br />
And
<br />
b) Psychological awareness (knowledge inclusive of a self model)
<br />
<br />The latter is derived from the former.
<br />
Call them primary and secondary self awareness? Dunno.
<br />
<br />As to what 'consciousness' might be?
<br />
<br />I'd say that if a cognitive agent has (a) at all then consciousness is
<br />
present, regardless of the self-representation and regardless of the extent
<br />
of (b).
<br />
<br />Conversely, no matter how complex a cognitive agent's (b) is and regardless
<br />
of the complexity of the self model.... a creature devoid of (a) is a
<br />
zombie.... deserved of the status of a household appliance. No matter how
<br />
complex a self model there is in (b) the creature has zero internal life. It
<br />
does not know it is anywhere. It may to some extent be able to act 'as-if'
<br />
it had an internal life, but it's just acting - an attribution bestowed by a
<br />
non-zombie with some (a).
<br />
<br />By the way...the physiological evidence for this division is summarised
<br />
nicely in a 'consciousness studies' context in a recent book by Derek Denton
<br />
which tracks primordial emotions out of the neo-cortex into small neural
<br />
cohorts in the ancient basal brain structures. Primordial emotions are the
<br />
emotions of internal body life-support such as breathlessness, hunger etc.
<br />
Creatures without a neo-cortex can have (a) with minimal (b) and therefore
<br />
have experiences and are conscious, just not very conscious. No self model
<br />
necessary, just minimal reflex behaviour.
