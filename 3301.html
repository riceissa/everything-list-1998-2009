<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Better go back and look up the word &quot;religion&quot; again.
</em><br />
<br />KSR:
<br />
I'm pretty comfortable with the English language, but I looked it up anyway. 
<br />
I stand by my definition.
<br />
<br />I've never found a spiritual system that did not proffess to tell the truth 
<br />
about existance from the macro to the micro. The role of religion is to 
<br />
explain universal truths, and ask that we act accordingly.
<br />
<br />Prophets describe our place in the cosmos by explaining universal
<br />
principles. Fundamentalists of all sorts are in conflict with the modern 
<br />
world because universal principles are increasingly scientific, secular, and 
<br />
physically practical. Old school religions are losing market share to the 
<br />
modern world. But the modern world does not offer a unified system of belief 
<br />
describing our place in the universe.
<br />
<br />RW:
<br />
I think this is an uneducated conclusion. That is if you continue to 
<br />
misuse&gt;the term &quot;religion&quot; in a consistent fashion.
<br />
<br />KSR:
<br />
Uneducated? Au contraire! These are carefull observations, and commonly 
<br />
reflected by others. If you study this topic at all, you will have noticed 
<br />
consistant repetitions across many disciplines, i'e anthropology, political 
<br />
science, sociology, demographics...
<br />
<br />RW:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The creation of old-world dogma was for the benefit of the young souls
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that by virtue of their own mis-expression, demanded a harsh dogma and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;religious expression to find their way back to god.
</em><br />
<br />KSR:
<br />
No. Harsh dogma is originally a survival strategy. Ethics is the economics 
<br />
of self preservation. Jews and Moslems forbid eating pig because of 
<br />
parasites in the meat. The Golden Rule, &quot;do unto others as you would like to 
<br />
be done,&quot; is basic self preservation. Years later, original reasons for 
<br />
dogma become obsolete through sanitation or cultural evolution. 
<br />
Simultaneously, over time the prophets' messages ossify into rote ritual. 
<br />
Fundamentalists have lost the meaning behind the message. The wisdom of a 
<br />
prophet's words are in the background, not the surface. It is analogy. But 
<br />
the symbolism used to make the original point gets buried by lost context or 
<br />
archaic metaphores. And so fools cling to what is in their hand, which is 
<br />
the bald statement, bleached of symbolic truth.
<br />
<br />RW:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The spiritual principles that these &quot;old school religions&quot; as you put it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are&gt;based&gt;on are just as valid today as they were then. Similar in concept 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to&gt;saying: electromagnetism was&gt;just as valid back then as it is today.
</em><br />
<br />KSR:
<br />
Yes. Spiritual principles are eternal, if they are true in the first place.
<br />
<br />RW:
<br />
-Those that cooperate and spontaneously express spiritual law out of love of 
<br />
others
<br />
<br />KSR:
<br />
Agreed. Some people, probably most people, are unable to expand their self 
<br />
concept to include much of the world beyond themselves. The message of the 
<br />
prophets is that it is all you.
<br />
<br />RW:
<br />
most&gt;of these &quot;modern worlders&quot; are rebelling against the spiritual in favor 
<br />
of the&gt;self in the&gt;world.
<br />
<br />KSR:
<br />
Intelligent &quot;modern worlders&quot; don't rebell against the spiritual in favor of 
<br />
the self (though they will lapse, like anyone). But they may rebel against 
<br />
what doesnt make sense to them. It is hard to sell a 5,000 year old God to 
<br />
someone who knows rudimentary physics. Physicists who understand vast 
<br />
swathes of contemporary physics are sometimes so awed by the scale that they 
<br />
start to believe again in higher power. But it is rarely the same God that 
<br />
they left.
