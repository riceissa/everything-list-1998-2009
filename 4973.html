Hi Eric,
<br />
<br />You are asking important questions which have been discussed by this 
<br />
group but to which imo, no satisfactory answer was given.
<br />
<br />First I'll widen the problem to place it in context. I can think of at 
<br />
least five ways that QM manifest itself:
<br />
1) Quantum Randomness
<br />
2) Spooky action at a distance
<br />
3) Superposition
<br />
4) Coherence/Decoherence
<br />
5) Interference
<br />
<br />The first two phenomena, randomness,and spooky action at a distance can 
<br />
easily be expained by many-worlds and COMP.
<br />
<br />1) Randomness:
<br />
A quantum die appears to be random because when it is thrown, all the 
<br />
faces come up, but, because of the many-worlds we can observe only one 
<br />
face.
<br />
<br />2) Spooky action at a distance
<br />
When a quantum phenomena appears to invove spooky action at a distance, 
<br />
there  is no action at all but an old magic trick. When a distant 
<br />
observer, makes his observation, the universe (or himself) has already 
<br />
split and his observation is just a confirmation of which branch his 
<br />
consciousness has followed. The rabbit is already in the hat before the 
<br />
beginning of the trick.
<br />
<br />The last three phenomena cannot be explained so easily with many worlds 
<br />
+COMP because they involve the simultaneous and possibly interfering 
<br />
existence of several worlds. It is as if our consciousness occupies 
<br />
simultaneously a multiplicity of &quot;classical?&quot; worlds. In fact it appears 
<br />
that for consciousness to exists it MUST span several &quot;classical?&quot; worlds.
<br />
<br />In other words, simply assuming the plenitude, filled with a 
<br />
multiplicity of observer moments, is not sufficient to explain 
<br />
superposition, coherence/decoherence and interference. As consciousness 
<br />
experiences its own propagation from one observer moment to another 
<br />
observer moment, it is constrained by interference. Why is this 
<br />
necessary? There is another layer besides many-worlds, and COMP. What in 
<br />
the nature of consciousness makes such a layer important?

<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I think this discussion might have already took place
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;here, but I would like to take you opinions on this.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;How do we define (de)coherence? What makes interference
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;happen or be lost?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Take the a double-slit-like experiment. A particle can take
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;two paths, A and B. We can in principle detect which path
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the particle went through.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Suppose we can make the detecting apparatus 'non-interfering'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;enough so that the particle is not grossly deflected by the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;detection, but can still reach the screen. We know that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;result of this thought-experiment is that interference does not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;happen.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The first answer is that the paths have 'decohered'. But what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;exactly does that mean? In a MWI perspective, I like the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;explanation that the two universes A and B are different by a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;large number of particles: the electrons in a wire, which carry
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the amplified pulse of the detector, which then reach a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computer, and such and such. Something of the order of 10^23
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;particles have changed state.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now suppose we use some kind of very slow detector. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;detection is made by, say, a very slow process such that not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;many particles (suppose only one particle, even though I don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;know how to make that detector) change their state before the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interfering particle reaches the screen. After that, we can amplify
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this information and know which path the particle went through.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Again, I believe interference would not be possible. But it is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;little harder to say why.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Before anyone says that *some* other particle has changed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;state, and that should be enough for the decoherence, suppose
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;now an experiment with a charged particle, say, an electron.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;We make it go through paths A and B by steering it with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;magnetic fields. Certainly, it has interacted with *something*,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ot it could not be steered. It interacted with the photons of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;EM field, or in last analysis, with the electrons that are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;generating it. We could use electric fields, so that the interaction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is more evident. On the other hand, a photon being reflected
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;by a mirror is also interacting with something, but that does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not prevent the interference from happening, as is well known.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Therefore interaction by itself does not cause decoherence.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;And if it is just a large number of particles changing state that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;does, then what is the threshold? Would an experiment with a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;few-particle-delayed-detector as described above allow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interference? Or is it the 'information' that causes decoherence?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If that is the case, how does one define 'information'?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
