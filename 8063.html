<br />Please, read what I say. In this list everybody knows that I insist  
<br />
that comp (I am a machine) entails that there is no primitive  
<br />
&quot;physical worlds&quot;, and that the appearance of a &quot;physical world&quot;  
<br />
should be non computational. It is the (comp) white rabbits. Reality  
<br />
is full of non-computable processes.  &quot;I am computational&quot; entails  
<br />
that what I see should be non computational *a priori*, but then, by  
<br />
taking the incompleteness phenomenon into account, the reasoning  
<br />
inherit nuances from theoretical computer science. I have already sum  
<br />
up this by the slogan: [Me = a machine] entails [Not me, as seen by  
<br />
me, ­ all machines].
<br />
This is comprehensible only if you understand the difference between  
<br />
notions of first and third person point of view. It would be far  
<br />
easier to follow the 8 steps proof (instead of inferring and  
<br />
attributing propositions I have never made).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  The case of the general NON-computability of the results of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; individual measurements
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  is somewhat more grievious than all of these because, not only QM  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does not in general
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  compute them (but computes their statistical distributions quite  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generally) but because we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  know that NO other conceivable local theory does compute them and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; furthermore,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  no other such theory computes their distribution as well as QM! In  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fact the only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  other &quot;mechanistic&quot; (non-local) theories that can claim to compute  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anything like the QM distibutions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  must contain &quot;faster-than-light&quot; propagations and other features  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that violate other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  well supported physical theories! This later result was proved by  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; George Svetlichny
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but I am sure you know the link so I need not include it.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You make wrong inferences at each paragraph! But in any case nothing  
<br />
you allude to is relevant for the understanding that comp implies the  
<br />
reversal physics/computer-science/number-theory/machine-theology/ 
<br />
&lt;call-it-like-you-want&gt;.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I wrote &quot;compute&quot; above where I would normaly write &quot;predict&quot;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because physical theories
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  are really analogue algorithms for computing predictions. Turing  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machines are very general
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  (but very slow and ineficient) ways of discretizing and encoding  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such algorithms and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  implementing them in special physical systems called digital  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computers to generate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  approximate predictions. This means that no UTM, no UD or UDA or  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any model of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  digital computation (or any physical, calssical or quantum  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computer by that matter)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that is CT equivalent to them, can compute what QM cannot!
</em><br />
<br /><br />Of course. We know this since Deutsch wrote his fundamental paper on  
<br />
quantum universal machine.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So if your UDA produces a &quot;huge amount of non-locality&quot; (whatever that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  means) I can only understand that as meaning that it computes  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (predicts) a whole lot less
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than QM and so, why should I care for it anyway?
</em><br />
<br /><br />This is an interesting and hard question. Now, and this is not a  
<br />
coincidence, I think that the easiest and shorter explanation follows  
<br />
directly by the seventh first step of the UDA reasoning. The non- 
<br />
locality and the indeterminacy (and its measure) will be first person  
<br />
(plural) notion (subjective in the sense of Everett). In case UDA's  
<br />
non locality is provably different from the testable non-locality of  
<br />
our &quot;empirical&quot; most probable computational history, then we are  
<br />
done, comp, in the way I make it precise, would be refuted. But when  
<br />
we replace the YD type of grandmother intuition by the possible  
<br />
discourse of the self-referentially classical sound sufficiently rich  
<br />
Universal machine (alias the lobian machine), it appears that the  
<br />
intuitive grandmother indeterminacy inherits a mathematical  
<br />
structures constrained enough to derive, currently, the propositional  
<br />
physics (the logic of yes/no answer). Results have been obtained that  
<br />
this move leads to &quot;some&quot; quantum logic. What form of non-locality?  
<br />
Open problem. But precise enough to be formulated in a decidable theory.
<br />
We care because the UD argument and its translation offer us a nice  
<br />
alternative by providing a test which either indirectly refute comp  
<br />
or give us an explanation of the origin of (propositional) physics,  
<br />
by traditional &quot;natural&quot; science use of OCCAM. In both case we will  
<br />
learn something which matters for tackling fundamental questions.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I know this sounds &quot;didatic&quot; but so do you when you run out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of arguments and send people to your papers
</em><br />
<br /><br />You are still making inference. And negative one. From this I could  
<br />
quasi-deduce that you have some negative prejudices. This is rather  
<br />
paradoxical given that we agree!!!  (Well, at the grandmother  
<br />
intuitive level). You believe comp is false (by believing YD false),  
<br />
and apparently you believe in some material reality, which is indeed  
<br />
incompatible (explicatively empty) with comp.
<br />
You should actually appreciate my showing that comp &quot;eliminates&quot; all  
<br />
the physicalist token-substances, given that by believing in that  
<br />
physicalism, it makes you wise to be skeptical on YD. Then I can  
<br />
understand you fear a little bit more the formal elimination of the  
<br />
YD, through the lobian interview, which already retrieve a non  
<br />
trivial propositional physics which until now has confirmed comp and  
<br />
the quantum. You need just to thrust you own belief: if you are right  
<br />
the comp physics will be different from the empirical comp, and we  
<br />
will have precise rational reason to doubt YD. But from what I have  
<br />
derived so far I am already astonished of the resemblance with QM.
<br />
So the reason why you have that negative attitude is a partial  
<br />
mystery. Those who are *really shocked&quot; by (just) the UDA reversal  
<br />
are the very many who believe strongly in both YD *and*  in the  
<br />
primitiveness of some material substances (more or less the  
<br />
materialists, naturalists, physicalists).
<br />
Mmh... Well, I see the problem, with your suspicion against YD, you  
<br />
should love UDA, and then it is all normal to hate AUDA (the lobian  
<br />
interview) because it shows that the apparently totally insane  
<br />
conclusion of UDA is not only consistent but also necessary, in some  
<br />
sense. And if comp is true comp is equivalent with QM (or some of its  
<br />
possibly corrected updated version), providing a conceptually simpler  
<br />
explanation of why machines develop beliefs, knowledge, hope, but why  
<br />
its observable and sharable parts take the shape of the mathematical  
<br />
physical laws.
<br />
I don't understand either why you don't appreciate I refer to my  
<br />
papers. Note that I have given more explanations on-line on the list.  
<br />
In case Escribe works again you can search on the author's name:  
<br />
marchal, marchal bruno, bruno marchal, etc. Look at the links in the  
<br />
archive. But if you want we can do the UDA step b y step, or even the  
<br />
AUDA (in case you are willing to study some mathematical logic books).
