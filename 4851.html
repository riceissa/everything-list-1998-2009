<br />A mind bending question. Greetings, James.
<br />
<br />My argument includes the notion that from the perspective of our 
<br />
universe the big bang took time to occur within, not everything 
<br />
popped into existence simultaneously. The dominant &quot;force&quot; was the 
<br />
attempt of the meta universe to restore its zero energy imbalance 
<br />
that the way virtual particles had distributed themselves (in the 
<br />
meta universe and quite by chance) had caused to go in to imbalance. 
<br />
That force was predominantly being expressed as a near infinite rate 
<br />
of expansion (a very high acceleration). At first the rate was 
<br />
expanding faster than the speed of light and nearly all the virtual 
<br />
particles were being immediately returned to the meta universe.
<br />
<br />But due to the quirky laws of quantum mechanics not all particles 
<br />
were being immediately returned, some stuck around long enough that 
<br />
the force of gravity came into existence. As the birth continued an 
<br />
ever increasing value of gravity resulted. Gravity is locally 
<br />
stronger than the inflationary force, it slowed the expansion rate 
<br />
down. But expansion continued regardless, at a decreasing rate.
<br />
<br />But the affect of gravity is dependant upon distance. As particles 
<br />
receded from each other, like dots on the surface of an inflating 
<br />
balloon, gravity had less and less effect upon neighbour particles.
<br />
<br />Once distance between particles became great enough then the force of 
<br />
expansion again became dominant, and the universe again began to 
<br />
expand and at an ever increasing rate. It is apparently continuing to 
<br />
do so. In our case the number of particles that were ultimately given 
<br />
birth to seems to indicate that our universe will never experience a 
<br />
big crunch (else inflation would not be occurring).
<br />
<br />So there was no counter force to expansion, it was only a matter of 
<br />
relativity, the number of particles that came into being, how fast 
<br />
they were coming into being, and the ultimate number of how many came 
<br />
into being. The big bang happened in spurts, it didn't happen all at 
<br />
once.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Are we do believe that this 'dark matter' which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is out there 'increasing acceleration' is also 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; responsible for the phase of 'decelerating
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; acceleration' that had to have been in place 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prior to the current cosmological era??!
</em><br />
<br />It is dark energy (DE) that is responsible for the exansion of the 
<br />
universe. I argue that it is not really energy as we know the term, 
<br />
but sort of a potential for energy in our universe to be returned to 
<br />
the meta universe from which it came. The potential results in 
<br />
eventual heat death of our universe at some finite time, and at that 
<br />
time there is no measurable difference between our universe and the 
<br />
meta universe (which has always been at heat death) and they are both 
<br />
really the same object.
<br />
<br />Black holes are always shrinking to a singularity, effectively 
<br />
increasing distance between themselves and everything else that 
<br />
exists in our universe. A black hole is just a localized area of 
<br />
space/time inflation. That concept is important.
<br />
<br />The matter that goes into a black hole becomes energy returned to the 
<br />
meta-universe. What remains is not a &quot;black hole&quot; as we think of one 
<br />
being, but a sort of energy potential portal into the meta-universe. 
<br />
These portals are what exhibit the affect that is being labeled dark 
<br />
matter (DM). It's an attraction by the meta-universe, its attempt to 
<br />
reclaim its zero energy balance. It is no different than dark energy, 
<br />
they are one and the same and they only appear to be different 
<br />
depending upon your relative viewpoint. They are both just different 
<br />
expressions of the ever increasing rate of inflation of the universe.
