<br />
Recent dialogues with Russell, plus discovering and finding helpful
<br />
previous joining posts, prompts me to post this for reference
<br />
purposes.
<br />
<br />I was born in 1950 in Glasgow Scotland of Anglo-Scottish parents, and
<br />
come from Hungarian, Middle Eastern, Russian, and Polish ancestry
<br />
insofar as I can trace it.  Mixed, anyway.
<br />
<br />My formal academic background is also best described as 'mixed', but
<br />
early on I always felt a bit inadequate compared to my teachers, who
<br />
seemed to just 'know' the 'answers' somehow, because they wrote them
<br />
straight on to the blackboard.  Myself, I had to 'puzzle' them out by
<br />
something like trial and error.  Also, their 'explanations' seemed to
<br />
lead only to more questions.  This exasperated my teachers.  One day
<br />
(I guess I must have been about 9)  I read a book of logic problems
<br />
that not only contained the answers, but the author's account of how
<br />
he'd reached them.  Turns out he'd used trial and error!  I remember
<br />
it dawned on me like a bolt of lightning: &quot;Everybody thinks like
<br />
this!&quot;  And thus reassured, I went on in this way.
<br />
<br />There's a corollary to this tale.  Many years later, I attended a
<br />
seminar where the neuroscientist Karl Pribram was the principal
<br />
presenter.  I was so stimulated by the dialogue that I 'kidnapped' him
<br />
afterwards by giving him a lift to the house where we'd both been
<br />
invited to dinner.  As he sat wearily in the passenger seat, I rambled
<br />
on about this and that, and after a while this led to my 'sharing' my
<br />
great 'Everybody thinks like that' insight.  &quot;You're wrong.&quot; he said,
<br />
and sank back into torpor.  My heart sank.  Then he sighed, and said:
<br />
&quot;Only people who can think at all, think like that.&quot;
<br />
<br />My professional career spans 35+ years in computer systems development
<br />
in the private sector, from machine code and plug-board days, through
<br />
assembler and a wide variety of high-level languages.   The hands-on
<br />
part spanned more than 20 years and I worked originally in commercial
<br />
applications development for systems vendors, focusing on elements of
<br />
operating systems and failure and recovery methods.  I developed early
<br />
versions of 'net-change' manufacturing planning and forecasting
<br />
systems, and from 1989, was an early participant in the nascent on-
<br />
line (originally phone-based) retail financial sector. I became Head
<br />
of Systems Architecture and Head of Information Analysis for the first
<br />
UK on-line bank, and Head of IT for an on-line retail insurer.  These
<br />
days, I do part time IT and business consultancy, and dabble in topics
<br />
like those on this list.  I've now achieved the status I've always
<br />
sought: self-employed dilettante.
<br />
<br />I can't recall exactly when my interest in AI and 'mind body' issues
<br />
began, but it was re-stimulated by John Searle's ideas as presented in
<br />
the 1984 BBC Reith Lectures, which got me furiously thinking and
<br />
reading about functionalism and then-current mind-brain theories like
<br />
Pribram's Holonomic theory.  I reached a vague realisation that
<br />
functionalism was incompatible with materialism, which is why I had a
<br />
start of recognition when I encountered Bruno's arguments.  But I've
<br />
really spent the intervening period just 'dilettanting' around the
<br />
related areas - philosophy of mind, epistemology, QM, cosmology,
<br />
Darwinism, etc. - as my enthusiasm and energy waxes and wanes.
<br />
<br />I've read or skimmed quite a lot of the book list others have
<br />
mentioned, but definitely need more rigour on the math and logic
<br />
background.  The existence of forums like this one has more or less
<br />
kept my marriage intact when it might not have survived many further
<br />
attempts to 'innocently' subvert ordinary conversations into
<br />
'epistomology' or some such nonsense.
<br />

<br />
