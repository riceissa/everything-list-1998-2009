<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; theory.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, in principle there still should be an infinite number of theories,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; starting with &quot;the data is completely random and just happens to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; look lawful by sheer coincidence&quot;.  I think the difficulty we have in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; finding new ones is that we are implicitly looking for small ones, which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; means that we implicitly believe in Occam's Razor, which means that we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implicitly adopt something like the Universal Distribution, a priori.
</em><br />
<br />An intriguing way of putting it; yes, the amount of data compression
<br />
possible is necessarily related to both Occam's Razor and the UDist.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; We begin with an intuitive physics that is hardwired into us by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; evolution.  And that includes mathematics and logic.  There's an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; excellent little book on this, &quot;The Evolution of Reason&quot; by Cooper.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No doubt this is true.  But there are still two somewhat-related problems.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One is, you can go back in time to the first replicator on earth, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think of its evolution over the ages as a learning process.  During this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time it learned this &quot;intuitive physics&quot;, i.e. mathematics and logic.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But how did it learn it?  Was it a Bayesian-style process?  And if so,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what were the priors?  Can a string of RNA have priors?
</em><br />
<br />I would say that the current state of the RNA string at any
<br />
given time can be regarded as its prior. After all, it survived
<br />
up to now, eh? The idea that evolution has to be pretty conservative,
<br />
---that is, the mechanisms must not allow too many new guesses---
<br />
also follows at once.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And more abstractly, if you wanted to design a perfect learning machine,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one that makes observations and optimally produces theories based on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them, do you have to give it prior beliefs and expectations, including
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; math and logic?  Or could you somehow expect it to learn those?  But to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; learn them, what would be the minimum you would have to give it?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm trying to ask the same question in both of these formulations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; On the one hand, we know that life did it, it created a very good (if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perhaps not optimal) learning machine.  On the other hand, it seems like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it ought to be impossible to do that, because there is no foundation.
</em><br />
<br />I strongly urge you to read the new book &quot;What is Thought&quot;, by 
<br />
Eric Baum. He very insightfully and carefully attends to these
<br />
questions.
<br />
<br />Lee
