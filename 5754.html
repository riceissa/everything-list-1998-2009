<br />Yes, this is true, and I believe Tipler threw it in as an afterthought in 
<br />
his book. The question arises, however, why would you bother with such an 
<br />
elaborate mechanism for immortality as the OP theory if the MWI of QM is 
<br />
correct? The MWI ensures immortality through an infinite number of possible 
<br />
scenarios which collectively must be far more likely than Omega Point.

I'm sure everyone is familiar with the ancient philosophical argument that 
<br />
time and space must be quantized, because if they were not you could never 
<br />
get to a determined point in space or time given that the distance left to 
<br />
travel could be infinitely divided in two...
<br />

<br />
<br />Actually, I thing that this argument (Zeno) came about because the ancient 
<br />
Greeks did not have any concept of an infinite series which converges to a 
<br />
finite value. There is a related argument, however: if reality is analogue, 
<br />
then any physical parameter would require an infinite number of 
<br />
non-repeating decimal places to describe it exactly. This would mean that 
<br />
what appears to be a finite system, such as an analogue voltmeter measuring 
<br />
a voltage, actually contains an infinite amount of information, which is 
<br />
absurd. Therefore, physical reality must be digital rather than analogue at 
<br />
the finest level.
<br />
<br />I am not sure where I first heard the above argument, and I am not sure 
<br />
about the absurdity of an infinite amount of information being contained in 
<br />
finite system.

light reflected from a real object will produce a pixelated image,
albeit far more finely grained than the image on any computer screen.
The Bekenstein Bound sets an upper limit to the amount of information
that can be contained in a given volume, or a lower limit to how finely
grained an object or its representation can be. Everything is digital;
analogue is an illusion.

Perhaps mathematics, which is digital, is incapable of precise
simulation of
    <br>
reality, which is not digital.

    <br>
There has been some discussion in recent posts about Tipler's Omega
Point
    <br>
theory, which postulates that an infinite amount of subjective time can
be
    <br>
squeezed into the last few moments of a collapsing universe. This is
    <br>
straightforward mathematically using infinite series, but if time is
    <br>
quantised, it would not work in reality; and it seems to be widely
accepted
    <br>
that time is indeed quantised. Is there a way around this difficulty?
