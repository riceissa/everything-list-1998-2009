- Italo Calvino -
<br />
<br />'Invisible Cities' (1972)
<br />
<br />VI, Cities and the sky.
<br />
<br />In Eudossia, that extends up and low, with meandering alleys, steps, narrow
<br />
lanes, hovels, a carpet is kept in which you can contemplate the real shape
<br />
of the city. At first nothing seems to resemble less Eudossia than the
<br />
design of the carpet, ordered in symmetrical figures that repeat their
<br />
patterns along straight and circular lines, woven of needleful of dazzling
<br />
colors, which alternating wefts you can follow all along the warp. But if
<br />
you stop to observe it with attention, you perceive that to every place of
<br />
the carpet corresponds a place of the city and that all the things contained
<br />
in the city are comprised in the design, arranged according to their true
<br />
relationships, which escape to your eye distracted from the coming and going
<br />
from the swarming from the awful crush. All the confusion in Eudossia, the
<br />
bray of the mules, the spots of lamp-black, the smell of fish, is what
<br />
appear in the partial perspective that you pick; but the carpet proves that
<br />
there is a point from which the city shows its true proportions, the
<br />
geometric outline implicit in its every minimal detail.
<br />
<br />Getting lost in Eudossia is easy: but when you concentrates staring the
<br />
carpet you recognize the road that you were looking for in a crimson or
<br />
indigo or amaranth thread that through a long round lets you enter in a
<br />
purple fence that is your true point of arrival. Every inhabitant of
<br />
Eudossia confronts to the immovable order of the carpet his own image of the
<br />
city, an anguish, and everyone can find hidden between the arabesques an
<br />
answer, the story of his life, the twists of his destiny.
<br />
<br />An oracle was consultated about the mysterious relationship between two such
<br />
different objects as the carpet and the city. One of the two objects, - it
<br />
was the response, - has the shape that the gods gave to the starry sky and
<br />
to the orbits around which the worlds spin; the other one is an approximate
<br />
glare, like every human work.
<br />
<br />The augurs since so long were sure that the harmonic design of the carpet
<br />
was of divine nature; in this sense the oracle was interpreted, without
<br />
giving place to controversies. But in the same way you can draw the opposite
<br />
conclusion: that the real map of the universe is the city of Eudossia as it
<br />
is, a spot that spreads without shape, with zigzag roads, houses collapsing
<br />
above one another in the dust, fires, cries in the dark.
