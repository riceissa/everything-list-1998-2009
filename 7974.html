Hi Hal,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not sure I can give you much feed back on what you advance below 
<br />
because these go
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;well beyond the little I understand about these questions of 
<br />
metaphysics. In general I think you can
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;strech some of conventional definitions in order to find out where 
<br />
that gets you but if you try
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;and strech all of them at once you risk not knowing what you are 
<br />
talking about anymore.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll give it a shot but please forgive me where I can't really say 
<br />
much...

<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;Hi Hal,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; My first comment was directed at your previous sentence which read &gt; 
</em><br />
something like: &quot;The list of course would have properties that seem &gt; 
<br />
incompatible as simultaneous properties of a single object, but &gt; 
<br />
nevertheless definitions create such objects as the &quot;is not&quot; member of 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; the definitional pair. So the All is - in total - self incompatible, 
</em><br />
but &gt; so what? &quot; I thought, from it, that you meant to say that your 
<br />
Everything &gt; list contains contradictory attributions like &quot;X is a car&quot; 
<br />
and &quot;X is not &gt; a car&quot; for the same X. I obviously
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;misunderstood you.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;[HR]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;The distinction is between existence and reality. While the whole list 
<br />
is taken as existing the assumption does not hold that every &quot;is&quot; and 
<br />
&quot;is not&quot; definable object can also have reality. I find it difficult to 
<br />
accept some combinations of &quot;X is ***...&quot; and &quot;X is not ***...&quot; as 
<br />
being simultaneous properties of the same object that can have reality 
<br />
or of any of its sub components but &quot;round square&quot; is perhaps not so 
<br />
unacceptable. For example in a discrete point universe where for one of 
<br />
its components half the applicable points are arranged &quot;square&quot; and 
<br />
half &quot;round&quot; this being a state in some sort of transition sequence of 
<br />
states wherein that component goes from being round to being square. 
<br />
Now when this particular state has reality in a sequence of such states 
<br />
does it not contain a &quot;round square&quot;?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I see but again I caution you about the use of those words, &quot;reality&quot; 
<br />
and &quot;existence&quot;. I think the first one has been more in
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the province of physics and that is why Einstein gave himself the 
<br />
trouble of defining it as a &quot;metatheoretic term&quot;. Mathematicians, even 
<br />
the ones who are not ashamed of professing platonism, never actually 
<br />
give you a definition of their
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;platonic reality&quot; , since they don't quite believe they can map the 
<br />
whole realm of &quot;platonic forms&quot; or don't even believe
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;that can be done (as Godel insisted). They will however prove 
<br />
&quot;Existence&quot; and Non-Existence theorems about some of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;these objects that you can build from attributions such as your 
<br />
infamous &quot;round square&quot; (though I am not aware of
<br />
&nbsp;any proof concerning this particular ontological thorn).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I sympathize with the more &quot;liberal&quot; metaphysical point of view about 
<br />
what abstracta exist as defended, for example by
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ed Zalta following Meinong and Mally (check is humorous Metaphysics 
<br />
Research Lab at Stanford: <a href="http://mally.stanford.edu/">http://mally.stanford.edu/</a> )
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;though I don't agree with his view of mathematical objects in 
<br />
particular. So I would grant you &quot;a list&quot; of sorts even
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;containing &quot;fictional objects&quot; such as the round-square if you exclude 
<br />
&nbsp;from it any reference to physical objects. I just don't know how useful 
<br />
something like that would be....
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">  &gt; About your first assumption, as you restate above, I would venture 
</em><br />
to &gt; say that QM suggests that the existence of such list is very 
<br />
unlikely if &gt; by 'reality&quot; one understands &quot;physical reality&quot; as 
<br />
defined by EPR, that &gt; is, as composed by distinct elements
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; bearing properties that are independent of the means of observation 
</em><br />
used &gt; to assign them to such objects. This is the gist
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; of Einstein's famous question &quot;Is the moon there when nobody looks?&quot; 
</em><br />
and &gt; all that folklore.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[HR]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I am making a distinction between existence and reality. Reality is a 
<br />
transitory state that some definable objects can have. Further I think 
<br />
it is incorrect to try to exclusively argue from a very small sub set 
<br />
[sample] of the objects that can have reality - presumably the states 
<br />
of our universe - back to the system that embeds them.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, those (states of our universe) are exactly the objects whose 
<br />
reality attribution is more problematic! I am not sure
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;how to drive this point accross to you. There is a paper posted today 
<br />
in the phsyics arXiv that you may want to read as it is
<br />
&nbsp;exactly on this subject:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;<a href="http://arXiv.org/quant-ph/0508183">http://arXiv.org/quant-ph/0508183</a>
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[HR]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;If it turns out that quantum mechanics is part of the valid 
<br />
description of our universe [The issue is I believe an open one] then 
<br />
the embedding system should allow for that. This does not preclude 
<br />
other universes for which quantum mechanics is not part of the 
<br />
description.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I think it is hard to argue that QM is not a &quot;part of the valid 
<br />
description of our universe&quot; so I cannot agree with you above!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;All empirical indications, so far, are to the contrary. What is an 
<br />
open question is whether it is the ONLY valid part or whether it is the 
<br />
valid description of the WHOLE universe since we still lack one.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt;Now if by &quot;reality&quot; you mean
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; platonic reality, I think it is a good question whether such list 
</em><br />
may &gt; exist or not. You will have to ask a mathematician...
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[HR]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I am of the opinion that the line items on my list are just numbers. I 
<br />
believe that most participants in this venue would allow that &quot;Numbers 
<br />
exist&quot; is a possible starting point and that this is could be 
<br />
considered a type of Platonism. I just renamed numbers as &quot;properties&quot; 
<br />
so as to include all their interpretations [sets of other numbers].
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Here I don't fully understand you. I am willing to admit that numbers 
<br />
exist or that they have a reality that is independent of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;my own existence or yours but I think that means that &quot;numbers have 
<br />
properties&quot; rather than &quot;numbers are properties (of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;something else)&quot;; if I believe the latter I don't think I could claim 
<br />
to be a platonist...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt;(I am assuming it is contains an countable infinity of entries, no?)
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;[HR]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Well there is a difference between listing and counting. I may not be 
<br />
able to count the reals [at least in this universe] but I think a 
<br />
mathematician who allows for continuous dimensions in a 3D space will 
<br />
also allow that in such a space I can list the reals just by drawing a 
<br />
line segment of arbitrary length on a note pad. Since my list has no 
<br />
dimensionality restrictions I suspect it can be one for one with the 
<br />
continuum.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Hal Ruhl
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry Hal, I don't see very well how a list can be &quot;one-to-one with 
<br />
the continuum&quot;! That may be a default of my imagination...
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Regards,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Godfrey,
