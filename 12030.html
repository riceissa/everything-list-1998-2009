</em><br />
I certainly have a methodological problem with such an idea. This is 
<br />
due to my motivation in the subject. I am searching an explanation of 
<br />
what is a person, so assuming the existence of a person (any person, 
<br />
godlike or not) seems to me to beg the question.
<br />
The same reason explains why I don't assume a physical reality. This is 
<br />
because I'm interested in understanding where physical realities or 
<br />
their appearances comes from.
<br />
As a &quot;wanting to be a scientist in those matter&quot; I have to be agnostic 
<br />
at the start, if only methodologically.

<br />
Note also that the major critics by the neoplatonists on Aristotle, 
<br />
besides their diverging opinions on the nature of matter, is the 
<br />
non-person character of the big unnameable, but then for Plotinus the 
<br />
&quot;second God&quot; (the second primary hypostase is &quot;personal&quot;), and indeed 
<br />
G* has a personal aspect from the point of view of the machine. I agree 
<br />
(comp agree) with Plotinus  that the big first cannot be a person. The 
<br />
second one can. To be sure Plotinus is not always completely clear on 
<br />
that point (especially on his chapter on free-will).



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Numbers are impersonal.


</em><br />
You say so. Assuming comp we already have to accept that numbers can 
<br />
have personal features. Worst, by Godel &amp;Co. Numbers cannot not have 
<br />
personal (indexical) features relatively to each others. (cf the Wi and 
<br />
the Fi).



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; An impersonal origin results in everything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; finally being equal.


</em><br />
Why? This reminds me Smullyan describing two possible reactions of a 
<br />
human in front of the comp hyp:
<br />
1) The human does not trust himself and believes that machine are 
<br />
stupid at the start. His reaction about comp is: &quot;I am machine thus I 
<br />
am as stupid as a machine&quot;.
<br />
2) The human trust himself: his reaction with the comp hyp is &quot;Cute, it 
<br />
means machine can be as nice as me&quot;.




<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Only an infinite personal God is big enough to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; produce personality.


</em><br />
Even just applying Theaetetus' standard definition of the knower to the 
<br />
godel-lob predicate of provability gives rise to a genuine knower which 
<br />
is right in its non belief that he is a machine. (I have not said that 
<br />
he believes he is not a machine, I am just saying that he does not 
<br />
believe being a machine. careful because such a nuance is often 
<br />
dismissed).




<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Impersonal+complexity does not produce personal.


</em><br />
I would like to see a proof of that statement. The comp first person 
<br />
seems to me to be a counterexample, unless you assume at the start the 
<br />
negation of comp (and weaker-comp).



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is the problem Plato had.  He knew that you need absolutes in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; order to have meaning.  Plato's gods weren't big enough to be the point
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of reference needed to define a person.  The gods and fates were
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; continuously fighting one another.


</em><br />
You are right, but Plato did not know about Church thesis, or 
<br />
incompleteness.


<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I know you get some nice relative
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; forms, G*/G and all that.  But in the end it is all meaningless.


</em><br />
You are quite quick here. Why would machine's beliefs and hopes be 
<br />
meaningless?




<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Satre pointed out, no finite point has any meaning without an infinite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reference point.


</em><br />
I totally agree with Sartre's point here. Church thesis is exactly what 
<br />
gives an absolute infinite reference point.



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But this is all a relative faith, which ends up being faith in faith
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in...(?)  When talking about ultimate questions, a relative faith
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doesn't do.  When your life is on the line, an impersonal structure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just doesn't do.


</em><br />
This could be a reason for hoping, not for accepting a personal being 
<br />
*as an explanation*. Cautious: wishful thinking.


<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't want to commit my future to a machine.


</em><br />
Me too. But I do it when I take a plane, car, train, lift, etc.
<br />
I can imagine that tomorrow some people will accept an artificial brain 
<br />
just for being able to pray their God a little longer ...



<br />
In another post you said:


<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Everything that there is is there.  But this is the ultimate in begging
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the question. The question remains, why is everything (I see) there?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why do I exist?


</em><br />
We have to accept something, if only because we cannot explain prime 
<br />
numbers without accepting the numbers, then comp explains why numbers 
<br />
talk like if they were sensible person, like if they were not numbers, 
<br />
like if they believe in a physical reality and beyond.
<br />
And above all, G* explains why those beliefs are correct.
<br />
I can indeed sum up a part of the interview by: machine will correctly 
<br />
discover their unnameable self and G* will correctly prove that such a 
<br />
self is not a machine from the first and third person point of view.




<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Relative truth is ultimately useless when it comes to the end of my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; life.


</em><br />
I agree with you. It is really the discovery of Church thesis, which 
<br />
introduces a lot of &quot;absoluteness&quot; in math (Godel found this 
<br />
miraculous) that I have begin to take &quot;mathematicalism&quot; seriously.



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would paraphrase Brent Meeker and ask, &quot;Why does 'blind' have to be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; default?&quot;

</em><br />
If &quot;non blindness&quot; is introduced as an hypothesis, it will prevent at 
<br />
the start any possible impersonal (blind) explanation of &quot;vision&quot;. Like 
<br />
putting consciousness in the neuron for explaining consciousness in the 
<br />
brain: this does not explain consciousness. Not only this does not 
<br />
explain consciousness, but it makes the search of an explanation almost 
<br />
impossible.


<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My response to Bruno addresses the assumption of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; impersonality.

</em><br />
I'm not convinced. The assumption of a personal God, like the 
<br />
assumption of an impersonal physical universe, explains nothing. Imo. 
<br />
It explains neither mind nor matter, nor ... God.
<br />
Now, I have much more evidence---empirical and theoretical--- for a 
<br />
(probably impersonal and immaterial) God, than for a primitive 
<br />
impersonal physical universe, which I take to be a locally useful FAPP 
<br />
superstition which does not resist reflection and introspection, as I 
<br />
try to illustrate with machine's introspection.

<br />
Bruno
