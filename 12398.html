</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Of course: questions of personal meaning are not scientific questions. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Physics may show you how to build a nuclear bomb, but it won't tell 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; you whether you should use it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But Physics, per se,  is not supposed to answer this.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Socio-economics could give light, as could &quot;computer simulation of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nuclear explosion in cities ...&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And some (still putative) theory of ethics could perhaps put light on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that question too. Well, the ultimate decision is a problem for the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;president&quot; .... But the president and its advisers could consult some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; decision theory ... perhaps.
</em><br />
<br />No, those theories won't answer the question of whether you should use the 
<br />
bomb either. Suppose your theory says something like, &quot;if you wish to save a 
<br />
lives by taking b lives, where a&gt;b, then you should use the bomb&quot;. The scientific 
<br />
part of this theory involves demonstrating that, in fact, use of the bomb would 
<br />
save a lives by taking b lives. But this does not tell you whether you should actually 
<br />
use the bomb. Neither would an ethical theory like utilitarianism tell you what to 
<br />
do: it might confirm that according to the theory it is the right thing to do, but 
<br />
utilitarianism cannot tell you that utilitarianism is &quot;right&quot;. In the end, what is &quot;right&quot; 
<br />
is an irreducible personal belief, which you can try to change by appeal to emotions 
<br />
or by example, but not by appeal to logic or empirical facts. And in fact I feel much 
<br />
safer that way: if someone honestly believed that he knew what was &quot;right&quot; as surely 
<br />
as he knew 2+2=4, he would be a very dangerous person. Religious fanatics are not 
<br />
dangerous because they want to do evil, but because they want to do good. The number 
<br />
of people killed in the name of God vastly outnumbers the number killed in the name of 
<br />
Satan.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Where I think I disagree with you [Tom] is that you seem to want to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; reduce the irreducible and make values and personal meaning real world 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; objects, albeit not of the kind that can be detected by scientific 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; instruments, perhaps issued by God. But in proposing this you are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; swapping one irreducible entity extremely well-grounded in empirical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; evidence (I know I'm conscious, and I know that when my brain stops so 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; does my consciousness) for another irreducible entity with no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; grounding in empirical evidence whatsoever.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree that you know you are conscious. Well, I don't know that but I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have good evidences and hope. But I don't see any evidence that when 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your brain stops so does your consciousness. I can understand the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; belief (not even knowledge) that when your brain stops relatively to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mine (in case we share an history), then so does the possibility of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your consciousness to manifest itself relatively to me; but no more.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Actually what does mean the expression &quot;my brain stops&quot;. In all 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe? all multiverses, all computational histories ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You have to be precise which theory you are using when relating some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3-me (like &quot;my brain&quot;) and some 1-me (like the knower, the conscious 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;I&quot;).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree with some critics you make with respect to Tom Caylor notion of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; personal God, but sometimes, it seems to me, you have a conception of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality which could as criticable as Caylor's one.  Err... i see your 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particular point is valid though, but you are using misleading images 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with respect to the consequence of mechanism (I guess you are aware but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that you want to remain short perhaps).
</em><br />
<br />It gets cumbersome to qualify everything with &quot;given the appearance of a physical 
<br />
world&quot;. As I have said before, I am not entirely convinced that comp is true, precisely 
<br />
because because such ideas as a conscious computation supervening on any physical 
<br />
process or on no physical process may be considered absurd. It is quite possible, for 
<br />
example, that there is something special about the structure of the brain which leads 
<br />
to consciousness, and a digital computer will not be able to copy this, even if it copies 
<br />
3rd person observable behaviour. Against that idea is the question of why we didn't 
<br />
evolve to be zombies, but maybe we would have if nature had electronic circuits to 
<br />
play with. If I had to guess between comp and not-comp I don't think I could do better 
<br />
than flipping a coin.
