<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I am reopening an old thread ( more than a year old) which I found

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very intriguing. It leads to some startling conclusions.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  really define it, you will need at least to axiomatize it in some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  Here is my question. Do you agree that a first person is a knower, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  in that case, are you willing to accept the traditional axioms for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  knowing. That is:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  1) If p is knowable then p is true;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  2) If p is knowable then it is knowable that p is knowable;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  3) if it is knowable that p entails q, then if p is knowable then q 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  knowable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  (+ some logical rules).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Bruno, what or who do you mean by &quot;it&quot; in statements 2) and 3).
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />The same as in &quot;it is raining&quot;. I could have written 1. and 2. like
<br />
<br />1) knowable(p) -&gt; p
<br />
2) knowable(p) -&gt; knowable(knowable(p))
<br />
<br />In this way we can avoid using words like &quot;it&quot;, or even like &quot;true&quot;.  
<br />
&quot;p&quot; is a variable, and is implicitly universally quantified over. 
<br />
&quot;knowable(p) -&gt; p&quot; really means that whatever is the proposition p, if 
<br />
it is knowable then it is true. The false is unknowable (although it 
<br />
could be conceivable, believable, even provable (in inconsistent 
<br />
theory), etc. The &quot;p&quot; in 1. 2. and 3.  is really like the &quot;x&quot; in the 
<br />
formula (sin(x))^2 + (cos(x))^2 = 1.
<br />
<br />&quot;knowable(p) -&gt; p&quot; really means that we cannot know something false. 
<br />
This is coherent with the natural language use of know, which I 
<br />
illustrate often by remarking that we never say &quot;Alfred knew the earth 
<br />
is flat, but the he realized he was wrong&quot;. We say instead &quot;Alfred 
<br />
believed that earth is flat, but then ...&quot;. . The axiom 1. is the 
<br />
incorrigibility axiom: we can know only the truth. Of course we can 
<br />
believe we know something until we know better.
<br />
The axiom 2. is added when we want to axiomatize a notion of knowledge 
<br />
from the part of sufficiently introspective subject. It means that if 
<br />
some proposition is knowable, then the knowability of that proposition 
<br />
is itself knowable. It means that when the subject knows some 
<br />
proposition then the subject will know that he knows that proposition. 
<br />
The subject can know that he knows.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In addition, what do you mean by &quot;is knowable&quot;, &quot;is true&quot; and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;entails&quot;?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />All the point in axiomatizing some notion, consists in giving a way to 
<br />
reason about that notion without ever defining it. We just try to agree 
<br />
on some principles, like 1.,2., 3., and then derives things from those 
<br />
principles. Nuance can be added by adding new axioms if necessary.
<br />
Of course axioms like above are not enough, we have to use deduction 
<br />
rules. In case of the S4 theory, which I will rewrite with modal 
<br />
notation (hoping you recognize it). I write Bp for B(p) to avoid 
<br />
heaviness in the notation, likewize, I write BBp for B(B(p)).
<br />
<br />1) Bp -&gt; p   (incorrigibility)
<br />
2) Bp -&gt; BBp  (introspective knowledge)
<br />
3) B(p-&gt;q) -&gt; (Bp -&gt; Bq)  (weak omniscience, = knowability of the 
<br />
consequences of knowable propositions).
<br />
<br />Now with such axioms you can derive no theorems (except the axiom 
<br />
themselves). So you need some principles which give you a way to deduce 
<br />
theorems from axioms. The usual deduction rule of S4 are the 
<br />
substitution rule, the modus ponens rule and the necessitation rule. 
<br />
The substitution rule say that you can substitute p by any proposition 
<br />
(as far as you avoid clash of variable, etc.). The modus ponens rule 
<br />
say that if you have already derived some formula A, and some formula A 
<br />
-&gt; B, then you can derive B. The necessitation rule says that if you 
<br />
have already derive A, then you can derive BA.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Are &quot;is knowable&quot;, &quot;is true&quot; and &quot;entails&quot; absolute or do they have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaning only with respect to a particular observer?
</em><br />
<br /><br />The abstract S4 theory is strictly neutral on this. But abstract theory 
<br />
can have more concrete models or interpretations. In our lobian 
<br />
setting, it will happen that &quot;formal provability by a machine&quot; does not 
<br />
obey the incorrigibility axiom (as Godel notices in his 1933 paper). 
<br />
This means that formal provability by a machine cannot be used to 
<br />
modelize the knowability of the machine. It is a bit counterintuitive, 
<br />
but formal provability by a machine modelizes only a form of &quot;opinion&quot; 
<br />
by the machine, so that to get a knowability notion from the 
<br />
provability notion, we have to explicitly define knowability(p)  by 
<br />
&quot;provability(p) and p is true&quot;. (Cf Platos's Theaetetus).
<br />
Here provability and knowability is always relative to an (ideal) 
<br />
machine.
<br />
I will come back on this in my explanation to David later. But don't 
<br />
hesitate to ask question before.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Can these terms be relative to an observer? If they can, how would you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rephrase these statements?
</em><br />
<br /><br />An observer ? I guess you mean a subject. Observability could obeys 
<br />
quite different axioms that knowability (as it is the case for machine 
<br />
with comp).
<br />
Just interpret &quot;knowable(p)&quot; by &quot;p is knowable by M&quot;.
<br />
&quot;M&quot; denotes some machine or entity belonging to some class of 
<br />
machine/entity in which we are interested.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  One more question: can or should p be the observer?
</em><br />
<br /><br />&quot;p&quot; has to refer to a proposition. Of course in english (at least in 
<br />
french) we often use similar word with different denotation or meaning. 
<br />
For example, you can say &quot;I know Paul&quot;. And Paul, a priori is not a 
<br />
poposition. But such a &quot;know&quot; is not the same as in &quot;I know that Paul 
<br />
is a good guy&quot;.
<br />
S4 is a good candidate for the second &quot;know&quot;. The &quot;know&quot; (in &quot;I know 
<br />
Paul&quot;) has a quite different meaning, somehow out of topic (to be 
<br />
short). Actually &quot;I know Paul&quot; really means humans variate and 
<br />
pragmatic things like &quot;I met Paul before&quot;, or &quot;I know Paul is not the 
<br />
right guy to hire for this job&quot;, etc.
<br />
<br />With the epistemological sense of &quot;knowing&quot;, we cannot know a knower, 
<br />
nor an observer. We can only know propositions. Those proposition 
<br />
copuld bear on a knower: like in I know that Paul know that 17 is 
<br />
prime. Sure.
<br />
Of course we can observe an observer. This illustarte already that 
<br />
observations and knowledge obeys different logics; hopefully related, 
<br />
of course, as it is with the arithmetical hypostases).
<br />
<br />Oops, I must already go. Have a good week-end, George, and all of you,
<br />
<br /><br />Bruno
