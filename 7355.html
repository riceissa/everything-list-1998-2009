Here is yet another delightful Stathis experiment that I fished up from
<br />
about ten days ago:
<br />
<br />Hal wrote
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Stathis Papaioannou writes:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You find yourself in a locked room with no windows, and no memory of how you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; got there. The room is sparsely furnished: a chair, a desk, pen and paper, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and in one corner a light. The light is currently red, but in the time you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; have been in the room you have observed that it alternates between red and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; green every 10 minutes. Other than the coloured light, nothing in the room 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; seems to change. Opening one of the desk drawers, you find a piece of paper 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; with incredibly neat handwriting. It turns out to be a letter from God, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; revealing that you have been placed in the room as part of a philosophical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; experiment. Every 10 minutes, the system alternates between two states. One 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; state consists of you alone in your room. The other state consists of 10^100 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; exact copies of you, their minds perfectly synchronised with your mind, each 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; copy isolated from all the others in a room just like yours.
</em><br />
<br />I'm liking this already.  So while the light is, say, green, then my
<br />
experiences are being multiplied---from the objective, scientific point
<br />
of view, i.e., the truthful view---by an astounding factor of 10^100!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Whenever the light changes colour, it means that God is either instantaneously
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; creating (10^100 - 1) copies, or instantaneously destroying all but one randomly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; chosen copy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Your task is to guess which colour of the light corresponds with which state 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and write it down. Then God will send you home.
</em><br />
<br />Of course, no instance will be able to say which is which. Thus I, taken as a
<br />
sort of collection of all my instances, cannot know and cannot say.
<br />
<br />Hal says:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let me make a few comments about this experiment.  I would find it quite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; alarming to be experiencing these conditions.
</em><br />
<br />What??  Alarming?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; When the light changes and I go from the high to the low measure state,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would expect to die. When it goes from the low to the high measure state,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would expect that my next moment is in a brand new consciousness (that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shares memories with the old).  [Brand new consciousness? What is that?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; How is it different from the old one?]
</em><br />
<br />First, Stathis has cleverly inserted that you don't know which is
<br />
which, so even the highly-anxious are spared. As for me, suppose
<br />
even that I knew. Then when the light went green, my joy would be
<br />
great (and in one hell of a lot of places!).  When it turned red,
<br />
I would be very philosophical about it and say, &quot;Aw, the best part
<br />
is off now, darn it. But I'm in certainly no worse shape than when
<br />
I came into this wonderful room.&quot;
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Although the near-certainty of death is balanced by the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; near-certainty of birth, it is to such an extreme degree that it seems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; utterly bizarre.  Conscious observers should not be created and destroyed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so cavalierly, not if they know about it.
</em><br />
<br />Why not, exactly?  I'm sure that you have considered (perhaps later
<br />
in the thread) the possibility that this is already happening to you
<br />
millions of times per second. So what?  Nothing to get excited enough
<br />
to write home about.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Suppose you stepped out of a duplicating booth, and a guy walked up with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a gun, aimed it at you, pulled the trigger and killed you.  Would you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; say, oh, well, I'm only losing two seconds of memories, my counterpart
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will go on anyway?
</em><br />
<br />Yes.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't think so, I think you would be extremely alarmed and upset at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the prospect of your death.
</em><br />
<br />Nah, not if I had been fully informed of the situation beforehand.
<br />
After all, I can even throw myself out of an airplane at high altitude
<br />
(with a parachute) even though it makes me extremely agitated. But 
<br />
since I *know* that I will be okay, it's not really a problem.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; God is basically putting you in this situation, but to an enormously,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unimaginably vaster degree.  He is literally &quot;playing God&quot; with your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness.  I would say it's a very bad thing to do.
</em><br />
<br />Okay, I agree it's unethical for Him to do it to some people. But He's
<br />
*not* really hurting them now, is he?  At no point are they any worse off.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, so what?  What good is that?  Why do I care, given that I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; going to die, what happens to the one in 10^100 part of me?  That's an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inconceivably small fraction.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In fact, I might actually prefer to have that tiny fraction stay in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; room so I can be reborn.  Having 10^100 copies 50% of the time gives me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a lot higher measure than just being one person.  I know I just finished
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; complaining about the ethical problems of putting a conscious entity in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this situation, but maybe there are reasons to think it's good.
</em><br />
<br />Yes!  Now that's right!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So I don't necessarily see that I am motivated to follow God's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instructions and try to guess.  I might just want to sit there.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And in any case, the reward from guessing right seems pretty slim
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and unmotivating.  Congratulations, you get to die.  Whoopie.
</em><br />
<br />Well, would you be willing to pay much for it *to* happen, or
<br />
*not to* happen?
<br />
<br />If I, on the other hand, knew that this wonderful room was going to
<br />
be available to me on a specific date, I would collect all my favorite
<br />
movies, my best books, some certain chemicals that it is best not to
<br />
describe in detail, and would look forward to the most wonderful
<br />
afternoon of my life.  I would enthusiastically pay a good fraction
<br />
of my net worth for this opportunity.
<br />
<br />Why?  Why would I do it?  Because logic grabs me by the throat and
<br />
*forces* me to   :-)
<br />
<br />Lee
