<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I'd like to revive an old thread, that has been bothering me a lot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; lately.  I hope you'll all agree that it's a fascinating puzzle.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Wei Dai posed this way back, in February of last year:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/index.html?mID=38">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/index.html?mID=38</a>.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I've read the entire thread, and I don't think the question was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ever resolved.  Wei, Nick Bostrom, and Hal Finney were the main
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; contributors.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;[...]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But there's an alternative way of computing this probability.  She
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; believes that at time t1, the odds are 1/2 that she'll have seen
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; heads.  She also knows that if, at time t1, she saw heads, then the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; odds will be 1 that at all later times, she'll continue to remember
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; seeing heads.  Likewise, if she saw tails at time t1, she'll
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; continue to remember seeing tails.  So
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     P(H,t3) = P(H,t1) = 1/2.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; So which is correct?  I know which solution I prefer, but I'd like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to get some feedback first.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't think the reasoning for this example is very solid.  You have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to introduce this notion of &quot;the probability that I will remember X at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time B, given that I remember it at earlier time A.&quot;  Then you have to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assume that it is 1.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But there is no sound basis for this assumption or this methodology.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is based on our common experience, but we have no experience with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; copy machines of this type.  I think we have to use mathematics rather
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than experience to guide us in new situations.  So this reasoning does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not seem convincing to me.
</em><br />
<br />But I can't imagine anything other than subjective probabilities.  That
<br />
doesn't mean that some other paradigm wouldn't be at work here, but I'm
<br />
wondering if you have any suggestions.  This gets into some pretty deep
<br />
metaphysics.
<br />
<br />Here are some ruminations on the metaphysical questions that might apply:
<br />
<br />1.  My conscious self is the result of a computational process.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Physical supervenience is not necessary here, but since it's 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;irrelevant, let's assume it for convenience.
<br />
<br />2.  I experience my memories to be consistent.  I know that that 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;doesn't mean that they necessarily are.  It's conceivable to me 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that someone could jump into my mind and change a memory of the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color of a horse I just saw from black to blue, and I would never 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have any way to detect it (barring other evidence).  But if I'm
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a computational process, then I would expect my memories to 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be consistent from one moment to the next.
<br />
<br />3.  I experience consciousness as a &quot;stream&quot; which &quot;travels through
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time&quot;.  This is the shakiest of these three so far.  Many 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;philosophers have made a strong case that the entire phenomenon of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time is an illusion.
<br />
<br />So let me ask you this:  are you suggesting that the probability that
<br />
I'll see heads at t1 might not be the same as that I'll see heads at
<br />
t2?  In other words,  P(H,t1) != P(H,t2)  ?
<br />
<br />This would be the case if the self-sampling assumption were at work
<br />
at every instant.  Then  P(H,t1) = 1/2  and  P(H,t2) = 2/3.
<br />
<br />But I do still have a hard time reconciling this with my feeling that
<br />
there is such a thing as a subjective stream of consciousness.  If this
<br />
is what you're saying, can you be more specific about what you would
<br />
give up with regards to the stream of consciousness idea?
<br />
<br />[more below]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One thing you did not say was why the other answer, P(H,t3) = 2/3, was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problematical.  I believe it had to do with decision theory.  In classical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; decision theory, a choice is evaluated by taking all possible outcomes,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multiplying the possible outcome times the utility of that outcome, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; summing the results.  You then make the choice which maximizes this sum.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; An example where this might seem to be a problem is the following.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You are offered a bet where you will pay $15 if the coin is tails, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; win $10 if it is heads.  If P(H) is 2/3, you might want to take the bet.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The resolution is to look at when the payment is made.  If it is after
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you are duplicated, and each instance of your duplicates receives the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; $10, then it is a good bet.  
</em><br />
<br />I don't see that this is necessarily true.  At time t0, I believe that at
<br />
time t3, I will *be* only one person.  If the coin lands tails, I will
<br />
still only get $10.  Why should I care that a copy of me is walking 
<br />
around with $10?  Again, it comes down to subjective probabilities.  I
<br />
will only bet if I believe that my probability of &quot;becoming&quot; one of the
<br />
mes that has seen heads is greater than that of me becoming the one that
<br />
has seen tails.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If the payment is made before duplication
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (but after the coin flip) then your head-observing duplicates don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; actually end up with $10 each, but rather $5.  The duplicating machine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does not duplicate money, or any of your material possessions.  In fact,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being duplicated in effect cuts your material possessions in half.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So the real choice is between $5 with probability 2/3 and -$15 with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probability 1/3, not a good bet.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; An interesting variant though is to introduce nonmaterial rewards.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; They used to have kissing booths at the fair.  For a few dollars you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would get to kiss a beautiful girl.  Suppose that is worth $10 to you.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now the bet is offered; you pay $15 on tails but get a kiss on heads.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The payment will be made before duplication.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In this case I would say that it is a good bet.  The memory of the kiss
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; gets duplicated with you, and each of your duplicates ends up with a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; memory that is worth $10.  So in this case you have P=2/3 of gaining
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something worth $10 and P=1/3 of losing something worth $15, making
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it favorable.
</em><br />
<br />But here again, I believe that at time t3, I'll either have a memory of
<br />
being kissed, or I won't.  And I need to know the relative probabilities
<br />
in order to make the choice.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Note that one need not bring MWI into this at all.  The only big
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; assumption is the existence of a copy machine.  Instead of MWI, one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; can think of the identical experiment being carried out on an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ensemble of, say, 100 hapless souls Albert, Bernard, Caroline, etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; At time t1, some number close to 50 will have seen heads.  At time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; t2, there will be 150 people, 100 of whom remember seeing heads,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and 50 of whom remember seeing tails.  From a bird perspective,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; if you picked any person at random from this group, the chance that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; they'll have seen heads is 2/3.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One difference though is that the MWI duplicates all of your material
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possessions, unlike the copy machine.  That changes the answer I would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; give, as in the kissing example above.  So it is not clear to me that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; copying presents issues involving subjective probabilities in the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way that an MWI model does.
