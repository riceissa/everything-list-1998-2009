<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Functionalism is the same as comp, except that functionalist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; traditionally presuppose some knowable high level of substitution (and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; then like materialist presuppose a physical stuffy level).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; So I would say comp is just the &quot;old functionalism&quot; corrected for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; taking the UDA consequence into account (the level of substitution is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; unkowable, and physical stuff is either contradictory or devoid of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; explanation power and redundant).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hmm - you use the term functionalism quite differently to my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understanding. My take is that functionalism implies if you replace
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the parts of my brain with things which were functionally equivalent,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you would end up with a copy of my consciousness. The description
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; given by Janet Levin on plato.stanford.edu seems to be in agreement
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with this notion (even though she uses different words).
</em><br />
<br /><br />I use functionalism in some standard sense. If you know an explicit non  
<br />
comp author defending functionalism I would be interested in the  
<br />
reference. Most functionalist I know accept Dennett's idea that a  
<br />
theory explaining brain and consciousness should not rely on either  
<br />
conscious or intelligent sub-entities, nor (unless explicitly so like  
<br />
Penrose did in some writings, but few would call those writing  
<br />
&quot;functionalist&quot;) entities more complex that the overal structure under  
<br />
study.
<br />
But ok, this is just terminology and I am not sanguine about it except  
<br />
for preventing misunderstanding.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Nowhere in this discussion is an assumption of a level of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; substitution,
</em><br />
<br />yes, apparently I am the one to introduce this, and to insist such a  
<br />
levcel cannot be known. Note that Maudlin made an allusion to such  
<br />
&quot;unbounded&quot; comp and argues this make comp obviously true. My work  
<br />
illustrates this is not the case, even if it forces, strictly speaking,  
<br />
a non-computationalist to postulate some actual infinity in the  
<br />
&quot;generalized brain&quot;. Again, I know only Penrose as defending such a non  
<br />
comp view. I take this as a courageous attitude, and as a symptom that  
<br />
some physicist can take the mind/body problem seriously. It is just a  
<br />
pity that he got his interpretation of Godel's wrong, especially after  
<br />
Judson Webb wrote his book (ref in my url).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; nor of stuffy matter.
</em><br />
<br />Many scientist take &quot;stuffy matter&quot; for granted, so it is true that it  
<br />
is very rare people mentions explicitly the hypothesis of stuffy  
<br />
matter.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Suppose I had a non Turing-emulable soul, composed of identical non
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Turing-emulable particles called &quot;soulons&quot;. Functionalism would imply
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I can copy my brain by adding in an appropriate arrangement of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical particles, as well as an appropriate arrangement of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; soulons. Yet, by construction, this theory is not computationalist!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So I stand by my remarks that computationalism is a specialised
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; variant of functionalism.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I am afraid your solon will just have this application: to give a non  
<br />
standard meaning to functionalism. Even a strict catholic can be a  
<br />
functionalist in that sense: just imagine that the solon, thanks to  
<br />
their non-comp (by construction) feature are connected to &quot;Descartes'  
<br />
God&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It depends what you put in the &quot;B&quot;. It is indeed a sort of scientific
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; knowledge when starting with B = the provability predicate of some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; fixed theory like Peano arithmetic, but such a theory can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (autonomously) transcends itself in the (constructive) transfinite,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the &quot;arithmetical&quot; meaning of &quot;B&quot; will evolved, letting invariant the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; modal logic G, G*, S4Grz, ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Then the justification is that it works. It gives an unameable  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; creative
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; subject which lives in a non describable temporal structure, etc. You
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; can take this as a simplification. With comp the simple first person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; already leads to a notion of arithmetical quantization. Then sensible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; matter is also given by adding &quot;&amp; p&quot; , but on &quot;Bp &amp; Dp&quot;, ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I can (sort of) see this. However, it is only one model, and not even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a terribly convincing one (to me at least).
</em><br />
<br /><br />I don't think it is a model. Once we say yes to the doctor, it is  
<br />
normal to be interested in what any machine (perhaps ideally correct)  
<br />
can prove about herself, and then we inherit of the nuances *forced* by  
<br />
incompleteness. We just cannot threw them in the trash, and then it is  
<br />
just an amazing news that they behave like we were expecting. I have  
<br />
worked with more complex definition (based on Kleene realizability and  
<br />
on Hyland effective topos until I discover the variant of provability  
<br />
were quite enough for distinguishing in number-theoretic terms the  
<br />
notion of persons corresponding to their use in the UDA.
<br />
This does not preclude more fine grain &quot;model&quot; of course, but let us  
<br />
first extract all the juice from simpler idea before. No?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Do you have any uniqueness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; results showing that the &amp;p is necessary for obtaining the unamable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; creative subject or the temporality?
</em><br />
<br /><br />For Bp &amp; p, I mentionned the appendix &quot;Artemov&quot; thesis of my text  
<br />
&quot;conscience et mécanisme&quot;, here:
<br />
<a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/bxlthesis/Volume4CC/">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/bxlthesis/Volume4CC/</a> 
<br />
6%20La%20these%20d'Artemov.pdf
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Except that Dp always entail ~BDp (by second incompleteness). This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; would make your refutability notion much too large.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Oh, well another idea bites the dust!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Anyway, thats by the bye. If I accept the Theatetical notion for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; sake of argument (since I can see how it might work for mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; knowledge), I still struggle to see how the &quot;&amp;p&quot; part leads to self
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; awareness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; To be just a little bit more specific, &quot;Bp&quot; is 3-self-referential (the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; machine proves correct proposition on any of third person description
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; made at some level, correctly chosen in a serendipitous way).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But by adding &quot;&amp; p&quot;, by a theorem similar to Tarski theorem, we are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; lead to a first person  self-reference (Bp &amp; p) without any nameable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; subject. It is the &quot;I&quot; which has no name. That &quot;I&quot;, somehow, could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; correctly said about himself that he is not a program, that he is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; duplicable (and indeed the first person is not duplicable from its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; first person point of view (despite Chalmers).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You would need to be more specific in your claims, but that would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probably be the subject of a full scientific paper, and perhaps you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are only speculating at present anyway. I will need to be patient.
</em><br />
<br />The whole thing is already in my SANE paper:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/</a> 
<br />
SANE2004MARCHALAbstract.html
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But even so, I don't see anywhere the necessity of 1st person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-awareness, which is what I was driving at.
</em><br />
<br /><br />What difference are you doing between self-awareness and consciousness.  
<br />
At this stage this is, imo, a 1004 fallacy.
<br />
I find remarkable that the &quot;Bp &amp; p&quot; variant of B gives a theory of  
<br />
consciousness isomorphic to Brouwer's theory of Consciousness:
<br />
- the subject feel not to be machine or formal
<br />
-the subject has no name
<br />
-the subject define an intrinsic intuitionist logic
<br />
-the subject is related to a temporal irreversible branching  
<br />
multiverse, etc.
<br />
Then with comp we get the shadows of the quantum.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I wish I shared your certainty that any n-person POV can be captured
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by means of a modal logic. But I don't. All I can say is that I find
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it unconvincing, whilst admitting that perhaps you have a point.
</em><br />
<br />Modal logic only simplifies the assertions on the provability logic.  
<br />
The first version of my work has been completed in the seventies  
<br />
without any use of modal logic. The important thing are the provability  
<br />
logics and their variant. I could use only formula of arithmetic. The  
<br />
modalities appears from purely number theoretical reasons&gt;. It is not  
<br />
something we have to introduce. We can hide them by working with the  
<br />
pure language of arithmetic, but this makes thing less easy to study.
<br />
... will say more in the road map ...
