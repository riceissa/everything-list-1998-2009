<br />A.&quot;the universe in which I live according to the current intuition
<br />
I have of it&quot;
<br />
and
<br />
B:&gt; the possibility to simulate the universe at any level of accuracy. &lt;
<br />
<br />First I wanted to ask what is intuition, but let us stay with common sense
<br />
(however divergent that may be). I don't have your intuition and you
<br />
don't have mine.
<br />
Now if A is true, I wonder upon WHAT can you simulate?
<br />
Your reply points to first person processes. I like better a 'mixed' way:
<br />
MY 'interpretation' of something to which I have access only through such
<br />
interpretation - but there must be a basis for the inter[retation both as
<br />
my way of doing it, but more importantly the 'thing' to interpret. The
<br />
(common sense) intuition comes into the 'my way'.
<br />
<br />C. (universe:)&quot;the smallest independent piece that does include myself&quot;
<br />
<br />First I object to &quot;independent&quot; which would lead to a multiple existence
<br />
of parallel natures (all of them singularities for the others) and we cannot
<br />
gain information from them - which would connect in some ways. Existence
<br />
as  we can reasonably speak about it, is interconnected - nothing
<br />
independent.
<br />
If you make concessions to that and accept 'relative' independence, then the
<br />
smallest 'unit'  including you is you. I don't think you want to go
<br />
solipsistic.
<br />
If you expand further - well, I did not find a limit. This is why I
<br />
concocted a
<br />
narrative about a 'plenitude' (undefined, not Plato's concept) FROM which
<br />
distinct 'universes' occur (in timeless and countless fulgurations, callable
<br />
BigBangs) with some INTERNAL history - in 'ours' including space and time.
<br />
So I have a 'universe to talk about' - within my intuition &lt;G&gt;. And many
<br />
more 'universes', obscured by ignorance (no info) - not excluded. I don't
<br />
restrict 'them' to our logic, math, system, not even causality.
<br />
<br />I like your metaphor of the dominos. It pertains to a view we may have
<br />
in our (exclusively possible) reductionist ways about the world: THIS
<br />
ONE is the cause of an event (one side of the domino) while the rest of
<br />
the system (all of it) is also influencing - whether we consider it in our
<br />
limited model (within our chosen boundaries) or not.
<br />
<br />This list goes many times beyond the reductionist ways of thinking.
<br />
Math logic is beyond models, it only becomes reductionistic, if applied to
<br />
'things/events': when limited models are quantitatively characterized in
<br />
comparison with other models and an ( = ) sign (or similar) is applied to
<br />
them within the selected boundaries.
<br />

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Dear Georges,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to your series of questions I would like to add one as first:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;What do you call universe?&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would naively answer: the universe in which I live
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; according to the current intuition I have of it. I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not sure this makes sense and I also understand that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; others may have different intuitions of it. Maybe a bit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more formally I would refer to &quot;the smallest independent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; piece that does include myself&quot; (in case there is anything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; else and hoping that we can get a common intuition of that;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dependence is relative to space-time continuity, particle
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interaction and this kind of things).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; as long as we do not make this identification, it is futile to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; speculate about &quot;its&quot; computability/computed sate.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maybe this is an opportunity to clarify the concept and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to see up to which point it is shared among us. I am not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sure we can easily go much farther than intuition we have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of it and to isolate the possible differences we have.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I see not too much value in assuming infinite memories
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and infinite time of computation, that may lead to a game
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of words, calling &quot;computation&quot; the object to be computed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maybe I was just not clear enough. I was just thinking of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the possibility to simulate the universe at any level of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; accuracy. However small but non zero the accuracy, there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would exist a simulation of finite but possibly very large
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; size and time that meets it. Infinite memory and running
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time would be necessary only to run an infinite sequence of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simulations with an accuracy going asymtotically close to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; zero.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Is 'Multiverse' part of your universe, or vice versa?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am not sure I understand the concept(s) of multiverse
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; enough to make a reasonable answer to this question.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For what I understand of it (them), it is (they are) not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consistent with the view I have of causality (which is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more related to the fact that the universe is &quot;more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ordered on one side that on the other&quot; than to dominos
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pushing each other).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Regards.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Georges Quénot.
