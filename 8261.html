<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hal,

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It won't make any difference, because the CC is not used in the way you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; imagine.  It doesn't have to produce a record and it doesn't have to erase
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; any records.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK, mea culpa, maybe I misunderstood the apparatus and it was not the CC
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that records
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things, but still the records
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could be kept somewhere, and one can ask what would happen if the records
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; were
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; kept somewhere else (e.g. in a macroscopic medium).  No?
</em><br />
<br />I don't think this makes sense, at least I can't understand it.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The point is, there is no change to the s photon when we put the polarizer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; over by p.  Its results do not visibly change from non-interference
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to interference, as the web page might imply.  (If that did happen,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; we'd have the basis for a faster than light communicator.)  No, all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that is happening is that we are choosing to throw out half the data,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and the half we keep does show interference.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes but we are choosing which half to throw out in a very peculiar way --
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; i.e. we are throwing it out by &quot;un-happening&quot; it after it happened,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by destroying some records that were only gathered after the events
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recorded in the data already happened...
</em><br />
<br />You have to try to stop thinking of this in mystical terms.  IMO people
<br />
present a rather prosaic phenomenon in a misleading and confusing way,
<br />
and this is giving you an incorrect idea.  Nothing is un-happening.
<br />
No records are destroyed after they were gathered.
<br />
<br />Forget that anybody told you this was a &quot;quantum eraser&quot; and think
<br />
about what really happens.  When all the polarizers are in place, half
<br />
of the p photons get eaten and half get through.  This gives us a way
<br />
to split up the s measurements into two halves.  It turns out that each
<br />
half independently shows interference, but that the two interference
<br />
patterns are the opposite of each other.  When you combine the two halves
<br />
back together, the peaks of one half fill in the valleys of the other,
<br />
and the data set as a whole shows no interference.
<br />
<br />Look at it concretely as it might happen in the lab.  We record a bunch
<br />
of s measurements and also record whether we get a coincidence with a p
<br />
photon getting through, in the CC.  Maybe we write a little check mark
<br />
next to the s measurements where there was a p photon coincidence.
<br />
<br />We go through afterwards to analyze the data.  If we just plot all
<br />
the s measurements we see a smooth curve, no interference.  Now we
<br />
go through and cross off the ones where there was no p coincidence.
<br />
We cross off s measurement number 1, then numbers 3 and 4, then 5, 7,
<br />
10 through 12, and so on.  When we plot the remaining measurements,
<br />
now we see an interference pattern.
<br />
<br />In other words, the coincidence with the p photon identifies a subset
<br />
of the s measurements which shows interference.  The total collection
<br />
of s measurements still shows no interference.
<br />
<br />There is no real &quot;erasing&quot; going on.  Whoever coined the term &quot;quantum
<br />
eraser&quot; was a master of public relations, but unfortunately he confused
<br />
millions of lay people into getting the wrong idea about the physics.
