<em class="quotelev1">&gt;like unconsciousness and perhaps some meditative states) maintain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that interpretation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But you don't seem to agree with me that the interpretation itself is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a subjective matter.
</em><br />
<br />There's some ambiguity in your use of the word &quot;interpretation&quot; here.  In 
<br />
&quot;Robot&quot; you argue that a physical system can be seen as implementing any 
<br />
possible computation under the right mapping, so that an &quot;interpretation&quot; 
<br />
might be just another word for a particular choice of mappings.  But 
<br />
&quot;interpretation&quot; can also be used in the more vague sense of attributing 
<br />
motives and thoughts to a physical system, giving you an explanation for its 
<br />
behavior in terms of folk-psychology.
<br />
<br />And there might also be a hybrid of these two views, which says that in the 
<br />
Platonic &quot;space&quot; of all possible computations there is always *some* 
<br />
computation corresponding to a particular set of thoughts and motives, so if 
<br />
a given system implements all possible computations than no 
<br />
folk-psychological explanation is ultimately better than any other.  For 
<br />
example, if I am interacting with a character in a video game, I know that 
<br />
some possible Turing machine simulates a being with a complex brain who 
<br />
happens to respond in the same way as the character in the game, so maybe 
<br />
what you're saying is that I'm free to choose the mapping where I'm actually 
<br />
interacting with such a being (even if I don't bother to figure out the 
<br />
details of the mapping itself).
<br />
<br />Depending on what you mean by &quot;interpretation,&quot; it might be possible to have 
<br />
a view basically similar to yours that still sees first-person experience as 
<br />
a matter of objective reality (unlike in position #1 of my original post).  
<br />
There could be a theory of consciousness that says that there is a 
<br />
one-to-one correspondence between computations and subjective experiences, 
<br />
even though a given physical system may actually implement all possible 
<br />
computations so it would still be a matter of &quot;interpretation&quot; as to which 
<br />
one I'm interacting with.
<br />
<br />This is actually somewhat similar to my view.  I am doubtful that a finite 
<br />
physical system actually gives rise to all possible subjective experiences 
<br />
(see below for why I don't think a theory of consciousness should be based 
<br />
on 'computations'), but I do think it may give rise to a lot of them--for 
<br />
example, my right brain and left brain may have their own experiences 
<br />
distinct from the experience of my brain as a whole, and more generally any 
<br />
subset of causally connected events in my brain may have its own unique 
<br />
experience.  In this view &quot;I&quot; am just a particular subset, a particular 
<br />
pattern of activity in the brain, rather than the brain itself.
<br />
<br />My hope is that a theory of consciousness would explain why some subsets are 
<br />
more likely to be experienced than others (like a more detailed version of 
<br />
the anthropic principle, or the 'copernican anthropic principle' discussed 
<br />
on www.anthropic-principle.com), so maybe the most probable subsets of my 
<br />
brain's activity would all have basically similar kinds of experiences.  But 
<br />
every pattern would experience *itself* as real, although many might have a 
<br />
very simple sort of consciousness (see Chalmers' discussion of the 
<br />
consciousness associated with a thermostat, for example).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The reward for legitimizing interpretations in which the humongous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;lookup table is as conscious as any other implementation of a given AI
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;program is consistency and evaporation of much of the elusiveness of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consciousness.  I've become very comfortable with that, at first blush
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;counterintuitive, consequence.
</em><br />
<br />I don't see why we should get any inconsistencies from the assumption that a 
<br />
lookup table does not have the same sort of experience as other types of 
<br />
programs.  Even if you assume that identical subjective experiences arise 
<br />
whenever a particular computation is implemented, it's still true that a 
<br />
Turing machine simulating a lookup table is quite different from a Turing 
<br />
machine simulating a neural network with the same outward behavior.
<br />
<br />My view is that a theory of consciousness should involve a one-to-one 
<br />
mapping between subjective experiences and *some* set of mathematical 
<br />
structures, but I don't think the set of all &quot;computations&quot; is a good 
<br />
candidate.  I think we need something more along the lines of &quot;isomorphic 
<br />
causal structures,&quot; but there doesn't yet seem to be a good way to define 
<br />
this intuition...Chalmers' paper at 
<br />
&lt;<a href="http://www.u.arizona.edu/~chalmers/papers/rock.html">http://www.u.arizona.edu/~chalmers/papers/rock.html</a>&gt;
<br />
discusses his views on the subject.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in the same way that a recording of a person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; probably doesn't have its own subjective experience.  Likewise, if I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; attribute feelings to a stuffed animal, I'm probably wrong.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Why do you think you're wrong?  I argued as forcefully as I could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;about a year ago on this list and also in the last chapter of my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;Robot&quot; book that allowing interpretationions like these (and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;arbitrarily more extreme cases like Putnam's rock) does not lead to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;intellectual or moral disaster.  On the contrary, it makes sense of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;issues that the intuitive positions endlessly muddle.
</em><br />
<br />But I'm not sure how we can get the appearance of living in an orderly 
<br />
universe with well-defined &quot;laws&quot; in this view.  There are a great many 
<br />
possible computations that would correspond to a brain similar to mine 
<br />
suddenly seeing the universe around it go haywire--should I be worried?  It 
<br />
seems to me that you really need to assign some kind of &quot;objective 
<br />
probability&quot; to each member of the set of all possible &quot;interpretations&quot; or 
<br />
first-person experiences.
<br />
<br />My own pet &quot;theory of everything&quot; is that a unique assignment of objective 
<br />
probabilities might emerge naturally from a theory of consciousness.  As I 
<br />
said before, my idea is that a theory of consciousness should basically be a 
<br />
formalization/extension of anthropic reasoning, so that in a universe 
<br />
containing 999 minds of insect-level complexity and 1 human-level mind, the 
<br />
probability of being the human might be much greater than 1/1000.  If this 
<br />
is the case, it may be that if you make the Platonic assumption that *all* 
<br />
possible mental patterns exist (whether 'mental patterns' are defined as 
<br />
computations or in some other way), then there might be a single 
<br />
self-consistent way to assign probabilities to each one, just as a large set 
<br />
of simultaneous equations may have only one solution.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  But #1 says it's meaningless to talk about the &quot;truth&quot; of these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; questions, just like it's meaningless to ask whether Shakespeare is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;really&quot; a better author than Danielle Steele.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It's not meaningless, but you have to agree on an interpretation to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;get a meaning.
</em><br />
<br />It's not meaningless to have discussions about aesthetics, but I think it's 
<br />
meaningless to ask which book is &quot;really&quot; better...I don't think that 
<br />
reality cares one way or another.  It doesn't make much sense to imagine two 
<br />
universes which are identical in terms of both physical events and mental 
<br />
experiences (if they exist), but which differ in a single way: in one, 
<br />
Shakespeare is &quot;really&quot; better, and in the other Danielle Steele is.
<br />
<br />On the other hand, if you believe that consciousness is real, it does seem 
<br />
to make sense to imagine two possible universes which are identical 
<br />
physically, but in one physical events give rise to qualia and in the other 
<br />
they don't (a 'zombie universe').  This would show that facts about 
<br />
consciousness are not fully reducible to third-person facts, even though 
<br />
there may be a theory of consciousness that defines a one-to-one 
<br />
relationship between them (also, if something like the pet theory I 
<br />
mentioned earlier turned out to be correct, it might be possible to 'reduce' 
<br />
all third-person facts to first-person facts).
<br />
<br />My wife and I often discuss the feelings and
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;motivations of characters in fiction.  These are not meaningless
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;discussions: there interpretations (which I can claim to be Platonic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;worlds as solid as any) in which the characters are as real as you or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I.  It is possible to gain emotional therapy by unloading one's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;innermost concerns on a teddy bear interpreted as thoughtful listener.
</em><br />
<br />But consider a &quot;story&quot; like this:
<br />
<br />&quot;A man walks into a bar.  He says, 'gimme a beer.'&quot;
<br />
<br />Certainly there are Platonic worlds where this really happens, and it's 
<br />
probably happened in 'our' world too.  But the story itself doesn't pick out 
<br />
any particular world, so it doesn't make much sense to say that there is a 
<br />
&quot;true answer&quot; to questions like, &quot;Was the man married?  Was he in a bad mood 
<br />
at the time?  Had he just been fired from his job?&quot;
<br />
<br />The best we can do is look at all possible worlds where the events in the 
<br />
story take place, and then decide which versions are more plausible relative 
<br />
to a universe like the one we experience.  For example, if we ask &quot;Did the 
<br />
man have purple skin and compound eyes?&quot; it makes sense to answer &quot;probably 
<br />
not.&quot;
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But #1 doesn't just say that conducting a long personal relationship
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; with a system is a good test of consciousness (which I believe)...it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; says that there's nothing to test, because attributing consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to a system is a purely aesthetic decision.  Even an omniscient God
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; could not tell you the &quot;truth&quot; of the matter, if #1 is correct.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I have come to strongly believe there is no truth to the matter that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is independent of interpretation.  But within an interpretation ...
</em><br />
<br />I believe that my own first-person experience is what it is, and no one 
<br />
else's opinion can change that.  But the physical system that is my brain 
<br />
probably gives rise to many different kinds of subjective experiences...if 
<br />
your ideas are right it may even give rise to all possible experiences.  
<br />
What this shows is that &quot;I&quot; am not identical to my brain, a conclusion that 
<br />
anyone with a computational view of mind would agree with.
