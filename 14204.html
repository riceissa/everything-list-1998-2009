<br /><br /><br />Fair enough, thanks.
<br />
<br />I give the solution of the little exercises on the notion of bijection.
<br />
<br />1) is there a bijection between N and N?
<br />
<br />Of course! The identity function is a bijection from N to N, and  
<br />
actually any identity function defined on any set is a bijection from  
<br />
that set with itself. Here is a drawing of a bijection from N to N (I  
<br />
don't represent the &quot;ropes&quot; ...)
<br />
<br />0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  ...
<br />
0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8 ...
<br />
<br />So all sets &quot;have the same number of element&quot; than itself.
<br />
<br /><br />2) Q is the set of rational numbers, that is length of segment which
<br />
can be measured by the ratio of natural numbers (or integers).
<br />
<br />There is a bijection between N and Q.   We have already seen a  
<br />
bijection between N and ZXZ, which I called the spiraller (I put only  
<br />
the image of the bijection, imagine the rope 0----(0,0),   1-----(0,1),  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2-----(-1,1), ... :
<br />
<br />(0,0) (0,1) (-1,1) (-1,0) (-1,-1) (0,-1) (1,-1) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (0,2)  
<br />
(-1,2) (-2,2) (-2,-1) ....
<br />
<br />We can transform that bijection between N and ZXZ into a bijection  
<br />
between N and Q in the following way. We start from the bijection above  
<br />
between N and ZXZ, but we interpret (x,y) as the fraction x/y, throwing  
<br />
it out in case we already met the corresponding rational number, or  
<br />
when we met an indeterminate fraction (like 0/0) or spurious one (like  
<br />
1/0, 2/0, ...), this gives first
<br />
<br />0/0  0/1  -1/1  -1/0   -1/-1 0/-1  1/-1  1/0  1/1  1/2  0/2   -1/2    
<br />
-2/2  -2/1 ...., and after the throwing out of the repeated rationals:
<br />
<br />0   -1   1   1/2   -1/2   -2 ...
<br />
<br />OK?
<br />
<br /><br />3) We have seen a bijection between N and NXN. We can use it to provide  
<br />
a bijection between N and NX(NXN). Indeed, you can zigzag on NX(NXN)  
<br />
like  we have zigzag on NXN, starting from:
<br />
<br />...
<br />
5
<br />
4
<br />
3
<br />
2
<br />
1
<br />
0
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(0,0) (0,1) (1,0) (2,0) (1,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,2) (2,1) (3,0) (4,0)  
<br />
(3,1) ...
<br />
<br />All right?
<br />
<br />Obviously there is a bijection between NXNXN and NX(NXN)); just send  
<br />
(x,y,z) on (x,(y,z)).
<br />
<br />In the same manner, you can show the existence of a bijection and any  
<br />
of NXNXNXN, NXNXNXNXN, NXNXNXNXNXN, ....
<br />
<br />4) (The one important for the sequel). Take any finite alphabet, like  
<br />
{0,1}, {a, b},  {a, b, c,  ... z} or all keyboard keys. Then the set of  
<br />
all finite words build on any such alphabet is in bijection with N.  
<br />
Indeed, to be sure of enumerating all the words, on {a,b,c}, say, just  
<br />
enumerate the words having length 1, then length 2, etc. And order just  
<br />
alphabetically the words having the same length. On the alphabet  
<br />
{a,b,c}, this gives
<br />
<br />a, b, c, aa, ab, ac, ba, bb, bc, ca, cb, cc, aaa, aab, aac, aba, abb,  
<br />
abc, aca, acb, acc, baa, bab, bac, bba, bbb, bbc, bca, bcb, bcc, ...
<br />
<br />I hope you see that this gives a bijection between N and A° (the set of  
<br />
words on A, which in this example is {a, b, c}. Purist would add the  
<br />
empty word in front.
<br />
&nbsp;From this you can give another proof that Q is enumerable (= in  
<br />
bijection with N). Indeed all rational numbers, being a (reduced)  
<br />
fraction, can be written univocally as a word in the finite alphabet  
<br />
{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, /}. Example 456765678 / 9898989 (I have  
<br />
added blank for reason of readibility, but those are not symbols taken  
<br />
from the alphabet).
<br />
Another important example, the set of all programs in any programming  
<br />
language. For some language, like Python for example, you have to put  
<br />
explicitly the &quot;enter&quot;, or &quot;carriage return&quot; key symbol in the  
<br />
alphabet, of course.
<br />
<br /><br />5) Let N be the set {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...}, as usual. Let N' be a  
<br />
sort of copy or relabeling of N, that is N' = {0', 1', 2', 3', 4', 5',  
<br />
6', ...}.
<br />
What are really object like 5' is not relevant except that we consider  
<br />
that any x is different from any x'. (usually mathematician formalize  
<br />
N' by NX{0}, or NX{1}, but that are details).
<br />
<br />Is N U N' in bijection with N ?
<br />
<br />Sure, NUN' = {0, 0', 1, 1', 2,  2', 3, 3', 4, 4', 5, 5', 6, 6', 7, 7',  
<br />
8, 8', ...}, and
<br />
<br />0, 0', 1, 1', 2,  2', 3, 3', 4, 4', 5, 5', 6, 6', 7, 7', 8, 8', ... is  
<br />
indeed an enumeration of NUN' (bijection from N to the set NUN'). You  
<br />
can see it as the result of a zigzagging between
<br />
<br />0,  1,  2,  3,   4,  5,  6, ...
<br />
0', 1', 2',  3',  4', 5',  6', ...  (do the drawing if you want to see  
<br />
the zigzag).
<br />
<br /><br />Is the infinite union NUN'UN''UN'''UN''''U ... still enumerable?
<br />
Yes, just zigzag on
<br />
<br />0,     1,     2,     3,     4,     5,       6, ...
<br />
0',     1',    2',    3',     4',    5',      6', ..
<br />
0'',    1'',   2'',    3'',    4'',    5'',     6'', ...
<br />
0''',   1''',  2''',    3''',   4''',    5''',    6''', ...
<br />
0'''',  1'''',  2'''',   3'''',   4'''',   5'''',   6'''', ...
<br />
0''''', 1''''',  2''''',  3''''',   4''''',  5''''',  6''''',
<br />
...
<br />
<br />this gives, starting from up left:
<br />
<br />0, 1, 0', 0'', 1', 2, 3, 2', 1'', 0''', 0'''', 1''', 2'', 3', 4, 5, 4',  
<br />
3'', 2''', 1'''',  0''''', 0'''''', ...
<br />
<br />and gives an enumeration (bijection with N) of the infinite union  
<br />
NUN'UN''UN'''UN''''U ...
<br />
<br /><br />Remark: for those who recall the transfinite ordinal we have met when  
<br />
we have try to give a good answer to the first fairy, you can realize  
<br />
that if we put on each set N', N'', N''', etc. the usual order (so that  
<br />
3''' &lt; 5''') for example, and if we extend those orders on the all  
<br />
infinite union by deciding that x^{n strokes} &lt; y^{m strokes} in case m  
<br />
is bigger than n (whatever are x and y),  we get transfinite ordinal  
<br />
number.
<br />
<br />Example
<br />
omega is just N
<br />
omega+omega is the ordinal of the order:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0,     1,     2,     3,     4,     5,       6, ...   0',     1',      
<br />
2',     3',     4',     5',       6', ...
<br />
<br />omega* omega = omega+omega+omega+omega+omega+omega+omega+ ... = the  
<br />
ordinal of the order
<br />
<br />0,1,2,3,...0',1',2',3',...0'',1'',2'',3'',...0''',1''',2''',3''',...0''' 
<br />
',1'''',2'''',3'''',...0''''',1''''',2''''',3''''',...0'''''',1'''''',2' 
<br />
''''',3'''''',...0''''''',1''''''',2''''''',3''''''', ....
<br />
<br />Obviously (ask if this is not clear), the zigzagging showing that  
<br />
NUN'UN''UN'''UN''''U ...  is in bijection with N, shows that the  
<br />
ordinal
<br />
omega* omega is in bijection with N.
<br />
<br />Note that all the &quot;...&quot; in
<br />
<br />0,1,2,3,...0',1',2',3',...0'',1'',2'',3'',...0''',1''',2''',3''',...0''' 
<br />
',1'''',2'''',3'''',...0''''',1''''',2''''',3''''',...0'''''',1'''''',2' 
<br />
''''',3'''''',...0''''''',1''''''',2''''''',3''''''', ....
<br />
<br />have the usual interpretation, except the last one, which supposes you  
<br />
have grasped the process for generating that ordinal. (Compare may be  
<br />
with Thorgny's ultrafinitist rebuilding of the ordinals, but only if  
<br />
you grasp well the non-ultrafinitist one before).
<br />
<br />All transfinite ordinal we have used with the first fairy (to give her  
<br />
a big finite number) were enumerable (= in bijection with N).
<br />
<br />This ends the little introduction to the notion of bijection, and of  
<br />
(infinite) enumeration (= bijection with N).
<br />
<br />Next, I will show the existence of bigger infinities, that is, of  
<br />
infinite set which cannot be put in a bijective correspondence with N.  
<br />
You can prepare yourself with the set
<br />
<br />NXNXNXNXNXNXNXNX ...  (the infinite cartesian product of N with itself)
<br />
<br />This is the set of omega-uples of natural number. It is the set of (x,  
<br />
y, z, r, s, t, u, ...) with x, z, ... all belonging to N. So it is also  
<br />
the set of sequences of natural numbers, and so it is also the set of  
<br />
functions from N to N.
<br />
<br />or you can take even just, putting 2 for the set {0,1} the infinite  
<br />
product of 2 with itself
<br />
<br />2X2X2X2X2X2X2X2X2X2X2X ...  (the infinite cartesian product of {0, 1}  
<br />
with itself),
<br />
<br />This is the set of infinite binary sequences, or the set of functions  
<br />
from N to 2, where 2 is put for {0,1}.
<br />
<br />I guess many of you knows that such sets are NOT enumerable, and that  
<br />
this can be proved by one application of Cantor's diagonal. But I will  
<br />
explain this in detail. The reason is not that we will have some use of  
<br />
that result, but just because it is the simplest use of a diagonal.
<br />
<br />Only after that, I will be able to explain, by a similar but a bit  
<br />
subtle diagonal, why Church thesis, and even more generally the  
<br />
hypothesis asserting there exist a universal computing machine, is a  
<br />
quite strong postulate whose impact on the everything theories, the  
<br />
measure problem, etc. is incalculable ...
<br />
This is needed to have a thorough understanding of the seventh and  
<br />
eighth steps of the UDA. But my main goal long term is to answer  
<br />
precisely a question by David about the origin and importance of the  
<br />
first person in the comp frame.
<br />
<br />So the sequel is:
<br />
<br />1) Cantor's diagonal
<br />
2) are there universal computing machine? (Kleene's diagonal, and  
<br />
Church thesis)
<br />
<br />3) A fundamental theorem about universal computing machines. (All such  
<br />
machine are imperfect, or insecure)
<br />
<br />Please ask questions. To miss math due to notation problem is like to  
<br />
miss travels due to mishandling of the use of maps, or to miss love by  
<br />
mishandling of the use of clothes ... It is missing a lot, for  
<br />
mishandling a few I wanna say.
