<br />&quot;Bleep&quot; of faith
<br />
An indie film gets buzz and a big rollout. But &quot;What the Bleep Do We Know!?&quot;
<br />
uses questionable on-screen experts - and appears to be an infomercial for a
<br />
controversial New Age sect.
<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />
By John Gorenfeld
<br />
Sept. 16, 2004 | Last week, the national release of the independent film &quot;What
<br />
the Bleep Do We Know!?&quot; seemed to be just the latest success story in the Year
<br />
of the Documentary -- a little movie that could, launched into 60 theaters
<br />
across the country by Samuel Goldwyn Films after selling out small theaters for
<br />
months. The film's co-director, William Arntz, has called it &quot;a film for the
<br />
religious left,&quot; an answer to &quot;The Passion of the Christ.&quot; It presents itself
<br />
as the thinking rebel's alternative to Hollywood pabulum: a heady stew of drama
<br />
and documentary, starring Oscar-winning actress Marlee Matlin as a Xanax-addled
<br />
photographer who discovers joy when she learns that quantum mechanics makes
<br />
spiritual wonders possible.
<br />
But the film -- buoyed by a slew of stories in regional and national outlets
<br />
(including Salon) about its supposed grassroots success -- has largely avoided
<br />
much skepticism. And as the distributors launched a national advertising
<br />
campaign, on NPR's &quot;All Things Considered&quot; among other outlets, and earned
<br />
respectable reviews from a number of critics (the San Francisco Examiner calls
<br />
it a &quot;smart film,&quot; and Roger Ebert, while not thrilled, gave it a thoughtful
<br />
two and a half stars), their movie has managed to avoid much scrutiny of what,
<br />
exactly, it's really about -- and who is behind it.
<br />
That has meant little attention has been given to either the film's agenda, or
<br />
its questionable use of supposed experts. At least one scientist prominently
<br />
interviewed in the film now says his words were taken out of context. And two
<br />
other key subjects in the film are not fully identified: a theologian who, the
<br />
film fails to divulge, is a former priest who left the Catholic Church after
<br />
allegations of sexual abuse; and a mysterious woman identified only as Judy
<br />
&quot;JZ&quot; Knight, who is actually a sect leader claiming to channel a
<br />
35,000-year-old warrior spirit named Ramtha. The film's three co-directors are
<br />
among those who follow Ramtha and look to Knight's channeled maxims to decipher
<br />
the mysteries of life. These Ramtha followers reportedly number in the
<br />
thousands. But critics call the sect a cult.
<br />
<br />In the movie, the 58-year-old Knight, whose accent is as thick as her mascara,
<br />
makes the boldest statements -- pronounced with long, rolling R's -- about
<br />
particles and God. &quot;We have grrreat technology. But we still have this ugly,
<br />
superrrstitious, backwahds cohncept of Gahd,&quot; she says, adding that &quot;the height
<br />
of arrrrrrogance is the belief of those who would see Gahd in their own image.&quot;
<br />
Musing on the unity of consciousness and matter, she reminds us that &quot;it only
<br />
takes a fantasy for a man to have a harrrd-on.&quot; In her normal mode, Knight
<br />
speaks the plain talk of her native Roswell, N.M., but in the manly presence of
<br />
Ramtha, said to have conquered the continent neighboring Atlantis, Knight's jaw
<br />
juts and her voice deepens into something magisterial and brash (view her
<br />
here). Her Ramtha's School of Enlightenment, on a $2 million compound based in
<br />
Yelm, Wash., boasts followers -- including celebrities like actress Shirley
<br />
MacLaine (who attended Knight's seminars in the late '80s) and &quot;Dynasty&quot; star
<br />
Linda Evans -- willing to pay up to $1,600 for a seminar.
<br />
Reached by Salon, Meyer Gottlieb, president of Samuel Goldwyn Films, says he's
<br />
seen &quot;Bleep&quot; about eight times. Its fledgling distribution company Roadside
<br />
Attractions had its first real hit earlier this year when it launched festival
<br />
favorite documentary &quot;Super Size Me&quot; and is hoping for a similar sleeper hit
<br />
with &quot; Bleep.&quot; Asked what he thought of the expressed desire by filmmaker Mark
<br />
Vicente (on a Ramtha Web site, BeyondTheOrdinary.net) for his viewers to emerge
<br />
from his movie in an &quot;almost trance-like state,&quot; Gottlieb only laughed.
<br />
&quot;The question is, Is this movie promoting a cult?&quot; he said. &quot;The only thing
<br />
we're interested in from a marketing perspective is creating a cult status for
<br />
the film ... cults, from my perspective, they deal with groups and leaders and
<br />
that stuff. This movie is about individual thinking. Individual control over
<br />
your future -- and your own reality.&quot;
<br />
But not everyone involved in the movie has good things to say about that
<br />
message.
<br />
David Albert, a professor at the Columbia University physics department, has
<br />
accused the filmmakers of warping his ideas to fit a spiritual agenda. &quot;I don't
<br />
think it's quite right to say I was 'tricked' into appearing,&quot; he said in a
<br />
statement reposted by a critic on &quot;What the Bleep's&quot; Internet forum, &quot;but it is
<br />
certainly the case that I was edited in such a way as to completely suppress my
<br />
actual views about the matters the movie discusses. I am, indeed, profoundly
<br />
unsympathetic to attempts at linking quantum mechanics with consciousness.
<br />
Moreover, I explained all that, at great length, on camera, to the producers of
<br />
the film ... Had I known that I would have been so radically misrepresented in
<br />
the movie, I would certainly not have agreed to be filmed.&quot;
<br />
&quot;I certainly do not subscribe to the 'Ramtha School on Enlightenment,' whatever
<br />
that is!&quot; he finished. Albert provided Salon with an excerpt from a piece he's
<br />
writing on the subject, in which he says, in part, &quot;I'm unwittingly made to
<br />
sound as if (maybe) I endorse its thesis.&quot;
<br />
When told of Albert's complaints, Gottlieb said, &quot;I certainly don't see it,&quot; but
<br />
acknowledged he's &quot;not into the science 100 percent.&quot; At press time, the
<br />
filmmakers issued an angry &quot;Open Letter to the U.S. Media&quot; in which it attacked
<br />
the &quot;intellectual smugness and superiority&quot; of its critics. (You can download
<br />
the PDF file here.)[&lt;<a href="http://www.gorenfeld.net/images/response.pdf">http://www.gorenfeld.net/images/response.pdf</a>&gt;]
<br />
<br />Knight's role as the voice of Ramtha is the most striking -- but hardly the only
<br />
-- omission of the film, which could easily be interpreted as a full-blown
<br />
infomercial for Ramtha. Two other on-screen experts are not identified as
<br />
Ramtha associates: Dr. Joe Dispenza, chiropractor and mystic, listed as a
<br />
student on the Ramtha Web site; and a man identified only as &quot;Dr. Miceal
<br />
Ledwith.&quot;
<br />
Ledwith (at one time Monsignor Michael Ledwith) was once on track to be the next
<br />
archbishop of Dublin, but the theologian stepped down as president of Maynooth
<br />
College in 1994, after a complaint that he had sexually harassed a young
<br />
seminarian. It was later revealed that Ledwith had allegedly paid an six-figure
<br />
sum to a man who accused him of sexual abuse. Ledwith has maintained his
<br />
innocence but left Ireland for the more placid confines of Monterey, Calif. On
<br />
the &quot;Bleep&quot; Web site, Ledwith's relationship with the Catholic Church is only
<br />
alluded to in a claim that he was once &quot;charged with advising the Holy See on
<br />
theological matters,&quot; but he is not identified as ever having been a priest, or
<br />
even as a lecturer at the Ramtha school. According to a Ramtha Web site, Ledwith
<br />
has joined &quot;Ramtha's core of appointed teachers.&quot; (The Ramtha school and Ledwith
<br />
have not responded to requests for interviews. The &quot;Bleep&quot; Web site recommends
<br />
that journalists contact an independent publicist, but the movie previously
<br />
listed as its P.R. contact Pavel Mikoloski, also director of public affairs for
<br />
Ramtha's school.)
<br />
Later in the film, a &quot;scientist&quot; explains that, thanks to the strangeness
<br />
quivering below the subatomic level, meditating monks have lowered the crime
<br />
rate in Washington, D.C. But not until the end of the film do we learn that the
<br />
scientist making this claim, John Hagelin -- who once ran for president --
<br />
conducted the research while teaching (until 1999) at Maharishi University, the
<br />
school named for the Beatles' guru. In JZ Knight's own publications, Ramtha's
<br />
existence, too, is frequently explained in terms of quantum mechanics.
<br />
Funding for the $5 million &quot;Bleep,&quot; according to various published interviews
<br />
with the film's creators, comes not from Ramtha but the software fortunes of
<br />
director Arntz, who designed the job-management application AutoSys. Now
<br />
popular in Unix environments, the program sold for more than $14 million in
<br />
1995. (Eerily, the startup money for AutoSys was also of Atlantean origin, or
<br />
so the original investor claimed. A 1999 piece in Wired by David Diamond
<br />
described the life and suicide of Frederick Lenz III, a guru in his own right,
<br />
who called himself not Ramtha but Rama. The software mogul told those who
<br />
rendezvoused with Rama that he'd taught meditation classes on Atlantis. Later,
<br />
Lenz said his students were bent on his murder, and he plunged himself into the
<br />
waters of Long Island Sound with a $30,000 watch on his wrist and 150 tabs of
<br />
Valium in his bloodstream.)
<br />
On the film's Web site FAQ, the filmmakers answer the question of whether
<br />
&quot;Bleep&quot; is a recruitment film coyly, stating that &quot;the short answer is no.
<br />
During the making of the film [originally to be titled 'Sacred Science'] it was
<br />
decided that what was important was the message, not the messenger -- whoever
<br />
that may be. Some people may be inspired to check out RSE, and some people may
<br />
be inspired to major at MIT in quantum teleportation.&quot; (At press time, MIT was
<br />
not yet offering such a major.)
<br />
<br />Ramtha's School of Enlightenment had previously promoted itself in its own
<br />
films, but those had a lower budget. One was &quot;Bleep&quot; director Mark Vicente's
<br />
2002 &quot;Where Angels Fear to Thread.&quot; Its trailer (available here) introduces
<br />
Ramtha in the fashion of &quot;Lord of the Rings,&quot; swinging a blade and raising a
<br />
goblet to &quot;the challenge of being an individual.&quot;
<br />
&quot;Bleep&quot; is a much slicker introduction. Its success relies heavily on word of
<br />
mouth, accelerated by the use of &quot;Bleep Teams&quot; organized by Captured Light
<br />
Industries, the production house set up by Arntz to create &quot;Bleep.&quot; (The film's
<br />
other production house, Lord of the Wind, is named for Ramtha himself.)
<br />
Heading the Bay Area street team is Kathy Vaquilar, who organized regular
<br />
&quot;Bleep&quot; events in at least two cities a week during August. On Saturday, Aug.
<br />
14, she helped organize a discussion in Berkeley that featured a Ramtha
<br />
representative, Cindy, &quot;who told us more about the film's background, how it
<br />
got started, and about the school,&quot; she posted on the &quot;What the Bleep&quot; forum
<br />
the next day, when the movement was spreading to nearby Walnut Creek. The next
<br />
night, a meeting was slated for San Francisco.
<br />
<br /><br />Vaquilar told Salon that she coordinates the &quot;Bleep&quot; campaign with a
<br />
representative of Captured Light. &quot;I don't know that much about the Ramtha
<br />
school,&quot; she wrote in an e-mail to Salon, and hastens to defend its role.
<br />
Knight, she writes, &quot;was only used as an interview subject. What is taught at
<br />
the school might seem weird to most mainstream people, but for those who study
<br />
or read the same materials on their own without any connection to the school or
<br />
to JZ Knight, their stuff is not considered unusual, but rather part of what's
<br />
already cutting edge.&quot;
<br />
That edge is something Vaquilar is familiar with. In August she promoted the
<br />
film at the Bay Area's UFO expo in Santa Clara, serving double duty with the
<br />
International Contact Support Network, which comforts those who say they've
<br />
encountered extraterrestrials. Vaquilar herself has written about meeting
<br />
insectoids, who treated her fairly well; but Knight, speaking in the voice of
<br />
Ramtha, has warned her own followers of the &quot;Gray Men,&quot; a clique of hostile
<br />
off-worlders controlling Earth's banks.
<br />
On the surface, the movie doesn't seem to be targeting the E.T.-obsessed; in
<br />
fact, it seems to follow in the footsteps of Carl Sagan's &quot;Cosmos&quot; by asking us
<br />
to thrill to the tapestry of space-time. But it has very little patience for
<br />
Enlightenment concepts like measurable results and scientific proof. In the new
<br />
science of &quot;Bleep,&quot; symbolized by disembodied equations and CG bubbles flying at
<br />
us like stars at warp speed, we're past all that.
<br />
We're also told that when Columbus came to America, the natives literally
<br />
couldn't see his ships. They couldn't think outside the box of Indian life. And
<br />
in a subway that seems like one of many conceits borrowed from the &quot;Matrix&quot;
<br />
movies (whose metaphor has similarly been borrowed by David Icke, the British
<br />
author who says the world is controlled by lizard men), the heroine learns that
<br />
you can see chi energy particles of love, that they've been captured in
<br />
photographs of water blessed by Buddhists. At this juncture Matlin hears a
<br />
voice in her ear: &quot;Makes you wonder, doesn't it?&quot; It's Quark, the greedy alien
<br />
from &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;! Actually, it's the guy who plays him, Armin
<br />
Shimerman, as one of several mysterious strangers guiding her to the truth.
<br />
The impression left from sitting through a screening of &quot;What the Bleep&quot; is that
<br />
a lot of people enjoy hearing their griping about religious fundamentalists
<br />
reflected back to them, backed by science. There's also plenty of stroking of
<br />
lefty values; Ramtha has declared that all world religions have in common &quot;the
<br />
suppression of women,&quot; adding, with the brashness surely fashionable in the
<br />
33rd century B.C., &quot;No woman who had an abortion has sinned against God. Fuck
<br />
all those assholes who tell you that.&quot; On the other hand, papers from Knight's
<br />
1992 divorce case with Jeffrey Knight hint that Ramtha is an ancient homophobe,
<br />
who allegedly declared that AIDS was Mother Nature's way of &quot;getting rid of&quot;
<br />
homosexuality and told Jeffrey Knight he should reject modern medicine and
<br />
overcome the disease using the school's breathing techniques, according to
<br />
court testimony. Tom Szimhart, a &quot;deprogrammer&quot; who testified on behalf of
<br />
Knight's husband (who eventually died of the disease) called the Ramtha school
<br />
a cult with an anti-scientific bent.
<br />
The &quot;backward&quot; religion of Christianity, Ramtha explains in the movie, doesn't
<br />
appreciate how the parables of Jesus are explained by photon waves and
<br />
probability -- just as creationists suggest that the latest archaeological
<br />
science can explain Noah's Ark and a very young Grand Canyon. The cumulative
<br />
effect of &quot;What the Bleep&quot; -- whose co-director, Betsy Chasse, produced the
<br />
evangelical teen comedy &quot;Extreme Days&quot; (2000) -- makes you wonder if it isn't
<br />
as fundamentalist as the Christianity and Islam that Ramtha inveighs against.
<br />
<br /><br />Even the father of the Isn't the Universe Amazing genre, the late Sagan, called
<br />
Ramtha out. He opened his 1997 book &quot;The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a
<br />
Candle in the Dark&quot; by asking why, if Ramtha is 35,000 years old, he gives us
<br />
only &quot;banal homilies&quot; (sample: &quot;I have come to help you over the ditch ... It
<br />
is called the ditch of limitation&quot;) instead of telling us, say, about the
<br />
currency, technology, social order and use of birth control in prehistoric
<br />
Lemuria -- a country popularized by Madame Blavatsky, the
<br />
turn-of-the-20th-century psychic. Sagan's argument, which couldn't be further
<br />
from the movie's, is that science has exposed so many natural wonders, there's
<br />
no need to gild the lily with gray aliens, telepaths and the spirits of
<br />
Cro-Magnon shoguns roaming the Evergreen State.
<br />
Needless to say the book isn't on the film's reading list, which instead
<br />
suggests reading the works of Ramtha.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Quoting Giu1i0 Pri5c0 &lt;pgptag.domain.name.hidden&gt;:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Has anyone seen this movie? Looks interesting - santatcruztoday.com:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This sure-to-be cult favorite is a hybrid of documentary and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; melodrama, combining a story about an unhappy, divorced photographer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Marlee Matlin) wandering the streets of Portland, Ore., with highly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; abstract theoretical constructs about the nature of God and &quot;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wacky, weird world of quantum physics.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The movie has a website (<a href="http://www.whatthebleep.com/">http://www.whatthebleep.com/</a>): WHAT THE BLEEP
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; DO WE KNOW?! is a new type of film. It is part documentary, part
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; story, and part elaborate and inspiring visual effects and animations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The protagonist, Amanda, played by Marlee Matlin, finds herself in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fantastic Alice in Wonderland experience when her daily, uninspired
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; life literally begins to unravel, revealing the uncertain world of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quantum field hidden behind what we consider to be our normal, waking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality... The fourteen top scientists and mystics interviewed in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; documentary style serve as a modern day Greek Chorus. In an artful
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; filmic dance, their ideas are woven together as a tapestry of truth.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The thoughts and words of one member of the chorus blend into those of

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the next, adding further emphasis to the film's underlying concept of
