Marc:
<br />
your considerations are enlightening. I am no mathematician so I try to
<br />
evaluate your (and others') remarks in a &quot;broader&quot; sense - and get diverse
<br />
thoughts.
<br />
Your question is more and more relevant and less and less explained by those
<br />
who &quot;live&quot; in math. Tom wrote: math is invariant, but is it still? The world
<br />
is NOT invariant, it is a ceaseless process of change and we take snapshots.
<br />
Math puts explanatory logic on such snapshots, so far (?) invariance-wise,
<br />
staying within.
<br />
(Goedel stepped further and I suspect: Bruno as well).
<br />
So I had to conclude: mathematicians are conservative, not advancing with
<br />
the trend of a dynamic view of 'everything' - unless my above hint to &quot;newer
<br />
math&quot; holds. I could not explain (1st person) (to myself) WHAT such math
<br />
could be.
<br />
Or: what the 'new' sense of &quot;NUMBER&quot; may be, everything is no answer. Then I
<br />
do not need a new statement. Then I have an old  noumenon: with a new word.
<br />
I would leave that to the dictionary-writers.
<br />
<br />About your time-dimension(S): in THIS UNIVERSE  a time-concept arose by the
<br />
inside view according to the restricted qualia forming our world. Not
<br />
differently from space and the combination of these: movement, referring in
<br />
abstraction: to change. So we have the 'right' to formulate multiple
<br />
concepts for them.
<br />
Mathematics, the invention of the human mind (after Bohm) is a stage in our
<br />
epistemic enlightenment and is the product of restriction since we (humans)
<br />
use a materially (figment!) limited tool: the human brain, for thinking. It
<br />
is not restrictive to the ...(?) existence? nature? everything? even:
<br />
reality? beyond us.
<br />
I leave it open that 'other' universes, composed by other qualia, may have
<br />
'other' concepts than ours. Time etc. Logic etc. Math on 'variant' units,
<br />
unrestricted variables and dimensions (whatever these are)
<br />
<br />I use 'timelessness' as a variation: thought is atemporal, aspatial. We CAN
<br />
think in those restrictions, but also transcending them. So several
<br />
time-dimensions are not so 'radical' for me. I may not be able to
<br />
'concretize' them, but not excludable.
<br />
<br />Your use of causality is also universe-bound. In a total interconnectedness
<br />
I figure a continuous change of everything with influence of everything on
<br />
everything (is it culminating in Hal R's nothingness?) so all changes are
<br />
deterministic even if we cannot follow all angles. Change comes from change,
<br />
influence changes influence.
<br />
We &quot;pick&quot; causes in our limited model-view, looking for influences and
<br />
origins 'within' our (boundary-enclosed) topical? model we can think in.
<br />
Then we find a most likely &quot;cause&quot;, just disregarding the 'rest of the
<br />
world' with its combined entailment, outside our observational limitations.
<br />
<br />I do not base my speculations on ideas of (maybe ingenious) earlier thinkers
<br />
too much (how much? good question) because the epistemic cognitive inventory
<br />
at &quot;their&quot; time was meager, humanity is continuously increasing the 'stuff'
<br />
we can think in, with, about, for, by etc. and do not restrict myself by
<br />
'accepted' limiting rules - maxims? like e.g.. the 'expanding universe' and
<br />
its consequences all the way to e.g. the Everett to Tegmar type multiverse
<br />
or even the Flat Earth as center of the universe (according to Einstein it
<br />
may (or may not) well be it, since movements are relative, no matter how
<br />
complicated it may be), adding to that the limited model view of our
<br />
physicists (including Q-science).
<br />
The figment of our traditionally built edifice of a physical world and its
<br />
'rules' is very impressive and practically exploitable, including 'math' (in
<br />
which I, too, do differentiate  between the 'ideal' (pure?) 'Math' and the
<br />
applied 'math' (using
<br />
(Robert Rosen's capitalization) applying the former's results to the latter,
<br />
with limited model-quantities derived from the (scientific?) physical view.
<br />
<br />Thank you for triggering the formulation of these thoughts of mine by your
<br />
post.
<br />
I am not ready with my speculations to discuss them with people well versed
<br />
in worldviews based on foundation of different knowledge-base 'sciences'.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ah, waht is mathematics?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I suspect humans could spend their life-times pondering this profound
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; question and never fully understand.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm a mathematical realist in the sense that I think mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entities are real objective properties of reality and not just human
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inventions, but I've come to seriously doubt the Platonist idea that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematics is static and timeless.  Rather I now favor the idea that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical truth can evolve with time.  See Greg Chaitin for some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ideas about this.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As some of you may, know, I've suggested some radical ideas about time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on this list: namely the idea that there may be more than one time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dimension, in the sense that there may be more than one valid way to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; define cause and effect relations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My big big idea is that mathematics could be a sort of 'higher order
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; causality' ,or, if you like a 'higher dimensional time'.  This is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible if some mathematical truths are not static, but can evolve
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Suppose that causality itself had a two-level structure, with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'mathematical time' on the top level, and what we think of as physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time on the bottom level.  This two level time structure is compatible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with David Bohm's interpretation of QM where reality indeed has a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; two-level structure - both the wave function and the particle are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; equally real but correspond to different levels of reality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The two-level time structure could also explain the difference between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the 1st person and 3rd person perspectives and resolve the puzzle of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; flowing time versus platonic timelessness.
