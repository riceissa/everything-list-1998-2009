<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;I know that sounds somewhat solipsist in the end, but I can't believe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;that merely scanning me can affect my future. And I would like to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;be convinced otherwise, because I don't like solipsism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What do you mean, &quot;the only way I could be convinced otherwise is by doing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the test&quot;? You agree that there is no 3rd person difference, but the whole
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point is that there can't be any *1st* person difference either! What do you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; imagine this 1st person difference could be?
</em><br />
<br />The first person difference would be that if I press the button 1000 times,
<br />
I believe I would still not leave the room. Of course, in a 3rd person
<br />
perspective, you would not be convinced, because of course *someone*
<br />
is still gonna stay in the room. 
<br />
<br />If you want, you can imagine that I am talking about a &quot;soul&quot;, even though
<br />
that brings unintended religious connotations.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Actually, I sympathise with you, because for many years I wondered, if I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; went into a teleporter, would the person who came out the other end really
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be me, or would I have been committing suicide? Then a few years ago, on a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sunday afternoon driving home from the supermarket, it suddenly dawned on me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that this was a crazy question. Other than thinking I was me, remembering my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thoughts, behaving like me, looking like me, etc., what other evidence could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there possibly be that the copy really was me? 
</em><br />
<br />I agree there is no 3rd person communicable evidence. But if you did the
<br />
experiment 1000 times and never left the room, would you be convinced
<br />
if someone told you that the next time you press the button there's a 50%
<br />
chance that you would be in New York?
<br />
<br />Of course in a 3rd person perspective this would be the one Stathis that
<br />
remained in the room, and you would say that this one has no claim of
<br />
being Stathis more than all the others have. But still, if you happened to
<br />
be that one, would you believe it's just a coincidence, and the next time
<br />
you could really go to New York?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If I were to be consistent, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would have to wonder whether the person I was a few months ago was &quot;really
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; me&quot;, because the atoms comprising my body today are probably completely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different. In fact, in *every respect* the person I was a few months ago
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; differs more from me as I am today than I would differ from a teleported
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; copy. In what way is the destruction of the original in teleportation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different to the destruction of the original which occurs in the course of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; normal life, other than the speed with which it happens? If you collected
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all the discarded matter from your body over the course of a year, you would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probably have more than enough to build a whole alternative person. Would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you consider that person &quot;dead&quot;, replaced by a mere copy? If not, could you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; give a consistent explanation for why you would consider teleportation to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; basically different?
</em><br />
<br />I do not equate my identity with the matter that composes my body at all.
<br />
I would say that my personal identity cannot be defined in a
<br />
communicable way, in the way I see it. I believe there is something
<br />
fundamental about consciousness.
<br />
<br />I guess that my position could be made analogous to the following thought
<br />
experiment: suppose you are playing a virtual simulation game, and in the
<br />
game you enter a copy machine just like the one we are discussing. The
<br />
game is programmed to feed your (real) brain with the experience of being in
<br />
the same room every time you press the button but seing all these copies
<br />
of your virtual body being created in New York. Of course there's no question
<br />
of who you are. You are not the copies in New York. While playing the game
<br />
you do not feel concerned that you could suddenly appear in New York and
<br />
be trapped in the simulation after pressing the button.
<br />
<br />In this example my identity would undoubtedly be located in my real brain.
<br />
I imagine an analogous situation for my identity in the real world, with
<br />
the difference that I can't (or I don't know how to) unplug from it. But
<br />
clearly it is not located in my body anymore than it was located in my
<br />
virtual body inside the simulation.
<br />
<br />But of course I find this position quite uncomfortable, because I cannot
<br />
acount for other people's consciousness in any well defined way. And 
<br />
since I don't like solipsism, i.e., I like to believe in other people's
<br />
consciousness, I must say it's deeply unsatisfactory. 
<br />
<br />But not enough to believe that I could experience being teleported to New
<br />
York.
<br />
<br />Eric.
