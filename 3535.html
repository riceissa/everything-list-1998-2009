The online magazine The Edge has a set of &quot;hard questions&quot; by experts
<br />
and notables in a variety of fields, some of which discuss multiverse
<br />
theories.  <a href="http://www.edge.org/q2002/question.02_index.html">http://www.edge.org/q2002/question.02_index.html</a>.
<br />
<br />Paul Davies critiques the multiverse+anthropic_principle explanation
<br />
for what we see, in <a href="http://www.edge.org/q2002/q_davies2.html">http://www.edge.org/q2002/q_davies2.html</a>:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Martin raises the question of whether what we consider to be
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fundamental laws of physics are in fact merely local bylaws applicable
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the universe we perceive. Implicit in this assumption is the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fact that there are laws of some sort anyway. By definition, a law
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a property of nature that is independent of time. We still need to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;explain why universes come with such time-independent lawlike features,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even if a vast and random variety of laws is on offer. One might try to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;counter this by invoking an extreme version of the anthropic theory in
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which there are no laws, just chaos. The apparent day-by-day lawfulness
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the universe would then itself be anthropically selected: if a
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;crucial regularity of nature suddenly failed, observers would die and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cease to observe. But this theory seems to be rather easily falsified.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Sir Martin points out, if a particular remarkable aspect of the laws
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is anthropically selected from a truly random set, then we would expect
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on statistical grounds the aspect concerned to be just sufficient to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;permit biological observers. Consider, then, the law of conservation
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of electric charge. At the atomic level, this law is implied by the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assumed constancy of the fine-structure constant. (I shall sidestep
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;recent claims that this number might vary over cosmological time
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scales.) Suppose there were no such fundamental law, and the unit of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;electric charge varied randomly from moment to moment? Would that
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be life-threatening? Not if the variations were small enough. The
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fine-structure constant affects atomic fine-structure, not gross
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;structure, so that most chemical properties on which life as we know
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it depends are not very sensitive to the actual value of this number.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the fine-structure constant is known to be constant to better
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than one part in a hundred million. A related quantity, the anamolous
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;magnetic moment of the electron, is known to be constant to even
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;greater accuracy. Variations several orders of magnitude larger than
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this would not render the universe hostile to carbon-based life. So
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the constancy of electric charge at the atomic level is an example of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a regularity of nature far in excess of what is demanded by anthropic
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;considerations. Even a multiverse theory that treated this regularity
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as a bylaw would need to explain why such a bylaw exists.
<br />
<br />It seems that this point can be addressed pretty well by the flavor
<br />
of multiverse theories we consider here, in which &quot;simple&quot; universes
<br />
are inherently more likely than more complex ones.  In this model we
<br />
would predict that the universe would be just as complex as necessary
<br />
to support our kind of life, but no more so.
<br />
<br />For a constant to be stable to better than 1/100,000,000 is not that
<br />
surprising; it is plausible that the simplest theory has that constant
<br />
being absolutely stable.  It would take more information to specify
<br />
a formula for variation of some physical unit than to specify a single
<br />
value which never varies.
<br />
<br />The &quot;Sir Martin&quot; article being responded to above is interesting in its
<br />
own right, as an attempt to justify exploring the multiverse concept
<br />
despite some complaints that it is metaphysics rather than physics.
<br />
In <a href="http://www.edge.org/q2002/q_rees.html">http://www.edge.org/q2002/q_rees.html</a> Martin Rees gives his own
<br />
example of an apparent departure from simplicity: the fact that our
<br />
universe seems to have a considerable portion of its mass in dark matter,
<br />
which doesn't do anything obviously useful.  Of course it may well be
<br />
that dark matter plays an important role in the formation of galaxies,
<br />
which allow for the formation of 2nd-generation stars which have enough
<br />
heavy elements that they can have planets.
