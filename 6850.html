<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on even days his total measure was higher, so that double the usual number

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of versions of Hal were generated in other branches of the multiverse, who

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would go on to have separate and distinct lives. Aiming for more good

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiences on even days would then be an altruistic thing for Hal to do, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; since it would result in greater happiness in the multiverse as a whole. If, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instead, it was more like my example, where a copy of Hal's mind is run on a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computer in lockstep with his biological mind on even days, and the computer 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; switched off on odd days, then what possible difference could it make to Hal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or anyone else, given what we have just said about the definition of an OM?
</em><br />
<br />To clarify, I did indeed mean the equivalent of this latter case,
<br />
where by some means on even numbered days I had more measure, and
<br />
on odd numbered days my measure was then reduced to a lower amount.
<br />
This might be done as you say by running a computer in lockstep with my
<br />
mind on even days and shutting it off on odd days, if you accept that
<br />
doing so will increase the measure of the even days.
<br />
<br />My message is at <a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m6592.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m6592.html</a> .
<br />
<br />The argument is fundamentally that creating a bunch of good experiences is
<br />
better than creating a bunch of bad ones.  Shutting the computer down doesn't
<br />
matter.  That just means that the good experiences won't be remembered.  But
<br />
they were still real, they were still experienced.
<br />
<br />After all, many people believe our own lives are finite in extent and
<br />
that after we die we will have no more memories of our lives.  But they
<br />
(mostly) don't conclude from that that it is irrelevant whether people
<br />
suffer or experience pleasure.  Even finite lives deserve to be as happy
<br />
as possible.  This is true whether they last for one day or 100 years.
<br />
<br />And worse, almost all of the moments of our lives are forgotten within
<br />
days if not minutes.  Most moments make essentially no impact on our
<br />
memories.  We can't remember what it felt like to brush our teeth on
<br />
February 9.  Yet, even knowing this, we still try to make our lives as
<br />
pleasant and comfortable as we can.  Even though we would have known
<br />
(had we thought about it) as we were brushing our teeth that day, that we
<br />
would not remember that moment, that it would soon be forgotten as surely
<br />
as if we had never lived it, we would still try to make the experience
<br />
as pleasant and non-painful as possible.
<br />
<br />All these examples are meant to show that we act as though we care about
<br />
giving good experiences even though we know they will be forgotten and
<br />
not have lasting impact.  If we extend that principle more generally,
<br />
I think it follows that we should try to have good experiences on days
<br />
when we have high measure.
