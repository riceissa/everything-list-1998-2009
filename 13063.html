<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />If you assume an ensemble theory, whether it be an infinite MWI or Bruno&#x2019;s
<br />
UD in the plenitude, is it POSSIBLE to avoid God?  For the purposes of this
<br />
question I&#x2019;ll define &#x201c;God&#x201d; as an entity capable of creating everything that
<br />
would be observed to exist in a (all possible) quantum mechanical universe.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />God has to choose only among QM universes? Does that God obey QM Eself?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Bruno, as a starting point, I concede that discussion of things
</em><br />
occurring outside the quantum-mechanical multiverse is metaphysical.
<br />
Certainly other realities can be discussed (Tegmark, and for that matter the
<br />
UD in the plenitude), but for the purposes of the question I was
<br />
specifically limiting the subject to the creation of the type of universe we
<br />
observe, because we are having to work off the laws of physics we know to
<br />
attempt and answer the question, and the issue is the creation of what we
<br />
observe, not other realities.  So it&#x2019;s not that &#x201c;God&#x201d; has to choose QM
<br />
universes, it&#x2019;s that I&#x2019;m only interested in whether an entity capable of
<br />
creating QM universes (whatever you call it) is an inevitable result of an
<br />
assumed ensemble theory.  Of course, as I described in the original post,
<br />
the entity does not have to actually create QM universes necessarily.  It
<br />
would achieve the same effect as to observers if it simply understood how to
<br />
emulate brain states of observers that existed in QM universes.    
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />To avoid God are we back to some kind of &#x201c;primitive physical&#x201d; idea that
<br />
there is something about the nature of reality that will forever prohibit
<br />
intelligence from emulating it?  
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />We cannot, knowingly, emulate a first person in any third person way. For
<br />
example we can emulate perfectly both the comp and the quantum indeterminacy
<br />
.. up to the measurement procedure, which can still be emulate but only by
<br />
emulating the observer himself. But this can be done with any classical or
<br />
quantum universal machine, but then only serendipitously.
<br />
I prefer translate the &quot;primitive physical idea&quot; as the idea that there is a
<br />
primitive physical world which is responsible for appearances. But this
<br />
already contradict the comp hypothesis (for example by the UDA argument, but
<br />
you can also look at Plotinus or Proclus).
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />That it is impossible even in theory to build a kind of &#x201c;universal quantum
<br />
constructor&#x201d;?  
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />It is impossible to build a universal *prover* or knower. But we can build
<br />
universal classical or quantum constructor or computer.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Or is the idea one that physics will forever prohibit intelligence from
<br />
acquiring the resources necessary to achieve such a feat? 
<br />
<br /><br />Neither math nor physics prohibit this. Math only prohibit universal machine
<br />
prover or knower.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />How can you have everything, but not have something capable of creating
<br />
everything?  If you assume for instance the UD in the plenitude (no
<br />
intelligent action required), doesn&#x2019;t it eventually describe intelligence
<br />
with access to infinite or near infinite resources capable of creating an
<br />
&#x201c;artificial&#x201d; UD?  
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />Sure. But why? The UD is needed in an argument. Real platonic UDs are enough
<br />
for the rest. Note that this can and should be tested.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />If the answer is yes the whole debate over God seems to become a silly
<br />
argument over semantics.  
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />You are quite fuzzy about God, and your basic assumptions. Do you assume a
<br />
*primitive* physical universe? 
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;I&#x2019;ll be happy to hear where I&#x2019;m wrong on all this.  Please be kind, I&#x2019;ve
<br />
been away from these sorts of discussions for quite a while!
<br />
<br /><br /><br />No problem, but you could be clearer about your assumption, or I am perhaps
<br />
missing something.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;  Thanks for your responses Bruno, I&#x2019;ll respond as to my assumptions when
</em><br />
I have more time.

<br />Why should there be?  Values are relative to people.  Love is our word.  We
<br />
invented it to describe what we feel.  Having some Platonic form of LOVE out
<br />
there is superfluous.  You're just making up a requirement for &quot;the really
<br />
real ding-an-sich&quot; so that you can say God provides it.
<br />
<br /><br />You could replace &quot;love&quot; with &quot;chocolate&quot; and &quot;God&quot; with &quot;the chocolate
<br />
fairy&quot;. You can claim that while the reason people like chocolate can be
<br />
explained in terms of chemistry, physiology, evolutionary biology etc., only
<br />
the chocolate fairy can give ultimate meaning to the chocolate eating
<br />
experience.
