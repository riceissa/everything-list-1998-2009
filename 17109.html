</em><br />
<br />Blimey!  Thanks, Peter - you couldn't have expressed a circular
<br />
argument more succinctly!  However, my reformulation is inevitably
<br />
equally circular (retaining the - presumably intentionally - ironic
<br />
use of 'uncontroversially') viz:
<br />
<br />&quot;Since the physical is uncontroversially not a fundamental item in
<br />
mentality, it has to be
<br />
higher-level or emergent in some way, like shoes and ships and sealing-wax.&quot;
<br />
<br />So you pays your money.....?  But no: the insuperable (AFAICS)
<br />
advantage of the second formulation is that 'mentality' (i.e. what is
<br />
real in the sense that I am real) is uniquely given - it is the fons
<br />
et origo of any inference, and hence justifies its direction in the
<br />
second case, whilst annihilating it in the first.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But you haven't said what the problem is in the emergence of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from the physical
</em><br />
<br />On the contrary, I've said it repeatedly.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; For dualism you need materalism AND the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mental AND an unbridgeable gap. You keep leaving the gap out.
</em><br />
<br />I'm left with the nagging sense that perhaps we're just violently
<br />
agreeing and the confusion is over semantics.  We both require a
<br />
justification for reality-in-the-sense-I-am-real.  Obviously this
<br />
requires an account of shoes and ships and sealing-wax not only on the
<br />
basis of our direct knowledge of them in these terms, but also in the
<br />
multiplicity of other ways that directly given elements can be
<br />
re-ordered - including of course those concerned with the heuristics
<br />
of their behaviour, such as whatever version of theoretical physics is
<br />
currently in favour.  Neither of us believes that a coherent account
<br />
in terms of more than one ontological mode of subsistence is either
<br />
necessary or possible.  But an entity is more than the mere sum of
<br />
whatever properties we can abstract from it.  So if what you're saying
<br />
could be reduced to the claim that there must be a unique ontology
<br />
that is consistent with all of the foregoing, and that you prefer to
<br />
call it physical, we could agree.
<br />
<br />One caveat however - and I think this is at the root of your permanent
<br />
disagreement with Bruno.  If we are to accept the 'physical' narrative
<br />
as the fundamental justification of what it is to be RITSIAR, then the
<br />
explanatory entities and relationships deployed for this purpose must
<br />
be justified explicitly and exclusively in terms of 'really physical'
<br />
entities and relations.  Consequently, it is incoherent to postulate
<br />
'functional' relationships across such boundaries as constitutive of
<br />
anything RITSIAR, because this opens up a veritable infinity of
<br />
alternative, arbitrarily abstracted, 'causal' inferences.
<br />
Consequently, and - I can't help adding - *obviously*, since we cannot
<br />
credit *all* of these abstractions with the needful causal potency, we
<br />
are all the more unjustified in privileging any *one* of them.
<br />
<br />So Bruno's point, fundamentally, is that if we're going to argue for
<br />
functional justification of the mental - in the sense of RITSIAR -
<br />
then said functional entities and relations must be postulated to be
<br />
'really real'.  COMP just axiomatises the functional entities and
<br />
relations that are held to be RITSIAR.  Bruno is sometimes a little
<br />
difficult to pin down on the foundational RITSIAR-ness of the 'number
<br />
realm', perhaps because his attention is focused more on what he can
<br />
do with it.  But if one simply can't stomach the idea that 'platonic
<br />
numbers' are what is really real, then fair enough.  But then one must
<br />
abjure functional-computational justifications for the 'mental':
<br />
again, fair enough (it's probably closer to my own prejudice).  But
<br />
unless you're an eliminativist about the mental, you can't have it
<br />
both ways.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Idealism does not save appearances. It cannot explain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; how there was a mindless universe for millions of years before
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; life evolved, for instance. Idealists usually have to flatly deny that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particular
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appearance.
</em><br />
<br />But I think we can save them quite handily.  First, calling something
<br />
'idealism' just pumps the intuition that there have to be sort of
<br />
bright images everywhere independent of 'minds'.  The problem here is
<br />
that we're stuck with folk vocabulary that drags in extraneous notions
<br />
left, right and centre causing an implosion of the imagination.  We
<br />
need to fix this, and I have a couple of suggestions.  The first was
<br />
in my reply to Rex, where I suggest, in answer to your implicit
<br />
question above, that the universe has to take things just as
<br />
personally as it needs to exist.  That, if you like, is the degree of
<br />
'mentality' (one of the terms that probably should be retired) you
<br />
might expect to exist before life evolved.  And you're right to
<br />
specify 'evolved' because whatever we mean by mind in the organic
<br />
sense would of course be vacuous if in constitution and function it
<br />
offered no evolutionary advantage.
<br />
<br />This leads to the second suggestion: what we call 'mind' is the
<br />
evolved capacity for representation, memory and intention directed
<br />
towards an environment, resulting from selected-for elaborations of
<br />
primitive but critically-similar potentials.  Of course, this is the
<br />
standard direction of any explanatory thrust, but with the critical
<br />
stipulation that we must be able to preserve the appearances from soup
<br />
to nuts: this is, as you point out, the nub.  Again, I don't insist on
<br />
any particular vocabulary, only the necessary sense.  As Popper
<br />
remarks, debate about words is futile - just clarify your terms until
<br />
the problem emerges precisely, or goes away.
<br />
<br />Of the above factors, the one that bears, I think, most on the
<br />
'appearance of mindlessness', is memory (a point made by Russell in
<br />
his neutral monist guise).  Essentially, we're 'conscious' of what we
<br />
can remember - this is inherent in the sense of re-presentation.  So
<br />
it may not in fact meet the case to hold that we're 'unaware' of what
<br />
we don't remember so well, but rather that 'primitive' awareness is
<br />
swamped in our memory by repeated re-presentation of dominant
<br />
higher-order themes.  In fact, introspection reveals the constant
<br />
coming and going of 'awarenesses' of every type and degree, shading to
<br />
ultimate forgetfulness.  IOW, 'consciousness' is just taking
<br />
particular things *so* personally that everything else is forgotten.
<br />
<br />So that, if you like, is the 'appearance' of mindlessness.

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; Cart before the horse:

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; Why should anyone believe in an ontological gap that isn't backed by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; an explanatory gap?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Why indeed?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Weren't you arguing for one?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; The mere existence of the mental implies nothing whatsoever
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; about any dualism any more than the simultaneous existence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; of cabbages and kings.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Well, I don't disagree with that, although I'm not quite sure what you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; intend by the dismissive 'mere'.  Our disagreements haven't usually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; been about the necessity of dualism, which I think we both abjure, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; rather whether mind is an abstraction from from matter or vice versa.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I'm not sure we'll ever agree on that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; Dualism requires an ontological divide--not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; a mere difference of kind--and an ontological divide requires
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; explanatory irreducibility.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Couldn't agree more.  However, my starting point is that the existence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of the mental (not to struggle over terminology) is indubitable, which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; makes the direction of abstraction mandatory if we want to save
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; monism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That doesn't follow at all. The epistemic fact that we are more sure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of A than B doesn't imply any metaphysical fact that B is reducible to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A rather
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than vice versa. The epistemic arrow and the metaphysical arrow are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; two different arrows. Since we are macroscopic, we are constructed to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; better access to high-level phenomena such as chairs and rocks than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fundamental particles that comprise them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Unless one denies reality to the mental (i.e. eliminativism)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I'm saying that further insistence on a material ontology in the usual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; sense is an implicit commitment to dualism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; THat doesn't follow either. For dualism you need materalism AND the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mental AND an unbridgeable gap. You keep leaving the gap out.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Specious relationship
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; terms such as 'functional equivalence', 'identical to', 'inside of'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and the like just mask this, IMO, and under examination can be seen to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; imply two-ness, not one-ness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Those positions have thei critics, but calling them
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'specious' is not criticism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  Further, in addition to its obvious (at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; least to me) merit of 'saving the appearances',
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Idealism does not save appearances. It cannot explain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; how there was a mindless universe for millions of years before
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; life evolved, for instance. Idealists usually have to flatly deny that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particular
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appearance.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; this narrative seems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to serve the rest of the story at least as handily as the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'externalised reality' version.  But I don't imagine we'll ever agree
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; on this either.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; BTW, perhaps I should clarify what I mean by 'the usual sense' of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; materialism, because it may be that this is part of any confusion.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; This sense is, I take it, the doctrine that reality is 'nothing but'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the material.  Stating it this way of course commits you, under
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; monism, to a purely abstract conception of the mental.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am not sure what you mean by abstract. Since the mental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is uncontroversially not a fundamental item in physics. it has to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; higher-level
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or emergent in some way, like shoes and ships and sealing-wax.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But you haven't said what the problem is in the emergence of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from the physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; unsatisfactory nature of this conception feeds the intuition of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'neutral' (perhaps not the best term) monism which could instantiate a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; spectrum of states spanning a mental-material 'dichotomy' now more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; apparent than real.  Any better?

<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Yes, sorry - am I REALLY being so unclear?  Obviously, as you say, it

<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; mind-material identity of any sort without doing violence to mind as

<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; manifestly radical ontological dichotomy between 'material-existence'

<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and 'mind-existence' is exhausted merely by description.
