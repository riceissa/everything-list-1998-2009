<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dear Stephen,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  We can go on and on about relations between states, numbers, UDs, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; whatever, but unless we have a consistent way to deal with the source
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; individuation and thus distinguishability, we are going nowhere...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [BM]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The source of individuation could be personal memory I think. Like a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sequence of W and M appears in the diary of someone subjected to an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; iterated WM-self-multiplication experiment. Memory is rather easy to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; define once we assume comp. The main difficulty here is to get an idea
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of what &quot;personal&quot; means, and for this we need a theory of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-reference, ... and that is what the diagonalization posts are all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does not the notion of &quot;memory&quot; carry with it some requirement of 
<br />
&quot;persistence under changes/transformations&quot;. It seems to be a lot like”invariance&quot;, 
<br />
but one that can be read and written. Pratt's restatement of Descartes 
<br />
dictum: &quot;I think, therefore I was&quot; can be easily seem to be equivalent to: 
<br />
&quot;I am what I remember (active reading of memory) myself to be.&quot;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comp, I am claiming requires more than just the mere a priori existence 
<br />
of AR (Platonic theory of Numbers), it requires a means to relate them to 
<br />
one another. This latter requirement seems to require both a means to relate 
<br />
and distinguish Numbers from each other. This is more than a linear 
<br />
superposition! We need a means to explain the appearance of Interaction: I 
<br />
read recently that some prominent scientist said something like that the 
<br />
physical realm is the means by which Numbers interact, I agree but go 
<br />
further to claim, with Pratt, that if we are required to have even some 
<br />
&quot;appearance&quot; of a physical realm, why not go all the way and put it on equal 
<br />
footing with the Ideals? (Symmetry anyone?!)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pratt solves the problem of dualism! Why do we still demand an 
<br />
incomplete and asymmetric Monism?
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the notion of &quot;personal&quot;, it seems to me that what we mean by such 
<br />
is some means of self-referencing that is capable of &quot;updating&quot;, this brings 
<br />
in the notion of &quot;memory&quot;... I still do not see how any form of 
<br />
diagonalization obtains self-referencing absent some means that allows the 
<br />
entries in the columns and rows to both &quot;be themselves&quot; and &quot;relate to each 
<br />
other&quot;.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goedelization works because we have the tacit idea that we can write a 
<br />
representation of a number as a symbol of something physical, giving it a 
<br />
persistence.... Where is the Platonic &quot;paper tape&quot;?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; ***
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [BM]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Concerning Pratt's dualism, it seems to me it is a purely mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dualism a priori coherent with number platonism, although further
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; studies could refute this. Open problem. I don't see Pratt reifying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; either primary matter or primary time, it seems to me.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pratt does not seek to reify neither a primary notion of matter or time. 
<br />
His Dualism becomes a Russellerian neutral Monism in the limit of Existence 
<br />
in itself. When the notion of distinguishability vanishes, so do all notions 
<br />
of Predicates and Properties, all that is left is mere Existence. This is 
<br />
why I am pounding hard on the apparent problem that monistic Platonism 
<br />
suffers from a severe problem, that it is only a coherent theory if and only 
<br />
if there is some &quot;subject&quot; to which the Forms have a meaning and this 
<br />
&quot;subject&quot; can not be a Form!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any form of Monism will have this severe incompleteness that has been 
<br />
heretofore overlooked because of the continued use of the tacit assumption 
<br />
of a 3rd person Point of View. Strip away the distinguishability that the 
<br />
3rd person entails and Forms become exactly isomorphic to each other.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pratt shows how the &quot;arrow of Time&quot; has a dual aspect, the &quot;arrow of 
<br />
logical implication&quot; and from this a very elegant explanation of 
<br />
interactions and causality follows, among other things... ;-) 
<br />
(Unfortunately, most readers of his papers do not seem to get past the 
<br />
abstract...)

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think a similar dualism appears in Plotinus cosmogony where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (simplifying a lot!) *from outside* the Good transforms itself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; degenerating eventually into Evil (also called Matter by the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (neo)platonist!) and by doing so makes the soul falling inexorably in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that matter) and *from inside* all souls extract themselves from that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter and are inexorably attracted by the Good and converge toward it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Arrows are reversed. And with comp it can be argued that the choice of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Categories of sets and its dual (which funnily enough gives the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; category of boolean algebras) is a genuine one, although some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quasi-constructive alpha-categories could fit in a still more better
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way (I think). But I have neither the time nor the competence to really
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; develop such approaches. Also, finding good notion of coherence here
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seems to me to be a little bit ad hoc so that I refer to you the the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comp derivation path of those coherence conditions.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, we are converging here, but with this proposed dualism the 
<br />
&quot;outside&quot; is the *neutral* monism of Existence. BTW, it is interesting to 
<br />
point out that the use of an equivalence between the notion of &quot;points&quot; and 
<br />
&quot;sets&quot; gives us the basic &quot;objects&quot; that make up our notions of &quot;space&quot;, all 
<br />
be have to add is a liberal amount of symmetry generators. This follows the 
<br />
same pattern as what is required to complete Mathematics: numbers and the 
<br />
relations between them.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bodies are the sets (as point and their interactions = Physics!) and 
<br />
Minds are the Boolean algebras (information structures and their 
<br />
implications = Computations!). Is this so hard to swallow?
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All we are asked to do here is do stop trying to make up a static 
<br />
Universe! This reminds me of Einstein's &quot;greatest mistake&quot;, his addition of 
<br />
a &quot;cosmological constant&quot; to make his field equation give a static solution. 
<br />
Look what that has lead to!
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Onward!
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Stephen
