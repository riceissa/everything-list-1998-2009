Hi Quentin,
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;What is the kind of universe we must live in if the electromagnetic field
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure of the brain delivers qualia?&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A. It is NOT the universe depicted by the qualia (atoma, molecules,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cells...). It is the universe whose innate capacity to deliver qualia is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; taken advantage of when configureed like it appears when we use qualia
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; themselves to explore it....cortical brain matter. (NOTE: Please do not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; make the mistake that sensors - peripheral affect -  are equivalent to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; qualia.)
</em><br />
<br /><br />I will only react to this...
<br />
<br />and I will deposit a large collection of weirdness for you to ponder....
<br />
<br />Q. What is cortical brain matter ?
<br />
Let us call our first candidate consistent with all the fatcs a monism
<br />
made of MON_STUFF. We must give ourselves the latitude to consider various
<br />
candidates.  For the purposes it does not matter what it is. I will try
<br />
and answer your questions by bringing in properties. So.... cortical brain
<br />
matter is made of a collection of MON_STUFF. Not atoms. Atoms are
<br />
organised MON_STUFF. Quarks are organised MON_STUFF. The MON_STUFF I
<br />
choose, that seems to deliver everything I need and is the simplest
<br />
possible choice:  is 'the fluctuation'.
<br />
<br />Q. Does it exists by itself?
<br />
No. It is nested MON_STUFF all the way down. It is intrinsically dynamic
<br />
and fleeting. Anything made of MON_STUFF is persistent organisational
<br />
structure within a massive collection of fleeting change. Exactly like the
<br />
shapes in the water coming out of a garden hose. There is a critical
<br />
minimum collection of it, from which all subsequent structure is derived.
<br />
That minimum is created like collections of turbulent water molecules
<br />
breaks off and self-sustains a eddy/vortex once a critical threshold is
<br />
reached. Ultimately there is no need to prescribe an ultimate minimum
<br />
'atom-ish' minimal size MON_STUFF fluctuation to predict qualia. Someone
<br />
else's problem. I don't need to solve that. The fluctuation model
<br />
works...that's all I need to progress.
<br />
<br />Q. if so, what is it composed of (matter ?) ?
<br />
Well it's not, so I don't have to fall into this logical hole.
<br />
<br />Q. what is matter ?
<br />
Hierarchically organised persistent but intrinsically dynamic (continually
<br />
refreshed) structures of MON_STUFF
<br />
<br />Q. what is brain?
<br />
I think we already did this.
<br />
<br />Q why cortical brain matter generates qualia ?
<br />
There is one single simple fundamental principle at the heart of it: &quot;At
<br />
all scales and all locations, when you 'be'  any MON_STUFF the 'view of
<br />
the rest of the universe' is delivered innately as 'NOT_ME'&quot;. Call it the
<br />
COLIN principle of universal subjectivity&quot; I don;t care...like the
<br />
fluctuation This is a simple as it gets.
<br />
<br />Q why it must be so ?
<br />
With the fundamental principle that perspective view at all scales
<br />
literally is the source of qualia, the whole reasoning changes from one of
<br />
WHY to one of WHERE/WHEN....which is what you ask. It is question of
<br />
visability. It is 'like' 'NOT_ELECTRON' to be a collection of MON_STUFF
<br />
behaving electronly. That is not 'about' being an electron. It IS an
<br />
electron. Not only that, there is a blizzard of the little blighters with
<br />
no collective 'story' to tell. Their collective summated scene is ZERO.
<br />
<br />Q Is qualia a dependance of cortical brain matter or the inverse ?
<br />
If I get you correctly it's 'INVERSE'.
<br />
<br />Q. is qualia responsible of what looks like cortical brain matter?
<br />
It's not 'responsible' in that it doesn't 'cause brain matter'. Qualia
<br />
present a visual scene -  a representation. In the scene we see brain
<br />
matter.
<br />
<br />Q or is it cortical brain matter that makes feel
<br />
qualia which in turns ask question about cortical brain matter ?
<br />
No. Cortical brain material is an appearance of MON_STUFF created by
<br />
special MON_STUFF doing the 'appearance dance'. When it does that dance
<br />
... (the cortical grey matter membrane dance)... it creates an appearance
<br />
of atoms, molcules, cells, tissue.... because these are persistent nested
<br />
structures of MON_STUFF doing the atom dance, the molecule dance, the cell
<br />
dance. etc..etc.
<br />
<br />As weird and hard to assimilate as it sounds....It all comes down to the
<br />
two simplest possible basic premises:
<br />
<br />1) A universe consisting of a massive number of one generic elemental
<br />
process, the fluctuation.
<br />
<br />2) A universe in which the perspective view from the point of view of
<br />
'being' ME, an elemental fluctuation, is 'NOT ME' (the rest of the
<br />
universe).
<br />
<br />The ecitable cell dance is the only dance that has it's own story
<br />
independent of the underlying MON_STUFF organisational layers. That is the
<br />
only place where the net exertions of MON_STUFF have nothing to do with
<br />
any other dance. That is the organisational level where the visibility
<br />
finally manifests to non-zero...why neural soma are fat - it's all about
<br />
signal to noise ratio.
<br />
<br />weirdness time over. Gotta go.
<br />
<br />Colin Hales
