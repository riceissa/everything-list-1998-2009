</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I am not sure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It would mean that he believes that brains (or whatever consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; supervenes on) are non Turing-Emulable infinite analog machine/
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; entities. This would contradict his chapter three, where he argues
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that the brain obeys &quot;well known physical laws&quot;. All such known laws
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; are Turing emulable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What I meant was I'm not sure sure he accepts &quot;Arithmetical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Platonism&quot;, which is one of your founding principles of COMP.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Remember that after my conversation with P. Jones on this List I have  
<br />
purposefully chosen to give away AR (Arithmetical realism) from the  
<br />
definition of COMP. People tend to put too much in Arithmetical  
<br />
Realism or arithmetical platonism. It is just impossible to give sense  
<br />
to Church thesis (which I put in COMP) without believing in the very  
<br />
weak form of realism I am using in UDA, nor is it possible to  
<br />
understand the closure of the set of partial recursive functions for  
<br />
the operation of diagonalization. I am pretty sure Vic Stenger can  
<br />
understand those notions;
<br />
COMP is just the old doctrine that the brain/body functions like a  
<br />
machine. Church thesis and arithmetical realism are useful to make  
<br />
clear what we mean by machine, i.e; finitely describable machine.
<br />
&quot;Arithmetical Platonism&quot; is just the indexical belief that the truth  
<br />
or falsity of a proposition like &quot;17 is prime&quot; does not depend on me,  
<br />
us, the humans.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible to believe consciousness is Turing emulable without believing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; actual Turing machines exist in the physical universe, for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instance.
</em><br />
<br />Of course. But I don't see the point. If consciousness is turing  
<br />
emulable, then the physical universe emerges from all immaterial  
<br />
computational histories. We don't have to believe in actual physical  
<br />
Turing machine existing in a physical universe, given that those  
<br />
notion are secondary or emerging from the arithmetical reality.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Think back to the fun debates we had with that ultrafinitist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Torgny!
</em><br />
<br /><br />It is preferable not putting the &quot;infinite tape&quot; in the definition of  
<br />
a universal (Turing) machine, like in recursion theory or theoretical  
<br />
computer science, or like in Turing's theorem that a universal turing  
<br />
machine exist. The infinite tape is really just an infinitely  
<br />
extendable finite tape. This makes possible to have universal machine,  
<br />
like us, even in Torgny's ultrafinitist and physicalist context.
<br />
<br />Universal machine theorem: EuAxAy  phi_u(x,y) = phi_x(y)      the  
<br />
&quot;universal u&quot; has a finite description.
<br />
With Phi_i the partial recursive functions, and (x,y) some computable  
<br />
bijection from NXN to N.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Anyway, it is probably best to let him defend his position, rather
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than putting words into his mouth.
</em><br />
<br /><br />He wrote books on the subject, we can deduce propositions from there   
<br />
and discussed them. Of course he is welcome to clarify his position,  
<br />
but if he got the &quot;chance&quot; to understand the UD argument, and if he  
<br />
want to keep up the myth of a primary physical reality, then he has to  
<br />
put some actual third person infinity in the brain or to throw away  
<br />
the notions of consciousness and person, like indeed some materialist  
<br />
are doing. In that case comp is trivially true, you would even survive  
<br />
a substitution of your brain with nothing 'cause you are already dead.
<br />
<br />I  am afraid Vic is just not aware of the subtlety of the  
<br />
consciousness problem. The way he dismisses mystical experiences as  
<br />
&quot;just&quot; neuron firings in the brain is rather typical. Gosh, we could  
<br />
say that the belief in a physical universe is also &quot;just&quot; brain  
<br />
firing. That proves nothing, and just illustrates that he believes in  
<br />
comp and use it, like many materialist, just to hold the idea that  
<br />
there is no consciousness problem.
<br />
Comp has always been the favorite hypothesis of the materialist, but  
<br />
where I use comp to try to formulate the mind-body problem,  
<br />
materialist use it to dismiss it. We are &quot;just&quot; machine, according to  
<br />
materialists. The problem is that (cf UDA) mechanism force us to admit  
<br />
a giant first person indeterminacy, which today lead to more  
<br />
indeterminacy than we observe in nature. Then the incompleteness  
<br />
provides everything we need to compare more scrupulously those  
<br />
indeterminacies and test the comp hypothesis. This leads to the study  
<br />
of machine's theology. I mean we have to distinguish what is true on  
<br />
machines from what machines can prove about themselves.
<br />
By not taking theology seriously enough, we give it to authoritative  
<br />
clerical powers and to popular wishful thinking ... making theology  
<br />
looks not serious and unscientific. It is a vicious circle. My opinion  
<br />
is that science is agnostic in front of any ontological commitments,  
<br />
especially fundamental one like universes and gods. But, hearing the  
<br />
creationist discourses in America, I remain sympathetic to Vic's  
<br />
intentions, despite I believe such a negative book (God does not  
<br />
exist) will give more fuel to its opponents. Putting back theology in  
<br />
the scientist curriculum, and admitting we are almost nowhere in our  
<br />
understanding of consciousness could be the best prevention against  
<br />
the popular incoherent mythes and the clerical authoritative  
<br />
manipulations of all sorts.
<br />
Science is doubt. Fundamental science is fundamental doubt.
