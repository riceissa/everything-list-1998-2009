so that CTM has to justify the appearance of PM. (= UDA)

Then I show that theoretical computer science is very promising to

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's like saying you can go from making a theoretical study of the

</em><br />
<br />Comparing mathematical objects with fairy tales objects can hardly help.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   I don't see, indeed, how you can both define matter from  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; contingent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; structures and still pretend that matter is primitive.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; I am saying that material existence *is* contingent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; existence. It is not a structure of anything.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Plotinus says that too! Me too.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; With church thesis this is can be made more precise in term of not-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; computable or not-provable, or some relativizations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You're still not getting it. PM isn't a non-computable number.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It isn't mathematical at all. You really do think in a box..
</em><br />
<br /><br />If you believe that a deduction is not valid, you have to say where,  
<br />
and why.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Somehow you talk like you would be able to be *conscious* of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; existence of primitive matter.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, at least I don't talk about immaterial machines dreaming each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; other.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; In arithmetic, that happens all the time. More below.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; !!!!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In arithemetic. people write down problems on blackboards and solve
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them.
</em><br />
<br />If comp is assumed, some computation correspond to dream, and their  
<br />
existence can be proved in arithmetic.
<br />
And the MGA argument shows that no machine can make the difference  
<br />
between &quot;real&quot;, virtual and arithmetical.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is no immaterial existence at all, and  my agreeign to have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my brain physcially replicated doesn't prove there is.
</em><br />
<br />Meaning: UDA is non valid. I am still waiting your argument.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; You have to deny the theorem of elementary arithmetic, which are used
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; by physicists (mostly through complex or trigonometric functions,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; which reintroduce the natural numbers in the continuum).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No. I don't have to deny their truth. I just have to deny that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence is ontological existence.
</em><br />
<br />I have no clue what you mean by &quot;ontological existence&quot;, except  
<br />
&quot;physical existence&quot;, but this beg the question.
<br />
If you don't deny the arithmetical truth, you accept arithmetical  
<br />
realism, and you cannot deny the UD, so you should be able to follow  
<br />
the argument. And if you believe the conclusion is wrong, you should  
<br />
say where.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Since it [UD] does not exist, it does not contain anything.
</em><br />
<br />UD exists like PI exists. The rest is taken into account in the  
<br />
argument that I am referring to.
<br />
Don't say that PI and circle does not exists. Say that PI and circles  
<br />
does not exist physically. It is quite different.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It is hard to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; recognize Peter Jones or Bruno Marchal from the huge relation and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; huge
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; numbers involved, in some emulations, but it is easy to prove there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; exists, from the information the doctor got when scanning your brain.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Same mistake
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; All you can prove is that *if* the UD existed *then* it would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contain such-and-such. But it doesn't actually exist.
</em><br />
<br />What you mean is that UD does not physically exists. (Well I am not  
<br />
sure this is true, but OK).
<br />
But MGA shows that the UD does not need to physically exist for my  
<br />
(non primary) physical existence.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is never going to get you further than mathematical existence.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You still need the futher step of showing mathematical existence is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ontological RITISAR existence.
</em><br />
<br />I still don't know if by RITSIAR you mean &quot;real in the sense my first  
<br />
person is real&quot; or &quot;real as my body is real&quot;.
<br />
You told me that the difference is epistemological, and I can accept  
<br />
this (for a while). But that makes a huge difference in the meaning of  
<br />
RITSIAR. I cannot doubt my first person, but I can doubt my body.  
<br />
After UDA+MGA, my first person appears to have an infinity of bodies  
<br />
(like in QM without collapse), and this makes the difference between  
<br />
those two forms of RITSIAR even bigger.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; See &quot;conscience &amp; mécanisme&quot; appendices for snapshot of a running
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; mathematical DU. It exists mathematically. But it can be implemented
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;materially&quot; , i.e. relatively to our most probable computations too.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So? It hasn't been.
</em><br />
<br /><br />It has been implemented, and it has run for a week in 1991. This is  
<br />
anecdotical. Just to say that the UD is a concrete program.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The way to prevent it is the same way that all sceptical hypotheses
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are prevented. You just note that there is not a scrap of evidence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for them. The only upshot of scepticism is that there is no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certainty, and we have to argue for the position of the greatest
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; plausibility.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I have better that a scrap of evidence: a deductive argument. A proof,  
<br />
that COMP =&gt; physics has to emerge from numbers.
<br />
<br />But I have also evidences for comp, in the sense that the physics  
<br />
which emerge from numbers is a multiversial physics, and the quantum  
<br />
reality makes many people to consider that we may live in a  
<br />
multiversial reality. And I have also more technical evidences coming  
<br />
from the Arithmetical UDA. That are evidence for comp.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I can't be &quot;in&quot; something that has merely mathematical existence, any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more than I can be &quot;in&quot; Nanrnia
</em><br />
<br /><br />... then CTM (comp) is false, and you should help us to find the error  
<br />
in UDA, instead of just denying existence for what almost everybody  
<br />
accepts to exist mathematically. Arithmetical reality kicks back.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; No, it just has to be right. The fact that a simulated me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; *would8 be wrong doesn't mean the real me *is* wrong.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But if you are correct in your reasoning, the simulated you has to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; correct to.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; False. You are treating all reasoning as being assumptionless and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; apriori. Both me's could have arguments of equal validity, but one of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the argumetns could have true assumptions and the other false
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumptionsm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because the truth of the assumptions (and hence the soundness of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argument)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; depends on external factors which vary.
</em><br />
<br />No, in this protocol, both have the same assumptions. If not, you are  
<br />
begging the question.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The mind-body problem comes from the fact that we have not yet find
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; how to attach consciousness to matter.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No, it comes from no being able to attach *phenomenal*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness to mathematical structures. There is no problem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attaching *cognition* to matter at all. If the matter of your brain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is disrupted, so are your though processes.
</em><br />
<br />What is *phenomenal* consciousness? Is not consciousness always  
<br />
phenomenal? How do you define matter and attach cognition to it? You  
<br />
are talking like if materialist did find a solution of the mind-body  
<br />
problem. This is not the case.
<br />
And yes, if the matter in my brain is disrupted, so are my thought  
<br />
processes. This is one reason to accept comp. So what?
<br />
<br />I have some colleagues who argues that MGA is not needed. They have  
<br />
read some papers on the phantom limbs, and they argue that  
<br />
consciousness (like the consciousness of a pain in the limb) is  
<br />
obviously non material, because it cannot be located in the limb, and  
<br />
cannot be located in the brain, nor elsewhere. They find that the &quot;yes  
<br />
doctor&quot; hypothesis, when well understood (yes doctor *qua computatio*)  
<br />
makes us immaterial at once, and that it is obvious that matter is  
<br />
what needs an explanation.  I have succeeded in explaining to some of  
<br />
them that such argument can't go through, on purely logical grounds,  
<br />
but MGA does go through, and if you think plausible, against such  
<br />
colleagues, that consciousness is a material phenomenon, then UDA  
<br />
shows you that such a material phenomenon cannot be Turing emulable.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It is the same reasoning.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Or you have a special sense making you know that you are the &quot;real&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; one, but either that special sense is Turing emulable and your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; doppelganger inherit them, or it is not Turing emulable, and you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; better should say &quot;no&quot; to the doctor, because you would loose that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; sense.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't need to strenuously argue against that there is something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; special about me that makes me un-emulable , or un-BIV-able.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I just have to note that there is no evidence for either hypothesis.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The burden is on the sceptic.
</em><br />
<br />There are ton of evidences. My favorite one is that *primary* matter  
<br />
is not even assumed in any physical text.
<br />
I have finished to read Aristotle for the second times, and I am not  
<br />
sure at all that he is responsible for that notion. I think that such  
<br />
a notion appeared the first time in catholic texts to prevent a  
<br />
protestant understanding of the relation between Jesus and braid.
<br />
I may begin to ask you to define what is primary matter. Your use of  
<br />
it looks more and more like the use of &quot;God&quot;.
<br />
And about conceptual analysis of that notion of matter, I would like a  
<br />
definition of matter which does not rely on matter, like Dennett asks  
<br />
for consciousness. If not, it is a sort of fake God.
<br />
To say that matter is fundamental, comma, is the same as saying that  
<br />
consciousness is fundamental comma. It is the same kind of misuse of  
<br />
God-like notion which explains the difficulty to keep a reasonable  
<br />
scientific, modest and agnostic, attitude in the fundamental fields.
<br />
<br />I am sorry Peter, but CTM + PM just does not work, and it is a good  
<br />
news, because if we keep CTM, we get a sort of super generalization of  
<br />
Darwin idea that things evolve. Now we know, assuming comp, that the  
<br />
physical laws have a reason, and that they evolves, in a non tempral  
<br />
or spatial way, in some arithmetico-logical space.
<br />
<br />It is not yet a complete solution of the mind-body problem, but it is  
<br />
a progress. It provides also a purely arithmetical interpretation of  
<br />
Plotinus neo-platonism, and that is interesting per se. After 1500  
<br />
years of materialism, together with variate form of person  
<br />
eliminativism, humanity could use a bit of a theory which provides  
<br />
some importance and respect toward persons.
