<br /><br />This leads to the most interesting question: what is geometry?
<br />
A lot of people, like Lucien Hardy or Russell Standish try to &quot;derive&quot; QM
<br />
from basic assumptions but most such attempts take some geometry for granted.
<br />
In some sense Descartes tried to make arithmetical foundation
<br />
for geometry and this has lead to the well known coordinate systems, and then
<br />
physics look like finding invariant for coordinate systems changes...
<br />
Coordinates give indeed number-representations of things, but we 
<br />
better should not take those things for granted. In any case the comp 
<br />
hypothesis forces us
<br />
to generalise Klein program for geometry (reducing it to symmetry (group)
<br />
theory), making the logical structure of
<br />
reality invariant for any change of point of view ...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;With comp the UDA shows we
<br />
must go from number to consistent comp histories then measure (and statistic
<br />
on those histories, and only then we can hope to find a way toward ...
<br />
What? commutative geometry above our common level of substitution, non
<br />
commutative below. I bet.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;[Gordon]

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Nonideal Measurments, we have to see more of what is going on in Real

</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />You cannot be serious. Most quantum weirdness can be described with
<br />
two dimensional real vector space and their products.
<br />
<br />Perhaps you are dreaming about building a non abelian anyonic quantum
<br />
computing machine through some fractional quantum Hall effect?
<br />
This is less elementary.

<br /><br />I showed comp force us to derive (aspect of) the laws of

physics from a measure on the consistent machine &quot;dreams&quot;.

I should get QT from the other side. I find indeed firstly
<br />
the many worlds, then, thanks to the consistency requirement
<br />
a sort of abstract geometry appears and I compare
<br />
it with the quantum for just verifying comp, or perhaps measuring
<br />
some sort of local degree of falsity of comp, who knows?
<br />
<br />Even if Freedman or Calude are right and that it exists some
<br />
analogical quantum universal machine that would not entail the falsity
<br />
of comp. Only if we find evidence that we are ourself such analogical universal
<br />
machine then comp would be false. I would not bet on that ... today.

<br /><br />Y're welcome. But remember I am not proposing a theory but only a theorem.

(I could be wrong but please tell me where!)
<br />
Ant it comes from a very well shared &quot;theory&quot; (comp). It is Everett's
<br />
and David Deutsch's theory of mind BTW.
<br />
It is not a matter of choice.
<br />
Comp implies the laws of physics MUST be derivable from numbers. Not in the
<br />
trivial way that QM can be formally related to the relation between *some*
<br />
numbers but in the non trivial way that QM emerges from all possible relations
<br />
between *all* numbers.
<br />
I don't know and don't really care if comp is true or not.

<br /><br />Curious. I don't believe any theories can fill fully the number realm (and that

But concerning the physical I would bet on some deep completeness of QT, this

mainly for statistical reason. I would bet QT complete and more than

universal, multiversal actually.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now you claim that if 99% of people believe and work within a certain

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sructure then it right and the only way,Wel up untill 1987 99% of

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Physicist and Maths guys and girls believe V.Neunman Proof against

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Hidden varibles just on faith except for Bohm and proved that he was

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now they is also Newton Physics which in the 19 the century guys where

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;all sure of and 99% thought that is just time to dot the I's and cross

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the T'S.However a small band of people over through this with

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So when you say that 99% of Math community believe in a certian Bivlanet

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;closers not me or 99% of you either ;) what ever we say a thing is it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;isnt it always more that we say, right now any single theory trying to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;say all is saying nothing!
</em><br />
<br /><br />Ok the 99% argument is bad, but I was not really pretending the community
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;believes in bivalent logic just that bivalent logic is the simplest
<br />
frame for communicating propositions on fundamental questions including
<br />
those on non bivalent logics and their models.
<br />
I said once classical logic is just the most polite logic. Probably
<br />
because it can take into account that very non constructive notion: the
<br />
other.
