<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;With the most usual (Aristotelian) sense of the term &quot;world&quot;, this

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Huh? I thought I was saying the opposite. I certainly believe in comp.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Still confusing Schmidhuberian  comp and ... comp  ?
<br />
<br />Schmidhuber Comp:   The universe is computable/Turing emulable
<br />
<br />Comp:   I (you) am (are) computable/Turing emulable.
<br />
<br />It can be argued that  Schmidhuber comp entails comp.
<br />
But alas comp entails (a priori) the negation of Schmidhuber comp.
<br />
<br />Because if I am Turing emulable then I cannot know
<br />
which computation currently supports me, and my expectations
<br />
should in principle be related to the most common computationnal
<br />
histories going through a description of my current state made at the right
<br />
substitution level  (which exists by comp-hyp) or below.
<br />
That is, you just cannot dismiss the &quot;induction failure problem&quot;.
<br />
So you have a measure problem. Remember that from the first person
<br />
(subjective) point of view you cannot be aware of the number of steps
<br />
&quot;really done&quot; so that the measure (fortunately in a sense) bears on the
<br />
infinite (maximal) consistent computationnal histories/extensions.
<br />
This introduce at least a non computable randomness in our most probable
<br />
neighborhood.
<br />
Obviously taking account some theorems in theoretical
<br />
computer science makes it possible to get many more information and
<br />
more precise account.
<br />
<br />Schmidhuberian type of comp is comp + putting
<br />
the &quot;induction failure problem&quot; (and the whole &quot;mind/body&quot; problem)
<br />
under the rug.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;In the spirit of your thought experiment, let me ask
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;you a &quot;personal&quot; question. Assume you have big motivation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;for going to Mars. You can now choose between a 100$ and a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;10000$ teletransporter machine (TTM). Let us assume you are not so rich
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;that this difference count (or adjust the number relatively to your 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;situation).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;The 100$ TTM has no security and it is known that billion of copies of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;yourself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;will be sold elsewhere, for example to the kind of &quot;hell&quot; you were 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;pointing to.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;The 10000$ TTM has quantum coded protection, so that the probability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;is very near one that no pirate will be able to copy you.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Are you telling us that you will take the insecure low cost TTM ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It's a good question, and this is where the rational comes up against the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;emotional. If it were my first trip, I think I'd be very nervous about the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;cheap alternative, and I would pay the extra or avoid going if I couldn't 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;afford it. However, if I had used the $100 service many times in the past 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(through choice or necessity), I don't think I would worry about using it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;again.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Here is another irrational belief I hold, while I'm confessing. I am 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;absolutely convinced that continuity of personal identity is a kind of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;illusion. If I were to be painlessly killed every second and immediately 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;replaced by an exact copy, with all my memories, beliefs about being me, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;etc., I would have no way of knowing that this was happening, and indeed I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;believe that in a sense this IS happening, every moment of my life. Now, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;suppose I am offered the following deal. In exchange for $1 million 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;deposited in my bank account, tonight I will be killed with a sharp axe in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;my sleep, and in the morning a stranger will wake up in my bed who has 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;been brainwashed and implanted with all my memories at my last conscious 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;moment. This stranger will also have had plastic surgery so that he looks 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;like me, and he will then live life as me, among other things spending the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;$1 million which is now in my bank account.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If I were rational, I should probably accept the above deal, on the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;grounds that my apparent continuity of personal identity will be the same 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;as it always has been. If such a proposal were put to me, however, I would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be horrified; and I am sure my friends and family would be too, even if 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;they shared my philosophical beliefs about personal identity. I would also 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be horrified if offered the role of the stranger who takes someone else's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;place. I can't decide which would be worse.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;On the other hand, if I had been forced to go through the above 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;transformation several times, I might get used to the idea and not be so 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;worried. Rationally, it shouldn't make any difference.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Obviously!  But it is so only because you dismiss the &quot;failure induction 
<br />
problem&quot;. Also: third person identity is arguably an illusion. But I hardy 
<br />
doubt first person identity can ever be an illusion or that it could even 
<br />
be useful to consider like it. What is painful in pain for the suffering 
<br />
first person is mainly that the pain can last, and this independently of 
<br />
any precise idea the first person could have about who she is.
<br />
<br />Let us iterate indefinitely the W M duplication of a machine capable of 
<br />
some inductive inference.
<br />
Obviously the one which is always reconstituted at W will believe (here in 
<br />
the sense of inductively infer)
<br />
that she will always be reconstituted at W, but she is false as his 
<br />
quasi-infinity of doppelgangers will (unsuccessfully) try to explain her.
