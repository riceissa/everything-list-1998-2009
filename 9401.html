<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Well, in the case of schizoid mathematician John Nash, his

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;psychotic&quot; behaviour was also clearly linked to his maths ability.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;After imbibing anti-psychotic medication, not only did his &quot;unreal&quot;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;friends disappear, but his mathematical perception as well.
</em><br />
<br />I don't think that's true, my understanding is that once he became 
<br />
schizophrenic he no longer did any useful mathematical work, just mystical 
<br />
numerology. In discussing the movie, the wikipedia entry at 
<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Beautiful_Mind">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Beautiful_Mind</a> says:
<br />
<br />&quot;The movie also misrepresents the effect Nash's mental illness had on his 
<br />
work. The movie depicts Nash as already suffering from schizophrenia when he 
<br />
wrote his doctoral thesis. In reality, Nash's schizophrenia did not appear 
<br />
until years later and once it did his mathematical work ceased until he was 
<br />
able to bring it under control.&quot;
<br />
<br />And the page at <a href="http://www.pnas.org/misc/classics5.shtml">http://www.pnas.org/misc/classics5.shtml</a> says that he once 
<br />
again started doing useful work after his recovery:
<br />
<br />&quot;In 1970, Nash moved back to Princeton, where he took to shuffling through 
<br />
the halls of the mathematics building, occasionally scribbling enigmatic 
<br />
numerological messages on the walls. Students referred to him as the 
<br />
&quot;Phantom of Fine Hall.&quot;
<br />
<br />Gradually, however, Nash's mental condition began to improve. Schizophrenia 
<br />
rarely disappears completely, but by the 1990s Nash appeared to have made a 
<br />
remarkable recovery, and he had turned once again to mathematical research.&quot;
<br />
<br />The wikipedia article elaborates on what his recent work has been about:
<br />
<br />&quot;The 1990s brought a return of his genius, and Nash has taken care to manage 
<br />
the symptoms of his mental illness. He is still hoping to score substantial 
<br />
scientific results. His recent work involves ventures in advanced game 
<br />
theory including partial agency which show that, as in his early career, he 
<br />
prefers to select his own path and problems (though he continues to work in 
<br />
a communal setting to assist in managing his illness).&quot;
