<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think on this list we should be willing to seriously consider the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; many-worlds interpretation (MWI) of quantum mechanics as the ontology 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our universe.
</em><br />
<br />I remain agnostic on the MWI or EWG interpretation. While I don't 
<br />
strongly believe that the MWI is &quot;reality&quot; (cough cough), I agree with 
<br />
Hal that it's a plausible ontology. Further, I take more seriously than 
<br />
many the &quot;plurality of worlds&quot; ontology of the late philosopher David 
<br />
Lewis. (The guy who argues that we should not give special linguistic 
<br />
treatment to &quot;our&quot; world and should give equal standing to &quot;the world 
<br />
in which World War II was won by Germany,&quot; for example. Lewis is 
<br />
sometimes caricaturized by capsule summaries of the sort &quot;David Lewis 
<br />
believes unicorns really do exist,&quot; but what Lewis is claiming is fully 
<br />
consistent with modal logic and possible worlds semantics.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; There are a few objections which I am aware of which have been raised
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; against the MWI.  The first is its lack of parsimony in terms of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; creating a vast number of universes.  We gain some simplification in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the QM formalism but at this seemingly huge expense.  The second is its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; untestability, although some people have claimed otherwise.
</em><br />
<br />The latter is the more important. If, for example, the plurality of 
<br />
worlds are out of communication with each other, forever and always, 
<br />
then it means nothing to assert that they &quot;actually&quot; exist.
<br />
<br />In weaker forms of the MWI, where it's the early state of the Big Bang 
<br />
(for example) which are splitting off into N universes, De Witt and 
<br />
others have speculated (as early as around 1970) that we may _possibly_ 
<br />
see some evidence consistent with the EWG interpretation but NOT 
<br />
consistent with other interpretations.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; third is that it retains what we might call the problem of measure,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that is, explaining why we seem to occupy branches with a high measure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or amplitude, without just adding that as an extra assumption.
</em><br />
<br />What's the problem here? I find it utterly plausible that we would be 
<br />
in a universe where matter exists, where stars exist, where entropy 
<br />
gradients exist, etc., and NOT in a universe where the physical 
<br />
constants or structure of the universe makes life more difficult or 
<br />
impossible (or where the densities and entropy gradients mean that 
<br />
evolution of complex structures might take 100 billion years, or more, 
<br />
instead of the billion or so years it apparently took).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The point is, all of these objections apply equally to the more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ambitious multiverse models we consider here.  Our multiverse is even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more profligate than the MWI; it is if anything less observable; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the problem of measure is at least as acute.
</em><br />
<br />I certainly agree with this! Tegmark's and Schmidhuber's and Egan's 
<br />
&quot;all mathematics, all programs&quot; models form supersets of the 
<br />
conventional MWI.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  By the metrics we typically use for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe complexity, basically the number of axioms or the size of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; program to specify the universe, the MWI is in fact simpler and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; therefore
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more probable than the traditional interpretation.
</em><br />
<br />This I'm not convinced of at all. I don't find the Copenhagen (aka 
<br />
&quot;Shut up and calculate&quot;) Interpretation requires any more axioms. So 
<br />
long as we don't try to understand what is &quot;really&quot; happening, it's a 
<br />
very simple system.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Quantum randomness does not exist in the MWI.  It is an illusion 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; caused by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the same effect which Bruno Marchal describes in his thought 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiments,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where an observer who is about to enter a duplication device has 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multiple
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible futures, which he treats as random.  If Schmidhuber would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; adopt
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this model for the physics of our universe it would improve the quality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of his predictions.
</em><br />
<br /><br />And, putting in a plug for modal/topos logic, the essence of nearly 
<br />
every interpretation, whether MWI or Copenhagen or even Newtonian, is 
<br />
that observers at time t are faced with unknowable and branching 
<br />
futures. (In classical systems, these arise from limited amounts of 
<br />
information available to observers and, importantly, in limited 
<br />
positional information. Even a perfectly classical billiard ball 
<br />
example is unpredictable beyond a few seconds or maybe tens of seconds, 
<br />
because the positions and sets of forces (turbulence in the air 
<br />
currents around the balls, even gravitational and static electricity 
<br />
effects, etc.) are only known to, say, 20 decimal places (if that, of 
<br />
course). Because the &quot;actual&quot; positions, masses, sphericities, static 
<br />
charges, etc.  are perhaps defined by 40-digit or even 200-digit 
<br />
numbers, the Laplacian dream of a suffiicently powerful mind being able 
<br />
to know the future is dashed.
<br />
<br />Unpredictability, or randomness, arises even in a fully classical real 
<br />
world.
