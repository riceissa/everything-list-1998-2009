<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;How useful is modal logic in dealing with these unknowable and branching

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;futures? Modal logic is the logic of possibility and necessity,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;but to make decisions you need to reason about probabilities rather than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;modalities.
</em><br />
<br />This is true only for the antic aristotelian alethic modal logic.
<br />
This one is approximated by the system S5.
<br />
<br />Modern modal logic is used to build a lot of very different systems, by the
<br />
use of different modal logics. The more common are T, S4, D, B,  etc.
<br />
<br />Those system try to approximate common modalities we use everyday:
<br />
<br />exemple:
<br />
<br />In alethic modal logic [] = it is necessary that
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and &lt;&gt; = it is possible that
<br />
<br />In temporal logic [] means always, and &lt;&gt; means once,
<br />
<br />In spatial logic [] means everywhere, and &lt;&gt; means somewhere,
<br />
<br />In deontic logic [] means obligatory, and &lt;&gt; means permitted,
<br />
<br />In formal provability logic [] means formally provable, and &lt;&gt;
<br />
means formally consistent.
<br />
<br />etc. Of course the meaning here is the &quot;intended&quot; meaning. The
<br />
goal is to capture such intended meaning axiomatically by the
<br />
choice or isolation of set of axioms and rules... For exemple if some
<br />
proposition is true everywhere we want it to be true somewhere,
<br />
so that for spatial logic []p -&gt; &lt;&gt;p should be an axiom, or a
<br />
theorem if we choose a stronger axiom.
<br />
<br />Note that in all those classical modal logic [] = -&lt;&gt;-   and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;===&gt;                                    &lt;&gt; = -[]- .
<br />
<br />But this is false for intuitionist modal logic. (Yes, that exists!)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;How does modal logic &quot;fit in&quot; with or relate to probability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;theory?
</em><br />
<br />The probability ONE interpretation of [], need at least []p -&gt; &lt;&gt;p.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  As far as I know, the logic used in probability theory is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;classical logic.
</em><br />
<br />It depends. Intuitionist mathematicians will use intuitionist
<br />
mathematics, etc. (Cf Edward Nelson wrote a book on probability
<br />
theory which relies in some way on intuitionist logic.) That can
<br />
help for the use of non classical infinitesimal numbers, which
<br />
can simplify the proofs.
<br />
<br />Classical Modal logic approach of classical probability theory
<br />
are proposed as substitution of probability theory.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;For example, P(not not A) = P(A) is assumed,
</em><br />
<br /><br />You point on a real diificulty, because in P(A) A is an event,
<br />
and in &quot;-A&quot;, A is a proposition.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;and there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are no axioms in probability theory that deal with modal qualifiers. Are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;there versions of probability theory based on modal logic or other logics?
</em><br />
<br />I know works by Fatarossi and Barnaba. They use Kripke semantics,
<br />
with weighted accessibility relations. The goal is not to build a new
<br />
probability theory, but to make more rigorous attempts to  clear some
<br />
paradox in some use of probability theory.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Also, can you clarify something else for me. The elements in the poset
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that is used to interprete modal logic are the possible worlds, whereas
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the elements of the poset in your &quot;causal time&quot; post are space-time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;events. If we re-interpret modal logic using the poset of events instead
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the poset of possible worlds,
</em><br />
<br /><br />I let Tim adding remarks. But in a &quot;time&quot; modal logic, events are the
<br />
possible world. Remember that for a logician a &quot;possible world&quot; is just
<br />
any element of a set, or of a more sophisticated mathematical structure.
<br />
(locale, quantale, lattice, category, ...   ..., quantum group, ...)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;&lt;&gt;A would mean A is true sometime
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;somewhere in the future lightcone of here-now, and []A would mean A is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;true all-the-time everywhere in the future lightcone of here-now. Are you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;advocating such usage of modal logic?
</em><br />
<br /><br />I mention an interesting paper by Golblatt: &quot; Dioderean Modality in
<br />
Minkowski Space-time&quot;. It is shown that the modality []p is for &quot;it is
<br />
and will always be the case that p&quot;. It shows that the dioderean
<br />
axiom &lt;&gt;[]p -&gt; []&lt;&gt;p formalises branching time in four dimensional
<br />
Minkowki space-time. It seems to work also for two and three dimensions.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I had argued earlier that in the case of possible worlds, we might as well
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;just use classical logic and talk about possible worlds and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;accessibility relationship directly.
</em><br />
<br />Which one. What do you mean by a world?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;That seems to apply even more to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;poset of space-time events. I really fail to see what benefits modal logic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;brings in this case.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Modal logic is just a mathematical tool for making clearer form of
<br />
reasoning. It is based on the idea of relativising truth on ... any
<br />
mathematical structures, hoping you can show the independence of
<br />
a formula from a set of formula.
<br />
Kripke geometries are used for showing the NON provability of a formula,
<br />
Like polynoms are used in topology for showing you cannot go continuously
<br />
form one space to another space. Modal logic in philosophy is like
<br />
tensor algebra in physics: it makes possible to shorten big amount
<br />
of researchers' work in small formula: like
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hx = Ex    Schroedinger equation
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&gt;p -&gt; -[]&lt;&gt;p   Godel second incompleteness theorem
<br />
<br />Of course you need to do an amount of math for getting some meaning
<br />
(vector space and linear algebra for Schroedinger equation, and
<br />
metamathematics + some modal logic for Godel second incompleteness theorem.
<br />
<br />George Levy asks recently &quot;Could somebody incorporate complementarity 
<br />
in a thought experiment in the style of Bruno's duplication 
<br />
experiment?&quot;
<br />
<br />This is an interesting proposal and I would be glad if someone manage
<br />
to present one. Just that it is *because* duplication-like experiment leads
<br />
quickly to obscurities and misleading intuitions, *that* modal logic
<br />
appears to be a fruitful investment, even if it is not the only one.
<br />
Categories and knots are full of promises too. It's also a question of
<br />
taste. In Counter-intuitive land, micro or macro, real or virtual,
<br />
it would be naive to believe you can go deep without some mathematics.
<br />
