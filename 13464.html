Hi Russel,
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't see that you've made your point.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you achieve this, you have created an artificial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; creative process, a sort of holy grail of AI/ALife.
</em><br />
<br />Well? So what? Somebody has to do it. :-)
<br />
<br />The 'holy grail' terminology implies (subtext) that the creative process
<br />
is some sort of magical unapproachable topic or is the exclusive domain of
<br />
discipline X and that is not me.... beliefs I can't really buy into. I
<br />
don't need anyone's permission to do what I do.
<br />
<br />Creativity in humans is perfectly natural, evolved in the brutal and
<br />
inefficient experimental lab of evolution and survives because it was
<br />
necessary for a _scientist_ (not cognitive agents of any other kind - I do
<br />
not claim that) -to come into existence. A scientist is a specific, highly
<br />
specialised, very highly defined behavioural subset of the biological
<br />
world with reproducible outputs that relate directly to consciousness that
<br />
can be verified. It is the ONLY example to use for in respect of any
<br />
claims of consciousness in an artifact.
<br />
<br />I suppose I have made a judgement call - a design choice- as an engineer
<br />
doing AGI - which I am perfectly entitled to do. It uses the only real
<br />
benchmark we have for the processes involved. As an empirical proposition
<br />
it is better placed than anything else I have ever heard from anyone
<br />
anywhere, ever....why?....It has measurable outcomes using the _one and
<br />
only_ definitive, verified and repeatable provider of 3rd person evidence
<br />
of the creative process and its intimate relationship to
<br />
consciousness - scientists themselves.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, it seems far from obvious that consciousness should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be necessary.
</em><br />
<br />It is perfectly obvious! Do a scientific experiment on yourself. Close
<br />
your eyes and then tell me you can do science as well. Qualia gone =
<br />
Science GONE. For crying out loud - am I the only only that gets
<br />
this?......Any other position that purports to be able to deliver anything
<br />
like the functionality of a scientist without involving ALL the
<br />
functionality (especially qualia) of a scientist must be based on
<br />
assumptions - assumptions I do not make.
<br />
<br />It's not that all AI is necessarily conscious. It is not that all
<br />
conscious entities are scientists. The position is designed to be able to
<br />
make one single, very specific, cogent conclusive verifiable position
<br />
_once_. Having scientifically reached that point other positions on the
<br />
role/necessity/presence of consciousness in biology and machine can follow.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Biological evolution is widely considered to be creative
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (even exponentially so), but few would argue that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  biosphere is conscious (and has been for ca 4E10 years).
</em><br />
<br />The second law of thermodynamics is the driver. I know that!.....and who
<br />
is arguing that the biosphere is conscious? It has nothing to do with my
<br />
engineering position/design/benchmarking choice. The creative act is, in
<br />
the case of scientists - being &quot;verfiably and serendipitously not-wrong&quot;
<br />
in respect of propositions about the natural world = empirical method.
<br />
This, in a human, including all the relevant cognitive processes - and
<br />
_especially_ the physics of qualia - is a perfectly valid benchmark.
<br />
<br />If a human must have consciousness to do science (the physics that exposes
<br />
a scientist/agent appropriately to the real novelty around them, external
<br />
to the scientist) and a machine can do science as well then that machine
<br />
is conscious. QED. If you know what qualia are (have a proposition for
<br />
them)and you switch them off (which I am proposing) and the ability to do
<br />
science fails.... QED...and your proposition in respect of qualia has
<br />
reach a level of empirical validity. This method has empirical teeth.
<br />
Indeed I would defy _anyone_ to undermine it without making unfounded
<br />
a-priori assumptions as to nature and role of the physics of
<br />
qualia....that is, unscientific or quasi-religious adherence to axioms
<br />
that were defined by the observation process in the first place.
<br />
<br />I believe this kind of discussion in this thread to be flawed because time
<br />
and time again it fails to make use of the simplest of questions. Read it
<br />
very carefully:
<br />
<br />&quot;What is the underlying universe in which those things we observe in brain
<br />
material (atoms, molecules, cells doing their dance), all defined _using_
<br />
observation would be/could be responsible _for
<br />
observation itself_ AND make it look like it does (atoms, molecules, cells
<br />
doing their dance)&quot;
<br />
<br />For _that_ universe is the one we inhabit. This is an empirically
<br />
testable, validly explored area. That universe - whatever it is- is not
<br />
that universe defined by/within observation atoms, molcules, cells etc).
<br />
It is the universe that LOOKS LIKE atoms, molcules, cells when you use the
<br />
observation faculty provided by it because whatever it is those things are
<br />
made of, WE _ARE_ IT.
<br />
<br />If you can't see this....let's see.... Ok.....science/maths defines the
<br />
SINE WAVE:
<br />
f(t) = sin(t)
<br />
we observe a sine wave, we characterise it as appearing within our
<br />
consciousness as shown. Now ask &quot;what is it that is behaving
<br />
sine-wave-ly&quot;. Whatever that is, it is NOT a sine wave. Another question
<br />
to ask &quot;What is it like to BE a sine wave?&quot;. These are all aspects of the
<br />
same thing.
<br />
<br />Now consider one of the models (sine waves) -
<br />
computationalism/functionalism - defined through an observation. What is
<br />
the observation? .....That universe seems to be performing computation or
<br />
information processing....so....what do we do with that observation?....
<br />
We jump to the unfounded conclusion that any form of computation in some
<br />
undefined way leads to consciousness (= all siine waves are
<br />
conscious)......
<br />
<br />This is as flawed as any similar explanation as it is logically
<br />
indistiguishable and as empirically useless as the equivalent belief: &quot;I
<br />
believe observation (consiousness) is invoked by the tooth fairy on
<br />
thursdays&quot;.
<br />
<br />The only real, verifiable evidence of consciousness we have is the
<br />
existence of scientists and their output. It may seem a hard task to set
<br />
yourself as an AI worker... but TOUGH - nobody said it had to be easy -
<br />
and it is no reason to set it aside  in favour of an empirically useless
<br />
&quot;tooth fairy hypothesis for consciousness&quot;.
<br />
<br />At least I have a plan.
<br />
<br />so in relation to....
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't see that you've made your point.
</em><br />
<br />I'd like to think that I have. My AI/Human scientist face-off stands as is
<br />
and I defy anyone to come up with something practical/better that isn't
<br />
axiomatically flawed. Everything is scientific evidence of something.
<br />
Scientists are no exception.
<br />
<br />cheers,
