<br />
Gentlemen,
<br />
<br />Thank you for many illuminating replies to the &quot;Why does anything exist?&quot; 
<br />
question.  Three are shown below.  It's clear that some hold that there is 
<br />
an identity between physical and mathematical existence (although Patrick 
<br />
Leahy may disagree).  If so, we can phrase the big WHY as &quot;Why do numbers 
<br />
exist?&quot;   (Answer:  Because such existence is a logical necessity.)
<br />
<br />The question (at least as I mean it) can also be phrased as &quot;Why is there 
<br />
something instead of nothing?&quot;  Or perhaps I am really asking &quot;What is the 
<br />
First Cause?&quot;
<br />
<br />I think the big WHY must be an unanswerable question from a scientific 
<br />
standpoint, and that Leahy must be correct when he says &quot;. . .  there is 
<br />
just no answer to the big WHY.&quot;  Stephen Paul King says it, maybe more 
<br />
rigorously, when he says, &quot;Existence, itself, can not be said to require an 
<br />
explanation for such would be a requirement that there is a necessitate 
<br />
prior to which Existence is dependent upon.&quot;

<br />
that the totality of the multiverse must sum to zero, that is the essence of 
<br />
symmetry. It is the actuality of the content of our individual experiences 
<br />
(including all of the asymmetries) that we have to justify.

<br />
I find this a very odd question to be asked on this list. To me, one of the 
<br />
main attractions of the &quot;everything&quot; thesis is that it provides the only 
<br />
possible answer to this question. Viz: as Jonathan pointed out, mathematical 
<br />
objects are logical necessities, and the thesis (at least in Tegmark's 
<br />
formulation) is that physical existence is identical to mathematical 
<br />
existence.  Despite this attractive feature, I'm fairly sure the thesis is 
<br />
wrong (so that there is just no answer to the big WHY?), but that's another 
<br />
story.

<br />
&nbsp;You can look at my URL for argument that physical existence emerges from 
<br />
mathematical existence. I have no clues that physical existence could just 
<br />
be equated to mathematical existence unless you attach consciousness to 
<br />
individuated bodies, but how?  I can argue that without accepting natural 
<br />
numbers you cannot justify them. So any theory which does not assumes the 
<br />
natural numbers cannot be a theory of everything. Once you accept the 
<br />
existence of natural numbers it is possible to explain how the belief in 
<br />
both math and physics arises. And with the explicit assumption of Descartes 
<br />
Mechanism, in a digital form (the computationalist hypothesis), I think such 
<br />
explanation is unique. Also, it is possible to explain why we cannot explain 
<br />
where our belief in natural numbers come from.
