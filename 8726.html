<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The &quot;dovetailer&quot; keeps sounding like a powerful idea. I do remember 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that it has often been mentioned here, but somehow I failed to pick up 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a sense of what it was really about.
</em><br />
<br /><br />The Universal Dovetailer is a program which generates and executes all 
<br />
programs.
<br />
Its existence is a non trivial consequence of Church thesis. Please 
<br />
recall me to explain this in detail in one or two weeks.
<br />
The necessity to dovetail (that is to run successiveley on the initial 
<br />
segement of the execution never waiting any programs stop is due to the 
<br />
fact that the always defined programs cannot be generated mechanically 
<br />
(this can be done in the case of all programs).
<br />
Actually I have already explain this on the list (in 2001) but the 
<br />
escribe archive seems no more working again, and the new archive seems 
<br />
not go enough backward in time.
<br />
The first published paper where I define it, is &quot;Mechanism ans Personal 
<br />
Identity&quot; paper:
<br />
<a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/M&amp;PI_15-MAI-91.pdf">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/M&amp;PI_15-MAI-91.pdf</a>
<br />
Russell Standish attributes it (wrongly) to Schmidhuber in his book. My 
<br />
fault, perhaps, because I have (charitably) compare  Schmidhuber &quot;great 
<br />
programmer&quot; with the Universal Dovetailer in some message to James 
<br />
Higgo. You can google on &quot;universal dovetailer&quot;.
<br />
I have also introduced the distinction between the first person, plural 
<br />
and non plural, and third person view, although this has been done by 
<br />
some philosophers of mind in different context before. I introduce it 
<br />
in the self-multiplication and UD context. This is explained in most of 
<br />
my papers (recent or not).
<br />
Schmidhuber never accepted that distinction (or took it as unscientific 
<br />
like may &quot;scientist&quot;, but that is a category error). Actually he leaves 
<br />
the list at the time most people acknowledge the idea. Schmidhuber's 
<br />
work is more akin to a constructive physics based on Universal 
<br />
effective prior than an attempt toward a TOE capable of treating the 
<br />
mind-body relation problems. Here too with some imagination we can see 
<br />
the shadow of that  1-3 distinction appearing in Tegmark through the 
<br />
frog and bird view.
<br />
In the Quantum Mechanics setting the 1-3 distinction appears in Everett 
<br />
fundamental paper under the term &quot;subjective&quot; and &quot;objective&quot;.
<br />
The full conceptual power of the UD arises from the 1-3 distinction 
<br />
applied to it. This leads easily  to the mind/matter  reversal (except 
<br />
for the remaining &quot;movie-graph/Occam difficulty).
<br />
Of course &quot;dovetailing algorithm&quot; are well known by computer scientists 
<br />
as a way to simulate parallelism on a sequential computer.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Was there a message to the Everything-List in which it was explained 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so that non-experts can understand it? I'm not asking you to track 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that message (or series of messages) down, but if you or somebody 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; remembers around which month it was, that should be enough for me to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; find it. Or is there a link to a Webpage with such an exposition?
</em><br />
<br /><br />I have a lot in my web pages but the Everything Archive does not 
<br />
function properly. I will try to find my own backup, once I have more 
<br />
time.
<br />
<br />But now, Ben, it could be an opportunity and a pleasure for me to 
<br />
explain the UD and  the UDA, again. (Those who have already understand 
<br />
are not obliged to reread the explanations but actually not many people 
<br />
have acknowledge a complete understanding of it).
<br />
After all, the interview with the lobian machine will bear on the UDA. 
<br />
The UDA explains why physics is reduce to a measure on computations 
<br />
&quot;seen from some 1-point-of-view&quot;, and the lobian machine will be able 
<br />
to extract the logic of probability one. This is enough to make the 
<br />
comparison with quantum logic (the logic of probability one in 
<br />
physics).
<br />
