Le 23-sept.-06, &#x2c6; 07:01, Russell Standish a &#x17d;crit :
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Anything provable by a finite set of axioms is necessarily a finite 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; string of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; symbols, and can be found as a subset of my Nothing.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You told us that your Nothing contains all strings. So it contains all 
<br />
formula as &quot;theorems&quot;. But a theory which contains all formulas as 
<br />
theorems is inconsistent.
<br />
I am afraid you confuse some object level (the strings) and 
<br />
theory-level (the theorems about the strings).
<br />
<br />Perhaps the exchange is unfair because I react as a &quot;professional 
<br />
logician&quot;, and you try to convey something informally. But I think that 
<br />
at some point, in our difficult subject, we need to be entirely clear 
<br />
on what we assume or not especially if you are using formal objects, 
<br />
like strings.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I should note that the PROJECTION postulate is implicit in your UDA
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; when you come to speak of the 1-3 distinction. I don't think it can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; derived explicitly from the three &quot;legs&quot; of COMP.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I'm afraid your are confusing the UDA, which is an informal (but 
<br />
rigorous) argument showing that IF I am &quot;digitalisable&quot; machine, then 
<br />
physics  or the &quot;laws of Nature&quot; emerge and are derivable from number 
<br />
theory, and the translation of UDA in arithmetic, alias the interview 
<br />
of a universal chatty machine. The UDA is a &quot;reductio ad absurdo&quot;.  It 
<br />
assumes explicitly consciousness (or folk psychology or grandma 
<br />
psychology as I use those terms in the SANE paper) and a primitive 
<br />
physical universe. With this, the 1-3 distinction follows from the fact 
<br />
that if am copied at the correct level, the two copies cannot know the 
<br />
existence of each other and their personal discourse will 
<br />
differentiate. This is an &quot;illusion&quot; of projection like the wave packet 
<br />
*reduction* is an &quot;illusion&quot; in Everett theory. The UDA reasoning is 
<br />
simple and the conclusion is that there is no primitive physical 
<br />
universe or comp is false. Physics emerges then intuitively from just 
<br />
&quot;immaterial dreams&quot; with subtle overlappings. The UDA does not need to 
<br />
be formalized to become rigorous. But having that UDA-result, we have a 
<br />
thoroughly precise way to extract physics (and all the other 
<br />
hypostases) from the universal interview. For *this* we need to be 
<br />
entirely specific and formal. That is why in *all* my papers (on this 
<br />
subject) I never separate UDA from the lobian interview. This is hard: 
<br />
I would not have succeed without Godel, Lob and other incompleteness 
<br />
theorems.
<br />
I have a problem with your way of talking because you are mixing 
<br />
informal talk with formal object (like the strings). Like when you 
<br />
write:
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The Nothing itself does not have any properties in itself to speak
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of. Rather it is the PROJECTION postulate that means we can treat it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as the set of all strings, from which any conscious viewpoint must
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correspond to a subset of strings.
</em><br />
<br /><br />It looks like a mixing of UDA and the lobian UDA. It is too much fuzzy 
<br />
for me.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But it is neither &quot;nothing&quot;. It is the natural numbers without 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; addition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and multiplication, the countable order, + non standard models.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I disagree - it is more like the real numbers without order, addition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and multiplication group structures, but perhaps with the standard
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; topology, since I want to derive a measure.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Are you saying that your Nothing is the topological line? Again it is 
<br />
not nothing (or it is very confusing to call it nothing), and what you 
<br />
intend will depend on your axiomatization of it. If you stay in first 
<br />
order logic, this will give an even weaker theory than the theory of 
<br />
finite strings: you will no more be able to prove the existence of any 
<br />
integer, or if you take a second order logic presentation of it, then 
<br />
your &quot;nothing&quot; will contain much more than what the ontic comp toes 
<br />
needs, and this is still much more than &quot;nothing&quot;. To be franc I am 
<br />
astonished you want already infinite objects at the ontological level. 
<br />
If *all* infinite strings are in the ontology, that could be a 
<br />
departure from comp (and that would be interesting because, by UDA, 
<br />
that would make your theory predicting a different physics and then we 
<br />
could test it (at least in principle), and only when your theory will 
<br />
be precise enough.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't know what Q1, Q2 and Q3
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Robinson Arithmetic is formalized by the following set of axioms 
<br />
(written in first order language and in &quot;french&quot;):
<br />
<br />Q1)   Ax        0 ­ s(x)    [0 is not a successor]
<br />
Q2)   AxAy    x ­ y -&gt; s(x) ­ s(y)  [different numbers have different 
<br />
successors]
<br />
Q3)   Ax        (x ­ 0  -&gt;  Ey(x = s(y))    [all numbers are successor, 
<br />
except 0]
<br />
<br />Together with the definition of addition:
<br />
<br />Q4)   Ax        x + 0  =  x [adding 0 to a number doesn't change it]
<br />
Q5)   AxAy   x + s(y)  =  s(x + y)  {adding some number x with a 
<br />
successor of some number y gives the successor of the addition of x and 
<br />
y]
<br />
<br />and the definition of multiplication:
<br />
<br />Q6)   Ax         x * 0  =  0 [multiplying a number by 0 gives 0]
<br />
Q7)   AxAy    x * s(y) = (x * y) + x  [if someone asks I will put this 
<br />
one in english but it is long and less understandable!]
<br />
<br /><br />PA, Peano Arithmetic, the &quot;simplest&quot; lobian machine for our purpose: is 
<br />
RA + the inductions axioms:
<br />
[ if P(0) and Ax (P(x) -&gt; P(s(x)) ]  -&gt; AxP(x)
<br />
<br /><br />RA is too dumb to be interviewed, but sufficiently clever to simulate 
<br />
the Universal Dovetailer, including the infinitely simulation of PA, 
<br />
and I interview those PAs. Unlike RA, PA has strong introspective 
<br />
power. PA can prove its own Godel and Lob theorems.
<br />
For example, if we let RA dovetail on all the proofs RA can build, then 
<br />
soon or later RA will prove that PA can prove the consistency of RA, 
<br />
but RA itself will never prove its own consistency. To infer that RA 
<br />
can prove its own consistency from the fact that RA proves that PA 
<br />
proves the consistency of RA would be like inferring I have a headache 
<br />
when I simulate Einstein's brain and got the sentence &quot;I have a 
<br />
headache&quot; (that is mainly Searle's error in his chinese room argument).
<br />
<br />The distinction between RA and PA is introduced because we have to 
<br />
distinguish simulation and belief/theory. Why do we  *have to*? Because 
<br />
of incompleteness which is the roots of all those nuances in computer 
<br />
science, and from which I derive all hypostases or x-person point of 
<br />
view, including the one which gives the &quot;comp-physics&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br />TO SUM UP:  the UDA is an informal rigorous, hopefully correct, 
<br />
argument showing that if we are machine then we are immaterial machine 
<br />
and that immateriality is contagious so that eventually (logically) 
<br />
physics is derivable from number theory under the form of an hypostase 
<br />
(the first person plural view).
<br />
<br />The lobian interview *is* the extraction of physics (and of the other 
<br />
hypostases). It presupposes a complete understanding of the UDA 
<br />
consequence, and it extracts the comp-physics from assumptions on 
<br />
numbers only.
<br />
<br />I though your ontic TOE (the strings) was similar to RA, but I guess I 
<br />
was wrong, so I am less sure I understand what you try to do.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps,
<br />
<br />Bruno
