<em class="quotelev1">&gt; B, rather than A not following B.&quot;
</em><br />
<br />I think you mean, &quot;the likelihood of A following B rather than not-A
<br />
following B&quot;. That's probably reasonable, although I suggested a somewhat
<br />
different approach in this (as usual) somewhat overly long posting:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.nabble.com/Teleportation-thought-experiment-and-UD%2BASSA-tf3057020.html#a8498222">http://www.nabble.com/Teleportation-thought-experiment-and-UD%2BASSA-tf3057020.html#a8498222</a>
<br />
<br />Imagine that we could write down a description of a person's mental
<br />
states for his whole lifetime, from birth to death. Every possible such
<br />
sequence would be a possible lifetime and would exist in the universe
<br />
of all information patterns. Some would have higher measure than others.
<br />
As usual, it is plausible that the highest-measure such lifetimes would
<br />
be those which exist as parts of universes that have reasonably simple
<br />
descriptions.
<br />
<br />Then we can get at your question of what is the likelihood of A following
<br />
B by asking, what is the measure of all lifetimes which experience event
<br />
B followed by event A, compared to the measure of all lifetimes which
<br />
experience event B not followed by event A.
<br />
<br />The difference from what you expressed would be, for example, if some
<br />
future civilization creates simulated OMs which remember B followed by
<br />
A, while in the &quot;real world&quot; B did not get followed by A. Your OM based
<br />
formulation might have those future OMs add quite a bit of measure to
<br />
B-then-A, while the lifetime based formulation would consider those
<br />
as less important, because of the discontinuity between the &quot;original&quot;
<br />
lifetime and the future simulation of B-then-A.
<br />
<br />The lifetime formulation also captures the intuition many people have
<br />
that consciousness should not &quot;jump around&quot; as observer moments are
<br />
created in the various simulations and scenarios we imagine in our
<br />
thought experiments. That was the conclusion I reached in the posting
<br />
referenced above, that teleportation might in some sense &quot;not work&quot;
<br />
even though someone walks out of the machine thousands of miles away
<br />
who remembers walking into it. The measure of such a lifetime would be
<br />
substantially less than that of a similar person who never teleports.
