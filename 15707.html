Hello Bruno,
<br />
<br />this is an answer for a mail a few weeks back, did not have the time up
<br />
to now.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;With comp, we have an (non
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; denombrable) infinity of computations, going through a (denombrable) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; infinity of states, and only few of them, I would say will have 1-OM 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; role or 3-OM role. Even a fewer minority (a priori) will belongs to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sharable computations (physical realities).
</em><br />
<br />Ok, so, in your view, some states code for 1-OM roles (qualia) and some
<br />
states code for shareable views (quanta). Most states code for nothing.
<br />
<br />What is a 3-OM? Do you mean a 3rd-person view description of an OM?
<br />
(for instance the &quot;zombie&quot; coding of a COMP state in a light-beam sent 
<br />
from Earth to Mars)?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; expressible. It is still an open problem if comp leads to solipsism, but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all the evidences available today, are that it does not lead to solipsism.
</em><br />
<br />Which evidence? Is that one of your technical results? Which one?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It would not be a dualism, it would be mind-monism, but the &quot;objects&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; being computed would not be OMs directly but some kind of basic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; mind-components - this idea is not new, in fact these objects would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; correspond to the &quot;dharmas&quot; of yogacara (and also Theravada Buddhism,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; but not so clearly there). (see
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharmas#Dharmas_in_Buddhist_phenomenology">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharmas#Dharmas_in_Buddhist_phenomenology</a>)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; One would lose the wonderful OM-COMP correspondence (which I think is an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; important feature of your COMP) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and get some kind of &quot;binding problem&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; again - how a unified consciousness results from the &quot;dharmas&quot;; but one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; would be able to better explain how we have shareable histories (which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is I think a _weak point_ of COMP if related directed to OMs - as has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; already been mentionend on the list, we can drift into solipsism with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; COMP quite easily (and I don't see why shareable histories of any great
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; measure should evolve)
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; And I would be interested what you think of the idea to let COMP govern
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; a &quot;dharma&quot;-level and not an OM-level directly.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am asking myself if you are not doing a 1004 fallacy(*).  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (*)Like when Bruno said &quot;about 1004 sheep&quot; in &quot;Sylivie and Bruno&quot; by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Lewis Carroll.
</em><br />
&lt;snip&gt;
<br />
<br />It's not a 1004 fallacy, it is rather an attempt to recover some aspects 
<br />
of materialism. (See the Chalmers excerpt I have included below on 
<br />
type-F monism)
<br />
<br />But then, of course, it would succumb also to the MGA argument (that is, 
<br />
it does not go together with COMP).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Try to explain, like if it was to to a &quot;layman&quot;,  the difference you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; make between &quot;dharma-level&quot; and &quot;OM-level&quot;.  Which OM?
</em><br />
<br />I guess I mean the difference between type-F monism and pure idealism 
<br />
(see again Chalmers text included below). Your view is a pure idealism, 
<br />
the type-f monism is a bit nearer to mainstream views (though still not 
<br />
widely held).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; (remember that the superveneience thesis  is more conscience/ &quot;relative 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implementation of states&quot;, than conscience/implementation of states&quot;. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The relativity will add the probability (or credibility) of context and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; histories. 
</em><br />
<br />Ah ok - so you mean that also with COMP and UDA there could be &quot;raw 
<br />
feels&quot; instantiated in Platonia (that would be dharma-level) - or some 
<br />
kind of protoexperential?
<br />
<br />Let me rephrase my question: with MAT, we have certain ideas (which 
<br />
might be wrong) on what mind could supervene on: on brains, that is, on 
<br />
certain organic chemical structures which exhibit high complexity and 
<br />
causal interaction. And this consciousness is a _unified_ experience 
<br />
(which also makes it a bit mysterious for MAT).
<br />
<br />With COMP, I am not sure on what consciousness would supervene. On a 
<br />
single step of a computation? On a turing machine state? On a 
<br />
number-theoretic relation? On a proof?
<br />
<br />And is the supervenient consciousness always tied to an integrated whole 
<br />
like a person, or, as I asked above, could also &quot;raw feels&quot; supervene on 
<br />
some parts of a computation which, relatively to others, constitute part 
<br />
of a computation on which a unified experience would supervene. (maybe 
<br />
that is what you mean with &quot;conscience/ &quot;relative implementation of states&quot;?
<br />
<br />Is that also why you think that COMP is not solipsistic? For example, if 
<br />
consciousness directly supervenes on some form of computation, and 
<br />
physical appearances (SWE etc) have to be derived from the measure on 
<br />
outgoing computations, you must also be aware that all humans in your 
<br />
experience are &quot;physical objects&quot; - they would only _not_ be zombies if 
<br />
they are &quot;fully computed&quot; (such as your OM) - but how can you guarantee 
<br />
that with the idealistic interpretation that you have? With the 
<br />
&quot;relative implementations&quot;?
<br />
<br />I think that there is a bit of a difficulty hidden there.
<br />
I am interested in your thoughts.
<br />
<br />Cheers,
<br />
Günther

<br />Consciousness and its Place in Nature <a href="http://consc.net/papers/nature.html">http://consc.net/papers/nature.html</a>

<br />
<br /><br />Type-F Monism
<br />
<br />Type-F monism is the view that consciousness is constituted by the 
<br />
intrinsic properties of fundamental physical entities: that is, by the 
<br />
categorical bases of fundamental physical dispositions *[[Versions of 
<br />
type-F monism have been put forward by Russell 1926, Feigl 1958/1967, 
<br />
Maxwell 1979, Lockwood 1989, Chalmers 1996, Griffin 1998, Strawson 2000, 
<br />
and Stoljar 2001.]]
<br />
<br />snip
<br />
<br />This view holds the promise of integrating phenomenal and physical 
<br />
properties very tightly in the natural world. Here, nature consists of 
<br />
entities with intrinsic (proto)phenomenal qualities standing in causal
<br />
relations within a spacetime manifold. Physics as we know it emerges 
<br />
from the relations between these entities, whereas consciousness as we 
<br />
know it emerges from their intrinsic nature. As a bonus, this view is
<br />
perfectly compatible with the causal closure of the microphysical, and 
<br />
indeed with existing physical laws.
<br />
<br />The view can retain the structure of physical theory as it already 
<br />
exists; it simply supplements this structure with an intrinsic nature.
<br />
<br />snip
<br />
<br />This view has elements in common with both materialism and dualism. From 
<br />
one perspective, it can be seen as a sort of materialism. If one holds 
<br />
that physical terms refer not to dispositional properties but the
<br />
underlying intrinsic properties, then the protophenomenal properties can 
<br />
be seen as physical properties, thus preserving a sort of materialism. 
<br />
&nbsp;From another perspective, it can be seen as a sort of dualism. The
<br />
view acknowledges phenomenal or protophenomenal properties as 
<br />
ontologically fundamental, and itretains an underlying duality between 
<br />
structural-dispositional properties (those directly characterized in
<br />
physical theory) and intrinsic protophenomenal properties (those 
<br />
responsible for consciousness). One might suggest that while the view 
<br />
arguably fits the letter of materialism, it shares the spirit of
<br />
antimaterialism.
<br />
<br />In its protophenomenal form, the view can be seen as a sort of neutral 
<br />
monism: there are underlying neutral properties X (the protophenomenal 
<br />
properties), such that the X properties are simultaneously responsible 
<br />
for constituting the physical domain (by their relations) and the 
<br />
phenomenal domain (by their collective intrinsic nature). In its 
<br />
phenomenal form, can be seen as a sort of idealism, such that mental
<br />
properties constitute physical properties, although these need not be 
<br />
mental properties in the mind of an observer, and they may need to be 
<br />
supplemented by causal and spatiotemporal properties in addition. One
<br />
could also characterize this form of the view as a sort of panpsychism, 
<br />
with phenomenal properties ubiquitous at the fundamental level. One 
<br />
could give the view in its most general form the name panprotopsychism, 
<br />
with either protophenomenal or phenomenal properties underlying all of 
<br />
physical reality.
<br />
<br /><br />snip
<br />
<br />There is one sort of principled problem in the vicinity. Our 
<br />
phenomenology has a rich and specific structure: it is unified, bounded, 
<br />
differentiated into many different aspects, but with an underlying
<br />
homogeneity to many of the aspects, and appears to have a single subject 
<br />
of experience. It is not easy to see how a distribution of a large 
<br />
number of individual microphysical systems, each with their own
<br />
protophenomenal properties, could somehow add up to this rich and 
<br />
specific structure. Should one not expect something more like a 
<br />
disunified, jagged collection of phenomenal spikes?
<br />
<br />This is a version of what James called the combination problem for 
<br />
panpsychism, or what Stoljar (2001) calls the structural mismatch 
<br />
problem for the Russellian view (see also Foster 1991, pp. 119-30). To
<br />
answer it, it seems that we need a much better understanding of the 
<br />
compositional principles of phenomenology: that is, the principles by 
<br />
which phenomenal properties can be composed or constituted from 
<br />
underlying phenomenal properties, or protophenomenal properties. We have 
<br />
a good understanding of the principles of physical composition, but no 
<br />
real understanding of the principles of phenomenal composition. This is 
<br />
an area that deserves much close attention: I think it is easily the 
<br />
most serious problem for the type-F monist view. At this point, it is an 
<br />
open question whether or not the problem can be solved.
<br />
<br /><br />snip
<br />
<br /><br />Overall, type-F monism promises a deeply integrated and elegant view of 
<br />
nature. No-one has yet developed any sort of detailed theory in this 
<br />
class, and it is not yet clear whether such a theory can be developed. 
<br />
But at the same time, there appear to be no strong reasons to reject the 
<br />
view. As such, type-F monism is likely to provide fertile grounds for 
<br />
further investigation, and it may ultimately provide the best 
<br />
integration of the physical and the phenomenal within the natural world.
<br />
<br /><br />snip
<br />
<br />Second, some nonmaterialists are idealists (in a Berkeleyan sense), 
<br />
holding that the physical world is itself constituted by the conscious 
<br />
states of an observing agent. We might call this view type-I monism. It 
<br />
shares with type-F monism the property that phenomenal states play a 
<br />
role in constituting physical reality, but on the type-I view this 
<br />
happens in a very different way: not by having separate &quot;microscopic&quot; 
<br />
phenomenal states underlying each physical state, but rather by having 
<br />
physical states constituted holistically by a &quot;macroscopic&quot; phenomenal 
<br />
mind. This view seems to be non-naturalistic in a much deeper sense than 
<br />
any of the views above, and in particular seems to suffer from an 
<br />
absence of causal or explanatory closure in nature: once the natural 
<br />
explanation in terms of the external world is removed, highly complex 
<br />
regularities among phenomenal states have to be taken as unexplained in 
<br />
terms of simpler principles. But again, this sort of view should at 
<br />
least be acknowledged.
