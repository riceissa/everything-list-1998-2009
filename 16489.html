<br />Okay, going back to basics.  It seems to me that there are two
<br />
questions:
<br />
<br />A) The problem of explaining WHAT we perceive
<br />
B) The problem of explaining THAT we perceive
<br />
<br />The first issue is addressed by the third-person process of physics,
<br />
and of just generally trying make sense of what we perceive as we go
<br />
through the daily grind of life.  Everybody has a grasp of this issue,
<br />
because you're faced with it everyday as soon as you wake up in the
<br />
morning, &quot;what's going on here???&quot;.
<br />
<br />The second issue is obviously the more subtle first-person problem of
<br />
consciousness.
<br />
<br />But, for A, the fact that we are able to come up with rational-seeming
<br />
explanations for what we experience, and that there seems to us to be
<br />
an orderly pattern to what we perceive, doesn't answer the deeper
<br />
question of the ultimate nature of this external world that we are
<br />
observing.  Here we get into issues of scientific/structural realism.
<br />
In other words, what do our scientific theories really mean?  (http://
<br />
plato.stanford.edu/entries/structural-realism/)
<br />
<br />But I don't think we can assign any real meaning to what we observe
<br />
until we have an acceptable understanding of the first person
<br />
subjective experience by which we make our observations.
<br />
<br />So the question of consciousness is more fundamental than the
<br />
questions of physics.  We can come up with scientific theories to
<br />
explain our observations, but since we don't know what an observation
<br />
really is, this can only get us so far in really understanding what's
<br />
going on with reality.  Until we have a foundation in place,
<br />
everything built above is speculative.  To rely on physics as your
<br />
foundation is &quot;with more than Baron Münchhausen’s audacity, to pull
<br />
oneself up into existence by the hair, out of the swamps of
<br />
nothingness.&quot;
<br />
<br />But here we hit a problem because the process that we use to explain
<br />
objective data doesn't work when applied to subjective experience.
<br />
There is a discontinuity.  The third-person perceived reality vs.
<br />
first-person experienced reality.  The latter apparently can't be
<br />
explained in terms of the former.  But without an explanation for the
<br />
latter, I don't see how any meaning can be attached to the former.
<br />
<br />And I think that is for this reason that I don't get hung up on the
<br />
&quot;white rabbit&quot; problem.  Arguments based on the probability of finding
<br />
yourself in this state or that state are fine if all other things are
<br />
equal, and that's the only information you have to reason with.  But I
<br />
don't think that we're in that situation.
<br />
<br />So I start with the assumption of physicalism and then say that based
<br />
on that assumption, a computer simulation should be conscious, and
<br />
then from there I find reasons to think that consciousness doesn't
<br />
depend on physicalism.  To me, the most likely alternate explanation
<br />
seems to be that consciousness depends on information.  However, I am
<br />
relying on some of my thought experiments that assumed physicalism as
<br />
support for my conclusion of &quot;informationalism&quot;.
<br />
<br />But I think the discontinuity between first and third person
<br />
experience is another important clue, because I think that this break
<br />
will be noticeable to all rational conscious entities in all possible
<br />
worlds (even chaotic, irrational worlds).  They should all notice a
<br />
difference in kind between what is observed (no matter how crazy it
<br />
is), and the subjective experience of making the observation.
<br />
<br />Further, let's say that I am a rational observer in a world where
<br />
changes to brain structure do not appear to cause changes to behavior
<br />
or subjective experience.  Physicalism wouldn't have much appeal in
<br />
this world.  Rather, dualism would seem to have a clear edge as the
<br />
default explanation.  But it might be even easier to make the leap to
<br />
platonism in such a world, as presumably Plato's &quot;ideal forms&quot; might
<br />
be even more appealing.  So in such a world you wouldn't get to
<br />
platonism by way of thinking about computer simulations of brains
<br />
(since brain activity isn't correlated with behavior), but I think you
<br />
would still get there.
<br />
<br />The question is, what kind of world NOT lead you to Platonism?  I
<br />
think only a world that didn't have first person experience.
