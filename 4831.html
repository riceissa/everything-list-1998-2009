<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I guess the problems in this discussion is the lack of precise
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definition of the terms and of the philosophical framework.
</em><br />
<br />This is where I most often feel like speaking up on this amazing list.
<br />
I don't have enough math to really understand things like the Speed 
<br />
Prior, etc., but I do think
<br />
that there are hidden philosophical assumptions (about consciousness, 
<br />
especially) behind many of the approaches here.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; First, in this discussion I am always assuming MWI.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In a materialistic framework - with nothing external to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical world - it is hard to define personal identity if we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; take the MWI in account.
</em><br />
<br />I agree; and in fact it is hard no matter what our favorite 
<br />
metaphysical theory says, MWI or otherwise.  &quot;I&quot; is a very tough 
<br />
philosophical problem.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But in this case there is clearly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no 'soul' or anything other than the configuration of atoms
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to describe what we call 'ourselves'. In any branching of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the multiverse there are multiple copies of my body being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; produced. Nevertheless, I only experience one of those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; states. Therefore, I guess the best I could say is that ' I '
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is one of the instances of this configuration.
</em><br />
<br />When it becomes difficult to say things about &quot;I&quot;, I find it helps to 
<br />
attempt to cast the entire situation into 3rd-person terms.  I would 
<br />
say here that under MWI (and UD, and the rest..) there is a ensemble of 
<br />
entities more or less similar to Eric.  Some of these are different 
<br />
enough that they could be considered different people (such as the Eric 
<br />
who inherited a billion dollars when he was 12 years old), some of them 
<br />
quite similar (such as the Eric who lives where the ambient room 
<br />
temperature is 2 degrees colder) and some of them are so similar 
<br />
(different only temporarily or unnoticeably, or at the quantum level) 
<br />
that they can't be told apart.  &quot;Individual Eric&quot;s within the ensemble 
<br />
can be seen to actually each consist in a fuzzy set of 
<br />
indistinguishable Erics.  The &quot;boundaries&quot; between sets demarcate where 
<br />
differences at the finest-grained levels start to make a difference at 
<br />
levels that an Eric can notice, given the kinds of observations he's 
<br />
making.  The boundaries being &quot;fuzzy&quot; means just that there is no fact 
<br />
of the matter which other copies are really &quot;you&quot; and which are not.  
<br />
This is not a problem!  Well, it is a problem if you insist on some 
<br />
definition of &quot;I&quot;, like that of Descartes, that rules this out; then 
<br />
you must argue for that definition.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let me stress this point: *I am, for all practical purposes,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one and only one specific configuration of atoms in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; specific universe. I could never say that ' I ' is ALL the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; copies, since I NEVER experience what the other copies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience.
</em><br />
Here I think you're making an assumption. You are certainly not ALL the 
<br />
copies, but then it doesn't follow that you are only 1.  &quot;You&quot; could be 
<br />
a fuzzy set of copies that have experiences so similar that they cannot 
<br />
be told apart.  That is, they cannot be told apart &gt;yet&lt;.  Unnoticeable 
<br />
differences eventually can percolate up and make a noticeable 
<br />
difference, or they can be made noticeable by making more sensitive 
<br />
observations.
<br />
&lt;snip&gt;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In some of these branching universes, this configuration
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of atoms that I call 'me' will not show signs of what we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; call life anymore. Notice that death is no different from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any other branching in the multiverse in a materialistic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point of view. There is no 'soul' being detached from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; body or anything else. So there is no reason to suppose
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that my personal experiences will not be, as before, one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of any of the future configurations of these atoms that I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; call 'me', including those where this configuration is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'dead' state.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In particular, after a severe car crash, most of these will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be dead. Notice again that 'dead' has, in this paradigm,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no supernatural meaning, it means nothing more than 'that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; body does not show vital functions anymore'. In particular,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that body has no sensorial experiences anymore. But there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is yet no reason to suppose that I cannot be one of those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bodies. Therefore, in this framework, in the case of a severe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; car crash, the probability that I have no more future sensorial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiences - i.e., that I am dead for good (or bad?) - is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simply the measure of universes where my body is dead.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; When some people suppose that our next experience is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessarily one of the alive ones, they are tacitly assuming
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a dualistic position.
</em><br />
I think they are indeed making an assumption, but not necessarily a 
<br />
dualistic one.  They are making the assumption that there is always a 
<br />
&quot;way out&quot; - that in every set of &quot;I&quot;'s who encounter a dangerous 
<br />
situation, there is always at least one that has a continuation.  There 
<br />
is no need to postulate some &quot;soul&quot; leaping from one body-copy to 
<br />
another.
<br />
<br />If a large set of Eric-equivalents encounter a really dangerous 
<br />
situation, most will not continue, but as long as this assumption holds:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;(The set of reasonably similar Eric-equivalents) contains
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(The set of Erics who are unnoticeably different from you) which 
<br />
contains
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(The set of Erics who have a living continuation after event X)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which has at least one member.&quot;
<br />
<br />then you will not experience yourself dying.  I think this is how 
<br />
materialism can accomodate QTI.  I do think a better attack on QTI is 
<br />
that the final part of the above assumption (the last set has at least 
<br />
one member) isn't well-argued for.  Even if these Eric-sets are 
<br />
infinite there may not be an Eric who survives, say, the sun exploding; 
<br />
just as the infinite set of composite numbers doesn't contain any 
<br />
primes.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But if we decide to accept a dualistic framework QTI would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probably be the least probable scenario. We could as well say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the next experience would be of many other kinds: in other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bodies, reincarnation, or any transcedental experience like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; going to heaven - there is no reason to decide between these.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this reduces to the white rabbit problem again.  The next 
<br />
experience could *always* be of many other kinds, whether we've just 
<br />
had a dangerous event or not.  I think it is an interesting question 
<br />
though, for surviving a fall from a cliff, say, certainly seems like a 
<br />
&quot;white rabbit&quot; event.  Perhaps one would conjecture that under QTI, 
<br />
&quot;white rabbit&quot; events that allow incredible survival must still be as 
<br />
mediocre as possible.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; For instance, QTI poses a difficulty for the dualist: at each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moment, if QTI and is true, an infinity of 'souls' is merging into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one single body, since this body is dying at an infinity of other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universes. How does this square with the common definition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of a 'soul' as an immaterial *individuality*?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
I think this is the least of dualism's problems..=)
<br />
<br />Best regards,
<br />
Pete
