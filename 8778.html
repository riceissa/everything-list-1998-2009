<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Your explication seems to turn on a pun.  &quot;End&quot; as something of value
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; doesn't imply a beginning.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; To the contrary an end or goal or terminus generally entails a beginning.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; A person interested in this subject from a theoretical viewpoint does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; have to confront that. It may help to have some acquaintance with past
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; thought on the matter.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; OK, I'll bite.  I sometimes consider having something to eat a value.  What
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; beginning does that entail?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Wondering whether to eat, how to go about it, whether it's worth it right
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; now, etc. Weighing and deciding. A mini-contest in one's head, or perhaps in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discussion or argument among a group about whether they shall eat now or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; later. To the extent that this decision-making sets precedents, has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ramifications for the group's future decision-making, etc., it has political
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; significance. Deciding who or what gets to decide, by what steps to decide,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; etc. This shows that the word &quot;political&quot; is less broad than the word
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;economic&quot; since it's easy to conceive of economic issues for a man alone on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a desert island. One can't do likewise with the word &quot;political,&quot; or even the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; phrase &quot;political-or-martial,&quot; one has to speak more broadly about &quot;power&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; issues -- the man's control over things on the island, the man's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-control, capacity to govern and pace himself and exert himself to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prepare for things, etc. There's no mot juste for all this.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sure, people care about (value) all kinds of things; even the words
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; used to describe things - see recent debate over &quot;theology&quot; vs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;metaphysics&quot; - some inherently, some instrumentally, and some mixed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But I'm not sure I'd call those &quot;powers&quot; - I guess you mean something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; like &quot;motivations&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; I mean like power, control, force, things that make things happen or not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; happen, things that decide what happens. People want to decide and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; determine things, not just be means to things or to be the ends,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Pygmalions or prey, of others.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; OK, they value autonomy - I guess that's why some get so exercised over the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; compatibilist view of &quot;free will&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; People value beginnings, means, ends, i.e, make general ends of all three.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Actually it would be better and less complicated conceptually if we take off
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the &quot;value&quot; wrapping instead of straightway getting into multiple conceptual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; layers. I mentioned people &quot;wanting&quot; to decide &amp; determine things, just in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; order to place it in a familiar context. I'm not talking about something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unfamiliar. There are all kinds of issues with power and freedom and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; independence. Power over others, avoidance of being under others' power, etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ruling, being ruled, ruling oneself. Well, there's ruling and then there's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; governing. Anyway, the politics of everyday life, some of it mild and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; minimizable, some of it not.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; They care about their relationship, such as they believe it to be,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; their relationship to the power of the universe itself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The power of the universe itself&quot;?  What would that be?  Are you going
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all mystical on me?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm talking about religious people and people who at least have religious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; tendencies. Religion is a common phenomenon with a lot of history to it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; These are sources, beginnings, leaderships, principles, (Greek)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; _/arches/_. This is not mere instrumentality. Deciding and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; determining is not a mere means, the decider employs means to ends.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The decider in that sense is the beginning, the leader.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Not if no one follows.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; The leader of one's own process. As in, being in charge, in situations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; where being in charge is not a given. This situation includes basic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; aspects of one's life.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; That seems to be a dualist position in which YOU are something apart from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; your processes.  Or do you mean aspiring to power over others - which some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; find very gratifying?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; At this point I'm not talking about aspiring. I'm talking straightforwardly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about being in control, making decisions -- at least for oneself. Some want
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more power than that. Some have more power than that and don't want it. Some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have all that and want still more. Parents reasonable want control over their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; children. Most of us have had the opportunity to test our self-control,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; resist destructive temptations in life, etc. There's nothing any more or less
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;dualist&quot; (I don't know what you're getting at) about self-governance than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about self-awareness or any other reflexive sort of thing. Making one's own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; choices, being free to do that, having the backbone to do it, etc., these are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everyday issues.
</em><br />
<br />I guess I've lost the thread of this discussion.  You're saying people 
<br />
value/want self-control - but sometimes they don't.  Sometimes they have 
<br />
self-control - but sometimes they don't.  I gather that a non-trivial decision 
<br />
means one between choices that evoke negative emotions, i.e. no &quot;good&quot; choices.
<br />
<br />I think you'd find the experiments of Libet and Grey Walter interesting.  They 
<br />
are not definitive, but they both provide evidence that decisions are made in 
<br />
the brain before one becomes conscious of them.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; _/Arches kai mesa/_, beginnings/leadings, and means. It's the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; difference between (a) **will &amp; character** and (b) **ability &amp;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; competence**. Aristotle wrote his ethical treatises about character
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in a broader sense than exclusively that of morality, and character
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in that broader sense is what it's about. It's a shame that Aristotle
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; didn't also write treatises about ability and competence,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; _/hikanoteta/_. Now, a carpenter, for instance, is not simply a means
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to carpentry, a means for carpented things to actualize themselves.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Has anyone every suggested such a thing?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; You have commited yourself to that view in dividing everything into means
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; and ends (&quot;instrumental value&quot; and &quot;inherent value&quot;). Since you hold that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; view, you must say that the carpenter's decision to do a job is a means
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; to that job or the end of that job.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; No, that's not exactly my view.  As I said, things can have both
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; instrumental and inherent value.  So a carpenter might decide to do a job
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; because he needs the money and because he enjoys doing capentery.  I didn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; divide *everything* into &quot;ends&quot; and &quot;means&quot;.  I noted that *values* can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of two kinds or have two dimensions: instrumental and inherent.  Some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; things aren't values at all - a decision is not usually a value for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; example.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't see the conceptual or discussional advantage of preferring to keep
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; framing means and ends as two instances of general ends -- values.
</em><br />
<br />Perhaps it is because values can be negative, i.e. pain has a negative value for 
<br />
most and so it is never and end.  However, it may be a means (pinch yourself to 
<br />
stay awake while driving).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Nevertheless, the idea that a decision is not usually also a value leads to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; incoherence. If a decision is not worth making, then why make it? 
</em><br />
<br />I was distinguishing &quot;a decision&quot; from &quot;making a decision&quot;, the latter implies 
<br />
an action which is presumably of value.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;And if the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; decision to make a door is of value in making the door, and that value is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; neither the value of a means nor the value of an end, then what sort of value
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is it? 
</em><br />
<br />OK, I take your point.  It can be regarded as of instrumental value &quot;in making&quot; 
<br />
the door.  For example if I offered the carpenter a good price for a door and 
<br />
that motivated him to decide to make the door, then his decision would be part 
<br />
of the chain that eventuates in my getting the door I wanted.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;For me, it's first of all the value of a kind of beginning, a taking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; up or taking on, an empowering of oneself to risk a test. From another
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; viewpoint, the given decision may be a means, and from another viewpoint, an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; end, and from another viewpoint, a confirmation. If the confirmation was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sought, then the door-decision served as a confirmation which for its part
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was a goal achieved.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Yet it is plain that the carpenter's decision is the carpenter's means
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; and it is plain that the job is not a means for the carpenter to decide
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; to do the job. This shows the inadequacy of means-ends as a dichotomy, a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; division of a whole into two.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It is not plain to me that the carpenter's decision is the capenter's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; means.  If his decision is make a doorway, then his means are a series of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; actions.  Of course making a door is not a means to decide to make a door.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But what are the &quot;means to decide&quot;?  I'd say they are consideration of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; consequences of making a door and how they comport with the carpenter's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; values.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sorry, that was my typo. A carpenter's decision is NOT the carpenter's means.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As for the rest, the carpenter's decision is not the end. If it were the end,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then his decision to make the door would be the end, the goal, accoomplished
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by his making the door. The making of the door, and the made door itself, are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not means to deciding to make the door in the first place. The carpenter's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; decision to make the door is, then, neither the means to the door, nor the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; end of the door (nor the end of making the door). Yet it has a role qua
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deciding in this means-end structure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The carpenter tries and deliberates, pursues, chooses or accepts (or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rejects), and adheres to (or renounces) his/her underlying decisions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; even to do the work at all, throughout the process. Is all this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; volition a &quot;means&quot;?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No - I don't insist on *everything* being a means or an end.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Somethings are neither, e.g. &quot;volition&quot;.  My view is that volition is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; feeling that the brain attaches to decisions to mark them as internal -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; as opposed to, for example, perceptions which are external and not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; voluntary.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't see the difference between human deciding and human volition. I don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mean the words &quot;volition&quot; or &quot;will&quot; in such a strong psychological sense. To
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will is just a more general term for to try, to seek, to decide or take, to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; adhere, or the contraries of those (to reject, etc.). Human agency is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; volition, humanly being affected is affectivity -- one's being affected by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some of those external decisions which you mention. Cognitive perception is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more a being or becoming supported than a being affected (e.g., wrenchingly).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think that the means-end dichotomy is weakened if you have these other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relations constantly essentially _involved_ in it but they're just &quot;other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stuff.&quot;.And I don't think you succeed in delimiting a realm of &quot;value&quot; that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can be divided into means and ends exhaustively, 
</em><br />
<br />You keep mischaracterizing my view.  I don't insist on dividing values into 
<br />
means and ends.  I see inherent and instrumental as two kinds of attributes a 
<br />
value can have. It can have them both at once; they are different but not contrary.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;the same problem reappears
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there. You have &quot;instrumental&quot; and &quot;inherent&quot; value -- mesic &amp; telic -- and I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pointed out (in different words) that there are archic values that are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; neither mes! ic per se nor telic per se. The Greek _arche_ does work better
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than the English &quot;beginning.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The problem is that will, deciding, etc., is always related to means and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ends. So what is it, in means-ends terms? Means and ends are middles and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ends, moyens et fins, medios y fines, mesa kai teloi, etc., etc. But the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; willing, the deciding is not, qua the kind of &quot;beginning&quot; which it is, either
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; means or ends.
</em><br />
<br />Above you argued that the carpenter's decision to build a door had instrumental 
<br />
value in building the door.  So that would make it a means too.
<br />
<br />You seem to be concerned to carve out a special category for human decisions, a 
<br />
&quot;will&quot; or &quot;volition&quot; that is not determined by anything merely mechanical or 
<br />
calculable.  That would be inconsistent with Bruno's &quot;comp&quot; hypothesis.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Somebody else's means, perhaps; the market's means perhaps, and so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on. But it isn't the carpenter's means, it's the carpenter's leading,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; deciding, etc. which, by means, tools, resources, s/he carries out.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This striving and deciding is most clearly seen as no mere means in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; contexts where control is truly at stake.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I would suppose that a carpenter has pride of workmanship and so there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is inherent pleasure in doing his job well.  His choice of this tool or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that is partly instrumental relative to that pleasure.  But he also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; does carpentry as a means to food, shelter, etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; So what? You're confusing the decision-making with the goals and values
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; and feelings, as if, given a set of goals, the decisions were already
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; made, or get made automatically, and as if people's decision-making were
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; a trivial process.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;trivial&quot;?  How do you know they aren't?  Are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; you aware of the experiments of Libet and Grey Walter.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No. I am extremely doubtful that some &quot;experiments&quot; are about to overthrow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all the trouble that people take over decision-making in everyday life, in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; various disciplines, in various communities, in various practices and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; employments, and especially in various arenas -- in debate, in sports &amp;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fashion, in business &amp; finance, and especially in politics and in war and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; combat. 
</em><br />
<br />I don't know what &quot;overthrow&quot; could mean in this context.  But experiments may 
<br />
show that people don't make decisions the way they think they do.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The making of decisions, and the making decisions stick, is a very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; big part of life. We have police forces and justice systems for it, for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instance. Sometimes people overemphasize process, but some respect for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; decision-making processes is essential in a free society.
</em><br />
<br />A free society generally refers to one in which individuals get to make 
<br />
decisions for themselves - with as little help as possible from police forces 
<br />
and judges.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You might as well ask how I know that all thought processes represented on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the everything-list aren't trivial. 
</em><br />
<br />I'm not asking you how you know (though I may get around to that).  What I asked 
<br />
is what you mean by &quot;trivial&quot; or &quot;non-trivial&quot;.  My current guess is you just 
<br />
mean difficult in some sense, either because it is hard to forsee consequences 
<br />
or because all choices seem to be bad ones.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The selective employment of hyperbolic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Cartesian doubt is not constructive.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; But goals and values and feelings sometimes conflict, in multifarious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; ways. Sometimes there is no clear answer and one has to decide anyway.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; So what?  It is usually uncertain what all the consequences of an action
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; may be.   Also people often have values that are not transitive, i.e. they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; prefer A to B
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and B to C and C to A; particularly when A, B, and C may be in different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mental categories.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This makes no sense. You're arguing that decision-making is still trivial
</em><br />
<br />I didn't argue that anything was &quot;trivial&quot; because I don't know what you mean by it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; even when decision-making is difficult and when the outcome is not absolutely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assured. 
</em><br />
<br />You mean not absolutely predictable by a 3rd party?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Is this supposed to be true in an individual, or among individuals
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in groups, or both? 
</em><br />
<br />It is certainly true in groups, c.f. Arrow's theorem.  Although economists often 
<br />
assume that individuals have completely transitive value sets, experiments tend 
<br />
to show they don't.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;If we care about what kind of society we live in, I don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think that we can regard decision-making, either in an individual, or among
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; individuals, as trivial. And also you say that sometimes preferences are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; clear and somehow the occurrence of such cases is &quot;good enough&quot; -- for what?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is that supposed to be trivial or nontrivial decision-making? I'm not sure of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your point there.
</em><br />
<br />Me neither.   I don't recall writing those things.  I think maybe we are in 
<br />
violent agreement ;-)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In the carpenter's sawing, hammering, etc., the exercise of skills
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and abilities, control is not really at stake. But in the carpenter's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; will and decision-making, control of the situation among various
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; factors in the carpenter is at stake.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think I understand the words, but the sentence leaves me blank.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; The carpenter may be of more than one mind on what to do. I don't mean
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; that the carpenter has a multiple personality. I mean that the carpenter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; may be of more than one mind in just the sense that &quot;more than one mind&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; is commnly used. Some element in the carpenter's mind will have to gain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; the upper hand. This will embody certain interests and efforts rather
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; than others by the carpenter in his/her life. Or maybe the carpenter will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; solve diverse problems together with creative solution.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But whatever choice he makes it is his choice - his control wasn't at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; stake?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Control within him was at stake. What are the controlling choices which he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; makes in life, the controlling repeated choices and habits? I'm not switching
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to psychology, but this is elementary psychology. 
</em><br />
<br />That goes with a modular theory of mind - which I find worth entertaining.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;And in every case you can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; also consider situations involving individuals in a group, and in various and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; overlapping groups.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Now, one is free to devise an epicycle-filled &quot;anthropo-nomy&quot; in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; order to describe intelligent beings while classing volition and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; decision-making as mere means, but it's not particularly useful.&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It's the basis of a whole branch of mathematics called decision theory,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a branch which is widely *used*.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; They can use it all they like, that won't stop the terminology from being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; inferior. Since we're talking about mathematicians, in whom eloquence is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; rarer than speech in goldfish, my safe guess is that they're just using
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; words like &quot;means&quot; or &quot;instrumentality&quot; in sub-optimal ways. Economists
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; talk about the inherent value which people ascribe to things but they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; call it &quot;utility value.&quot; Unfortunately I can't recommend contemporary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; lit. depts. as any sort of remedy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I'd recommend contemporary lit depts as sources of disease. :-)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, we're in agreement there.  I wonder why back when there used to be a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;literary scene&quot; in the USA, lit professors didn't find it strange that their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; depts., even the most prominent of them, had no relationship to it. On the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other hand, at least in the old days lit professors very often did take some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interest in literature. Anyway, I'm out of the lit loop these days.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Anyway, I see no reason to take such terminologies seriously -- it's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; useless and counterproductive when the purpose is understanding.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; One way of understanding the mind is to create an artificial one.  People
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; who do that find the terminology useful.  See for example John McCarthy's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; writings on robots and self-awareness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Okay, seriously, I don't know anything about the terminology of mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; decision theory. If I saw it, I might find it quite reasonable. The idea that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they call decisions &quot;means&quot; bothers me, if that's what they do. I know how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they'd take such objections -- they'd ask, how would meeting such objections
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; improve decision theory? Well, I wouldn't know specifically.
</em><br />
<br />They'd call decisions about whether to make a decision &quot;2nd order decisions&quot; - 
<br />
not &quot;means&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Another way to see this is by a set of examples comprising an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; exhaustive set of a certain kind of combinations of the two.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What two - you seem to introduce a lot more than two things below?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. Choice and decision-making. 2. Means, methods, practices. Then I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; combine those two things in four ways.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Oh, OK.  So choice about means is economics - but isn't it also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; engineering?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The soundbyte characterization of economic activity as choice in regard to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; means is from the Austrian School of economics. I would characterize
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; engineering as a discipline, a cultivated kind of know-how. Knowledge in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; regard to means. Again, a soundbyte characterization. I don't mean I read
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; book and become an engineer. If you set such practical/productive disciplines
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concerned with means, as engineering, set them alongside decision-making
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about means, the differences will stand out better and the reasons for such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; choices of characterization will appear more clearly. Business is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; competitive, businesspeople make decisions, decisions about reforming a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; company are also business decisions, and in competition things get decided
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; beyond the power of individual businesspeople. It's a larger decision-making
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; process, rife with unintended consequences. Conflict, competition, decidings.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That's what it is. And it's in regard to means, resources, etc. Sure, one can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pursue a discipline of business, but that's a discipline _about_ business and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; applied in business. Nobody calls business, itself, &quot;know-how.&quot; One im! 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mediately associates &quot;know-how&quot; to things like engineering. Business, in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; general sense, is more like &quot;decide-how,&quot; though it's true that nobody would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; call it that, I think because somehow that &quot;how&quot; doesn't clearly evoke means
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the full-fledged instrumental sense.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Art has been characterized as essentially a process of selection, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; selective composition, by Wordsworth for instance. But I would characterize
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it as a _discipline_, a cultivated kind of knowing or understanding in what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; effects one feels things (affectively). This combination of cognition &amp;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; affectivity in its basics has, I think, something to do with why beauty (or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whatever one wants to call it, the aesthetic value) is not necessarily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hedonistic and seldom has been hedonistic. Artistic beauty is a spectator
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; kind of thing, the spectator may feel moved and infused with complex precise
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; feelings, but remains usually a spectator, though some playwrights in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particular have tried to change that. Anyway, the works are embodiments of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such understandings. Not a systematic, scientific knowledge or understanding.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Such would be affective psychology. Psychology or any discipline of knowledge
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or research is a cultivated kind of learning or knowing in or on what light
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or basis one learns o! r knows things.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; And don't generals choose the means the means to attack or defend?  I guess
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;with regard to&quot; seems very vague to me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; They are some very general characterizations. I think such characterizations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have more value if done systematically, such that, for instance, the linking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;with regard to&quot; varies systematically when made more specific. That's just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; too complicated for this discussion.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A means which is a way of contesting or fighting to retain control, where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; control is significantly at stake, is not just a workaday means, it's a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; weapon, an enforcer, a decider, your decider against others. Arms, defensive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &amp; offensive, armadas, ammunition, etc. Then think of all those things which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in nonviolent conflicts we call weapons and defenses -- not literal swords
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and shields yet serving parallel functions. Again, the overall context is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; important -- is it a context of struggle to gain or keep control, or is it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cooperative or at least tolerant, with forces safely under control? It's the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; difference between fighting, and work or chores.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, any added thing which enhances is apt to be called a means. Icing on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cake is kind of means or way to enhanced pleasure. Really it's an enhancement
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the end, not a tool or resource toward an end. But still, it's one of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; those added things. The sword isn't you (though you're supposed to wield it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as an extension of yourself), it isn't your goal or your opponent or your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; victory, it's in between and amid those things, so it's natural to see it as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a kind of middle. But its role is really not that of mediating and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; facilitating, instead it's your will, or your general's will, in steel,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; clashing for control, whereby you empower yourself or your general, or are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; overcome.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Or maybe a lot of categories we've invented for the work.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Politics &amp; martial affairs; business; management &amp; compliance; skills of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; labor &amp; cooperation -- &quot;invented categories&quot;? That's not a serious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; remark.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Why not?  I could also categorize the same actions as communication,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; calculation, and physical labor?  All categories are invented.  My point
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; was that simply classifying something according to a lot attributes doesn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; make that something any bigger (or smaller).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Which of those activities could possibly be categorized as &quot;calculation&quot;?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That's the most surprising thing that you've said. 
</em><br />
<br />Management is the allocation of resources, which often involves calculation.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;If categories are all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;invented,&quot; arbitrary, then there's no point in their whimsicality. 
</em><br />
<br />Invented isn't the same as arbitrary.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Anyway,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the point of those four was to bring into clearer relief the destinctions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between deciding and performance, character &amp; competence, etc, by pondering
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what each of the four actually involve. One of them could be classed as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; calculation? That's a stretch right out of sight.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm always suspicious of schemes with &quot;Levels&quot;.  Sometimes the schemer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; invents the levels to put his opinions at the highest (and implicity,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the best) level.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; I was talking about Tegmark's Levels and correlations thereto, as I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; mentioned that I thought I should try to bring the discussion &quot;back to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; the Everything,&quot; I'm not aware of high-low valuations among those Levels.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; OK.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Another piece of agreed clarity. But I don't know how much longer we can get
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; away with this off-topicality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<br />No problem.  You talked about Tegmark's levels.  I got us back on topic by 
<br />
pointing out that your theory of mind is inconsistent with Bruno's &quot;comp&quot; - if I 
<br />
understand them correctly.
