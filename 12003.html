<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Have you read Francis Schaeffer's trilogy of books: The God Who Is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; There, Escape From Reason, and He Is There And He Is Not Silent.  He
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; talks about the consequences of the belief in the uniformity of

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; natural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; causes in a closed system.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; No. But if you want to send a little summary, please do.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; If by uniformity of natural causes in a closed system you mean
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; something describable by a total computable function, I can understand
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the point (but recall I don't assume neither the notion of Nature nor
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of Cause). Now, the computerland is closed for diagonalization &quot;only&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; That is something quite different, making computerland much open than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; anything describable by total computable functions.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is no way that I can give a little summary, but I'll try anyway.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think this will also go towards addressing Stathis' allusion to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; faith.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One thing Schaeffer did was remind us that the assumptions of nature
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and cause were foundational to modern science.  We have to assume that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is a nature to reality in order to study it and use our reason to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; make sense of it.  Reality has to &quot;make sense&quot; inherently, i.e. it has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to have an order to it, in order for us to &quot;make sense&quot; of it.  Our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reason (rationality) makes use of antithesis, to induce cause and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; effect.  Perhaps nature and cause do not appear as formal assumptions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in comp, but do you not make use of a belief in them in the process of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thinking and talking about comp, and surely in the process of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; empirically verifying/falsifying it?


</em><br />
Sure.



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Schaeffer maintained that the basis for antithesis is not that it was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an invention of Aristotle or anyone, but that the basis for antithesis
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is reality itself, based on the God who is there (as opposed to not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being there).

</em><br />
I agree with this a priori. At this stage making a difference between 
<br />
reality, nature and god seems to me to be 1004 fallacies. In order to 
<br />
have the motivation for doing science you have to believe in some 
<br />
reality.



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  The existence of the personal God answers the questions:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) Why is there something rather than nothing?  i.e. the question of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the origin of the form of the universe, why does it &quot;make sense&quot;?  What
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is the basis for the nature of reality and beauty?


</em><br />
Here I disagree. The &quot;existence of God&quot; does not explain why is there 
<br />
something rather than nothing. It could be a promise for such an 
<br />
explanation but using &quot;god&quot; or &quot;reality&quot; as an explanation does not 
<br />
work, indeed such belief are related to faith.
<br />
There is a difference between believing or trusting God, and using 
<br />
badly the God notion for explaining genuine problem away.



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) Why is man the way he/she is?  Why is man able to have language and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do science, and make sense of the world?  Why is man able to love and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; figure out what is right?  What is the basis for meaning?  What is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; basis for mind?  How can persons know one another?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3) Why is man able to know anything, and know that he knows what he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; knows?  What is the basis for truth?  What is truth?


</em><br />
Here the comp hyp provides genuine answers including testable 
<br />
predictions. Of course the comp hyp presuppose a reality (number's 
<br />
reality, truth about numbers). Then it can explain why we have to have 
<br />
some faith in numbers in the sense that we cannot explain numbers from 
<br />
something simpler.



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, from the birth of modern science, we have taken a journey to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dispense with any kind of faith

</em><br />
Let us define &quot;faith&quot; by belief in unproved or unprovable truth. The 
<br />
idea that science dispense with faith is a myth. A lot of physicists 
<br />
have faith in a primitive physical reality (I lost *that* faith unless 
<br />
you enlarge the sense of &quot;physics&quot;).



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and try to be exhaustive in our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; automony and control.  Ironically we have abandoned rationality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (including antithesis),

</em><br />
I agree. We have abandoned rationality in &quot;theology&quot; (the science of 
<br />
the fundamental reality whatever it is, say) since a long time, and 
<br />
this made us partially abandoning rationality in the study of nature, 
<br />
appearances, etc. as well.
<br />
For some reason many &quot;scientist&quot; just abandon the scientific attitude 
<br />
when they talk in fields in which they are not expert, instead of 
<br />
remaining silent. And this is doubly true when the field in which they 
<br />
are not expert is related to fundamental question.


<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and we have abandoned ourselves to ourselves.


</em><br />
That is a poetical way to put the things, but remember that if we are 
<br />
machine there are at least about  2 * 8 utterly different (and 
<br />
interacting, sometimes conflicting) sense for &quot;ourselves&quot;, some 
<br />
including notions of faith. So some care is needed here.


<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We are lost in a silent sea of meaningless 0's and 1's, and man is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine.


</em><br />
???  You talk like if you were subscribing to some pre-godelian 
<br />
reductionist conception of machine (like so many &quot;materialist&quot;).



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is why I said that when we put ourselves at the center of our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; worldview, it is a prison.

</em><br />
OK for that analogy.

<br />
You add:

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I want to be clear that it isn't modern science that is to blame, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the abandonment of faith (being certain of what we do not see).  It
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; isn't that there's something unique to this time in history either.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This has happened multiple times in history.  Now we are seeing perhaps
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a backlash from man as a machine, in lots of different ways e.g.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; postmodernism, fundamentalism...  But if there is a God who is there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and is not silent, then faith takes on a different meaning.  Faith in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and of itself does not do the trick.  It has to be faith in a real
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality, a true truth.

</em><br />
I agree (with the proviso that I suppose that by &quot;machine&quot; you talk 
<br />
about the old pregodelian conception of (non universal) machine.
<br />
We don't know what universal machine are capable of, and I don't see 
<br />
why a present &quot;God&quot; would abandon them.  I hope you can harbor some 
<br />
doubt about the proposition that machine are stupid, lack subjective 
<br />
phenomenality, etc.
