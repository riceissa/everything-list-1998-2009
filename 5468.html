Not yet. We know that the bizarre, inconsistent worlds must exist if the 
<br />
Platonia idea is correct, but we (or at least I) don't currently know how 
<br />
likely they are. In Platonia, there are X number of possible-next-states 
<br />
from my current state. (For simplicity's sake, lets even say that X is a 
<br />
very very large finite number.) If a vast majority of these states show me 
<br />
sitting in my chair typing, with my computer not turning into a kangaroo, 
<br />
etc., then no, the fact that my world so far has not been bizarre and 
<br />
inconsistent does *not* cast doubt on the validity of the Platonia theory. 
<br />
In fact, if we can show logically, mathematically, or computationally (for 
<br />
me these are all ultimately the same thing) that a vast majority of my 
<br />
next-possible-states do in fact show me sitting in my chair typing, with 
<br />
very few computers turning into kangaroos, this would be an extremely strong 
<br />
reason to believe that the Platonia theory is correct, because it's survived 
<br />
a rather stringent falsification test.

<br />This analysis is sound only in the common sense single world situation. You 
<br />
get into trouble if you try to use conventional probabilities if multiple 
<br />
histories/worlds/copies are allowed, as I tried to show with the 
<br />
teleportation example.
<br />
<br />Suppose that the overwhelming majority of your next-possible-states are 
<br />
totally bizarre, according to the theory we are testing. If only one copy of 
<br />
you can exist at any one time, then the theory predicts that there is a 
<br />
billion to one probability that in the next second you will find yourself in 
<br />
a bizarre universe. As a matter of fact, as you read these words, you do not 
<br />
find that the world around you suddenly becomes bizarre. Therefore, the 
<br />
theory is most likely wrong.
<br />
<br />Consider now a similar theory, but multiple copies of you are allowed. The 
<br />
theory predicts that there will be one billion branchings of the world in 
<br />
the next second, with each branch containing a person who shares all your 
<br />
memories up to that point. The theory also predicts, as above, that all but 
<br />
one of these worlds will be obviously bizarre. As a matter of fact, as you 
<br />
read these words, you do not experience the world around you suddenly 
<br />
becoming bizarre. But unlike the previous example, this is entirely 
<br />
consistent with the theory, which predicted that one version of you would 
<br />
continue in the world as per usual.
