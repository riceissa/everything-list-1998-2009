</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Bruno,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; I started to read [the English version of] your discourse on Origin 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Physical Laws and Sensations. I will read more later. It is certainly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; very interesting and thought provoking. It makes me think of 'Reasons
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; and Persons' by Derek Parfitt. His book is very dry in places but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; mostly very well worth the effort of ploughing through it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Parfit is good. I stop to follow him when he insists that we are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; token.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I paraphrase myself sometimes by the slogan MANY TYPES NO TOKEN.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Can you explain the disagreement with Parfit? My reading of chapter 99 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; R &amp; P is that a &quot;token&quot; is a particular instantiation of a person 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; while a &quot;type&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is the ensemble of related instantiations. &quot;Mary Smith&quot; is a type, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Mary Smith
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; coming out of replicator no. 978 at 11:05 AM&quot; is a token.
</em><br />
<br /><br />When I say &quot;MANY TYPES NO TOKEN&quot;, I assume comp *and* the conclusion I 
<br />
derive from it, that is the reversal between physics and &quot;number 
<br />
theoretical machine theory&quot; (say). In particular I take from granted 
<br />
that my next &quot;observer moment&quot; is somehow determined by two things: a 
<br />
&quot;proportion&quot; of computational histories going through my actual 
<br />
computational state, and the proportion of consistent extensions, which 
<br />
are related to a &quot;proportion&quot; of similar computational histories.
<br />
So with comp &quot;Mary Smith coming out of a replicator no. 978 at 11:05 
<br />
AM&quot; is a type. It is the type of all (2^aleph_0) histories going 
<br />
through that event (supposedly well 3-described).
<br />
&nbsp;From a third person point of view, if you are willing to say that the 
<br />
natural numbers are token (I am neutral on that), then it would make 
<br />
sense to see the nth step of an immaterial execution of a DU, (or an 
<br />
enumeration of the true sigma_1 arithmetical sentences) as (immaterial) 
<br />
tokens. But even in that case, there would be no sense to attribute 
<br />
tokenness to &quot;Mary Smith coming out of a replicator no. 978 at 11:05 
<br />
AM&quot;, because there is no way to privilege one instantiation from 
<br />
another. We must take them all, and they constitute highly undecidable 
<br />
sets.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It appears that in this terminology (actually due to Bernard Williams, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not Parfit)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; once generated a token remains the same token until there is another 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; branching,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but my preference is to generalise the term and say that a token has 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only transient
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence, which then makes &quot;token&quot; equivalent to &quot;observer moment&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK. I prefer.
<br />
With comp it has to correspond to the third person Observer Moment (OM 
<br />
hereafter).
<br />
They are the true Sigma_1 sentences, or the accessible states by the UD.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; literally true, given that from moment to moment, even in the absence 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of teleportation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; etc., the atoms in your body turn over such that after a certain time 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; none of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter in your body is the &quot;same&quot;, and before this time the fact that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter in your body is the &quot;same&quot; is accidental and makes no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; difference to your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious experience.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Assuming bodies. I see the point.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As to whether I am token or type: obviously, literally, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I-who-write-this-now am a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; token.
</em><br />
<br />This looks like the first person OM. It is different from the preceding 
<br />
one.
<br />
The 3-OM are enumerable, even recursively enumerable.
<br />
The 1-OM  are enumerable but not recursively enumerable (for those who 
<br />
have the Cutland, it is a simple consequence of Rice theorem).
<br />
And the similarity classes of the 1-OM (= states plus its relative 
<br />
proportion) has the power of the continuum.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  My present token is included in the set of related tokens in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; past, future,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other branches of the multiverse, surreptitious emulations of my mind 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; made by aliens,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and so on: the type. Note that the definition of a particular token 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (especially in my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generalised sense, fixed to a specific and unique position in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multiverse) can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; made completely unambiguous,
</em><br />
<br /><br />How? With comp (with the multiverse = UD*) you have to bet on a level 
<br />
of description of you, and then, even in the lucky case of a correct 
<br />
bet, I still don't see how you will discover you present token, if only 
<br />
because of the many undistinguishable computational histories going 
<br />
through that state (which I recall you can only bet on).
<br />
This was about your 3-OM token. The situation is even more difficult 
<br />
for the 1-OM token, which is determined in the neighborhood of the 
<br />
infinite.
<br />
And frankly if you believe a recording can be conscious, don't forget 
<br />
to look for the infinitely any emulation any recording before telling 
<br />
me where is your 1-OM in UD*.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; while the definition of a type is necessarily vague and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fuzzy arround the edges. For example, if a being exists somewhere with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 70% of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my memories and 30% of your memories, should he be included in my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; type, your type,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a new type, or some combination of these? It is only because we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience a linear
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence from birth to death, so that only a single token is extant 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at a time and there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is clear physical continuity from one token to the next, that we can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ignore the distinction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between token and type and consider the definition of a particular 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; type to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unambiguous.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree. But thought experiments involving self-duplication are here to 
<br />
remind such distinctions. Like the superposition is contagious in the 
<br />
quantum multiverse, with comp typeness is contagious: Mary Smith, being 
<br />
digitally duplicable, is a type and when she leaves the replicator 978, 
<br />
she does not instantiate in &quot;Mary Smith coming out of a replicator no. 
<br />
978 at 11:05 AM&quot;, she just particularizes herself into the more 
<br />
particular type of the &quot;Mary Smith coming out of a replicator no. 978 
<br />
at 11:05 AM&quot;. But there are many of such types, even not counting those 
<br />
emulated by the &quot;recordings&quot; emulated in the UD* (or the sigma_1 true 
<br />
sentences).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As for what matters in survival, that is a contingent fact of the way 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our brains have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evolved.
</em><br />
<br /><br />We can bet that survival of (many pov) values is necessary in the long 
<br />
term.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  It isn't as simple as saying that survival of type is what matters, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; except in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; abovementioned linear existence with which we are familiar. One 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concise way to put it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is that what matters in survival is that there should exist at least 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one token (or observer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moment, or instantiation) which has my present token's memories in its 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; past. Moreover,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it is important that where several such tokens exist, as I may feel 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; myself &quot;becoming&quot; any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one of them with equal probability, as many as possible should have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; good experiences.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This works for simple branchings, but it becomes complicated when we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consider mergings
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and partial memory loss. Another problem is tokens in parallel worlds: 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I could say I don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; survive if no future tokens exist who have my present memories,
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK, but I really think that it is less misleading to reason on a block 
<br />
reality (like UD*), instead of taking the risk to confuse first person 
<br />
time (which cannot not exist) and third person time (which could not 
<br />
exist)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  even though other tokens
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exist in the multiverse who branched off some time ago, but then that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would be like saying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't survive if I experience any memory loss at all, for example 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; due to medications like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; midazolam. It could be that every second, tokens are finding 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; themselves in hellish multiverse
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; branches where they suffer horribly then die, which is equivalent to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suffering horribly then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; having the memory of the experience erased.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Hoping that is possible.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; We can describe exactly what happens in each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of these cases using the token or observer moment terminology,
</em><br />
<br />For the 3-OM, we can only bet on descriptions. We don't know our 
<br />
substitution levels.
<br />
The 1-OM can only hope their neighborhoods are enough coherent so that 
<br />
their goals make sense.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; but reconciling this with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; psychological survival is problematic because our brains did not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evolve to cope with these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sorts of situations.
</em><br />
<br />OK. But it is perhaps the same as jumping with a parachute. We can 
<br />
learn.
<br />
(The lobian interview shows that the tension between the first person 
<br />
views and the third person views (and other hypostases) will be with us 
<br />
forever so that we have to learn forever ... and even after that we can 
<br />
still expect to be surprised infinitely often and force to cope with 
<br />
new situations).
