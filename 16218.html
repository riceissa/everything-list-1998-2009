<br /><br />Chapter 1
<br />
<br />Introduction
<br />
<br />The mind returns to itself like a glove – Buddhist proverb
<br />
<br />Mr Edgar Morin, president of the jury on Le Monde 1998’s University  
<br />
Research Prize, commended the laureates, I amongst them, seeing the  
<br />
happy fortune of our doctoral theses published chez Grasset, that we  
<br />
should have no hesitation in adopting a presentation bearing full  
<br />
witness to the human and personal aspect - all of which decided me to  
<br />
relate it’s entire history.
<br />
<br />I should recognise the somewhat special character of the result, but  
<br />
also, and perhaps especially, because of the nature of the path  
<br />
undertaken. I brought up the question of the work’s basis for the  
<br />
first time in 1963, at a school in Brussels. I was eight years old: I  
<br />
do not know if I was particularly precocious or merely highly-strung.  
<br />
In effect the motivation for this work and, for the research toward it  
<br />
commencing in infancy, has always been linked to a fear of death.
<br />
<br />There are other more fundamental reasons for my describing this  
<br />
unfolding path, an essential part of which is situated in my earliest  
<br />
infancy:
<br />
<br />1.     The work is essentially multidisciplinary. It is situated at  
<br />
the intersection of numerous disciplines – theology, psychology,  
<br />
biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, information technology –  
<br />
and, suddenly, it is difficult to know with what to begin. Bearing  
<br />
this in mind, the way of kids’ questions is particularly fit for the  
<br />
purpose.
<br />
<br />2.     I questioned myself, but rapidly began wondering where the  
<br />
questions came from; a good part of the thesis rests on a process of  
<br />
self-observation. We will see how the thesis is naturally self- 
<br />
explanatory, how it explains its own genesis. An aspect made clearer  
<br />
if one follows, even if only briefly, the path of the kiddies’  
<br />
questions. I myself profited thereby and ended up with a more polished  
<br />
version of the principal argument. There is no attempt at dumbing-down  
<br />
and the reader can skip any passages judged too technical.
<br />
<br />3.     The opportunity to do justice and homage to the great authors  
<br />
and books that stake out my quest, amongst them: G. Ames &amp; R. Wyler,  
<br />
James Watson, Linus Pauling, Michel-Yves Bernard, Lewis Carroll, E.  
<br />
Nagel &amp; J.R. Newman, Jean Ladrière, S.C. Kleene, Bernard d’Espagnat.
<br />
<br />4.     …and to recount a Belgian in the best, or universal story in  
<br />
the worst of cases, nothing at all of which is very funny. This story  
<br />
explains why I defended my thesis in 1998 in France. I shall recount  
<br />
these events without hatred or spirit of revenge.
<br />
<br />I will tell you in several words even now, the principal result. To  
<br />
begin with, the work presents a proof, which is to say a deductive or,  
<br />
to use heavier terminology, a hypothetico-deductive argument. This  
<br />
signifies there is a hypothesis as much as a “thesis”, in the more  
<br />
technical sense of what is demonstrated from this hypothesis.
<br />
<br />By way of proof, I expect that if the reader is not fully convinced of  
<br />
the result after study of the work, he should put up either a non- 
<br />
justified proposition or an error. Note that, concerning deductive  
<br />
work, conclusions never officially carry over to reality. Scientific  
<br />
proofs operate inside the frame of a postulated theory. Science is  
<br />
thus always modest on the subject of its applicability to or its  
<br />
approximation to the real.
<br />
<br />The hypothesis is that of Mechanism: the idea that we could be digital  
<br />
machines, in a sense that will be rendered more clearly in due course.  
<br />
Grossly speaking, we would be machines in the precise sense that no  
<br />
parts of our bodies are privileged with respect to an eventual  
<br />
functional substitution: this says that we can survive a heart  
<br />
substitution by the transplant of an artificial heart, or of a kidney  
<br />
by an artificial kidney, etc., inasmuch as the substitution is carried  
<br />
out at a sufficiently fine level. Neither can there be any constraints  
<br />
imposed on the level of substitution chosen. It’s important to  
<br />
remember that I am not going to defend the hypothesis of Mechanism. I  
<br />
only want to pose this hypothesis at the outset. It constitutes the  
<br />
predefined frame of the work1 [footnote 1]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />[Footnote 1: Note that the idea of taking Mechanism or  
<br />
Computationalism as a hypothesis seems to be, rather curiously,  
<br />
original. Since Descartes (and even before, notably among the Hindu  
<br />
logicians), there is a staggering amount of literature surrounding the  
<br />
question of Mechanism and the mind, but it is always a question of  
<br />
arguments in favour of Mechanism or arguments against it. Many also  
<br />
think that Mechanism is by itself a solution to the mind-body problem.  
<br />
This, I hope is a strong suit of the current work, to show that  
<br />
Mechanism does not automatically resolve the mind-body problem. On the  
<br />
contrary, it necessitates a reformulation of the problem taking the  
<br />
form of a necessary justification of belief in the appearance of a  
<br />
material world, physical or substantial (to anticipate in one phrase  
<br />
the principal result of the work.)]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />The discovery described here is that in this case, that with this  
<br />
hypothesis of Mechanism, physics becomes reducible to the psychology  
<br />
of machines. The “of” should be interpreted in both the transitive  
<br />
and intransitive senses: clearly it is a question of psychology  
<br />
concerning machines as much as psychology inferred or postulated  
<br />
correctly (by definition) by the machines themselves. We will be able,  
<br />
with a little information theory, to define this psychology in the  
<br />
wider sense of the machines’ “self-referentially correct”  
<br />
discourse. Such a psychology appears non-normative: we will see that  
<br />
it makes of us beings vastly less well known to ourselves than we had  
<br />
ever imagined. It constitutes a sort of “vaccine” against the  
<br />
numerous forms of reductionism of human psychology.
<br />
<br />The reduction of physics to psychology happens also at the  
<br />
epistemological level: physics effectively becomes a branch of  
<br />
psychology – the science of observable machines – as it does at the  
<br />
ontological level: matter or the appearance of matter emerges from  
<br />
consciousness, from the mind or the mental or even as we will see, of  
<br />
“possible gambles” made by all digital machines.
<br />
<br />It seems that what I have succeeded in demonstrating is that to truly  
<br />
take seriously the hypothesis that we are digitalisable machines, is  
<br />
to be forced to recognise a reversal of the naturalist or materialist  
<br />
idea, quite widespread among philosophers, physicians and the man in  
<br />
the street, that physics is the fundamental science to which all the  
<br />
other natural and human sciences - at least ontologically and thus in  
<br />
principle - should be reducible. I summarise this theorem by:
<br />
<br />comp  ⇒  reversal
<br />
<br />where comp designates “computationalism”, a name often given to  
<br />
“Digital Mechanism” and reversal designates the reversal of  
<br />
psychology with physics. What results is not a primitive matter with  
<br />
consciousness emerging from the organisation of the matter but the  
<br />
reverse: consciousness is now the more primitive and matter, or rather  
<br />
the appearance of material organisation, emerges from all the possible  
<br />
experiences of all the possible consciousnesses; and this in a  
<br />
sufficiently precise sense that derives physics (science of matter)  
<br />
from psychology (viewed as a very general science of conscious  
<br />
experience, or more positively, of stable discourses by the machines  
<br />
themselves: physics, but not geography2, belonging necessarily to this  
<br />
self-referential discourse, which I will demonstrate.)
<br />
<br /><br /><br />[Footnote 2: Physics becomes the study of what is a priori observable  
<br />
by every observer. The moon’s existence is not (in all truthfulness)  
<br />
a physical law. By now one might fear that the physical laws lead only  
<br />
to trivial truths, but we will see that the constraints of Mechanism  
<br />
detrivialise this introspective physics.]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;At this stage, anyone who for any good reason were to be persuaded  
<br />
of the veracity of contemporary materialism3, can always surmise that  
<br />
the present work constitutes a rejection of Mechanism. This will  
<br />
nevertheless pose a problem since Mechanism is, implicitly or  
<br />
explicitly, the philosophy adopted by the majority of materialists.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />[Footnote 3: Throughout this work, “materialism” will be taken in  
<br />
the weak sense of the philosophical doctrine that postulates the  
<br />
existence of a substantial universe (a fact of things obeying laws  
<br />
independent of us).]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Concerning my own position on this I remain silent. My philosophical  
<br />
opinions rest and will remain private. In the more technical part of  
<br />
the thesis I nevertheless show that one can already extract enough  
<br />
qualitative and quantitative givens from physics once this is shown to  
<br />
be derivable from machine psychology. We can then confront the results  
<br />
with the usual empirical and modern physical theories – notably  
<br />
quantum mechanics – to start to see an empirical confirmation of this  
<br />
psychology and thus confirmation of the reversal.
<br />
<br />By illuminating problems in the interpretation of (quantum) physical  
<br />
facts, this thesis vehiculates a de facto judgment. The judgement that  
<br />
the reversal and Mechanism, its reasoning logic, are plausible.
<br />
<br />A final observation concerns rationalism and interdisciplinarity.
<br />
<br />This work pleads as “rationalist”. Like Karl Popper, I appreciate  
<br />
the match between rationalism and elitism. Rationalism is a form of  
<br />
hope concerning the reasoning powers of others. It is the hope that  
<br />
the other will have the courtesy to listen to you and accept your  
<br />
results or to indicate to you your errors, or to say to you at the  
<br />
very least that the subject is of no interest to him. Popper writes:
<br />
<br />Faith4 in reason is not only a faith in our own reason but also – and  
<br />
even more – in that of others.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />[Footnote 4: French translation of Popper quote suppressed.]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Thus a rationalist, even if he believes himself to be intellectually  
<br />
superior to others, will reject all claims to authority since he is  
<br />
aware that, if his intelligence is superior to that of others (which  
<br />
is hard for him to judge), it is only insofar as he is capable of  
<br />
learning from his own and other peoples’ mistakes, and that one can  
<br />
learn in this sense only if one takes others and their arguments  
<br />
seriously. Rationalism is therefore bound up with the idea that the  
<br />
other fellow has the right to be heard, and to defend his arguments.  
<br />
(Karl R. Popper5)
<br />
<br /><br /><br />[Footnote 5: The Open Society and Its Enemies. London, Hutchinson, 1950]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />I feel in particular, that reason is a universal and, universally  
<br />
profitable. Nothing else like science exists that is clearly separate  
<br />
to all other human endeavours. I merely believe that there are those  
<br />
possessed of a scientific attitude, which is no more than a form of  
<br />
modesty and honesty with themselves and with others. This attitude  
<br />
does not depend on any particular domain. I have a ready-made slogan:
<br />
<br />Some gardeners are more scientific than astronomers
<br />
<br />And, I might have said astrologers in place of gardeners6.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />[Footnote 6: One can consult a fine book by Suzanne Blackmore In  
<br />
Search of the Light for an example of a scientific contribution to  
<br />
parapsychology, albeit somewhat negative.]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Today a kind of artificial chasm is maintained between the human  
<br />
sciences and the exact sciences. To combat the so-called elitist usage  
<br />
of mathematics, a minister of politics7 was struck by the notion of  
<br />
suppressing numerous hours devoted to maths in diverse sections of  
<br />
secondary teaching.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />[Footnote 7: This idea was defended by Claude Allègre, explored in his  
<br />
book The Defeat of Plato (Fayard, Paris, 1995) and applied when he  
<br />
ascended to the post of Education minister.)]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />In the same way, more and more hours of maths teaching are being taken  
<br />
away from the human sciences. This can only finish by discouraging  
<br />
teachers from teaching by demonstration – meaning explanations – of  
<br />
formulas in mathematics courses. One would presumably do the opposite,  
<br />
short of teaching other mathematics in the human sections.
<br />
<br />The prohibition on the generalised use of deductive or interrogative  
<br />
reason, and on mathematics itself, contributes not only to rendering  
<br />
the human sciences less exact and the exact sciences less human, but  
<br />
also especially to rendering the human sciences less human and the  
<br />
exact sciences less exact, as should be clear from a reading of the  
<br />
present work.
<br />
<br />Note that I do not claim that reason is everything, or that it is a  
<br />
kind of universal panacea. I only say that reason, properly  
<br />
considered, should stand as the first rung of courtesy, permitting  
<br />
evolution and progress in the research of knowledge. Short of making  
<br />
courageous “backflips” from time to time, as in revising one’s  
<br />
beliefs or abandoning a prejudice, this is how things should be.
<br />
<br />Reason is not sufficient for progress in knowledge. There must also be  
<br />
inspiration, attention, imagination, bravery etc. While reason is not  
<br />
of itself sufficient, it is necessary to communicate results to others.
<br />
<br />Again concerning interdisciplinarity,  I often like to cite Descartes.  
<br />
He wrote:
<br />
<br />One must therefore be convinced that all the sciences are so linked  
<br />
together that it is easier to learn them all at the same time, than to  
<br />
isolate each from the other.
<br />
<br />I hope that the present contribution will illustrate to what extent  
<br />
Descartes was inspired on this point. As with the collaborations on  
<br />
quantum mechanics of Einstein, Podolski and Rosen on the one hand, and  
<br />
of Bell on the other, this work should also illustrate the artificial  
<br />
character of the frontier between science and philosophy, or even  
<br />
between science and theology. We will return to this point.
<br />
<br />Any traces of eventual frontiers existing between the sciences and the  
<br />
philosophies rest ultimately on philosophical postulates, avowed or not.
<br />
<br />The advantage in my briefly recounting to you the pathways taken by my  
<br />
still-young thoughts, lies in the fact that children are naturally  
<br />
interdisciplinary: they have not yet submitted to that form of  
<br />
brainwashing known as “academic specialisation”. Children will  
<br />
always pose questions without fear of where they might be putting  
<br />
their feet.

<br />
<br />The Amoeba’s Secret
<br />
<br />(1961 → 1971)
<br />
<br />what am I doing here in these miasmas
<br />
<br />tiny little Lilliputian
<br />
<br />seized by terror, sometimes by asthma
<br />
<br />before these tonnes of thingumajigs
<br />
<br />Gaston Compère, “Geometrie de l’absence”
<br />
<br /><br /><br />What follows evidently constitutes a partial view of the past. I am  
<br />
not telling my life-story,  merely those sparse events that illustrate  
<br />
the threading of the ideas and questions that together form the origin  
<br />
of the discovery.
<br />
<br />Certain paediatricians claim that the first metaphysical crisis, or  
<br />
the first anxious moments concerning death, occur in children around  
<br />
age 4. Perhaps. I remember well the terror that invaded my mind day  
<br />
and night, and I demanded all manner of assurances from my parents  
<br />
that I would wake up the following morning.
<br />
<br />With the well-intentioned care of silencing any woes in children,  
<br />
parents are apt to tell stories. As I was born in Germany, a nanny  
<br />
would regularly read to me in German many folk-tales, mainly those of  
<br />
the brothers Grimm, although I am not so certain that these offered me  
<br />
any appeasement concerning my worries.
<br />
<br />It must have been at around the age of 5 or 6 when as I remember,  
<br />
doubtless by a sort of absent-mindedness or simply out of fatigue  
<br />
since I assailed him with questions remorselessly, that my father  
<br />
informed me that Saint Nicholas did not exist.
<br />
<br />“And Father Christmas?”
<br />
<br />“Him neither” my father replied, sadly noting my incredulous and  
<br />
king-hit countenance. Thus collapsed my first theory – or ontology,  
<br />
mythology, theology, belief, dream…call it what you will; at this  
<br />
age, any precision on my part had been premature.
<br />
<br />“And the fairies?” I pleaded.
<br />
<br />“Them neither”
<br />
<br />“But, come on – the angels and all that…?”
<br />
<br />Here I could see that I had come once again to pose my father an  
<br />
embarrassing question. After a long drawn-out sigh, he explained to me  
<br />
that really he believed in none of it – in angels or in God, but that  
<br />
my cousins and uncles and aunts believed it all. This astonished me  
<br />
all the more in that fairies were for me no more than female angels  
<br />
equipped with magic wands. I liked fairies and angels because they  
<br />
could fly (had I gone on to develop this tendency I might have become  
<br />
an aviator), but in the main because fairies and angels were immortals.
<br />
<br />By now I had realised that adults could have differing beliefs. I  
<br />
found this profoundly shocking. If my cousins could believe in angels,  
<br />
was it not my right to also believe in them, as well as in fairies?
<br />
<br />My father explained to me that it was surely my right after a certain  
<br />
fashion, to believe in whatever I wanted to believe, but that it was  
<br />
by no means evident that to do so would be in my best interest.
<br />
<br />To believe in false propositions is to invite deception and  
<br />
disappointment. I found entirely pathetic the notion of believing in  
<br />
the false, and the whole thing gave me the shudders. From this moment  
<br />
on, I would try to adhere to the rule: avoid at any price belief in  
<br />
falsity.
<br />
<br />The truth, evidently, can give rise to fear. In particular the idea  
<br />
that I was a mere mortal seemed to me to be at the very limits of the  
<br />
acceptable. But the idea of believing in falsity out of fear of the  
<br />
truth worried me all the more. I therefore made promise to myself to  
<br />
always search for the true, fearsome as this may well turn out to be.  
<br />
To know would seem even better.
<br />
<br />To know is better: agreed. But is this even possible? Surely it cannot  
<br />
be easy.
<br />
<br />To start with, I observed that during nightly dreams I was able to  
<br />
believe in just about any falsity. In addition, I suffered sleep  
<br />
problems, like many kids, something confirmed by  
<br />
electroencephalography. My dreams were abnormally realistic. This  
<br />
hyperrealism was fine in the case of lovely and pleasant dreams, but  
<br />
it became truly worrisome in the case of strange dreams and  
<br />
nightmares. Doubts arising from dreams, even concerning the  
<br />
possibility of knowing truth, will play a role in the story that  
<br />
occupies us here. There is nothing original in any of this; the  
<br />
metaphysical role of dreams appeared with the Hindu idealists, Plato,  
<br />
Descartes, Berkeley, as I would learn later on.
<br />
<br />There followed the problem of a divergence of opinion between my  
<br />
father and my uncle. Before, everything was simple: a proposal was  
<br />
true if and only if my father asserted it1.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />[Footnote 1: I express myself here in adult language; at the time I  
<br />
would have been hard-pressed to formulate such a proposal in this way.]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Since he had evinced several seconds of doubt over the existence of  
<br />
angels and told me that my uncle himself believed in them, I truly  
<br />
wondered just whom I should believe over this.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />I asked my uncle why he believed in angels. He replied, inasmuch as I  
<br />
can recall with any precision, that his belief was based in the fact  
<br />
that his parents believed in them, also his grandparents, etc. I found  
<br />
his reply frankly troubling. In effect, if his ancestor had been  
<br />
mistaken, this mistake would be propagated from generation to  
<br />
generation. I came to admire my father’s placing in doubt his own  
<br />
parents’ beliefs, and I decided to never believe in a proposition  
<br />
under simple pretext that it had been announced by a trusted person or  
<br />
family-member. I had hit upon what one now calls the principle of free  
<br />
will, a founding principle of the Free University of Brussels, the  
<br />
university where my father concluded his juristic studies after a  
<br />
learning spell with the Jesuits. I have no doubt that he may have  
<br />
influenced me.
<br />
<br />I asked my father why he did not believe in angels and fairies (I  
<br />
could not have cared less about St Nicholas and Father Christmas  
<br />
because to my mind they were not even immortals). He responded by  
<br />
saying that having thoroughly searched everywhere, no one had  
<br />
encountered them anywhere. There followed a deluge of revelations: we  
<br />
live on a ball suspended in space, we have already orbited it etc. It  
<br />
seemed like no place existed for fairies and angels.
<br />
<br />In order to not run the risk of believing falsity, my interest in  
<br />
imaginary beings slid over to a pronounced interest in animals, for  
<br />
whose existence nobody had even the slightest doubt. Returning to  
<br />
Belgium from Germany, my parents bought a small hobby-farm in the  
<br />
country to which we would go during vacations and on the weekend. I  
<br />
passed a lot of time observing swallows, butterflies, ants etc. When  
<br />
observing an animal, for example, a butterfly, I identified body and  
<br />
soul with this butterfly. If it flew, it was I who flew, if it  
<br />
gathered pollen, it was I who gathered pollen and it was I who became  
<br />
intoxicated by the multiple nectars of the flowers of the fields.
<br />
<br />One day, I pointed to a white butterfly and exclaimed to my sister and  
<br />
brother “Look! This butterfly, I recognise it, it’s me; I have been  
<br />
this butterfly for several weeks now.” And they, with a delicacy well  
<br />
known amongst siblings, broke the news to me that this was not  
<br />
possible “because butterflies only live for one day.”
<br />
<br />This came as quite a shock. It reminded me that if swallows and  
<br />
butterflies flew, like angels, they were none the less mortal for it,  
<br />
like me. They did seem though, to live a much shorter life than I,  
<br />
which I found disturbing.
<br />
<br />At this time, whenever I identified with an animal, the identification  
<br />
took place in real time: I did not yet imagine from the butterfly’s  
<br />
point of view that one day could appear very long. Thus, if a  
<br />
butterfly truly lived but one day, due to my identification with it, I  
<br />
also lived but one day and no longer. And this was no laughing matter.  
<br />
I became maniacally obsessed with the maximum life spans of animals.  
<br />
Every time I heard of a new animal I would ask about its longevity. I  
<br />
was rather disappointed to discover that, on the whole, large animals  
<br />
lived longer than the small ones with which I had been identifying  
<br />
almost exclusively since I myself was of small stature at this time.
<br />
<br />It was then that I made an authentic and revolutionary discovery. I  
<br />
had a canine companion in whom I confided my metaphysical concerns, my  
<br />
partner in the quest for truth. One fine day, I tried to show him a  
<br />
tiny red spider (in fact a tiny garden acarina), without managing to  
<br />
attract his attention. I concluded that the acarina was too tiny for  
<br />
my dog to see and suddenly, I found myself identifying with my dog. It  
<br />
thus came into my mind that the fairies and angels were perhaps just  
<br />
that little bit too miniscule for us to be able to perceive them.
<br />
<br />As quickly as I could, I presented my theory to my father. I was  
<br />
particularly serene, not only in view of a proof of the existence of  
<br />
fairies, but also of the proof that my father could not be sure of  
<br />
their non-existence. I played devil’s advocate not because I wanted  
<br />
to contradict my father at any price, but rather to show that my  
<br />
cousins and uncle were perhaps not entirely in the wrong.
<br />
<br />“Even if you searched everywhere on Earth for angels and didn’t  
<br />
find any, that proves nothing” I said. “Perhaps angels and fairies  
<br />
are simply too small for us to see them?” I explained to him the  
<br />
experience with my dog. My father, who had an answer to hand for  
<br />
everything, enlightened me that the search had included the direction  
<br />
of the tiny as well. He spoke to me of the microscope and – and in  
<br />
fact it was this that surprised me the most - he explained that the  
<br />
effective discovery of a multitude of tiny animals invisible to the  
<br />
naked eye had thereby been made. He then took a piece of paper and  
<br />
drew a sketch of an amoeba. I fell headlong in love with this tiny and  
<br />
adorable creature, multiform and so easy to draw.
<br />
<br />And so to the fundamental question of the moment: how long might an  
<br />
amoeba expect to live?
<br />
<br />Considering my belief that the smaller an animal was, the less time it  
<br />
could live, I hardly had any illusions. It must be that my tiny amoeba  
<br />
could not possibly live very long at all.
<br />
<br />On this question of the lifetime of an amoeba, my father, with  
<br />
infinite wisdom, contented himself to explain that having eaten their  
<br />
fill of even tinier (!) creatures during a day, rather than merely  
<br />
dying like any ordinary beast such as a butterfly, it divided itself  
<br />
instead into two. Instead of dying and disappearing, an amoeba would  
<br />
divide itself and give birth to two amoebas. This was practically the  
<br />
reverse of death itself.
<br />
<br />“So they’re immortal, then?”
<br />
<br />This time, my father made no response.
<br />
<br />I requested, of my elder brother and sister notably, that they bring  
<br />
back from school as many documents as they could find on amoebas,  
<br />
which they very kindly did. I thus started to write (more exactly, to  
<br />
scribble in just about every sense) a book: The Invisible World. My  
<br />
idea was that if invisible worlds existed – and the existence of the  
<br />
amoeba proved the existence of such worlds – one could no longer  
<br />
enjoy any form of certainty over whatever the case might be. In the  
<br />
final analysis, my uncle may well have been right on the subject of  
<br />
angels. The amoeba was surely a tangible piece of evidence that at  
<br />
least certain animals could be immortal. I killed time by annoying my  
<br />
parents with the demand for a microscope of my own. When the  
<br />
microscope inevitably arrived, I looked for amoebas. I discovered  
<br />
euglenas and especially paramecia, and when they divided themselves  
<br />
into two, I divided into two also. The question now was to know  
<br />
whether the paramecium had survived its division.
<br />
<br />What exactly was going on?
<br />
<br />I arrived at my first public seminar on amoebas. Even though I may be  
<br />
driven by self-imposed questions, I have always had an immense  
<br />
enthusiasm for giving oral exposés, even delivering classes and  
<br />
seminars on subjects at a considerable distance from those that  
<br />
preoccupy me directly. Thus, I had already given several verbal  
<br />
exposés, notably on minerals, but, in 1963, at the age of 8, people  
<br />
were urging me to deliver a seminar on microbes.
<br />
<br />Entitled Amoeba, Euglena and Paramecium, I have managed to rediscover  
<br />
my succinct resumé in an old notebook:
<br />
<br />My friends, let me tell you, in this room, we are not 24 in number,  
<br />
but several million2.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />[Footnote 2: I already liked paradoxical propositions; true but  
<br />
slightly astonishing statements, so to speak. “We” to my mind,  
<br />
evidently designated the students of the class with the teacher and  
<br />
the microbes in the class. The “million” would have had to be a  
<br />
much higher number in reality, if one had wanted to be more exact.]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Does the elephant see the tiny red spider? Could living beings exist  
<br />
who are so tiny that to us they would be invisible? Could there be an  
<br />
invisible world and a tunnel through which to explore it? As  
<br />
incredible as this may sound: yes. The microscope is the tunnel and  
<br />
the microbes are the discovery. Amoeba, euglena, paramecia,  
<br />
vorticellae, stentor, bacteria, ovum and spermatozoa, the protozoa  
<br />
among us! Nutrition, digestion, excretion, diverse sensibilities (the  
<br />
euglena’s eye), and …. reproduction.
<br />
<br />Question: How long can an amoeba live? One day or forever? If it lives  
<br />
two days it lives every day… forever. (Public secondary school Robert  
<br />
Catteau, in the presence of Prof. Verschaeve)
<br />
<br /><br /><br />I would become more and more obsessed by this question of the  
<br />
immortality of the amoeba. For the following two full years, I would  
<br />
pass half my free time on walks gathering every possible kind of water  
<br />
(sewerage, liquid manure, pond water, estuarine, puddles of every  
<br />
sort) and the other half observing these waters under the microscope.  
<br />
As usual, I always identified completely with the microorganisms I was  
<br />
observing and attempted to somehow sense whatever was going on at the  
<br />
moment of their division. I scaffolded an unimaginable number of  
<br />
theories illustrating the immortal character of unicellular creatures  
<br />
without arriving at a stage of conviction over any of them. The  
<br />
consistent effort to go from fairies to amoebas had been kick-started  
<br />
by my fear of believing in non-existent things and I did not at any  
<br />
price want to believe that amoebas were immortal if they in fact were  
<br />
not.
<br />
<br />Yet, certitude had come through: IF an amoeba lives two days THEN it  
<br />
lives every day3
<br />
<br /><br /><br />[Footnote 3: In fact the common amoeba divides on average every 50  
<br />
hours approximately, but for the sake of simplicity I will continue to  
<br />
speak as though its divisions occur every 24 hours.]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />It remained to demonstrate that for an amoeba to be immortal, it only  
<br />
needed to survive one division.
<br />
<br />An example of a theory heading in this direction was what I called  
<br />
“The Principle of the Inspector”:
<br />
<br /><br /><br />NO CORPSE means NO MURDER
<br />
<br /><br /><br />According to the inspector, when the amoeba divides, it leaves behind  
<br />
no corpse, so no “body” dies in the act of dividing, therefore an  
<br />
amoeba survives its division. But this reasoning is invalid. When a  
<br />
hydra eats an amoeba, it gets digested and neither is any corpse left  
<br />
behind. The difficulty lies in believing that it survives the process  
<br />
of digestion. The “Principle of the Inspector” collapsed.
<br />
<br />My basic theory or argument in favour of the immortality of the amoeba  
<br />
or paramecium had been directly linked to the experiment of swapping  
<br />
places with a concrete paramecium and keenly observing it through a  
<br />
microscope. Evidently I had come up against a problem of scale. It  
<br />
seems that I go from one to two but how is this possible? Which is the  
<br />
original paramecium between the two new ones? Both or only one of  
<br />
them? Which one?
<br />
<br />In particular, if I become one of the two paramecia, how could I  
<br />
convince the other, given that it could just as easily make the claim  
<br />
of being me?
<br />
<br />Completely gobsmacked by this, given over to a sort of semi-ecstatic  
<br />
vertigo I realised something just as extraordinary and incommunicable.
<br />
<br />My feeling had been that the amoeba survived its division (and thus  
<br />
every division, meaning that it was immortal) but as it had become  
<br />
two, each of the two resulting amoebas were unable to convince the  
<br />
other that it had survived, where “it” referred to the original  
<br />
amoeba. From whence arose the incommunicability.
<br />
<br />If an amoeba could not bring any of its copies to accept its survival  
<br />
or its immortality, how much more difficult might it be to convince a  
<br />
human being?
<br />
<br />How difficult might it be for me to convince another human of the  
<br />
immortality of an amoeba even if immortality were an accepted notion?  
<br />
The more I reflected on this, the more it seemed to me that this  
<br />
immortality, if immortality it was, must be condemned to remain  
<br />
forever secret. This explained to my satisfaction the prudent silence  
<br />
of my father.
<br />
<br />A spectacular confirmation would arrive when I was given The Marvels  
<br />
of Life, the very fine book by Ames &amp; Wyler with a preface by Jean  
<br />
Rostand and superb illustrations by Charles Harper – it was also the  
<br />
first book I ever took to bed and slept with!
<br />
<br />This book contained an entire chapter consecrated to the amoeba.  
<br />
Distraught by the toll of new information it contained, I initially  
<br />
believed that it would not get down to the question of the immortality  
<br />
of protozoa, but one day, I fell upon the photo of a paramecium for  
<br />
which the legend was “Is the paramecium immortal?” I quickly felt  
<br />
relieved because I could see that one could at least pose this  
<br />
question. Soon thereafter I felt astonished: “here, finally is a book  
<br />
that addresses an enormous number of questions and is content to pose  
<br />
the question”. This astonishment was given legs by the confirmation  
<br />
that the immortality of the paramecium, if immortality exists, could  
<br />
be no more than a necessary interrogation: a wager on uncommunicable  
<br />
success.
<br />
<br />Ames and Wyler were just as prudent as my dad. I wondered if I was  
<br />
going to succeed at being just as prudent as them. What rotten luck  
<br />
all the same: I discover a fundamental truth and it seems forbidden to  
<br />
communicate it. I would have to wait until 1971 to get out of this  
<br />
impasse and to weigh up the communicable as per the uncommunicable  
<br />
parts of the amoeba’s secret.
<br />
<br />It is noteworthy that up until this time, I had never asked what an  
<br />
amoeba was made of, or what I myself was made of. It seemed to me that  
<br />
the question did not truly depend on whatever things were made of. I  
<br />
did not imagine myself as made of something(s). The problem of  
<br />
immortality seemed to me to be more a question of biology, or of  
<br />
psychology, or of theology - not a question of physics. The matter did  
<br />
not rest there either in that I demanded to know how an amoeba managed  
<br />
to divide itself into two. Moreover, the argument in favour of the  
<br />
amoeba’s immortality on one hand and especially the incommunicability  
<br />
of this immortality by the amoeba on the other hand, depended  
<br />
crucially on the fact that after the division, the two resulting  
<br />
amoebas were rigorously identical, since only in this case did the two  
<br />
amoebas seem to contradict one another in claiming to have survived,  
<br />
one, each!
<br />
<br />The reading of Ames &amp; Wyler, accompanied by books of Jean Rostand  
<br />
passed to me by my father as well as some excellent manuals of Jean- 
<br />
Pierre Vanden Eeckhoudt – teacher at the Robert Catteau Public School  
<br />
– would drive me from astonishment to astonishment. There, I learnt  
<br />
the magic words that described the principal phases of cellular  
<br />
division: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase; as well as their  
<br />
significance in chromosomal terms. I learnt especially that I am  
<br />
myself constituted from a colony of social amoebas! Our pluricellular  
<br />
organic quality posed me problems: how could I as a society of amoebas  
<br />
still identify with an individual amoeba? Unless an amoeba itself were  
<br />
in turn a colony of sub-microbes, and so on and so forth? I was thus  
<br />
led naturally to an interest in chemistry and to atomic physics.
<br />
<br />On the subject of matter, I would pose myself a question that would  
<br />
prevent me from truly taking seriously the idea of the atom, to say  
<br />
nothing of the very notion of matter itself. Initially, I imagined  
<br />
atoms to be ultra-smooth and ultra-hard spheres; next I learnt that  
<br />
atoms were in fact constituted of electrons spinning around a nucleus  
<br />
of protons and neutrons that I imagined were in their turn, like ultra- 
<br />
smooth and ultra-hard spheres. It seemed that you could always divide  
<br />
matter and that research to find the ultimate particle was all in  
<br />
vain. At the same time however, if one were to find an ultimate  
<br />
particle, it seemed to me, what could it possibly be other than a  
<br />
smooth and ultra-hard sphere once again, and what could such a sphere  
<br />
be made of?
<br />
<br />The very idea of matter seemed to me to be void of any explanatory  
<br />
capacity? To me, the notion of matter seemed to bring out more  
<br />
questions than it did answers and seemed to threaten perhaps, the  
<br />
unity of the amoeba.
<br />
<br />It was in the volume by Joël de Rosnay that I learnt of the existence  
<br />
of DNA4, the gigantic molecule of deoxyribonucleic acid which is a  
<br />
long chain in the form of a double helix “like the inside of a  
<br />
certain castle of the Loire”, comprising the repetition of molecules  
<br />
taken from the group { Adenine, Thymine, Cytosine, Guanine} resulting  
<br />
in a very long “word” in the genre of AATGGCTATGGACCTCAG….and it  
<br />
was in this book that I would learn how this word, seen as a suite of  
<br />
triplets AAT GGC TAT GGA CCT CAG…. is translated into RNA, another  
<br />
nucleic acid, itself translated into a “word”: proteins, comprising  
<br />
tiny molecules, amino acids, chosen from the alphabet of 20 “amino  
<br />
acids”. I would learn how these proteins and their enzymes coped with  
<br />
the rest: from the synthesis of tiny molecules (amino acids,  
<br />
nucleotides, sugars), even right up to the constitution of the cell.
<br />
<br />All the same, this gave oxygen to more questions. How did we know all  
<br />
this? What, indeed is a molecule?
<br />
<br />In fact my “Joël de Rosnay” and the review Science &amp; Life,  was a  
<br />
springboard for the book destined to become my basic bible for the  
<br />
following years (1968 and thereafter) : the French edition, edited by  
<br />
François Gros and prefaced by François Jacob of James D. Watson’s  
<br />
The Molecular Biology of the Gene. In this book, I would gain a  
<br />
glimpse of the incredible molecular dance that goes on, not only with  
<br />
the amoeba, but with an even tinier creature: the bacterium  
<br />
Escherichia Coli.
<br />
<br />My “Watson” was so biblical that in my vocabulary, the very word  
<br />
“Watson” had become synonymous with THE Bible. In retrospect, my  
<br />
“Ames &amp; Wyler” had been my first Watson, but at the age at which I  
<br />
read it, I believe that I did not pose questions in the genre of  
<br />
knowing who might have written a book.
