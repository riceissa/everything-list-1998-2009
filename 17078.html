2009/7/28 Bruno Marchal &lt;marchal.domain.name.hidden&gt;:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, the question &quot;why this 1-OM and not that other one&quot;, is like the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; questions:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; -  &quot;why do I feel myself in W, and not in M&quot; which is very natural for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one going out at W.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; -  &quot;why do I feel myself in M, and not in W&quot; which is very natural for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one going out at M.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK?
</em><br />
<br />Yes, OK, the seven steps: but this isn't the problem.  Hmm...let's
<br />
see.  OK, let's try a different tack.  As you have observed, we may
<br />
well share some basic intuitions, but we don't share the same goal
<br />
here.  Yours intentions vis-a-vis COMP are professional, precisely
<br />
limited, modest, practical, and as such I endorse them wholeheartedly.
<br />
&nbsp;Mine are dilettantish, more personally oriented, probably less
<br />
useful; essentially a way of exercising my curiosity.  So before going
<br />
on, I need to state something obvious, or perhaps not-so-obvious,
<br />
related to my personal thinking style.
<br />
<br />In internalising your ideas, I try to do so, as it were, by BECOMING
<br />
whatever system you are proposing.  You might say that this is
<br />
reification, but for me it's an indispensable imaginative tool: you
<br />
might call it cogification.  It's a sort of meditation, and when I was
<br />
active as a programmer, I used to be able to do it in my dreams, and
<br />
would often actually experience myself as the program going into some
<br />
error state - a useful debugging tool!  And of course one of the
<br />
helpful aspects of cogifying in this way is that you see immediately
<br />
what you're getting, what you're NOT getting, and particularly that
<br />
you can't get something for nothing.
<br />
<br />So all my questions to you really stem from these imaginative
<br />
cogifications.  I need to know what it FEELS like to be in
<br />
Bruno-world.  Only then can I find out if it matches my own
<br />
experience, and hence the non-negotiable appearances I'm committed to
<br />
saving.  Thus in the present case, I first scrupulously clearing away
<br />
extraneous notions, and commence to cogify myself to your
<br />
specifications in order to experience the consequences.  As a simple
<br />
result of my going about the matter in this way I am totally present
<br />
and personally instantiated in my cogifications.  My natural
<br />
perspective here is that of the One - the global &quot;I&quot;: hence all my
<br />
questions stem from this perspective.
<br />
<br />Now, it impinges on me that I really should justify how the One could
<br />
be said to 'focus' itself on - or resolve - a COMP perspective in the
<br />
first place: i.e. we must check that what I airily called 'clearing
<br />
away extraneous notions' isn't just getting something for nothing.
<br />
Actually, 'something *from* nothing' may turn out to be more apt here:
<br />
mathematical totality - in effect
<br />
everything-inter-related-in-every-possible-way - would be
<br />
indistinguishable, from the perspective of the One, from 'nothing'.
<br />
This has been pointed out in various ways before.  So the first
<br />
cogification is (in David Bohm's term) the 'relevation' (relative
<br />
elevation) of the number realm and its basic operators: the emergence
<br />
of something from nothing.  A point of view, or the possibility of
<br />
many, emerges.  In effect, everything else falls away into background
<br />
noise.
<br />
<br />Further cogifications are then further levels of relevation: that of
<br />
the UD and its infinitely iterated interlaced infinities of steps
<br />
distinguished from the background noise of the set of all possible
<br />
programs.  As I cogify myself in the guise of the UD I'm able to
<br />
consider the relevation of further subsets of the global point of
<br />
view.  Now &quot;I&quot; - as the One - can see interference effects relevate
<br />
invariances from the background noise of recursive infinities;
<br />
increasingly intricate patterns built on these invariances;
<br />
pattern-pattern 'least difference' relations that both create and
<br />
differentiate historical sequences; 'events in time' that relevate as
<br />
these sequences phase-shift through my global 'observer moment'; white
<br />
rabbits that flit by, but get lost against the vast illumination of
<br />
reiterated regularity.  In this broad-brushed but experientially
<br />
persuasive way I'm able to intuit how &quot;I&quot; - as the One - might both
<br />
lose and find myself in an infinity of distinguishable personal
<br />
regularities against a background of noisy irrelevance.
<br />
<br />So my question to you was really about the machinery of perspective,
<br />
in the sense I've described above.  We often speak of the
<br />
indeterminacy of the &quot;I&quot;, but I'm at least equally struck by its
<br />
determinacy.  It's always the same &quot;I&quot;, and this is consequent on the
<br />
global presence of the One in the light of the options available for
<br />
relevating a point of view.  As a direct consequence of cogifying
<br />
myself in the form of the One, I perceive that I really have two
<br />
options only, experientially speaking.  I can just sit here
<br />
atemporally; present, differentiated and inter-related in all possible
<br />
ways, but essentially getting 'nothing' out of it.  Or I can relevate
<br />
a global observer moment and thus experience a polymorphous parade of
<br />
events phase-shifting through it as inter-laced personal histories in
<br />
space and time.  It may be all illusory, but at least they're MY
<br />
illusions: the mini-illusions of the vast cavalcade of mini-mes.
<br />
Which option is likely to be the more entertaining way of spending
<br />
eternity?

<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, it has, or comp is false. But I suspect you confuse two different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; questions (if I may say so to be short).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - the ability of the soul to remain conscious when getting to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;universal-whole&quot; in the 'conscious way'. This needs work, and typical &quot;let
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it go&quot; abilities,  detachement, abnegation, amnesia (and is another topic).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And then the consciousness of your most probable relative situation, which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; eventually is determined by a measure on the infinity of computations going
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (arithmetically) through your state.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And here the mystery is that the apparent physical worlds seem computable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; How could a sum on an infinity of computations be computable? (it is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; white rabbit problem).
</em><br />
<br />OK, I said it was wacky, so it's probably wrong (or not even that).
<br />
But, as a last try, let me rephrase it thus: you've gone over the
<br />
tutorial (which I've always accepted in its essentials) of who &quot;I&quot; am
<br />
- so who

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think, a different aspect of the observer moment, and I'll try to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; state it as clearly as I can.  When I imagine an infinity of OMs, as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it were, co-existing in some atemporal sense, I find I still can't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; satisfactorily answer the question: why am &quot;I&quot; experiencing JUST this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The UD generates, infinitely often, all 3-OMs, all as (universal) machine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; states, and this through an infinity of computations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But the 1-OMs belong to infinities of those &quot;equivalent (by respect of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; substitution level) 3-OM. They are not aware, cf UDA step 2, of the fact
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that in universal dovetailing time (defined by the (mathematical) execution
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the UD), some of those 3-OMs will take a *very* long time to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generated.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, the question &quot;why this 1-OM and not that other one&quot;, is like the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; questions:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; -  &quot;why do I feel myself in W, and not in M&quot; which is very natural for the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; -  &quot;why do I feel myself in M, and not in W&quot; which is very natural for the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one going out at M.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I don't mean of course, why does this experience possess just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *these* characteristics - this is always determined by the structure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the OM, as per the UD steps.  The issue, rather, is that &quot;I&quot; is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; essentially a global referent that fundamentally applies only to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whole,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hmm....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and that the 'part' or 'little me' is thus nothing but the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *viewpoint* of the whole at a given moment
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This can be said for the different reason that you are universal yourself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (in Post Turing Church sense).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here, all what happens is that the 1-OM of that universal machine (fallen in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entangled multi-computational histories) has all its immediate expectation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; based on a set dense in the whole (like fractions are dense in the real
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; numbers). It is not the whole, but it is the infinitely many possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computational histories leading to that 1-OM and to those corresponding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3-OMs.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So under this assumption the real question is: why is the *whole* at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this moment seemingly limited to ONLY this view rather than any - or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indeed all - of the available co-existing alternatives?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For the reason that when your body is duplicated, your soul is not.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You wake up at M, and only can bet &quot;intellectually&quot; on your doppelganger in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; W.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is the same reason why Everett quantum observer cannot feel the split.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Amoebas divides, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, each can ask why me, and why here and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; now.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But, as Plotinus and others have seen, &quot;we&quot; can somehow experience some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inverse path ... 8, 4, 2, 01 and going back to the universal. (But this is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not needed for the derivability of physics).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here is a nice &quot;inverse path&quot;, btw:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lFT4H7E7Ac&amp;feature=channel_page">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lFT4H7E7Ac&amp;feature=channel_page</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Push pause at the beginning, you will see a yellow things with 16 little
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appendices. With good eyes you can guess the 32 more little appendices, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you can see behind the 64 and the balck 128.  So you have at the start
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; M... 128 64 32 16.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then start the video to see the sequel ... 8, 4, 2, 1, M. (followed by ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; M, and zooming in back).   Exercise  :)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  And in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; light of an infinity of co-existing OMs, I can't answer this, because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such a co-existing whole should presumably co-presently see (i.e.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'be') ALL points of view 'at once'.  AFAICS, notions of measure do not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suffice to resolve this.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, it has, or comp is false. But I suspect you confuse two different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; questions (if I may say so to be short).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - the ability of the soul to remain conscious when getting to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;universal-whole&quot; in the 'conscious way'. This needs work, and typical &quot;let
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it go&quot; abilities,  detachement, abnegation, amnesia (and is another topic).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And then the consciousness of your most probable relative situation, which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; eventually is determined by a measure on the infinity of computations going

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (arithmetically) through your state.
</em><br />

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; How could a sum on an infinity of computations be computable? (it is the

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However I have a wacky intuition: despite the platonic criterion of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; co-existence, 1-person experience of the temporal dynamism (i.e.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sequentiality) of the part - i.e. each OM - might reasonably persuade
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; us that sequentiality should also possess, in some ineliminable sense,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a role in the whole.  Consequently, under this assumption, could the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; UD (to reify it only to this degree)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The UD exists, like the number 17 exists. No less, no more.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (of course the UD is &quot;really&quot; universal if and only if Post-Church-Turing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thesis is true).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be conceived for this purpose to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be 'sequentially resolving' each 'OM-programme-step'?  Indeed my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understanding is that this dovetailed sequentiality is actually a key
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conceptual element of COMP.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not sure to see what you mean. It is a key to be sure to go through all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3-OMs, with the correct (recursively invariant) redundancy (without which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there would indeed be no measure possible).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In this sense - and in this sense only -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could the UD therefore be thought of as temporally instantiating that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OM *uniquely* at each step on behalf of the whole COMP-multiverse, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thus bringing into focus - in effect - its *unique* point of view?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, if you name the UD states U1, U2, U3, U4, ..., you go sequentially
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; through all 3-OMs, and this through the right arithmetical relations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; defining the histories, but your problem reappears at one level above: why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;am I&quot; in Um and not in Uw. But that problem makes no sense, for the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reason that &quot;why I am in M and not in W&quot; makes provably no sense in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-duplication experience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then there is the global first person indeterminacy, which appears at step
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 7, although it is &quot;definitely there&quot; with the step 8. It is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indeterminacy of your immediate subjective future &quot;in front&quot; of a never
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ending universal dovetailing. At that step, assuming (or not with step 8) a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concrete universal dovetailing in the universe (or in arithmetic) you should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand that you are duplicated &quot; at each instant&quot;, so that your future
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subjective instant is determined by an infinity of computations: all those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (existing in the U dovetailing) going through your actual states. So, in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; order to attach your mind to a physical appearance, you have to justify the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical appearances from an infinite set of computational histories. OK?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, I understand as I've said above that I am duplicated at each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instant (what I used to think of as being 'teleported into the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; future').  However, I must press you on your use of the expression
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'going through your actual states'.  I think you mean:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) Your 'actual state' corresponds to some OM (i.e. the one you 'find'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; yourself in).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, my mental &quot;RITSIAR&quot; state corresponds to an infinity of  3-OM
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generated by the DU.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) The UD entails that an infinity of prior and posterior states is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implied by your finding yourself in *this* OM - i.e. they 'go through'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this state.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3) Hence the physical appearances you discover in this OM must depend
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on (i.e. be justified by) the totality of these states.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ... in this 1-OM. Yes. But instead of &quot;these states&quot;, it is more &quot;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; totality of the computations leading to theses states&quot;. The (in)determinacy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; weight depends on the relative densities of computations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4) It follows therefore that any association of your mind - as the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; collection of these states - can be correlated only with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *totality* of physical appearances derived from this collection.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is this right?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not so sure that the phrasing is right.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The physical reality can no more be just a mathematical structure among
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; others. There may or may not exist such a structure, but in any case this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure or quasi-structure has to result from the statistical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;interference&quot; of an infinity of computations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Implied by 3) above.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; AUDA illustrates the consistency of such an idea, and provides a technical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way to extract already the logic of the observable events. But AUDA is far
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more demanding in logico-mathematical technicalities.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You said it!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hmm...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; AUDA is UDA, where the &quot;yes doctor&quot; is replaced by a &quot;direct&quot; interview of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correct self-introspecting universal machine.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Somehow, what I am saying in AUDA is that, thanks to the work of Gödel, Löb,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Solovay, etc., we can already have a talk with the universal machine and ask
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; her opinion, and what &quot;her&quot; physics looks like.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, the 'yes doctor' is an act of faith.  But how much further will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we be able to rely on the machine's opinions on what her physics looks
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like?  Enough to take the leap with certainty, or is there always some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; irresolvable doubt? (I think the answer is yes, because the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; substitution level remains always below the level of introspection.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And there is the doubt about our own correctness, and even consistency.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The doubt about the presence of a bug.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The doubt &quot;am I dreaming?&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The doubt, as you say, that we have chosen the correct substitution level.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The doubt about the ability of the surgeon,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the doubt about the reliability of the artificial brain,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the doubt &quot;should I take a mac of a pc?&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That are the eternal doubts of the terrestrial numbers ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then it is a rather technical point to show that by adding non computational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; power to such a universal machine will not change the AUDA interview, unless
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you bring necessarily vague ad hoc &quot;non comp&quot; feature build for changing the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interview.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So what is consequential on this?  Do you mean that in this case the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine can still derive consistent (though incomplete) opinions on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; her physics and therefore make reasonable bets on her duplicability?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Consistent but false. (not even assuming comp, but assuming elementary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arithmetic).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps inconsistent.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If a universal machine bet that God create earth and heaven in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; six days and that she is not duplicable, well, it becomes hard to even argue
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if the AUDA physics will change or not.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And what is consequential on this? Do you mean that her view of her
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics has become such that neither she (by fiat) nor we (per theory)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can make reasonable bets on her duplicability?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We are leaving the topic here. ... of course there is the correct theory of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the insane machine. But there is also the insane theory of the insane
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine, and a correct theory can exist about that! I let the subject to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine psychoanalysts.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But all machine are duplicable, I would say by definition.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; .
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hope this &quot;heroic failure&quot; can help the grandma a little bit,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, it helps when we go more slowly and step by step, so that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ignoramus can keep up.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Step by step is my favorite pedagogy, inherited from mathematics. Some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematicians, like in category theory, will say that global pictures and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; diagrams are best, and I agree with that. Step by step, but on mail, it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hard to make quickly little drawings. Sigh.
