</em><br />
<br /><br />Thanks. Also, I will follow your suggestion to force me writing little 
<br />
post. I will first answer an older post by George (not to confuse with 
<br />
Georges).
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Le 25-mars-06, à 00:51, George Levy a écrit :
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have read or rather tried to read Smullyan's book. His examples are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; totally fabricated. I will never meet the white knight in the island of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; liars and truthtellers. I need examples which are relevant to life, at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; least the way I understand it in the context of the many-worlds.
</em><br />
<br /><br />The role of the knight-knave island is just to give an easy way to 
<br />
produce self-referential sentences? This is explain on page 48 in 
<br />
Forever Undecided (hereafter FU).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Einstein (or maybe someone writing about relativity) came up with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; paradox of the travelling aging twin.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Was it not Langevin?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Schroedinger came up with his
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cat's paradox. Tegmark came up with the quantum suicide experiment.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I came up first with the comp suicide, and much later after with the 
<br />
quantum suicide and with the &quot;kill the user&quot; sort of quantum 
<br />
computation, well before Tegmark, and I am not sure this has helped to 
<br />
make my work more &quot;acceptable&quot; or &quot;comprehensible&quot;. For me &quot;quantum 
<br />
suicide&quot; was a confirmation of the fact, easily derivable from comp, 
<br />
that even for purely empirical reason we can doubt &quot;mortality&quot;, or 
<br />
doubt that the mortality issue is simple, like so many materialist tend 
<br />
to think.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Granted, I will never travel near the speed of light; I will never put 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cat in a box equipped with a random and automatized killing device; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I will not attempt suicide; my wife would just kill me. However, these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; examples fired up my imagination: travelling near the speed of light,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existing in a superposition of state, surviving a nuclear bomb under
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your chair.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Smullyan's white knigth had the mission to teach me about the logic of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; G
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and G*. Sorry, he failed. The white knight does not fire up my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; imagination. I don't care about his island and about his questions.
</em><br />
<br /><br />It is exactly with the &quot;diagonal principle&quot; (FU page 211) that the 
<br />
logical role of the Knight-knave Island is eventually eliminated. Now 
<br />
his &quot;diagonal principle&quot; arises in the context of his &quot;Godelized 
<br />
Universe&quot; for which Smullyan don't provide motivation (it still look 
<br />
like a fairy tale). What makes Universe *Godelized* is really Church 
<br />
Thesis, and that is really the missing key in FU (and actually in the 
<br />
whole work of Smullyan). I make those steps more transparent in my SANE 
<br />
paper. have you print it? It should help.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; However I do care about life, death and immortality. The many-world 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seem to guarantee a form of immortality, at least according to some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interpretations.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes, we have discuss this a lot. I think most people agree on this in 
<br />
the list, both with the quantum MWI, or with some &quot;all computations 
<br />
exist&quot;. I think the most serious involved people in this list just 
<br />
disagree on how to quantify the (quantum or comp) indeterminacy. Of 
<br />
course progress have been made on the quantum part of that problem, but 
<br />
hardly on the comp part, which is actually presupposed in the quantum 
<br />
MWI (cf Everett, Deutsch, ...).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I consider this issue to be very relevant since sooner
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or later each one of us will be facing the issue of death or of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non-death.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Be careful with such motivation because it could lead t wishful 
<br />
thinking. I am not sure you can appreciate the comp &quot;lesson&quot; which 
<br />
shows above all the abyssal googelplexity or our ignorance. But then 
<br />
such an ignorance appears to have a mathematical shape capable of 
<br />
providing information, but this leads today just to hard mathematical 
<br />
questions.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would like someone to come up with an extreme adventure story like 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; travelling twin, Schroedinger's cat, or Tegmark's suicide experiment to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; illustrate G and G*.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I think the whole UDA (Universal Dovetailer Argument) and the movie 
<br />
graph paradox (or argument), and/or Maudlin's Olympia device are going 
<br />
in that direction. G and G* are just the tools for making this 
<br />
technical enough so that it leads to testable propositions. UDA is 
<br />
really the intuitive (and rigorous although informal) path for an 
<br />
understanding of the reversal between physics and numbers, including 
<br />
the showing of how hard the comp (im)mortality puzzle is.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; For example this story would describe a close brush
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with death.. It would create a paradox by juxtaposing 1) classical or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; common sense logic assuming a single world,
</em><br />
<br /><br />It seems to me that the UDA just does that. Do you see that classical 
<br />
physics is a priori untenable with comp once we take the 1-3 person 
<br />
distinction into account? I mean Classical physics is just 
<br />
epistemologically incompatible with common sense, once comp is assumed.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) classical or common sense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logic assuming the many-world, and
</em><br />
<br /><br />See just above.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  3) G/G* logic assuming the many-world.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Well, we get G and G* assuming just the natural numbers (and 
<br />
classicality in Platonia, but this is generaly assumed under the comp 
<br />
hyp).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What would the white knight do if he were living in the many-world?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Please, the white knight is just a &quot;logical tool&quot; for getting G and G* 
<br />
without learning some heavy introduction to recursion theory or 
<br />
mathematical logic. Read my SANE paper(*)  for a quick elimination of 
<br />
it. You can ask question.
<br />
But the white knight is nothing more than that. As an entity it is not 
<br />
even definable in the language of a lobian machine. I explain this in 
<br />
my paper.
<br />
I realize also that I explain the &quot;real&quot; heart of the matter 
<br />
(diagonalization *and* Church thesis) in my last paper, which is not 
<br />
yet in my web page (which I should update anyway).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; kind of situations would highlight his talent to think in G. Would his
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behavior appear to be paradoxical from our logical point of view?
</em><br />
<br /><br />The white knight does not exist, not even in Platonia. It is the price 
<br />
Smullyan asks to pay for making G and G* easily accessible without 
<br />
studying too much mathematical logic.
<br />
<br />Now I think I should train you with diagonalization. I give you an 
<br />
exercise: write a program which, if executed, will stop on the biggest 
<br />
possible natural number. Fairy tale version: you meet a fairy who 
<br />
propose you a wish. You ask to be immortal but the fairy replies that 
<br />
she has only finite power. So she can make you living as long as you 
<br />
wish, but she asks precisely how long. It is up too you to describe 
<br />
precisely how long you want to live by writing a program naming that 
<br />
big (but finite) number. You have a limited amount of paper to write 
<br />
your answer, but the fairy is kind enough to give you a little more if 
<br />
you ask.
<br />
You can ask the question to very little children. The cutest answer I 
<br />
got was &quot;7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7&quot; (by a six year old). Why seven? It was the 
<br />
age of his elder brother!
<br />
<br />Hint: try to generate an infinite set S of more and more growing and 
<br />
(computable) functions, and then try to diagonalize it. S can be 
<br />
{addition, multiplication, exponentiation,  .... (?)....}. More hints 
<br />
and answers later. I let you think a little bit before. (Alas it looks 
<br />
I will be more busy in may than I thought because my (math) students 
<br />
want supplementary lessons this year ...).
<br />
<br />Hope this can help; feel free to make *any* comments.
<br />
<br />Remember that if all this is too technical, you can also just read 
<br />
Plotinus and the (neo)platonist which, accepting comp or weaker form of 
<br />
Pythagorism,  do have a tremendous advance on most materialist of today 
<br />
... I think it could even provide more light on the practical death 
<br />
issue. The role of G and G* is just to get the math correct for some 
<br />
notion of quantifying the 1-person probabilities.
<br />
