<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I note that you have identified yourself with the the ASSA camp in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; past (at least I say so in my book, so it must be true, right! :). What
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you are proposing above is an anti-functionalist position. The question is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does functionalism necessarily imply RSSA, and antifunctionalism imply
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the ASSA? ie, does this whole RSSA/ASSA debate turn on the question of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; functionalism?
</em><br />
<br />The distinction I am drawing seems somewhat orthogonal to the RSSA/ASSA
<br />
debate. Suppose someone is about to die in a terrible accident. From
<br />
the 1st person perspective, RSSA would say that he expects to survive
<br />
through miraculous good luck. ASSA would say that he expects to die and
<br />
never experience anything again. Now suppose that in most universes an
<br />
advanced, benevolent human/AI civilization later recreates his mental
<br />
state and in effect resurrects him in a sort of heaven. Both ASSA and
<br />
RSSA might now say that his expectation prior to the accident should be to
<br />
wake up in this &quot;heaven&quot;, that that is his most likely &quot;next&quot; experience.
<br />
<br />My argument suggests otherwise, that the chance of this being his next
<br />
experience would be rather low. However it basically leaves the RSSA/ASSA
<br />
distinction intact. We would go back to the situation where RSSA predicts
<br />
a miraculously lucky survival of the accident while ASSA predicts death.
<br />
<br />But actually my analysis is supportive of the ASSA in this form, in that
<br />
the measure of a lifetime which ends in the accident is much higher than
<br />
the measure of one which survives.
<br />
<br />As far as functionalism, I agree that this kind of analysis argues
<br />
against it.  Indeed the post from Wei Dai which introduced this concept,
<br />
which I quote here, <a href="http://www.udassa.com/origins.html">http://www.udassa.com/origins.html</a> (apologies for the
<br />
incompleteness of this web site), suggests that the size of a computer
<br />
would affect measure, contradicting functionalism.
<br />
<br />Frankly I suspect that Bruno's analysis would or should lead to the same
<br />
kind of conclusion. I wonder if he supports strict functionalism? Would
<br />
he say &quot;yes doctor&quot; to any and all &quot;functional&quot; brain replacements? Or
<br />
would some additional investigation be appropriate?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I wonder where this leaves Mallah, who admits to computationalism, yet
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is died-in-the-wool ASSA?
</em><br />
<br />Indeed I have often wondered where in the world is Jacques Mallah,
<br />
who was so influential on this list in the past but who seems to have
<br />
vanished utterly from the net. Actually, I wrote that sentence based
<br />
on previous Google searches, but just now I discovered that as of
<br />
two weeks ago he has published his first communication in many years:
<br />
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0709.0544">http://arxiv.org/abs/0709.0544</a> . Here is his abstract, which seems similar
<br />
in its goals to your own work:
<br />
<br />: The Many Computations Interpretation (MCI) of Quantum Mechanics
<br />
: Authors: Jacques Mallah
<br />
: (Submitted on 4 Sep 2007)
<br />
: 
<br />
:     Abstract: Computationalism provides a framework for understanding
<br />
:     how a mathematically describable physical world could give rise to
<br />
:     conscious observations without the need for dualism. A criterion
<br />
:     is proposed for the implementation of computations by physical
<br />
:     systems, which has been a problem for computationalism. Together
<br />
:     with an independence criterion for implementations this would allow,
<br />
:     in principle, prediction of probabilities for various observations
<br />
:     based on counting implementations. Applied to quantum mechanics,
<br />
:     this results in a Many Computations Interpretation (MCI), which is
<br />
:     an explicit form of the Everett style Many Worlds Interpretation
<br />
:     (MWI). Derivation of the Born Rule emerges as the central problem for
<br />
:     most realist interpretations of quantum mechanics. If the Born Rule
<br />
:     is derived based on computationalism and the wavefunction it would
<br />
:     provide strong support for the MWI; but if the Born Rule is shown not
<br />
:     to follow from these to an experimentally falsified extent, it would
<br />
:     indicate the necessity for either new physics or (more radically)
<br />
:     new philosophy of mind.
<br />
<br />I am looking forward to reading this!
<br />
<br />Hal
