<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I would say &quot;relative to a theory explaining the appearances&quot;, not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; just to the appearances.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, it is relative to appearance, but people go on to theorise that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; these appearances are &quot;true reality&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;From Pythagoras to Proclus, &quot;intellectuals&quot; were proud not making that 
<br />
error. Aristotle is in part responsible for having made &quot;appearance&quot; 
<br />
reality, coming back to the (provably wrong assuming comp) common sense 
<br />
in those matters.
<br />
(of course as you know we have to rely on common sense to go beyond 
<br />
common sense).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Searle's theory is that consciousness is a result of actual brain 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; activity, not Turing emulable.
</em><br />
<br />Nooooo....... True: Searle's theory is that consciousness is a result 
<br />
of brain activity, but nowhere does Searle pretend that brain is not 
<br />
turing emulable. He just implicitly assume there is a notion of 
<br />
actuality that no simulation can render, but does not address the 
<br />
question of emulability. Then Searle is known for confusing level of 
<br />
description (this I can make much more precise with the Fi and Wi, or 
<br />
with the very important difference between computability (emulability) 
<br />
and provability.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This theory is in keeping with the facts
</em><br />
<br />Ah?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and allows us to keep materialism as well.
</em><br />
<br />Abandoning the comp hyp. OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The main problem I see with it is that it allows for the existence of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; philosophical zombies, such as computers that act conscious but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aren't. If this were possible it would mean that consciousness was an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; optional evolutionary development, i.e. we could all have evolved to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; live in a world exactly like our own, except we would be zombies. It's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not a knock-down argument, but it strikes me as odd that something as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; elaborate as consciousness could have evolved with no real benefit.
</em><br />
<br />OK. Of course COMP admits local zombie. One day it will be possible to 
<br />
build an artificial museum tourist, looking and commenting picture and 
<br />
art like a real tourist, which nobody will be able to distinguish from 
<br />
a real tourist, but which will be only a sophisticated machine looking 
<br />
for presence of bomb in the museum.
<br />
With comp, consciousness has a big role, many big role (relative 
<br />
sped-up of computations, give the ability to face personal relative 
<br />
ignorance and alternate reality guessing and contemplation, ...). Cf I 
<br />
define in first approximation &quot;consciousness&quot; as the quale which 
<br />
accompanies the instinctive believe in reality/self-consistency.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I agree there is no way to know whether you are being run in serial, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; parallel, etc. But mathematically multiple shorter parallel streams 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; have to be able to be glued, at least mathematically, for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; constituting a proper computation. If not literally anything can be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; described as a computation. That is why I explicitly use a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; mathematical definition of computation, and then(and only then) try 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to figure out what is a rock, for example.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Would you speculate that there is some indivisible atom of conscious 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computation?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Not at all. Consciousness, or instinctive belief in a reality (or in 
<br />
oneself) and/or its associated first person quale needs an infinity 
<br />
(even non countable) of computational histories. It depends in fine of 
<br />
all nameable and unameable relations between number. Nothing deep here, 
<br />
the primeness of 17 is also dependent in some logical way of the whole 
<br />
mutilicative structure of the natural numbers. Machine are lucky to be 
<br />
able to prove the primeness of 17 in a finite time, because the *truth* 
<br />
of even something as mundane than 17's primeness already escapes the 
<br />
machine capability of expression.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Because it doesn't seem that you need any &quot;glue&quot; to have a continuous 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stream of conscious in teleportation and mind uploading thought 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiments.
</em><br />
<br />One day I will have to ask you what you really mean by computation. An 
<br />
arbitrary sequence of sign can be interpreted as a computation (cf your 
<br />
&quot;rock&quot;). I am OK with that if, and only if you can show me the 
<br />
universal machine for which this sequence describes a computation. And 
<br />
if you do that, each of those sign will need to have, at least,  an 
<br />
arithmetical connection: there will be a number (finite piece of 
<br />
information) capable of relying all the signs. This makes computations 
<br />
non trivial object, and it is easy to prove that arbitrary sequence of 
<br />
numbers/signs are NOT computations (there is an uncountable number of 
<br />
arbitrary sequences, and a countable number of third person 
<br />
computations. The glue I was thinking about is not physicalist glue, 
<br />
but already arithmetical glue. Does that help?
<br />
<br />The real question is not &quot;does a rock implement computations&quot;, the 
<br />
question is &quot;does a rock implement computations in such a way as to 
<br />
changed the relative measure of my (future) comp states in a relevant 
<br />
way?&quot; And for answering such question we need to know what a rock 
<br />
really is, and both physics and comp are not near at all to answer 
<br />
this. Comp has less trouble here because it does not have to reify any 
<br />
primary reality associated to the rock, which already emerge locally 
<br />
from many non material computations.
