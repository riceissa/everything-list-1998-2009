<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I personnaly deny the concept of &quot;measure of conscious experiment&quot;. I deny
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the fact that consciousness is an *objective* property of matter, just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because you can not define a physical property, measurable by an external
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; apparatus, whose measure could determine the degree of consciousness (or if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you can, let me know).
</em><br />
<br />I don't think it is that simple.  Consciousness is an information
<br />
property.  It is analogous to asking whether a computer program running
<br />
on a piece of hardware has some property.
<br />
<br />If you stare at the CPU and memory of a computer, and ask whether it is
<br />
running a particular program, it seems very hard to tell.  The hardware
<br />
appears inert, superficially.  It looks the same whether it is running
<br />
one program or another.
<br />
<br />However, on closer inspection, you can actually get some information.
<br />
If you probe the hardware and examine the electrical signals in detail,
<br />
you can learn what program is being executed, and begin to answer
<br />
questions about it.
<br />
<br />The same thing is true of the brain, or other physical object.  We can
<br />
probe it and learn about it and develop theories about what is going
<br />
on internally.
<br />
<br />Now, with consciousness, we have an additional problem, because we aren't
<br />
sure what kinds of programs must be running to be conscious.  However,
<br />
as we examine more brains in detail, we should be able to come up with
<br />
theories which at least say that certain kinds of programs, certain
<br />
kinds of brain activities, are correlated with consciousness.  This may
<br />
not be a complete or exhaustive listing of all forms of consciousness,
<br />
but conservatively we can say that these patterns do indicate the kind
<br />
of consciousness that most people have.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Much of the discussion about consciouness is plagued by this fact, because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we include it in formalisms that have not been deviced to handle it.  The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only consciousness we know is our own one, by means that are different from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; those we use to interact with the outer world. We think that the other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; human beings are conscious because of the similarity of their behavior with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ours, but it does not define what is consciousness. If one succeeds in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; building a computer with a human-like behaviour (which is quite possible in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my sense), deciding if it is actually conscious or not is purely a matter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of convenience, not an intrinsic property. In other words, I think the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proposition &quot;Another than me is conscious&quot; is really unprovable.
</em><br />
<br />Provability is not the issue.  No propositions are absolutely provable.
<br />
We want to come up with theories about the universe.  Theories are
<br />
inherently unprovable, but are based on our detection of regularities
<br />
and patterns in nature.
<br />
<br />The problem with theories of consciousness isn't provability, it is
<br />
testability.  How would we ever test the predictions of the theory?
<br />
<br />In fact, there are some circumstances in which such testing can be done.
<br />
If the theory predicts that altering brains in certain physical ways
<br />
should result in particular changes in consciousness, we can try these
<br />
out and ask the people what they experience.  Solipsists can even alter
<br />
their own brains so as to be sure of the results.
<br />
<br />However, we cannot use this method to extend our theories much beyond
<br />
ordinary human brains.  It is hard to see how we could ever reach
<br />
agreement about whether various kinds of animals are conscious.  And in
<br />
the case of computer programs, if our theories predict that they are
<br />
conscious (based on patterns of brain behavior), and the programs say they
<br />
are conscious, some people may still maintain that the programs are not.
<br />
<br />The theory of consciousness faces many difficulties, but despite these
<br />
issues, it is not completely impossible.  In particular, it should be
<br />
possible to construct conservative, limited, testable theories based
<br />
on observations of human brains, which should achieve wide agreement
<br />
and acceptance.
