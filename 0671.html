I don't know what could be more enjoyable than exploring an ensemble
<br />
theory or aggregate model of the Universe. I just want to point out that
<br />
it may not be necessary to consider all conceivable mathematical or
<br />
physical systems.

&lt;&lt;&lt; The answer is that the structure(s) we are in obey physical laws,

not because they were cast by  fiat from some omnipotent being, but

simply because the structures that do obey physical laws are more

numerous than those that do  not, and hence we are likely to find

ourselves in those.

&lt;&lt;  We can find ourselves ONLY in those structures that obey physical

laws because these are the ONLY structures that can support us as
<br />
rational beings (SAS). The assumption that worlds with (rational)
<br />
physical laws are  more more numerous than those without is therefore
<br />
unwarranted.  In fact I would believe in the opposite. That the worlds
<br />
without rational physical laws, (if these could be called worlds at
<br />
all), are more numerous than those with rational physical laws.
<br />
<br />I just would add that there may not be more than one set of rational
<br />
physical laws which apply everywhere. I would not expect multiple
<br />
mathematical systems distinct or separate from a single aggregate
<br />
mathematical system of nature. Existence I expect has a math itself and
<br />
any system, mathematical, physical, or temporal, is sub-content of that
<br />
one system or nature.
<br />
<br />We might consider the possibility that an extension of mathematical
<br />
logic and a sort of extended reality emerges inside unique temporal
<br />
frameworks, creating reason or consistency, subject to how each temporal
<br />
framework is configured. Still, all such worlds share a common
<br />
foundation by existing.
<br />
<br />Someone mentioned Descartes, I think therefore I am. Within many ways we
<br />
can interpret the phrase, such as the meaning of 'I think' or 'I am', is
<br />
the simple recognition that 'something exists'. Any mathematical system,
<br />
any set of physical laws, is subject to whatever natural laws govern
<br />
basic existence, i.e. the nature of the Universe of universes.
<br />
<br />Ultimately I believe the solution is to recognize that what is possible
<br />
defines what is actual, or even, what is possible 'is' what is actual. I
<br />
would expect those involved in this group to be thinking along those
<br />
lines already. So my question is, can there be subsystems where what is
<br />
real or where physical laws break the laws of another system? If the
<br />
most basic construction or foundational elements of the system are
<br />
changed, (i.e. mass, density, number of spatial dimensions in our
<br />
system) then systems would only relate in what is common to both. Laws
<br />
would change accordingly, as each exists in one ultimate system.

<br />One of the biggest problems is that in Relativity, there is no well

<br />
<br />You've probably seen where Tegmark maps spatial and temporal dimensions
<br />
to consider which are possible real systems. Fascinating objective, to
<br />
recognize how space-time relates to the set of all possible worlds.
<br />
Perhaps, as we remove ourselves from our position in time, working
<br />
toward a God's eye view, we need to suspend thinking of time as an
<br />
elementary dimension. Said another way, see the universe as if there is
<br />
one common moment of now for everyone and everything.
<br />
<br />So I personally prefer to abandon time and use mass or density as a
<br />
dimension. Please let me know, anyone, a good reason not to consider an
<br />
ensemble theory, a description of all possible states or worlds, first,
<br />
without time as a dimension.
<br />
<br />Anyone can imagine the first three dimensions of space without time.
<br />
Consider a model of possible states by adding density into each
<br />
dimension. Along a plane, or in ONE dimension, the range of value for
<br />
density is from zero to infinite (the values of an ordinary mathematical
<br />
plane).
<br />
<br />Notice two extreme states, infinite density and zero density. There
<br />
should be no objection to zero density if you suspend time.
<br />
<br />In TWO dimensions we have to keep in mind we are modeling all that is
<br />
possible of density and space. Adding a second dimension of space
<br />
creates a 2D spectrum of patterns. The diagram below will help:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.everythingforever.com/F-TIME.GIF">http://www.everythingforever.com/F-TIME.GIF</a>
<br />
<br />At either ends of the spectrum there remains isolated extremes, singular
<br />
possible states of infinite and zero density, but at every other measure
<br />
of density there is more than one possible pattern or configuration. The
<br />
number of states actually diverges away from infinite density, gets fat,
<br />
and then it converges toward zero, the two singular patterns.
<br />
<br />It might help to imagine a flat network of lights. There are
<br />
configurations of 'all on', 'all off', and an infinite number of
<br />
variations if the individual lights are variable in intensity. So the
<br />
set of all possible 2D patterns is infinite yet bordered by extremes.
<br />
<br />Adding a third dimension only expands the measure of unique possible
<br />
patterns. The model is still given shape by two extremes, zero and
<br />
infinite.
<br />
<br />Now consider such spaces as if they actually exist as static timeless
<br />
worlds. Within this set exists all the patterns from which any possible
<br />
time world would necessarily be created or built. Any space-time world
<br />
would be secondary to this non-temporal set of worlds.
<br />
<br />I myself believe time is actually space, a series of space worlds, 4D
<br />
space, and quantum mechanics is the side effect of our passing through
<br />
static spaces. Feynman described time as a direction in space. I
<br />
describe time as a direction through spaces.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.everythingforever.com/4Dspace.jpg">http://www.everythingforever.com/4Dspace.jpg</a>
<br />
<br />The fourth spatial dimension travels through many 3D worlds and creates
<br />
'space'-time. As I understand this aggregate set of spaces, each space
<br />
is defined (finite), yet the set is not otherwise divided apart. So
<br />
there exists a fourth dimension of directions, within each space,
<br />
directions that pass through the aggregate set creating time as we know
<br />
it.
<br />
<br />I propose a few other theories also, all interconnected, such as a
<br />
mathematical system where positive and negative values combine rather
<br />
than cancel, and a theory that there isn't simply order and disorder
<br />
along an axis, but rather two kinds of order in nature, and I show that
<br />
the order of one is the disorder of the other.
