SP:' You wouldn't necessarily be squashed if you were inside the event 
<br />
horizon of a black hole provided that it was massive enough. Being 
<br />
inside the event horizon is not the same as being inside the singularity.'
<br />
<br />MP: Two thoughts come to my suspicious mind.
<br />
1/   [Not far from the post-Freudian speculation :-] ... Attendance 
<br />
within the event horizon of a common or garden galactic variety black 
<br />
hole would seem to incorporate a one-way ticket *to* the singularity, 
<br />
would it not?
<br />
<br />2/   I once heard someone on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's 
<br />
Radio National Science Show [on every Saturday after the midday news] 
<br />
describing our universe in these terms. His point was that whatever we 
<br />
might think about what was 'beyond' the bounds of 'our' universe, 
<br />
nothing from here can escape to 'there'. As I understand it this is in 
<br />
line with Einstein's concept of the universe being closed in upon 
<br />
itself, the key cause of which is gravity, the curvature of space-time.
<br />
<br /><br />MP: Going off at a tangent, I have a question which is quite possibly a 
<br />
dumb question that just needs to be asked because it CAN be asked.
<br />
<br />Preamble: The expansion of the universe, characterised by the Hubble 
<br />
Constant I believe, is usually explained non-mathematically by analogy 
<br />
with the stretching of the surface of a balloon as the balloon is 
<br />
inflated. The balloon surface is stretched uniformly, pretty much, by 
<br />
its having everywhere the same tensile strength and elasticity and by 
<br />
the force which causes the deformation being applied equally all over 
<br />
because it is the averaged effect of all the gas particles within the 
<br />
contained volume. That much makes sense, and the overall effect is to 
<br />
cause point locations on the surface of the balloon to recede from one 
<br />
another at a rate which is proportional at any given moment to the 
<br />
distance between the points, measured along the surface.
<br />
<br />Question: Would it be mathematically equivalent, or significantly 
<br />
different,  to consider the measured change in size and in distances as 
<br />
a uniform *contraction* of the metric, ie the measuring system, rather 
<br />
than an expansion of the location, so to speak. In particular, why is it 
<br />
not feasible to consider the Big Bang and subsequent Inflationary epoch 
<br />
as being in effect a collapse?
