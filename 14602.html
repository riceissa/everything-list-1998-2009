<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I'm not saying that.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I would say the second law is

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  statistical, and is verified in most branches. In the MWI applied to

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  quantum field it seems to me that there can be branches with an

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  arbitrarily high number of photon creation without annihilation, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  this for each period of time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; I'm not sure what source of photon creation you have in mind, but QFT
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; doesn't allow violation of energy conservation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Maybe it was vacuum energy Bruno was referring to, or else perhaps the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; creation of virtual particle pairs? Stephen Hawking (who by the way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; apparently regards Everett's theory as trivally true, in other words,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; instrumentalistic and without physical significance) used virtual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; particles to explain how black holes may evaporate. But I don't want
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to put words in anyone's mouth, and plus, I am not knowledgeable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; enough on these matters to discuss them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But if I may raise one possibility, it seems to me that despite the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; existence of fluke branches in which the second law is not inviolate,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; there are no possible branches that experience the outcome of a double
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; slit experiment that does not result in an interference pattern.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This is according to my understanding that the interference actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; takes place across branches, as each path of the photon interferers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; constructively and destructively with itself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But that interference is of the wave-function with itself.  It's squared
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; modulus only determines a probability.  So, thru a fluke of probability,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the photons could strike the screen in a pattern that is arbitrarily close
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the naive no-interference pattern.  I say &quot;arbitrarily close&quot; since in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; principle no photon could land where the probability was zero. But the zero
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probability region is a line of measure zero.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's not very clear to me how MWI accounts for the pattern.  Is it supposed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that there is a separate world for every point each photon could land; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; separate worlds having a certain probability weight.  Or are there multiple
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; worlds for each spot in order that the probability be proportional to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; number of worlds?  And what if the probability is an irrational number?
</em><br />
<br />Mutiple worlds for each spot on the screen, according to my
<br />
understanding of Feynman's explanation of the experiment. However, I
<br />
think it is important to distinguish between the probability function
<br />
that describes the interference pattern registering on the screen/
<br />
photodetector array, and the probability function that results from
<br />
the square of the psi modulus. IIRC, Feynman said that the
<br />
interference pattern from the double slit experiment (or equivalently,
<br />
the emergent probability function that is the same across branches)
<br />
results from the fact that for any point on the screen where a photon
<br />
may fall from the slits there are multiple paths that one photon may
<br />
take to get to that point. The next step is to say that there are
<br />
other branches (due to MWI), each of which describes another possible
<br />
path taken by that same photon, and that, depending on the relative
<br />
difference in path lengths to the point in question, summing over all
<br />
possible paths taken by a photon to that point results in a value
<br />
somewhere between completely desctructive interference and completely
<br />
constructive. I take this scenario to mean that the total interference
<br />
pattern is a probability function describing how likely it is to
<br />
measure a single photon at any point on the screen, and that this
<br />
probability function is an emergent property of light particles
<br />
interfering with parallel versions of themselves across branches.
<br />
Since they are summed across the branches, so to speak, the
<br />
interference pattern resulting from the double slit experiement is one
<br />
example of getting a deterministic result from probabilistic
<br />
interactions, and is in fact the same pattern across all branches
<br />
representing outcomes of the experiment. So the psi function may be
<br />
thought of as being proportional to the number of universes, but the
<br />
probability function representing the distribution of photons on the
<br />
screen is not.
<br />
<br />This is what I was thinking when I first mentioned the experiment,
<br />
although I didn't express what I meant very well. I was also thinking
<br />
of a game show scenario thought experiment that arrives at the same
<br />
conclusion, i.e., that multiple probabilities may degenerate into
<br />
fewer unique branches, and that not every event actually happens
<br />
somewhere in the multiverse. For example, Lets say that a contestant
<br />
on Deal or No Deal gets down to the last briefcase, so that there is
<br />
only the case that she originally selected, or there is the other. All
<br />
other cases have been eliminated, so one of the remaining two has one
<br />
cent in it, and the other has one million dollars. The contestant has
<br />
to choose whether she wants to keep the one she originally selected,
<br />
or else switch with the last remaining case. The contestant, who
<br />
happens to read the Everything list, has brought along a qubit, a
<br />
particle in a superposition of spin states to help her with her
<br />
decision. If she measures the particle's spin as positive, she will
<br />
elect to switch cases, and if she measures it with a negative spin she
<br />
will keep the one she has. This is because she wants to be sure that,
<br />
having gotten to this point in the game, there will be at least some
<br />
branches of her existence where she experiences winning the grand
<br />
prize. She is not convinced that, were she to decide what to do using
<br />
only the processes available to her mind, she would guarantee that
<br />
same result since it is just possible that all of the mutiple versions
<br />
of herself confronted with the dilemma may make the same bad guess.
<br />
<br />Is she correct to feel this way?
