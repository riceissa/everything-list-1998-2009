<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Russell, If you believe that a particular thought is poorly expressed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or sloppy, I would appreciate any help you might offer in making it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more precise, rather than 'bashing' it.  
</em><br />
<br />It seems you've miscontrued my &quot;bashing&quot;, sorry about that. I was,
<br />
perhaps somewhat colourfully, meaning &quot;extracting some meaning&quot;. Since
<br />
your prose (and often Colin's for that matter) often sounds like
<br />
gibberish to me, I have to work at it, rather like bashing a lump of
<br />
metal with a hammer. Sometimes I succeed, but other times I just have
<br />
to give up.
<br />
<br />I most certainly didn't mean &quot;unwarranted critising of&quot;, or &quot;flaming&quot;. I am
<br />
interested in learning, and I don't immediately assume that you (or
<br />
anyone else for that matter) have nothing interesting to say.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sometimes conversations on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the list feel more like talking past one another, and this in general
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; isn't 'a useful exercise'.  My comment to Brent was motivated by a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perception that you'd been countering my 1-personal terminology with 3-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person formalisms.  
</em><br />
<br />Terminology is terminology, it doesn't have a point of view. Terms
<br />
should have accepted meaning, unless we agree on a different meaning
<br />
for the purposes of discussion.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Consequently, as such, they didn't strike me as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; equivalent, or as genuine 'counterexamples': this surprised me, in
</em><br />
<br />Which counterexamples are you talking about? 
<br />
<br />1) Biological evolution as a counterexample to Colin's assertion about
<br />
doing science implies consciousness. This started this thread.
<br />
<br />2) Oxygen and hydrogen atoms as counterexamples of a chemical
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;potential that is not an electric field
<br />
<br />3) Was there something else? I can't quite recall now.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; view of some of the other ideas you've expressed.  So I may well have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; been too swift to assign certain motives to you, not having detected
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any pedagogically-motivated intent to caricature, and I would welcome
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your more specific clarification and correction.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I should say at this point that I too find the 'terminology' task very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; trying, as virtual any existing vocabulary comes freighted with pre-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existing implications of the sort you have been exploiting in your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ripostes, but which I didn't intend.  I would welcome any superior
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; alternatives you might suggest.  Trying or not, I'm not quite ready to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; give up the attempt to clarify these ideas.  If you think the exercise
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; misconceived or poorly executed, it's of course up to you to choose to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'bash', satirise, or ignore it, but I would particularly welcome open-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ended questions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />I don't recall satirising anything recently. It is true that I usually
<br />
ignore comments that don't make sense after a couple of minutes of
<br />
staring at the phrase, unless really prodded like you did in your
<br />
recent post on attributing sensing to arbitrary interactions.
