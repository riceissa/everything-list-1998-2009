<br />Thanks for taking the trouble to express your thoughts at such length.
<br />
I won't say too much now, as I have to leave shortly to meet a long
<br />
lost relative - from Hungary! However, I just want to make sure it's
<br />
clear, both for you and the list, that:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;Comp is false&quot;. Let's see where *that* leads.....
</em><br />
<br />isn't intended as a definitive claim that comp *is* false. Rather, *if*
<br />
it is false, in what ways specifically, and what are the alternatives?
<br />
Can they be stated as clearly and explicitly as Bruno is trying to do
<br />
for his approach ('to see where it leads')? Hence the 'anti-roadmap',
<br />
or perhaps better - 'another roadmap', or some ideas for one. Most of
<br />
the thoughts in it were originally expressed in some earlier postings
<br />
on 'The Fabric of Reality' list, which Bruno was kind enough to copy to
<br />
this list.  Anyway, it's intended as a point of departure (for me
<br />
certainly) and I look forward to some strenuous critiques.
<br />
<br />One misgiving I have, now that I've finally grasped (I think) that the
<br />
comp 'theology' entails 'faith' in the number realm, is that by this
<br />
token it seeks to provide a TOE (Bruno, am I wrong about this?) That
<br />
is, beginning with an assertion of 'faith' in UDA + the number realm,
<br />
we seek to axiomatise and 'prove' a complete theory of our origins.
<br />
Bruno is a very modest person, but I worry about the 'modesty' of the
<br />
goal. Of course, it's highly probable that I just misunderstand this
<br />
point. However, I'm having trouble with my faith in numbers,
<br />
monseigneur. My own intuition begins from my own indexical
<br />
self-assertion, my necessity, generalised to an inclusive
<br />
self-asserting necessity extending outwards indefinitely. I don't look
<br />
for a way to 'get behind' this, and to this extent I don't seek a TOE,
<br />
because I can't believe that 'everything' (despite the name of this
<br />
list) is theoretically assimilable. This may well be blindness more
<br />
than modesty, however.
<br />
<br />Having said this, of course in a spirit of learning I'm trying to
<br />
understand and adopt *as if* true the comp assumptions, and continue to
<br />
put my best efforts into getting my head around Bruno's roadmap as it
<br />
emerges. I have a lot of experience of changing my mind (and maybe I'll
<br />
get a better one!)
<br />
<br />David
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; David,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your post has wits. Yet it reminded me of 'atheism' which starts from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;belief&quot; it is supposed to deny. I am not an atheist, because I do not know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what to deny: what do people 'think' to call &quot;god&quot;?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My question to comp was (and I think it is different from your position):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let me &quot;IN&quot; into learning about 'comp' from the outside, the 'no comp'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mindset.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; When you say: &quot;Comp is false&quot; you accepted it and argue about &quot;IT&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I ask &quot;What is comp - if I am outside the entire mindset and don't assume&quot;?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno is VERY logical and knowledgeable, but his 'mindset' includes numbers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and mathematical thinking. I got a lot of good responses from him to my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; questions and all started from some &quot;in theory&quot; assumption (e.g. 'assuming
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comp', etc.). What if we do NOT assume it?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I asked about 'numbers' stripped from counting and quantities. Otherwise
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they are only quantizing adjectives (6 what?). (Like the 'color green'?)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Pure&quot; mathematics works differently, it even substitutes the numbers with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other symbols (yes, 'symbols', if we do not think of the 'what').  I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; differentiate an &quot;applied math&quot; in the sciences, working with quantities
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; identified within the limited topical models of the science. This is another
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subject, - I want to concentrate here on the &quot;numbers&quot; concept.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ideas 'exist' relationally (and some are translated into physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (materialistic) features). To get to 'ideas' a receiving observer is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessary with enough complexity to accept them.  (Then we (our mind)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interpret them into the perception of reality).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In my older thinking (prone to be revised) I defined my 'information'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concept as some difference 'accepted' into an observer. The difference can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be e.g. an electric (so called) potential and the acceptor )observer!) even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a polar(!) moelcule(!),  - or at a different level: a difference, like a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; strange societal story is accepted by a reader of G.B.Shaw (observer).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Existence in this ontology was the difference itself, observer anything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that accepts information.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; When the developing human 'mind' reached the complexity to identify
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'numbers' the numbers enetered the human thinking. Does it make sense to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argue a homoiusion war whether they existed &quot;before&quot; they could be accepted?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For 'us' they started to exist when our mind became capable to 'accept' such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is only semantical in our syntax to call this situation an &quot;invention&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is only semantical in our syntax to call this situation an &quot;invention&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then we started to count and think in quantities using the newly &quot;invented&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'numbers'. But what are these 'numbers' without the counting and quantizing?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Do they have a quantitative original meaning? Originally the 'unit' was 2,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and '1' was half of it in certain cases. In my language which is older than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Indo - European ones a man with 1 eye is &quot;half-eyed&quot; and with 1 hand or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; foot i said to have lost his &quot;half&quot; hand or foot. Yet a man is 1, a sable is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1, not 2. Many was 5, seemingly from the fingers, and in Russian grammar
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they have a dual case and a &quot;big plural&quot; above 5.  (Also: a 'unit' involves
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more than one by its meaning).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; David, I do not go all along your long post.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; These remarks came to mind  - I don't write a dissertation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Your idea was an intreresting one. My original reaction (above) was a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reminiscence to a 'believer's' challenge that I should 'disprove' god and my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; answer was: only, if you prove something to exist can I refute it.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;Comp is false&quot;. Let's see where *that* leads. I'm erecting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; this as a signpost to indicate a direction, and I would beg the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; list's indulgence in helping me to look in this direction, rather
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; than confining its comments to the ramshackle construction of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; signpost itself. My hope is that you will help me to expose whatever is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; untrue or confused about what follows (I'm sure you will!). But I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; hope you will also 'catch my drift'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 1) The bit-stream
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Comp deals with a bit-stream representation of appearance. The theorems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of comp process this bit-stream in terms of a formal system, creating a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; framework within which 'true or 'false' theorems may be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; evaluated. This system is by its nature closed, or tautological. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; statements that can be made, their 'truth' or 'falsehood', are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; inherent in the axiomatic and operational characteristics of the formal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; system as applied to the bit-stream.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 2) The instantiation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; In order to implement the comp approach, an instantiation is required
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that will represent the bit-stream and enact the formal operations. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Turing machine is an idealised version of such an instantiation. A
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; digital computer is a physical version of a TM. Consequently comp may
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; be instantiated in a digital computer, and copied in innumerable media
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that suitably preserve its informational structure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 3) Dimensionality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The bit-stream is 'pure' information and as such is 0-dimensional.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Multi-dimensionality emerges only at the level of the active
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; instantiation of the bit-stream. Consequently what is Turing-emulable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is the bit-stream (which includes a statement of the required formal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; operations - i.e. the program) and because this emulation is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 0-dimensional, it is indifferent to form ('substrate-independent').
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Also because it is 0-dimensional, it is inherently powerless to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; interact directly with multi-dimensional reality. All such interaction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; takes place because what is implicit in the bit-stream is rendered
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; explicit by its multi-dimensional instantiation. Although we may speak
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; metaphorically (i.e. 'as if' projecting 'form' on to it) of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; bit-stream as 'representational' in a virtual 0-dimensional sense,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; this is powerless as such to cause any interaction with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; multi-dimensional environment. To do this requires that additional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; information, merely implicit in the bit-stream, is rendered explicit by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the instantiation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; If we consider an 'intelligent program' instantiated in a digital
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; computer, 'explicit form' - multi-dimensionality - is 'added
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; back' at the interfaces where the machine interacts with the external
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; environment. For example, a display device transforms the bit-stream
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; into pixels in a 2-dimensional arrangement. At the next 'layer' up,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a user decides whether to interpret the 2-dimensional arrangements
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; semantically (i.e. 'these are symbols') or graphically (i.e.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'this is a quasi-3-dimensional scene'). Up another layer, and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; user transforms these judgements into direct interaction with a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; multi-dimensional environment.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; All pure bit-stream representations rely on implicit environmental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; assumptions in order to 'execute' as intended. DNA, for example,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; relies for its expression both on its multi-dimensional orientation in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; space, and the materials present in the local environment. This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; information is not present, though implicit, in the codons, but is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; *made explicit* by the environment that instantiates them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 4) Form
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The 'physical' description of the world, as I was rightly reminded
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; by Peter, has no significant layering (well, perhaps it does, but more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; later). Appearance, however, displays complex layering, and as we have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; seen, this also 'appears' to extend to the intelligibility of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; world in which we 'appear' to participate. 'Form' and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'layering' somehow emerge from whatever the physical model
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; describes as a bit-stream. When we experience and interact with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; world, we do so in a way that is inherently multi-dimensional. What is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; represented in this way is directly 'grasped' or 'enacted'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (i.e. represented, structured) in multi-dimensional 'form' and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; unfolded by multi-dimensional 'motor units' into action in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; multi-dimensional world. This is both what makes it non-invariant to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Turing-emulation, and gives it its direct multi-dimensional linkage to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; enaction in multi-dimensional environments. Certainly, 0-dimensional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; bit-stream representations and pathways are entailed in such processes,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; but they serve to store and transmit information, not to enact its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; meaning or its consequences in the world  - i.e. its intentionality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; as information-put-into-action.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 5) Correlation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; How is the above to be correlated with the physical or bit-stream
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; representation? Through appropriate forms. We already know this from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the fertility of 'laws of form' that are intrinsic to science as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; practised - whether physical, chemical, biological, physiological,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; psychological, sociological, and so on up the 'levels'. At each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; level, 'laws of form' are abstracted that render this world-view
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; intelligible, although they are not directly implied at the level below
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; - hence Peter's comment about the 'lack of layering'. So,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; consider the brain. We can approach this through the lens of a variety
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of forms - squidgy grey mass, neural network, bio-electrical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; circuitry, neuro-chemical pathways, etc. - even 'digital
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; computer'. None of these has yet succeeded in capturing a 'formal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; decomposition' that yields appearance, or even a mechanism that seems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; capable of enacting the construction of  multi-dimensional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; representation as experienced.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; However, as the above analogies indicate, this is not a fruitless task,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; but an empirical one. There have been, and still are, innumerable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'formal decompositions' of the world that have served only to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; multiply mystery. The world, as we know, stands on the backs of an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; infinite stack of turtles, and motion is accomplished through the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; efforts of an innumerable insensible angelic host. ????? .......... We
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; should be looking for a 'formal decomposition' of the brain that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; embraces both isomorphic representation of, and direct
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; multi-dimensional interaction with, the external environment of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; body, and beyond it the world. We should expect these forms to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'construct boundaries', the 'lines of cleavage' that do not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; exist in the 0-dimensional physical description. We should ask - from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; either side of this cleavage - 'who is looking, listening, tasting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; what lies on the other side?' The 'side' that is able to answer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; these questions intelligibly by enacting its responses in the world is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the 'perceiver'. The other is the 'perceptual model'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The explicit multi-dimensional 'grasp' of form is what I contend
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; makes all this non-invariant to Turing emulation. Note that I've not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; said 'non-Turing emulable', since anything that can be represented
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; as a bit-stream may be Turing-emulated, but the issue here is whether
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; multi-dimensional experience and enaction is invariant to such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; emulation. My claim is that it can't be, because it requires the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; instantiation to explicitly 'add back' the missing information that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is only implicit in the 0-dimensional  emulated bit-stream. It is this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that makes multi-dimensional environments 'non-invariant to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; computation', as opposed to 'non-computable'.  This is IMO the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'understanding' - the multi-dimensional enaction of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; multi-dimensionally-represented information - to which, for example,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Penrose appeals as the source of mathematical intuition. It isn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Platonic reality to which the mathematician, or any of us, has direct
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; access, but rather the multi-dimensional forms from which these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'perfect' concepts are abstracted.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 6) Indexical existence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Missing information? Surely this isn't the dreaded 'hidden
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; variables'? I don't think it is. The missing information is what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (some of us) are trying to express by 'I assert my indexical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; existence as a necessary fact'. This 'information' is entirely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; absent from the physical or other formal (virtual, or what we've
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; sometimes rather unfortunately called 3rd-person) accounts of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; appearance/ reality. It expresses itself self-referentially, and this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; expression has 'qualities' (again what we perhaps unfortunately
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; call 'qualia', but  let it serve). I contend that qualia carry the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; meaning *like this!*, or more simply *this!*. From such 'codons'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; worlds of  'thisness' emerge. Since 'thisness' is at the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; time the instantiation of the multi-dimensional environment, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'thisness' of experience' can transform directly to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'thisness' of enaction in the world. This is what we call meaning
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and intentionality. The project of mapping and correlating our accounts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of the world-as-appearance-and-meaning and the world-as-structure has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; been well-termed 'Dual-aspect Science'. Let's get on with it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 7) Mass, space, gravity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; If the foregoing is speculative, what follows is ruminative. Having
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; dismissed 'form' as significant in a physical decomposition of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; reality, does this perhaps force a re-appearance at the point where QM
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; collides with General Relativity - i.e. where the bit-stream hits the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; instantiation? Curved space, gravitational interaction - these seem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; intrinsically geometrical/ topological/ 'shaped' ideas. Is there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; any analogy here to the relationship of formal description to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; instantiation? I wonder.....
