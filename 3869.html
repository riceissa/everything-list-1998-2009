<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Here's a new question for you, Bruno. What interpretation of probability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;theory do you subscribe to? I've been saying that the meaning of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probabilities come from decision theory and specificly a probability only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;has meaning if it actually is relevant to making a decision.
</em><br />
<br />I think we discussed this before (when I told you that this position
<br />
is not unlike my iridia (ex)-boss position). But probabilities never really
<br />
appeared in that context, credibilities appeared instead, somehow akin to the
<br />
Dempster Shafer evidence theory. You can look at Philippe Smets webpage
<br />
at <a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~psmets/">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~psmets/</a> for links.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;So far no one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;has posted a disagreement with that philosophy, but perhaps we don't all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;agree. Would you like to clarify your position on this issue?
</em><br />
<br /><br />I think I do not disagree with that philosophy. Now in my approach
<br />
the only axiom I really need for the machine's rational beliefs on
<br />
probability is that [P(x) = 1] entails [not P(x) = 0]. (P(x) is
<br />
for probability of event x). This will
<br />
correspond to the modal formula []A -&gt; &lt;&gt;A. That is: if the event A
<br />
is necessary then it must be possible. This formula
<br />
is called D (for deontic: it is also basic in the modal approach to
<br />
obligation and permission). If D was not a theorem of the Z logic, I would
<br />
have stop the machine interview and would be much more doubtful about
<br />
comp.
<br />
It is an open problem how to treat more general notion of probability
<br />
in the language of a consistent machine. With the introduction of self-
<br />
duplication experiment, probabilities becomes very counterintuitive. That's
<br />
why I try to give partial axiomatic and just listen to what a consistent
<br />
machine can say about that, and remaining consistent.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I think you can formalize the problem, or at least an aspect of it, in the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;language of decision theory. So perhaps you can come back to this question

</em><br />
<br /><br />OK. But honestly my feeling is that &quot;decision&quot; is a higher concept that
<br />
probabilities.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  Come on, I'm sure you see what I mean.  (Of course &quot;functional substitution&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  is an interesting concept by itself. It would be just a slight exaggeration
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  to say that the lambda calculus and even category theory has been invented
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  for making that concept precise). In the uda frame, once the level of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  digital substitution has been chosen, a substitution is functional if it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  preserves the counterfactuals input/output relations of the thing which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  is substituted.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;You claimed that the concept of causality is problematic. So how do you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;define &quot;counterfactuals input/output relations&quot; without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reference to causality?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Imo, concept like &quot;causality&quot;, &quot;free-will&quot;, &quot;decision&quot;, etc. are fundamental
<br />
and very interesting *high level psychological* notion.
<br />
The &quot;counterfactuals input-output relations&quot; are semantically defined by UD*
<br />
the running of all computations. But the &quot;running&quot; is itself defined
<br />
in arithmetic, or in the minimal set of inference rules needed to formalize
<br />
notion of computation. This is confirmed partially by the formal similitude
<br />
of the Z logic and Lewis/Hardegree/Stalnaker quantum like approach of the
<br />
notion of relevance. It is also linked to the non-monotonic aspect of quantum
<br />
logic (cf hardegree). But the only low level notion of causality is the comp
<br />
approach is the classical material implication. A is a cause of B if A is false
<br />
or B is true. From this a pyramid of causality notion can (and must) evolve.
<br />
I'm not sure this can make sense if you have not an idea of the psycho/physics
<br />
comp reversal.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; I have written more in this list than I will ever be able to write in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  a paper. I have begin at least four papers; I don't know if I will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  finish them. &quot;Our field&quot; overlaps too much disciplines. Either the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; papers grow too much, or the paper became relatively incomprehensible.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  Perhaps I should write a book instead. I don't know.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  I must think about that. Advices are welcome.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Sorry, I'm not an academic and have no idea how things work in that world.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Academic are like any human societies. It works like happy families in the
<br />
best cases and like mafia in the worst but fortunately rarer (I hope) cases.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I just want you to write your ideas down in a comprehensive form that I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;can understand.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I guess we are not on the same length wave. It would really help me to write
<br />
that comprehensive form if I knew what is your problem with the uda, unless
<br />
for some reasons you reject the *hypothesis*. I would really
<br />
appreciate if you could tell me at which step of the uda you stop(*).
<br />
The comprehensive paper must begin by the uda, and I don't see what I can
<br />
add.
<br />
The AUDA without an understanding of the UDA is just a formal games.
<br />
I am open to the idea that something is wrong or unclear, or imprecise.
<br />
I mean once you understand the difference between 1-person and 3-person, and
<br />
once you understand the 1-comp indeterminacy, and once you understand that
<br />
if we are machine we cannot be aware of any delays in UD-computations 
<br />
(invariance
<br />
lemma), then it follows(**) that our futures are determined by all computations
<br />
going through and relative to our actual (1-actual) computational states.
<br />
At first it looks like a refutation of comp because empirically we have good
<br />
reasons to believe in negative amplitudes of probability, which intuitively
<br />
does not seem to appear through comp, but then taking into account the
<br />
godelian incompleteness, through  the translation of UDA in the consistent
<br />
machine language shows that the probability matter is more subtle than
<br />
intuition.
<br />
<br />(*) if *anyone* find a flaw or even imprecisions I would be grateful
<br />
letting me know it. (links  <a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m3044.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m3044.html</a> ).
<br />
<br />(**) Easily with some Occam Razor. Less easily without Occam; you need the
<br />
Movie Graph Argument if you don't accept Occam.
