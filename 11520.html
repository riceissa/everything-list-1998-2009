<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Questions of how this may finally be reconciled with 'RITSIAR' (I hope

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you recall what this means) are in abeyance. Nevertheless, some aspect

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of this approach may ultimately be ascribed a status as 'foundational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existent' analogous to that of 'primary matter' in materialism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Alternatively, such a hypothesis may be shown to be redundant or

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; incoherent.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Peter, as we've agreed, materialism is also metaphysics, and as a route
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to 'ultimate reality' via a physics of observables, is vulnerable to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'reification'. Might it not be premature to finalise precisely what it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is that physical theory decribes that might actually be RITSIAR?
</em><br />
<br />The point of the phrase RITSIAR is to leave it deliberately
<br />
unstated what that reality consists of. If Bruno is
<br />
going to come to conclusions about my reality, RITSIAR,
<br />
he must be making *some* sort of ontological assumption,
<br />
even without knowing what specific kind of ontology is involved
<br />
in RITSIAR.
<br />
<br />Matter is a bare substrate with no properties of its own. The question
<br />
may well be asked at this point: what roles does it perform ? Why not
<br />
dispense with matter and just have bundles of properties -- what does
<br />
matter add to a merely abstract set of properties? The answer is that
<br />
not all bundles of posible properties are instantiated, that they
<br />
exist.
<br />
What does it mean to say something exists ? &quot;..exists&quot; is a meaningful
<br />
predicate of concepts rather than things. The thing must exist in some
<br />
sense to be talked about. But if it existed full, a statement like
<br />
&quot;Nessie doesn't exist&quot; would be a contradiction ...it would amount to
<br />
&quot;the existing thing Nessie doesnt exist&quot;. However, if we take that the
<br />
&quot;some sense&quot; in which the subject of an &quot;...exists&quot; predicate exists is
<br />
only initially as a concept, we can then say whether or not the concept
<br />
has something to refer to. Thus &quot;Bigfoot exists&quot; would mean &quot;the
<br />
concept 'Bigfoot' has a referent&quot;.
<br />
<br />What matter adds to a bundle of properties is existence. A non-existent
<br />
bundle of properties is a mere concept, a mere possibility. Thus the
<br />
concept of matter is very much tied to the idea of contingency or
<br />
&quot;somethingism&quot; -- the idea that only certain possible things exist.
<br />
<br />The other issue matter is able to explain as a result of having no
<br />
properties of its own is the issue of change and time. For change to be
<br />
distinguishable from mere succession, it must be change in something.
<br />
It could be a contingent natural law that certain properties never
<br />
change. However, with a propertiless substrate, it becomes a logical
<br />
necessity that the substrate endures through change; since all changes
<br />
are changes in properties, a propertiless substrate cannot itself
<br />
change and must endure through change. In more detail here
<br />
<br /><br />The Case Against Mathematial Monism
<br />
<br />Mathematical monism is both too broad and too narrow.
<br />
<br />Too broad: If I am just a mathematical structure, I should have a much
<br />
wider range of experience than I do. There is a mathemtical structure
<br />
corresponding to myself with all my experiences up to time T. There is
<br />
a vast array of mathematical structures corresponding to other versions
<br />
of me with having a huge range of experiences -- ordinary ones, like
<br />
continuing to type, extraordinary ones like seeing my computer sudenly
<br />
turn into bowl of petunias. All these versions of me share the memories
<br />
of the &quot;me&quot; who is writing this, so they all identify themselves as me.
<br />
Remember, that for mathematical monism it is only necessary that a
<br />
possible experience has a mathematical description. This is known as
<br />
the White Rabbit problem. If we think in terms of multiverse theories,
<br />
we would say that there is one &quot;me&quot; in this universe and other &quot;me's&quot;
<br />
in other universes,a nd they are kept out of contact with each other.
<br />
The question is whether a purely mathematical scheme has enough
<br />
resources to impose isolation or otherwise remove the White Rabbit
<br />
problem.
<br />
<br />Too narrow: there are a number of prima-facie phenomena which a purely
<br />
mathematical approach struggles to deal with.
<br />
<br />* space
<br />
<br />* time
<br />
<br />* consciousness
<br />
<br />* causality
<br />
<br />* necessity/contingency
<br />
<br /><br />Why space ? It is tempting to think that if a number of, or some other
<br />
mathematical entity, occurs in a set with other numbers, that is, as it
<br />
were, a &quot;space&quot; which is disconnected from other sets, so that a set
<br />
forms a natural model of an *isolated* universe withing a multiverse, a
<br />
universe which does not suffer from the White Rabbit problem. However,
<br />
maths per se does not work that way. The number &quot;2&quot; that appears in the
<br />
set of even numbers is exactly the same number &quot;2&quot; that appears in the
<br />
list of numbers less than 10. It does not acquire any further
<br />
characteristics from its context.
<br />
The time issue should be obvious. Mathematics is tradionally held to
<br />
deal with timeless, eternal truths. This is reflected in the metpahor
<br />
of mathematical truth being discovered not found (which, in line with
<br />
my criticism of Platonism, should not be taken to seriously). It could
<br />
be objected that physics can model time mathematically; it can be
<br />
objected right back that it does so by spatialising time, by turning it
<br />
into just another dimension, in which nothing really changes, and
<br />
nothing passes. Some even go so far as to insist that this model is
<br />
what time &quot;really&quot; is, which is surely a case of mistaking the map for
<br />
the territory.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Consciousness is a problem for all forms of materialism and
<br />
physicalism to some extent, but it is possible to discern where the
<br />
problem is particularly acute. There is no great problem with the idea
<br />
that matter considered as a bare substrate can have mental properities.
<br />
Any inability to have mental properties would itself be a property and
<br />
therefore be inconsistent with the bareness of a bare substrate. The
<br />
&quot;subjectivity&quot; of conscious states, often treated as &quot;inherent&quot; boils
<br />
down to a problem of communicating one's qualia -- how one feels, how
<br />
things seem. Thus it is not truly inherent but depends on the means of
<br />
communication being used. Feelings and seemings can be more readily
<br />
communicated in artistic, poetic language, and least readily in
<br />
scientific, technical language. Since the harder, more technical a
<br />
science is, the more mathematical it is, the communication problem is
<br />
at its most acute in a purely mathematical langauge. Thus the problem
<br />
with physicalism is not its posit of matter (as a bare substrate) but
<br />
its other posit, that all properties are physical. Since physics is
<br />
mathematical, that amounts to the claim that all properties are
<br />
mathematical (or at least mathematically describable). In making the
<br />
transition from a physicalist world-view to a mathematical one, the
<br />
concept of a material substrate is abandoned (although it was never a
<br />
problem for consciousness) and mathematical properties become the only
<br />
possible basis for qualia. Qualia have to be reducible to, or
<br />
identifiable with, mathematical properties, if they exist at all. This
<br />
means that the problem for consciousness becomes extreme, since there
<br />
is no longer the possibility of qualia existing in their own right, as
<br />
properties of a material substrate, without supervening on
<br />
mathematically describable properties.
<br />
<br />The interesting thing is that these two problems can be used to solve
<br />
each other to some extent. if we allow extra-mathemtical properties
<br />
into our universe, we can use them to solve the White Rabbit problem.
<br />
There are two ways of doing this: We can claim either:-
<br />
<br />* White Rabbit universes don't exist at all
<br />
<br />* White Rabbit universes are causally separated from us (or remote in
<br />
space)
<br />
<br /><br />The first is basically a reversion to a single-universe theory (1).
<br />
Mathematical monists sometimes complain that they can't see what role
<br />
matter plays. One way of seeing its role is as a solution to the WR
<br />
problem. For the non-Platonist, most mathematical entitites have a
<br />
&quot;merely abstract&quot; existence. Only a subset truly, conceretely, exist.
<br />
There is an extra factor that the priveleged few have. What is it ?
<br />
Materiality. For the physicalist, matter is the token of existence.
<br />
Material things, exist, immaterial ones don't.
<br />
The second moves on from a Mathematical Multiverse to a physical one
<br />
(3). The interesting thing about the second variety of
<br />
non-just-mathematical monism is that as well as addressing the White
<br />
Rabbit problem, it removes some further contingency. If the matter,
<br />
physical laws, and so on, are logically possible, then the general
<br />
approach of arguing for a universe/multiverse on the grounds of
<br />
removing contingency must embrace them -- otherwise it would be a
<br />
contingent fact that the universe/multiverse consists of nothing but
<br />
mathematics.
