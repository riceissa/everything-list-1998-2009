Thanks&nbsp; for the repost. As far as the suicide paradox goes, I'd argue that it's not a paradox. Regardless of how he measures it, if there is a possible alternative, then that alternative exits in a parallel world. The outcome is inconsequential. I see no difference between that and the Schroedinger's Cat example.<BR><BR>----- Original Message ----- <BR>From: "Saibal Mitra" <SMITRA.domain.name.hidden><BR>To: "aet.radal ssg" <AET.RADAL.SSG@POST.COM><BR>Subject: Re: Many Pasts? Not according to QM... <BR>Date: Thu, 26 May 2005 19:02:19 +0200 <BR><BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; The original posting about this dates back from the beginning of <BR>&gt; this list. I just <BR>&gt; invoked this in this thread to argue why one should consider observer moments <BR>&gt; (identical ones considered as the same) as fundamental concepts. <BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; The suicide paradox I was referring to is just Tegmark's thought <BR>&gt; experiment where the <BR>&gt; experimenter measures the spin of a particle. If it is down he is <BR>&gt; instantly killed, he <BR>&gt; survives if it is up. Then he argues that according to the MWI the <BR>&gt; experimenter should <BR>&gt; always measure that the spin is up, because that's the only branch in which he <BR>&gt; survives. <BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; Saibal <BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; Quoting "aet.radal ssg" <AET.RADAL.SSG@POST.COM>: <BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; &gt; For some reason I didn't get the original post about the suicide paradox, <BR>&gt; &gt; so if someone could resend it, sans any "everything" computer lingo, I <BR>&gt; &gt; would appreciate it. <BR>&gt; &gt; The subject of the&nbsp;thread - "Many Pasts? - Not according to QM"&nbsp; taken on <BR>&gt; &gt; its face seems false,&nbsp;at least&nbsp;from the standard MWI model. If you have <BR>&gt; &gt; parallel worlds you have parallel pasts. In fact, that's why MWI is <BR>&gt; &gt; supposed to be the solution to time travel paradoxes. Take an arbitrary <BR>&gt; &gt; moment, when a measurement, or any other trigger, causes a decoherence, <BR>&gt; &gt; move forward in time from that moment and look back - you have parallel <BR>&gt; &gt; pasts that begin from the point of decoherence. ----- Original <BR>&gt; &gt; Message ----- From: "Saibal Mitra" To: everything-list@eskimo.com <BR>&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: Many Pasts? Not according to QM... Date: Wed, 25 May <BR>&gt; &gt; 2005 01:24:23 +0200 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Oorspronkelijk bericht ----- <BR>&gt; &gt; &gt; Van: "Patrick Leahy" &gt; Aan: &gt; Verzonden: Wednesday, May 18, <BR>&gt; &gt; 2005 05:57 PM &gt; Onderwerp: Many Pasts? Not according to QM... &gt; &gt; <BR>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Of course, many of you (maybe all) may be defining pasts from <BR>&gt; &gt; an &gt; &gt; information-theoretic point of view, i.e. by identifying <BR>&gt; &gt; all &gt; &gt; observer-moments in the multiverse which are equivalent <BR>&gt; &gt; as perceived by <BR>&gt; &gt; <BR>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the observer; in which case the above point is quite irrelevant. (But <BR>&gt; &gt; you &gt; &gt; still have to distinguish the different branches to find the total <BR>&gt; &gt; measure &gt; &gt; for each OM). &gt; &gt; This is indeed my position. I <BR>&gt; &gt; prefer to define an observer moment as the &gt; information needed <BR>&gt; &gt; to generate an observer. According to the <BR>&gt; &gt; ''everything'' &gt; hypothesis (I've just seen that you don't <BR>&gt; &gt; subscibe this) an observer <BR>&gt; &gt; moment &gt; defines its own universe. But this universe is very <BR>&gt; &gt; complex and therefore <BR>&gt; &gt; <BR>&gt; &gt; &gt; must have a very low measure. It is thus far more likely that the <BR>&gt; &gt; observer &gt; finds himself embedded in a low complexity universe. &gt; <BR>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One of the arguments in favor of the observer moment picture <BR>&gt; &gt; is that it &gt; solves Tegmark's quantum suicide paradox. If you <BR>&gt; &gt; start with a set of all &gt; possible observer moments on which a <BR>&gt; &gt; measure is defined (which can be &gt; calculated in principle using <BR>&gt; &gt; the laws of physics), then the paradox <BR>&gt; &gt; never &gt; arises. At any moment you can think of yourself as being <BR>&gt; &gt; randomly drawn <BR>&gt; &gt; from &gt; the set of all possible observer moments. The observer <BR>&gt; &gt; moment who has &gt; survived the suicide experiment time after time <BR>&gt; &gt; after time has a very <BR>&gt; &gt; very &gt; very low measure. &gt; &gt; &gt; Even if one assumes only a single <BR>&gt; &gt; universe described by the MWI, one has <BR>&gt; &gt; to &gt; consider simulations of other universes. Virtual observers <BR>&gt; &gt; living in such <BR>&gt; &gt; a &gt; simulated universe will perceive their world as real. The measure of such <BR>&gt; &gt; <BR>&gt; &gt; &gt; embedded universes will probably decay exponentialy with <BR>&gt; &gt; complexity.... &gt; &gt; &gt; Saibal -- <BR>&gt; &gt; ___________________________________________________________ <BR>&gt; &gt; Sign-up for Ads Free at Mail.com <BR>&gt; &gt; <BR>&gt; &gt; http://www.mail.com/?sr=signup <BR>&gt; &gt; <BR>&gt; &gt; <BR>&gt; &gt; <BR>&gt; &gt; <BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; -- <BR>&gt; _____________________________________________________________________ <BR>&gt; Nu 12 maanden gratis Live Eredivisievoetbal bij 20 Mb ADSL voor maar <BR>&gt; EUR 39,95 per maand.
