<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; The universe is not under any obligation to reveal itself to us. All we

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; do is stumble around blindly gathering what data we can and make a best
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; guess as to what's going on.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This is a metaphysical judgment.  There are those who strongly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; disagree on rational grounds.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One of the problems with the verification principle of logical positivism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was that it, itself, cannot be verified by the verification principle, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hence is subject to the charge of being part of the hated metaphysics (and,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I suppose, if it could be verified it would be subject to the charge that it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was a circular argument). But I would get around the problem by stating the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; principles by which science works thus: IF you want to predict the weather,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; build planes that fly, make sick people better THEN you should do such and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such. By putting it in this conditional form there is no metaphysical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; component.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />I think you and/or Bruno talked about this internal conditional
<br />
definition of &quot;morality&quot; before.  But this is just logical inference
<br />
inside a &quot;closed&quot; system of facts.  IF this is true THEN this is
<br />
true.  There are no real normative statements here, and thus no real
<br />
moral meaning.  IF you want to torture babies, THEN you &quot;should&quot; do
<br />
such and such.  This definition of morality does not explain why we
<br />
should want certain things and not others.  This definition does not
<br />
suppport the real noble things of morality such as compassion.  Some
<br />
examples are:
<br />
<br />IF you want to follow the Creator's path when your enemy strikes you
<br />
on the cheek, THEN you should turn the other cheek and pray for him/
<br />
her.
<br />
IF you want to follow the Creator's path when it comes to a choice
<br />
between your benefit and your neighbor's benefit, THEN you act for
<br />
your neighbor's benefit.
<br />
IF you want to follow the Creator's path when it comes to a choice
<br />
between your life and your friend's life, THEN you should give your
<br />
life.
<br />
<br />The thing that is different in this realm of true morality is that the
<br />
Creator is a person that we can get to know (not totally, but in a
<br />
process of growth just like any relationship), so that we aren't just
<br />
cranking out IF/THEN inferences like a machine, but the Holy Spirit
<br />
(analogous to All Soul in Bruno/Plotinus term) affirms with our spirit
<br />
that a certain response or initiative in the current situation is in
<br />
accord with the Creator's personal character.  Thus, there is only so
<br />
much convincing that one can do in a forum like this.  The rest
<br />
requires actually being shown God's love in a tangible way by another
<br />
person.  Then it is still up to each of us to decide how we respond.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Science is just a systematisation of this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; process, with guesses taking the form of models and theories.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; So science is a just systematisation of a metaphysical judgment.  I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; agree.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; However, it's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; all tentative, and the scientific method itself is tentative: tomorrow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; pigs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; might sprout wings and fly, even though this has never happened before.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; would bet that pigs will still be land-bound tomorrow, because there is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; reason to think otherwise, but I have to stop short of absolute
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; certainty. A
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; metaphysical position would be that flying pigs are an absurdity or an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; anathema and therefore pigs absolutely *cannot* fly. But it is arrogant
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; well as wrong to create absolute certainty, absolute meaning, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; absolute
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; anything else by fiat, just because that's what you fancy. If there are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; things we can't know with certainty or can't know at all, that may be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; unfortunate, but it's the way the world is.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Stathis Papaioannou
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Looking over my previous post, I cannot see why you are bringing up
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; absolute certainty.  Also I don't know what &quot;absolute meaning&quot; means,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; unless it means knowing meaning with absolute certainty in which case
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I don't hold that view.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sorry if I have misunderstood, and if I have been unclear or tangential.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Several posts back you spoke of positivism being deficient because &quot;a closed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; system which is supposedly totally explainable will always have at least one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fixed point that is unexplainable&quot;. I read into this an implication that God
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would solve the problem because he could be outside the system, indeed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; outside all possible systems. But this runs into two problems. The first is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that positivists are in fact very modest and make no claim to explain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everything; the very opposite, in fact. The second is that the concept of an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entity outside all possible systems, and therefore requiring no cause,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; design, meaning or any of the other things allegedly necessary for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe and its components constitutes a restatement of the ontological
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argument for the existence of God, an argument that is 900 years old and has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; been rejected as invalid even by most theists.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Stathis Papaioannou
</em><br />
<br />I insist that I am not going down the ontological argument path.  If
<br />
you want to categorize my argument from meaning, perhaps it is closest
<br />
to Kant's argument from morality.  In a scientific system, perhaps
<br />
this is branded as &quot;wishful thinking&quot;, but I am also insisting that
<br />
science's basis (anything's basis actually), such as fundamentality,
<br />
generality, beauty, &quot;introspection&quot; is also mystical wishful thinking,
<br />
and naturality is circular, and reproducibility is circular in that
<br />
its pragmatism begs the question of meaning (IF you want to do this,
<br />
THEN reproducible experiments have shown that you &quot;should&quot; do such and
<br />
such).
