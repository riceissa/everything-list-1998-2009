<br />Hi Levy,
<br />
<br />I hope you have take some rest because this is a long reply :-)
<br />
Still too technical without doubt, but read it carefully: perhaps
<br />
it will help us to make some back and forth between on one hand
<br />
the intuitive and informal (but rigorous with comp) UDA and, on 
<br />
the other hand its formal and counter-intuitive translation in 
<br />
arithmetic through G and G*.
<br />
Sometimes I recall things, not for you, but for others.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Your expose in a &quot;nutshell&quot; is far too technical to convince me... 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;unfortunately I believe I would have to obtain a post grad education
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in logic to appreciate your position as you state it.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Post grad ?  Well, perhaps ...,  these days ...  :-) 
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Yet I believe that what you are saying sounds
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;valid. So even though I would like to give you the prize, I'm 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;afraid, I'm not qualified. 
</em><br />
<br /><br />Damned!     (but I appreciate the honesty).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;However, all is not lost. I believe that your position can be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;stated much more simply without having to review all of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;modern logic theory.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Thanks for that optimistic statement.
<br />
<br />Now, when I eliminate all the &quot;modern logic theory&quot; ..., 
<br />
well, only the UDA remains. 
<br />
The role of &quot;Modern Logic&quot; is just to give tools to tranlate UDA in 
<br />
the language of a sound machine (or arithmetic).
<br />
<br /><br />I recall what's UDA for the (possible) others.
<br />
<br />The UDA (Universal Dovetailer Argument), is a thought experiment showing 
<br />
that the computationalist hypothesis implies a reversal between 
<br />
physics and (machine) psychology. The UD is a program which generates
<br />
and executes all computer programs, and the UDA shows my 
<br />
&quot;immediately next futur&quot; is determined by the set of all my consistent
<br />
extension emulated by the UD (or belonging to UD* as I say sometimes).
<br />
The reversal occurs at both the ontological level and at the 
<br />
epistemological level:
<br />
<br />-Ontologically: UDA shows matter emerges on consciousness (roughly speaking: 
<br />
it is actually the belief in matter which emerges and interferes)
<br />
-Epistemologically: Physics becomes a branch of the psychology of machine
<br />
(with psychology taken in the large sense of science of consciousness, you
<br />
can call that theology if you prefer. For my purpose the (double)
<br />
theory of mind will be given by G and G*, see below).
<br />
A version of the UDA can be found in the archive at
<br />
<a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m1726.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m1726.html</a>
<br />
<br />The UDA illustrates also the incompleteness of Schmidhuberian-like TOE approach,
<br />
and more generally it gives a clue on the extreme non triviality of the mind/body
<br />
problem (even) with the computational hypothesis. (Some materialist
<br />
believes that comp *is* the solution of the mind-body problem, alas for them,
<br />
materialism is not even compatible with mechanism. This can be derived
<br />
from UDA + OCCAM, or directly from the Movie Graph Argument, or from
<br />
Maudlin's paper. Ref in my thesis at <a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal</a>).
<br />
<br />The UDA shows that whatever you do, the next &quot;conscious&quot; event has a 
<br />
probability uniquely determined by the set of all your consistent extensions
<br />
in the UD* (= accessed by the UD). It is a special and precise version 
<br />
of the measure problem recurrently discussed on this list.
<br />
It is apparently not so precise because the &quot;measure&quot; is not 
<br />
defined (through the UDA).
<br />
But the &quot;rigorous&quot; result remains: you don't need to know the measure for
<br />
understanding 1) that comp reduces physics into the *search* of that unique
<br />
measure, and 2) that this search must be made only through the 
<br />
machine's psychology.
<br />
Nevertheless I search to isolate that measure, and I do that by the interview
<br />
of the machine through G (going to the &quot;meta&quot; level as says Georges) and 
<br />
its angel/truth theory (through G*). See below definitions and programs.
<br />
<br />For understanding the UDA (and the reversal psycho/physico), 
<br />
people need only a passive amount of computer science and 
<br />
elementary comp philosophy. The best (IMO) book is, still today, &quot;Mind's I&quot; 
<br />
edited by Hofstadter and Dennett, even if both Dennett and Hofstadter
<br />
seem to close their eyes where I insist maintaining them wide open; 
<br />
in particular both Dennett and Hofstadter fail to see the comp 
<br />
indeterminacy, although they both proposed some versions of the duplication 
<br />
experiment.). 
<br />
I like also to mention Daniel Galouye Sc Fi book &quot;Simulacron 3&quot;, and the
<br />
more recent &quot;permutation city&quot; by Greg Egan.
<br />
Of course UDA stretches a lot such similar thought experiences.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;It may be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that you know too much as one of the famous scientists said when he heard 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the accomplishment of a younger and less experienced colleague (I think it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Wofgang Pauli... &quot;Ach! I know too much!&quot;).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Let's see if we can summarize your position in simple terms.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Mmh ... let us try. But before I would like to say that the modal
<br />
mathematics really simplify the matter because the needed self-reference 
<br />
makes you walk on the counter-intuitive border of consistency. But you
<br />
are surely right in insisting to make things simpler, in some way.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;1) What are the axioms and rules of inference supporting your system. This 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;answer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;should be answerable in a few lines. Please don't mention Kripke, Leibnitz or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;anyone else. Do not give any reference. State your system from the ground up.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I have not really a system. Perhaps a &quot;realm&quot; would be better. A third
<br />
person (minimal) ontology. You know it and we know that it is not what you
<br />
appreciate the more, for it is just numbers. Arithmetical truth, in a large
<br />
sense including computer science, provability logics and other &quot;intensional&quot;
<br />
(modal) variations. Since Godel we know arithmetical truth is not 
<br />
completely axiomatisable. No *complete* TOE for numbers and/of machines.
<br />
<br />Now having just a realm we need a strategy to isolate the measure 
<br />
on &quot;my&quot; relative  consistent extensions appearing in UD*. (That move is
<br />
made obligatory by the UDA).
<br />
<br />My strategy is infinitely naive. I just ask the machine. The sound
<br />
self-referentially correct machines. The Lobian (Loebian) machine as I
<br />
call it in my thesis.
<br />
It is difficult to imagine a more simple minded idea, isn't it?
<br />
<br />I ask her first about her provability ability. Actually this is what 
<br />
*has been done* by Godel, Lob etc. and the 
<br />
whole interview is *completely* captured by the modal theory G. 
<br />
And you get miraculously G*, the guardian angel, a system which 
<br />
proves *all* the *true* sentences about probability (and unprovability, 
<br />
concistency, etc.). G is included in G* of course.
<br />
<br />These two theories are really an embryon (at least) of the self 
<br />
referentially correct machine's laws of mind.
<br />
G and G* are really what I call machine psychology. G is actually 
<br />
machine's machine psychology, explaining what the machine can say about
<br />
her own psychology, and G*  is *all* machine's psychology including
<br />
explanation why the machine remains silent on some question.
<br />
(All, but without quantifying in the scope of the provability predicate,
<br />
but let us not be distracted now by too technical remarks).
<br />
<br />I limit my interview to sound machine talking classical logic and
<br />
sharing my belief in elementary provable number statements (by which
<br />
I mean provable in Peano aritmetic or ZF, etc.).
<br />
Those number truth contains &quot;intensional&quot; one (thanks to Godelian
<br />
like coding, or better thanks to &quot;programming&quot;), containing statements
<br />
like &quot;the machine coded by i will stop on input coded by number j&quot;.
<br />
<br />So &quot;my&quot; system, if you want, are G and G*. But of course they are not 
<br />
my system, but the provably logic machine's systems (also known as
<br />
the logic of self-reference).
<br />
<br />You can translate &quot;G proves []p -&gt; [][]p&quot; by [for all p in the machine
<br />
language, the machine proves &quot;if I can prove p then I can prove that
<br />
I can prove p&quot;], and you can translate &quot;G* proves []p -&gt; [][]p&quot;, by [for 
<br />
all p in the machine language, if the machine can prove p then the
<br />
machine can prove that she can prove p&quot;]. 
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;2) Derive the &quot;Little Abstract Schroedinger Equation&quot; from these axioms. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Again this should be short.(note that I have not said anyting about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;uncertainty yet. This comes below)
</em><br />
<br /><br />You ask it. You get it! But this cannot *not* be technical. And I
<br />
cannot be more short than the proof allows me (why don't you ask
<br />
Andrew Wiles for a shorter proof of Fermat theorem!)
<br />
<br />You ask for the crux of the crux, here it is.
<br />
<br />I recall LASE (the Little Abstract Schroedinger Equation) is:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;p -&gt; []&lt;&gt;p,
<br />
<br />This is because the system B, with the following axioms and inference
<br />
rules:
<br />
<br />AXIOMS [](p -&gt; q) -&gt; ([]p -&gt; []q)     K
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[]p -&gt; p                       T
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;p -&gt; []&lt;&gt;p                     LASE
<br />
<br />RULES  p p -&gt; q                    p    
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-------- Modus Ponens      ---  Necessitation,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;q                       []p
<br />
<br />provide a modal representation of (minimal) Quantum Logic.
<br />
<br /><br />Now &quot;my systems&quot; are G and G*. I recall once more that
<br />
G is a sound and complete
<br />
formalisation of of all modal sentences such that their 
<br />
interpretation (where the atomic sentence are interpreted by
<br />
any sentence in the language of the machine, and &quot;[]p&quot; is
<br />
interpreted by &quot;I prove p&quot;, also in the language of the 
<br />
machine) are *provable by the machine*.  
<br />
G* is a sound and complete formalisation of of all modal 
<br />
sentences such that their interpretation  are *true on the machine* 
<br />
instead of just provable. The soundness of the machine makes G
<br />
include in G*. 
<br />
<br />I recall that a formal presentation of G is:
<br />
<br />AXIOMS    [](p -&gt; q) -&gt; ([]p -&gt; []q)     K
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[]([]p -&gt; p -&gt; []p             L 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
RULES  p p -&gt; q                    p    
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-------- Modus Ponens      ---  Necessitation
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;q                       []p
<br />
<br /><br />and G* is
<br />
<br />AXIOMS    Any theorem of G
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[]p -&gt; p            
<br />
<br />RULES  p p -&gt; q                   
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-------- Modus Ponens   (only! No Necessitation rule!!!)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;q    
<br />
<br />(Plus some &quot;obious but tedious&quot; substitution rules)
<br />
<br />G and G* are really the laws of mind (of the *ideal* machine
<br />
if you want).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
Now remember that my goal is to ask the machine about the 
<br />
measure on its (personal) consistent extensions. In particular
<br />
I define the &quot;measure of p is equal to one&quot; by 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;provable p  and consistent p&quot;    []p &amp; &lt;&gt;p
<br />
<br />A motivation here is giving by the Kripke semantics (if I can
<br />
mention that!). Indeed remember that []p is always true in terminal
<br />
world. A terminal world has no extension at all. For having a 
<br />
measure one on the consistent extension,
<br />
I must explicitely state that consistent extensions exists, that is
<br />
p is sure (measure one) if p is provable (true in all accessible
<br />
extension/world) and consistent (there is at least one accessible
<br />
world). That is I define &quot;m(p) = 1&quot; by [&#x20ac;]p = []p &amp; &lt;&gt;p.
<br />
<br />Now &quot;p&quot; must belong to UD*. It can be shown that it is enough
<br />
to restrict the interpretation of p (in the language of the machine)
<br />
by so called \Sigma_1 sentences (a UD generates sentences equivalent to
<br />
\Sigma_1 sentences, and reciprocaly a generation of all
<br />
\Sigma_1 sentences gives something equivalent to a UD).
<br />
A sigma_1 sentence is a sentence provably equivalent to a sentence
<br />
with the form &quot;It exist a number n such that P(n)&quot; with P 
<br />
algorithmically decidable. You can convince yourself that if such
<br />
a sentence is true then it is provable. Actually the sound machine
<br />
I interview can prove this fact in some sense: the sound machine
<br />
can prove p -&gt; []p for all p which are sigma_1.
<br />
<br /><br />We must prove that G* proves the theorem of B (T and LASE) and 
<br />
are closed for modus ponens. (I loose the necessitation rule,
<br />
and the substitution rule must be weakened).
<br />
<br />You can ask me &quot;why&quot; at any point. Don't hesitate.
<br />
<br />The main point is the proof by G* of LASE. 
<br />
That is when p is \Sigma_1:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;G*  proves   p -&gt; [&#x20ac;]&lt;&#x20ac;&gt;p
<br />
<br />Let us do it in detail (you ask!, and I let you prove that G*
<br />
prove [&#x20ac;]p-&gt;p, the other axiom of B, by yourself. It is really easy).
<br />
<br />Remember that [&#x20ac;]p is []p &amp; &lt;&gt;p
<br />
<br />So &lt;&#x20ac;&gt;p = -[&#x20ac;]-p            (definition of &lt;&#x20ac;&gt; !)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= -([]-p &amp; &lt;&gt;-p) 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= (-[]-p v -&lt;&gt;-p) 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= &lt;&gt;p v []p 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= []p v &lt;&gt;p   (recall -(A &amp; B) = (-A v -B) and other
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;elementary propositional equivalence),
<br />
<br />so [&#x20ac;]&lt;&#x20ac;&gt;p = []&lt;&#x20ac;&gt;p &amp; &lt;&gt;&lt;&#x20ac;&gt;p
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= []([]p v &lt;&gt;p) &amp; &lt;&gt;([]p v &lt;&gt;p)
<br />
<br />So, all what we need to show is that G* proves, for p
<br />
corresponding to the \sigma_1 sentence :
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;p -&gt; []([]p v &lt;&gt;p) &amp; &lt;&gt;([]p v &lt;&gt;p)
<br />
<br />Now if G* proves p -&gt; A and if G* proves p -&gt; B, then G*
<br />
proves p -&gt; (A &amp; B), so it is enough to prove:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that 1) G* proves  p -&gt; []([]p v &lt;&gt;p), and 2) G* proves
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;p -&gt; &lt;&gt;([]p v &lt;&gt;p). And this for p \Sigma_1 sentences.
<br />
<br />Modally &quot;\Sigma_1-ness&quot; can be shown to be characterised
<br />
by the modal sentence &quot;p -&gt; []p&quot;.(Visser's result). You see
<br />
that the true \Sigma_1 sentence are verifiable (if they are true
<br />
they are provable, they are necessarily accessible by the UD).
<br />
<br />Let us prove 1).
<br />
<br />a) G proves p -&gt; []p         (p \Sigma_1)
<br />
b) G proves p -&gt; ([]p v &lt;&gt;p) (elementary propositional calculus)
<br />
c) G proves []p -&gt; []([]p v &lt;&gt;p)
<br />
<br />This is because if G proves A-&gt;B, then G proves []A -&gt; []B
<br />
(indeed if G proves A-&gt;B, then G proves [](A-&gt;B) by the 
<br />
necessitation rule, but G proves [](A-&gt;B) -&gt; ([]A -&gt; []B) 
<br />
because it is an instance of the K axiom, so by modus ponens
<br />
G proves []A -&gt; []B. We say that G is a regular logic.
<br />
A regular logic is any logic which proves []A -&gt; []B when it
<br />
proves A -&gt; B.
<br />
<br />d) G proves p -&gt; []([]p v &lt;&gt;p)  by a) and c).
<br />
e) G* proves p -&gt; []([]p v &lt;&gt;p) because G is included in G*.
<br />
<br />1) is proved. I have begin with G (and not G*) because G* is
<br />
not a regular logic! G* prove t -&gt; &lt;&gt;t, but G* does not prove
<br />
that []t -&gt; []&lt;&gt;t (t = TRUE, easy exercice once you get familiar
<br />
with G).
<br />
<br />Let us prove 2). It works even on non \Sigma_1 propositions.
<br />
<br />a) G* proves []p -&gt; p (axiom of G*)
<br />
b) G* proves -p -&gt; -[]p (elementary propositional calculus)
<br />
c) G* proves --p -&gt; -[]-p (subst -p for p)
<br />
d) G* proves p -&gt; &lt;&gt;p    (from c, cf. p &lt;-&gt; --p, &lt;&gt;p = -[]-p)
<br />
e) G* proves p -&gt; ([]p v &lt;&gt;p) (elem. prop. calc.)
<br />
f) G* proves ([]p v &lt;&gt;p) -&gt; &lt;&gt;([]p v &lt;&gt;p) (subst ([]p v &lt;&gt;p)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for p in d).
<br />
g) G* proves p -&gt; &lt;&gt;([]p v &lt;&gt;p)  by e) and f).
<br />
<br />2) is proved. And so LASE is proved. The machine's guardian
<br />
angel tell us that the &quot;measure one on the consistent 
<br />
extensions&quot; obeys some sort of quantum logic.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;3) How does consciousness - i.e., first person point of view - 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;come about from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the axioms and rules of inference. Why is this set of axioms unique in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;allowing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consciousness to arise?
</em><br />
<br />It depends how you define consciousness in the language of the 
<br />
machine, of course. Once you find such definition you can interrogate
<br />
G and G* by yourself! Note that G and G* are really unique as far as
<br />
you interview sound machines &quot;believing&quot; (proving, communicating)
<br />
enough elementary arithmetical truth.
<br />
<br />A brouwerian sort of &quot;animal&quot; consciousness seems to be captured by 
<br />
t v &lt;&gt;t, which is just &lt;o&gt;t in the first variant of the bew box [].
<br />
(cf [o]p = []p &amp; p, so &lt;o&gt;p = t v &lt;&gt;t, just use again that 
<br />
&lt;o&gt; is -[o]-.
<br />
This gives the S4Grz logic with its asymmetrical bifurking temporal
<br />
description of evolving knowledge states. It is a &quot;plenitude&quot; in the
<br />
sense that G* does not add a thing to G. From the point of view of that
<br />
first person subject provability *is* equal to truth.
<br />
<br />But immediate perception is given by the []p &amp; &lt;&gt;p variant of the box.
<br />
With p sigma_1 that gives our LASE, classifying our possible 
<br />
*verifiable* experiences.
<br />
<br />I mention the subtle mariage of symmetry and antisymmetry provided
<br />
by []p &amp; &lt;&gt;p &amp; p for the &quot;true&quot; immediate experiences. This makes
<br />
possible to distinguish (astonishingly enough) phantom pains from
<br />
&quot;referentially correct pains! It proves also LASE. It seems that
<br />
the quanta is not a long way from the qualia!
<br />
<br />If you add to the machine some self-anticipating ability, you get
<br />
an evolving machine able to speed-up itself by &quot;building their own
<br />
consistent extensions&quot; (The speed-up is a consequence of some other
<br />
result by Godel). It can be shown that such machine is always risking
<br />
loosing consistency in the process by anticipating to much.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;4) How does the world come about from the existence of consciousness and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;axioms
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and rules of inference. How does third person point of view arise?
</em><br />
<br /><br />If we are machine (comp) we will never know if there is a world or any
<br />
consistent extensions. That would be akin to []&lt;&gt;t (a falsity G* says).
<br />
<br />Appearances, and even solid and stable, and locally true, appearances
<br />
of (many) worlds is explained by the measure on the consistent extensions.
<br />
<br />Third person arises when the machines smell (infere) Plato Heaven. 
<br />
Plato heaven, of course, does not arise. (By which I mean that the truth
<br />
of arithmetical sentences like &quot;2+2=4&quot;, &quot;8 divides n -&gt; 4 divides n&quot; or
<br />
Fermat, Goldbach, etc.&quot; are independent of myself and yourself (with
<br />
my respect).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;5) How does LASE introduce uncertainty, superposition, and the violation of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Bell's inequality, in the perception of the world by consciousness. Give an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;example as a thought experiment involving consciousness and world as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;described above.
</em><br />
<br />Important questions, no doubt. Difficult one I'm afraid. You enter the
<br />
territory of the open problems ...
<br />
<br />Well, going from LASE to uncertainty is not obvious at all , even for &quot;real&quot;
<br />
quantum logician. And it is not easier for our arithmetical quantum
<br />
logic. It is a good research project! Nevertheless the compatibility of
<br />
observable admit plenty quantum logical definition and are easy to translate
<br />
in the modal system. So that part is less difficult (except you must find
<br />
the right representation).
<br />
<br />For the same reason, superposition are more easily handled, by translating 
<br />
the quantum logical disjunction modally:
<br />
A + B can be translated (thanks to the link between the modal B system and 
<br />
quantum logic) by [&#x20ac;]&lt;&#x20ac;&gt;([&#x20ac;]&lt;&#x20ac;&gt;A v [&#x20ac;]&lt;&#x20ac;&gt;B).
<br />
<br />Bell's inequality: here is a (purely arithmetical) version of it,  
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[&#x20ac;]&lt;&#x20ac;&gt;A &amp; [&#x20ac;]&lt;&#x20ac;&gt;B -&gt; [&#x20ac;]&lt;&#x20ac;&gt;(([&#x20ac;]&lt;&#x20ac;&gt;A &amp; [&#x20ac;]&lt;&#x20ac;&gt;C) v 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;([&#x20ac;]&lt;&#x20ac;&gt;B &amp; [&#x20ac;]-[&#x20ac;]&lt;&#x20ac;&gt;C)).
<br />
<br />Note it is a purely arithmetical sentence because the arithmetical
<br />
interpretation of [&#x20ac;]p is Bew('p') &amp; Con ('p')  ;Con ('p') = -Bew('-p')
<br />
where bew and con has been arithmetized (like Godel did) and 'p' is for
<br />
a godel number (of p).
<br />
<br />I programmed a computer (some years ago) to prove it or refute it, but it
<br />
is intractable by brute programming ... (so it is an open problem).
<br />
<br />You asked a thought experiment involving consciousness and world as 
<br />
described above?  That question is a little fuzzy for me. Is not UDA enough?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;6) Is it possible to write a computer program to illustrate all of this?
</em><br />
<br />A program now! What an exam! I thought you want me not being too 
<br />
technical.
<br />
But y're the master. You ask, I give :-)
<br />
Below is a program for G, G*, S4Grz, and Z and Z* (Z are the KD logics
<br />
coming with the []p &amp; &lt;&gt;p variant, but without the restriction to the
<br />
sigma_1 sentences). IL is for intuitionistic logic. gip, g*ip, ilip
<br />
are G, G*, IL, working on infix presentation of formula.
<br />
So (g '(-&gt;(bw p) (bw (bw p))) gives the same answer as 
<br />
(gip '(bw p -&gt; bw bw p)).  []p is represented by (bw p).
<br />
(g A) gives NIL if the formula A is a theorem of g, meaning the list of 
<br />
counterexample is empty, otherwise it gives Kripke models invalidating the
<br />
formula A. Just read those heavy answers as &quot;not a theorem&quot;. But if you
<br />
want to read the Kripke models just note that &quot;F\#&quot; represente the node
<br />
of the tree of the accessibility relation on worlds, and that the 
<br />
worlds are represented by lists with the relevant sentences.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;This is your end-of-school-year final exam. No cheating allowed. There is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;no time limit and it is open book. Take your time.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Thanks for the open book. The program below is indeed just a translation
<br />
(I made in the eighties) in LISP, of the chapter 8 of Boolos 1979.
<br />
<br />If I don't succed my end-of-school-year final exam, I hope there is
<br />
an another chance in september!
<br />
<br />In any case thanks for your persevering attention, Mister G.
<br />
Levy (my mother's name BTW).
