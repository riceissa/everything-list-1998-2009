<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think the only way you can do that is with &quot;David&quot; instead of &quot;Bruno&quot;.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It seems to me that when you accept an 'indexical 1st person Bruno&quot; you

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are accepting something far more complex than the notion of six being a

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perfect number.
</em><br />
<br />Of course, you're right. So, to correct myself:
<br />
<br />I can give 'meaning' to an 'indexical 1st-person David' instantiating
<br />
the *idea* of 'a perfect number', because its 'indexical existence' is
<br />
part of this 'David'.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Because I need, if only to communicate, a simple &quot;ontological&quot; reality,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and numbers (natural numbers) can be proved to be essential in the sense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that it is impossible to get them without postulating them.
</em><br />
<br />Not hesitating, then, to press you again:
<br />
<br />But don't we just 'derive' natural numbers by establishing a semantic
<br />
equivalence between '6' and the collection of faces on a cube? And
<br />
their additive and multiplicative structures likewise by analogy and
<br />
generalisation? Must it not be the case that all we can know of the
<br />
number realm is in practice wholly instantiated in indexical
<br />
1st-persons as information, and that ideas about its further extent,
<br />
while possibly justified as theory, are not, empirically, instantiated
<br />
*anywhere* to our knowledge? As far as I can see, the only alternative
<br />
to this is the belief that we have 'direct contact' with this realm, as
<br />
Penrose claims, which is surely equivalent to claiming knowledge of God
<br />
by 'direct revelation'. In this case we're merely substituting 'numbers
<br />
made us', for 'God made us'. While any such belief may be *true*, it
<br />
isn't logical or necessary truth. So what precisely is 'essential'
<br />
about the number realm, in the sense of making it the basis of
<br />
'indexical David' - whom I claim and assert to be necessarily real?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course, we have access to numbers only via our first person view. But this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fact does not logically entails that numbers themselves are a necessarily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; personal or an indexical construction per se.
</em><br />
<br />Despite your claim that they are the basis both of the personal and
<br />
indexical? I ask you again, for them to play such a profound role, what
<br />
status, beyond that of an idealised notion, are you giving them?
<br />
<br />Having remonstrated with you thus, might I suggest that I could
<br />
understand your meaning better thus:
<br />
<br />&quot;Let's proceed *as if* the number realm were the sole 'primitive', and
<br />
everything else we observe could be derived from it. If we succeed in
<br />
this venture, we will have gained much in the way of insight. No doubt,
<br />
there will still remain further questions as to the nature and true
<br />
origins of the 'reality' so conjured into existence, possibly
<br />
unanswerable. But since the question - why am I in this situation at
<br />
all in which I am able to be surprised that I am in this situation at
<br />
all? - regresses inevitably to a point beyond reason, perhaps it
<br />
doesn't put us in a worse position in this regard than any other
<br />
assumption.&quot;
<br />
<br />Does this work for you?
<br />
<br />David

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; important in the sense that if I die, a perfect number will still

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; either exist or not exist. I do interpret Penrose's mathematical

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; platonism in that way, and I agree with him (on that), like I think

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; david Deutsch and other physicists (but not all!).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; This should suits &quot;centrality of first person notion&quot;, but with comp,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; as I try to explain, even that first person will emerge from more

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; primitive non personal notion (like numbers ...), and this

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; independently of the fact you like to recall and with which I agree

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; which is that I have only access to a personal view on numbers.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I feel I must press you on this.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Please, don't hesitate.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I think using 'exists' in this sense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is playing with words. I'm asking that whatever you posit as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; fundamental (even when it's in the spirit of seeing where it leads -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; which of course I respect and support) you are prepared to defend as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'real' in as strong a sense as 'indexical 1st person' (i.e. our sole
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; experiential/ existential point of departure). This IMO is crucial.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Without this sense, I genuinely can't see what 'a perfect number will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; either exist or not exist' can possibly *mean* - i.e. do any conceptual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; or other kind of work. What is 'meaning' but a metaphorisation,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; analogising, or mapping of some observation in terms of another? e.g.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; '5' is the 'cardinality' of the fingers of my hand. And the 'arena' in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; which this 'meaning' is instantiated is always the 'indexical 1st
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; person'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; So, I can give 'meaning' to an 'indexical 1st-person Bruno'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; instantiating the *idea* of 'a perfect number', because its 'indexical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; existence' is part of this 'Bruno'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think the only way you can do that is with &quot;David&quot; instead of &quot;Bruno&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It seems to me that when you accept an 'indexical 1st person Bruno&quot; you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are accepting something far more complex than the notion of six being a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perfect number.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But the only way I could assign an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; analogous existence to 'a perfect number' by itself, in the absence of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; this instantiation, is to assign 'indexical existence' to the number
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; realm itself. This realm is then your posited 'medium of instantiation'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (or 'fundamental reality') But isn't this '1st-person primacy'? Or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; maybe it's just 'indexical primacy'.  Either way it's OK by me, but why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; not you?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Because I need, if only to communicate, a simple &quot;ontological&quot; reality,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and numbers (natural numbers) can be proved to be essential in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense that it is impossible to get them without postulating them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Remember that I do postulate the comp hyp. I am willing to assign
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness to some computation (and then I show the inverse map
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cannot be one-one: to any consciousness I am forced to assign an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; infinity of computations). Although I agree that the first person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; notions are central, they are not primary. 1-notions emerge from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relations between numbers (where numbers are always conceived together
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with their additive and multiplicative structures). The computations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are relatively embedded in that arithmetical reality. Of course, we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have access to numbers only via our first person view. But this fact

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does not logically entails that numbers themselves are a necessarily
