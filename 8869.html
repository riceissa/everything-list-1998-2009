<br /><br />This looks like an encouraging statement :-)

<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The problem isn't with the name of his theory, or with any problem

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with Bruno per se beyond

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this:  There doesn't seem to be an easily reducible way to summarize  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the theory in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; manner that is digestible to anyone beyond the highly specialized in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; similar fields. 
</em><br />
<br /><br />I doubt this. I would even say that highly specialized people have more  
<br />
difficulties due to the lack of a panoramic view of the subject, and  
<br />
the lack of knowledge in the adjacent fields. Logicians doesn't really  
<br />
know the conceptual problem of QM. And Physicist rarely know what a  
<br />
formal system is all about. Both are unaware of the mind-body problem,  
<br />
etc.
<br />
Probably popularization is technically more easy (but professionally  
<br />
more dangerous).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;My theory&quot;, in a first approximation, is just &quot;Mechanism&quot;, the  
<br />
doctrine that we are machine, in the sense that we cannot see any  
<br />
difference once we are substituted at some level of description of  
<br />
ourselves. That &quot;theory&quot; already appears in some ancient Indian and  
<br />
chinese texts, and is often attributed to Descartes.
<br />
Somehow &quot;my theory&quot; is already popularized in many science-fiction  
<br />
books and essays. Dennet and Hofstadter are quite close in the book  
<br />
&quot;Mind's I&quot;, which I recommend. They didn't see the first person comp  
<br />
indeterminacy though. And, given that Hofstadter wrote an impressive  
<br />
book on Godel's theorem, where he criticizes correctly the use of  
<br />
Godel's incompleteness against mechanism, I thought awhile that it was  
<br />
not even necessary I wrote my work. Almost like Judson Web, Hofstadter  
<br />
sees that Godel's theorem could be a good news for Mechanism/Comp. My  
<br />
work preceded those books for ten years, but has been trapped in a sort  
<br />
of typically european bureaucratic nightmare which will make me  
<br />
abandoning research for a while.
<br />
Have you read the &quot;Mind's I&quot; book? I think you could follow the UDA  
<br />
argument easily if you have done that. The argument requires only some  
<br />
passive understanding of what a digital universal machine (computer)  
<br />
is.
<br />
I keep saying I have no theory. I have just a theorem or an argument  
<br />
(informal and (hopefully) rigorous) according to which, if we take the  
<br />
comp hyp. seriously enough then eventually physics should be  
<br />
retrievable from [computer science + the amount of &quot;theological faith&quot;  
<br />
needed for saying &quot;yes&quot; purposefully to the doctor].
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I certainly understand the basics of some of his ideas,
</em><br />
<br /><br />If you understand the UDA, you get the point .... If not, you can  
<br />
always ask questions or make critics.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; but when it gets into all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; his logical analysis I just have never found myself willing to devote  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; myself to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time required to really get into the detail of where he is coming  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from. 
</em><br />
<br /><br />... because the logical analysis does not add anything. The UDA  shows  
<br />
that comp entails that necessarily physics is a branch of computer  
<br />
science (in a large sense).
<br />
The &quot;logical analysis&quot; is the beginning of an *actual* derivation of  
<br />
physics from computer science. This *illustrates*  how such a  
<br />
derivation, which is made necessary by UDA, can *actually* be  
<br />
undertaken. The logical analysis also shows the relative consistency of  
<br />
the enterprise. Would Godel's theorem be false, i.e. would truth be  
<br />
equal to provability, all &quot;hypostases&quot; would collapse into classical  
<br />
logic. Thanks to Godel's theorem, they are all different.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would consider myself highly interested in these topics and at least  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reasonably intelligent.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Do you have the little book by Smullyan &quot;Forever Undecided&quot;?  It is a  
<br />
very cute introduction to the logic G. Once you understand what is G,  
<br />
you can understand all the other arithmetical hypostases (effective and  
<br />
non effective person points of view, Theaetetical variants, see below).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Even something as mundane as the MWI (to this group at least) runs  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; into a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brickwall when presented to the layperson.  You should see the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conversations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have with my wife.  Tell people everything is made of strings.  Or  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; space and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time can be warped and curved.  They may not understand the science and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; math behind it at all, but at least you are speaking their language. 
</em><br />
<br /><br />I think you have too much imagination which make you think my work is  
<br />
technically difficult. It isn't. In Brussels my work has been  
<br />
criticized has being too much easy. Argument of the type: &quot;my two years  
<br />
old niece can do that!&quot; (*).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  The world is not ready for his ideas. 
</em><br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;From -500 to +500, the world has been ready for quite similar Platonist  
<br />
Questioning, I tend to think now. And actually Plotinus seem to have  
<br />
got the main points with almost all details (without comp!). After:   
<br />
just 1000 years of a sort of obscurity with respect to the fundamental  
<br />
questioning, and so much religious or ideological brainwashing that in  
<br />
some countries we can even no more suggest any idea capable of  
<br />
questioning materialism. At least it *looks* like that.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Even for the most part the world of scientists in my opinion. 
</em><br />
<br /><br />Perhaps. You should wait I submit a publication, though. All the papers  
<br />
I have published so far has been ordered, and I try to get some more  
<br />
technical confirmation, or infirmation perhaps, to submit a completed  
<br />
version of my thesis. It could still take times(**), especially now  
<br />
that I realize that it could be difficult just to find the accurate  
<br />
journal ... I will send papers to the ArX.org  soon or later. I am not  
<br />
entirely satisfied by my presentations.
<br />
<br />Bruno
<br />
<br />(*) To be fair, those critics were coming from people defending some  
<br />
political version of materialism which I have never find very  
<br />
convincing. Those people are very powerful in France and Belgium, which  
<br />
explains a bit of my academical isolation. Let me give you pieces of  
<br />
evidences once and for all so that I will not need to bother the list  
<br />
with that &quot;little history&quot;. For example, in 1998,  I got a price in  
<br />
France celebrating annually the five best PhD theses in the french  
<br />
speaking world. See
<br />
<a href="http://www.lemonde.fr/mde/prix/janv99.html">http://www.lemonde.fr/mde/prix/janv99.html</a>
<br />
The price consisted in part in the publication of the thesis, and  
<br />
indeed in 2000, the publishing of the book has been publicly announced:  
<br />
see the picture:

<br />

<br />
Now all the books on that document have been published, but not mine,  
<br />
and without any explanations. Worse, they will eventually suppress me  
<br />
from the list of the winner... See:
<br />

<br />
We are still living in an Orwelian sort of world. In west europa,  
<br />
apparently,  we don't have a solid Berlin Wall to make it fall ...
<br />
Now, in France, an ex-minister of education has written a book entitled  
<br />
&quot;The defeat of Plato&quot;, and I guess I have also underestimated the  
<br />
ambient AntiPlatonism. But I don't care. If needed I will come back  
<br />
next Millenium ;-)
<br />
<br /><br />(**). Let me confide a more happy and recent event, to finish on a more  
<br />
optimistic mode.  And let me take this as an opportunity to make a sort  
<br />
of Plotinian summary of &quot;my thesis&quot;.
<br />
As you know the UDA (Universal Dovetailer Argument) is a sequence of  
<br />
thought experiments showing, from the comp assumption, that physics  
<br />
should be ultimately derivable by some sort of measure on all  
<br />
computational histories which exists beyond time and space in  
<br />
(arithmetical) Platonia. Then, I interview a sufficiently rich (with  
<br />
respect to provability) introspective universal machine about that  
<br />
&quot;measure&quot;. This consists in presenting the UDA to the machine. The main  
<br />
difficulties consists in defining what is an &quot;history&quot;. It cannot be a  
<br />
mere computation: it must be a computation as seen from some first  
<br />
person, or first person plural, perspective, like in the UD Argument.
<br />
Now, it is natural to modelize the first person by the &quot;knower&quot;. It is  
<br />
the one who feels incorrigibly the sensations she is living. The  
<br />
simplest way to transform a mere opinion into knowledge has already  
<br />
been proposed by Plato in his Theaetetus: it consist in defining it by  
<br />
True Opinion, where the opinion is presented in company of a  
<br />
justification or proof. Such an opinion can be modelized by the  
<br />
provability predicate of Godel, hereby written B. So Bp is an  
<br />
abbreviation of &quot;p is provable by a (fixed) machine&quot;. We suppose the  
<br />
machine is sound, so Bp -&gt; p, by definition. But (and this is the  
<br />
solution of the problem I gave to Tom) although it is true that Bp  
<br />
implies p, it is just an easy consequence of Godel's theorem that the  
<br />
sound machine is not able to prove that truth. So although the  
<br />
Theaetetical trick of defining the knowledge of the proposition p by Bp  
<br />
&amp; p, looks irrelevant (because Bp is really equivalent to Bp &amp; p), it  
<br />
is not because that truth is not provable by the machine, and so, it  
<br />
will define indeed a natural candidate for a, possibly rough, notion of  
<br />
knowledge. And the same applies for the notion of  
<br />
provability-and-consistency: Bp &amp; Dp, and even for the notion of  
<br />
true-provability-and-consistency: Bp &amp; Dp &amp; p.
<br />
Now provability-and-consistency is needed to define a notion of  
<br />
&quot;probability one&quot; on the possible extensions of the machine, as the UDA  
<br />
suggests, and should indeed give the logic of probability one on the  
<br />
computational histories, at least in the comp situation where &quot;p&quot; will  
<br />
corresponds to states accessible by the Universal Dovetailer.
<br />
So we get 8 hypostases (viewed as generalization of the notion of  
<br />
person point of view, so as to include the truth represented by p). The  
<br />
primary one:
<br />
<br />p  (truth, the one)
<br />
Bp  (intellect, third person)
<br />
Bp &amp; p (soul, first person)
<br />
<br />and the secondary one:
<br />
<br />Bp &amp; Dp   (intelligible matter, observation, first person plural)
<br />
Bp &amp; Dp &amp; p  (sensible matter, where &quot;objective reality not only kicks  
<br />
back but can even hurt).
<br />
<br />Why 8 ?   It looks like 5, isn't it? No. Because the machine which  
<br />
introspect herself will soon discover its own Godel's theorem: &quot;if I  
<br />
cannot prove the falsity then I cannot prove that fact, that I cannot  
<br />
prove a falsity&quot;, i.e. ~Bf -&gt; ~B(~Bf). Or Dt -&gt; ~BDt. So the machine is  
<br />
able to discover the gigantic gap between the divine (Unameable) Truth,  
<br />
and its terrestrial effective provability ability. So the second  
<br />
hypostase divides itself in a terrestrial part: the terrestrial  
<br />
intellect, and a divine part, the divine intellect.
<br />
Solovay's theorem states that the terrestrial intellect is described by  
<br />
the logic G, and that the divine intellect is described by the logic  
<br />
G*. By a kind of miracle, the soul does not divide. It is the only  
<br />
hypostase which is both terrestrial and divine, in some sense. The  
<br />
price is high: she cannot indentify herself to any machine or even  
<br />
angels, or anything third person describable.The two secondary  
<br />
hypostases does divide themselves in terrestrial and divine part. This  
<br />
will help to modelize the difference between Qualia and Quanta.
<br />
To test that theory, we need to compare the logic of Matter with the  
<br />
empirical logic of Matter (quantum logic).
<br />
Well, for this we need to find axiomatizations of the secondary  
<br />
hypostases (terrestrial and divine).
<br />
... and I have been stuck somehow on that problem since my PhD thesis.  
<br />
Still, in it, I have been able to already got &quot;quantum&quot; theorems  
<br />
(called LASE in the list) and even theorem prover for those logics (but  
<br />
they are intractable).
<br />
<br />The happy event is that I got last week the visit of a little genius in  
<br />
logic who *did* solve the axiomatization problem for the the two logics  
<br />
of sensible matter (terrestrial and divine). Actually, in my term, he  
<br />
found a cute sort of &quot;modal Fourier transform&quot; between the intellect  
<br />
(described by G) and the intelligible matter (described by Z in the  
<br />
Lille Thesis). Actually I strike my head on the wall, 'cause  
<br />
technically this &quot;fourier transform&quot; was right in front of my eyes, but  
<br />
I did not seen it until he shows it to me in a two pages mathematical  
<br />
poem, which I intend to put on my web pages). So G thinks &quot;particles&quot;  
<br />
and Z thinks already &quot;waves&quot;, if we granted that LASE is indeed a  
<br />
symptom of the presence of a purely arithmetical quantum logic (which  
<br />
can be defended formally, accepting some modal interpretation of  
<br />
(quantum) probabilities in the literature (Barnaba, Goldblatt, Dalla  
<br />
Chiaria). From that Fourier transform he succeds to define easily G in  
<br />
Z, from which axiomatizations follow). He did not find a comparable  
<br />
inversible transformation for the &quot;sensible matter&quot;, though ...
<br />
I am still a long way to complete the derivation of the comp-(or  
<br />
weaker) physics, so as to test it from empiry, but a genuine step has  
<br />
been done last week, thanks to him.
<br />
<br />(I will answer Ben tomorrow).
