<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Let me add to this previous post the following,  which is relevant in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;context
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the MWI.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Any object can be viewed from the first person or from the third person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;perspective. Let me explain.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If the object does not exert any contingency on the existence of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observer, then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the first and third person perspectives coincide.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If the object does have a contingency on the existence of the observer, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;then the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;first and third person perspectives diverge. For example, let's say that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the object
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is a randomly detonated  bomb. If the bomb is located under your seat, then 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a contingency on your continued existence and therefore your observation 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;will be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;first person: you will not see the bomb explode. If on the other hand, the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;bomb is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;located far away, then your observation will be third person and you might 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;see it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;explode.
</em><br />
<br />But you're assuming that continuity of consciousness is real--in other 
<br />
words, you're assuming that the &quot;I&quot; who makes an observation while the bomb 
<br />
is still ticking can later observe it going off or failing to do so.  Some 
<br />
people believe in the reality of the first-person view, but only from the 
<br />
perspective of moments; each experience is what it is, and doesn't &quot;become&quot; 
<br />
anything else.  From this perspective all you can say is that there are no 
<br />
experiences of brains that were destroyed by the bomb, but that doesn't 
<br />
imply any sort of &quot;quantum immortality&quot;--you can't say that you're 
<br />
guaranteed to see the bomb failing to explode, because *you* won't see 
<br />
anything other than what you're seeing right now.
<br />
<br />And even if you do assume that consciousness really &quot;flows&quot; in some sense, 
<br />
quantum immortality is not guaranteed--it's still possible that the flow can 
<br />
simply end at some point.  So just because you can never experience a 
<br />
timeline where the bomb kills you, that doesn't mean you *will* experience a 
<br />
timeline where it fails to kill you.  Your experience may just terminate.
<br />
<br />But if continuity of consciousness is real, there are good reasons to 
<br />
believe in quantum immortality.  Consider a replicator that creates a 
<br />
perfect copy of you.  If the subsequent lives of the &quot;original&quot; and the 
<br />
&quot;copy&quot; are completely symmetrical, it's reasonable to guess that 
<br />
you-before-replication have a 50% chance of becoming the original and a 50% 
<br />
chance of becoming the copy.
<br />
<br />Now consider an experiment where you step into the scanning chamber, but the 
<br />
replicator malfunctions and reproduces a copy of a pattern stored in 
<br />
memory--a completely different person.  We don't know how continuity of 
<br />
consciousness would work exactly, but it's pretty reasonable to conclude 
<br />
that the chances of becoming the person in the replication chamber are tiny 
<br />
(although perhaps not zero--consider a continuum of cases where the 
<br />
replicator creates more and more imperfect copies of you).  So the intuition 
<br />
is that in a reasonable theory of consciousness, your chances of &quot;becoming&quot; 
<br />
some future brainstate or another would be weighted somehow by their 
<br />
similarity with your current brainstate.
<br />
<br />Well, now consider a trial where the replicator creates a copy that is 
<br />
physically similar to you, but with all the synapses absent so there is no 
<br />
coherent activity in the brain.  Would there be any more chance of 
<br />
&quot;becoming&quot; that being than there was of becoming a totally different brain?  
<br />
Probably not--perhaps even less.  Finally, consider a limit case where the 
<br />
replicator simply fails to reproduce anything.  It's doubtful that in this 
<br />
case your experience would try to &quot;flow into&quot; a replication chamber where no 
<br />
brain activity existed, and would thus &quot;die.&quot;  But these last two cases are 
<br />
basically similar to &quot;death&quot; in the MWI.  So I think it's quite plausible 
<br />
that if continuity of consciousness is real, quantum immortality is true.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Following this reasonning we could surmise that even some of the natural 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;laws
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;themselves as well as the absence of white rabbits could be first person 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;effects.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Any violation to those laws and the appearance of white rabbits would imply 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;immediate disappearance of the observer. For example any change to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;charge/mass
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of electrons would be &quot;global&quot; and result in the immediate destruction of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;as we know it. Therefore the stability of the electron could be a first 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;effect.
</em><br />
<br />I think that's unlikely.  The anthropic principle won't work any harder than 
<br />
it needs to--if the stability of the electron was just a first-person 
<br />
effect, we would probably see the electron's charge/mass fluctuating within 
<br />
a certain &quot;life-preserving&quot; range.  And if universes with different laws of 
<br />
physics exist, observers would probably be more likely to find themselves in 
<br />
universes in which their existence was less &quot;lucky&quot; (although we don't know 
<br />
what the a priori &quot;probability&quot; of different sets of laws would be).
