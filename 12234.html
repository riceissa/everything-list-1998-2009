<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I know it seems a little bit paradoxical, but then it is my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; methodology
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to take seriously the interview of the lobian machine, which is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;famous&quot; for its many paradoxical thoughts.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It is certainly not a reductio against comp, given that we are not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; arriving at a genuine contradiction. It just happens that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;goodness&quot; is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; as unnameable as truth.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Now, concerning this paradox, it seems to me intuitively
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; comprehensible. If someone saves me from some horrible pain, then 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is (arguably) good; but if he does that in the *name* of &quot;good&quot;, I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; understand that this naming depreciates its action. Even if 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; personally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I am still benefiting from that situation, the naming could make me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; uneasy, and who knows what will be done under that or any name.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; A little uneasiness about what someone might do in the future is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; hardly enough to transform a good act into a bad one.  It seems you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; are saying that if the good samaritan claimed to have performed his 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; kind act *for any reason whatsoever* it would become a bad act.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; That sounds like a reductio to me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Not at all. It becomes bad when he refers or &quot;justify&quot; his act in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; *name* of any &quot;unnameable virtue&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's not clear what &quot;bad&quot; refers to in the above.  It seems as though 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you are asserting an absolute standard of &quot;bad&quot; while claiming there 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can be no absolute standard of &quot;good&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />Not really. Someone acting in the name of &quot;truth&quot;, &quot;good&quot; etc. are 
<br />
&quot;bad&quot;. But someone acting in the name of &quot;bad&quot; are bad too. Note that I 
<br />
am considering an ideal situation, and I am lifting provable relations 
<br />
between ideal machines and the notion of truth by appeal to the 
<br />
platonist relastionship between &quot;truth&quot; and &quot;good&quot; (and &quot;beauty&quot;, ...). 
<br />
None of those sentences should be taken literally or what I am saying 
<br />
would be self-defeating. Moral things have to be understood by oneself 
<br />
or taught by examples ... Perhaps this is a place to invoke the &quot;second 
<br />
person&quot; point of view, which refers to intimate relations between a 
<br />
little number of individuals who can communicate and share first person 
<br />
point of view (but here too normative suggestions can destroy couples 
<br />
and families) in a non public way, and thus can say more without 
<br />
falling in the trap of making things normative.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; My personal judgment of good or bad would not be so clear cut.  If 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; someone does me an act of kindness I consider that good.  If he refers 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it to some &quot;unameable virtue&quot;, e.g. he says he did it in the name of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; God or Capitalism, then I may consider it a little less good - but not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bad.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Locally. Of course I agree. Now with ideal machines there is a sense to 
<br />
say that even good things when made in the name of &quot;goods&quot; (or worse: 
<br />
imposed in the name of &quot;good&quot;) could lead to the bad, for those 
<br />
machines, in the long run.  I do think that western &quot;religion&quot; have 
<br />
repeated that &quot;error&quot;, and this would explain why it is difficult to 
<br />
come back to the questioning which was at the roots of those 
<br />
&quot;religion&quot;.
<br />
As animals, humans, like wolves, have developed efficient, but 
<br />
&quot;lobian-ethically-wrong&quot; recipe of life, of the kind &quot;the boss is 
<br />
right&quot; ...
<br />
My approach of &quot;moral&quot; here is before all theoretical. The funny 
<br />
godel-lobian &quot;paradox&quot; here is that lobian morality is quasi 
<br />
self-defeating. Summed up and simplified, it like if the wise lobian 
<br />
machine told us &quot;Here is a good suggestion: never listen to any &quot;good&quot; 
<br />
suggestion&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It is hard to define those unnanmeable virtue except that &quot;true&quot; is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; already one of those and &quot;good&quot;, &quot;just&quot; etc. are obvious derivative 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of &quot;true&quot;.  But I must say that I am talking about some ideal case, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and I can imagine context where nuance should be added. You can, for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; example, give a vaccine to a child. The child is unhappy about that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; because the vaccine has some distasteful taste or because he is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; afraid of needles, and you can make short your justification by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; saying &quot;it is for your own good&quot;. Here you don't act in the name of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; good, you just sum up a long explanation based on the idea that a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; disease is not good for your child. Well even here the complete 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; explanation is better in the case the child has no idea of any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; relationship between the vaccine and the disease.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But even the most complete possible explanation must end at some point 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with something that is explicitly or implicitly good.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I totally agree with you. I think the basic biological rule has been 
<br />
that if Animal A eats Animal B, in *general* this is good for A and bad 
<br />
for B. At the level of species this is probably already false (most 
<br />
animals with predators needs their predators in the long run for reason 
<br />
of ecological equilibrium and/or &quot;natural eugenism&quot;). We would not be 
<br />
here in case drinking water would have been very painful.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I think we agree that this good, in the explanation, must be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something the child accepts as a personal good.
</em><br />
<br /><br />For human-goodness, sure. The question &quot;are human good&quot; is not a 
<br />
question human can really asked. It is something a Platonist can hope 
<br />
for,  although strictly speaking we can just hope to be lesser bad. 
<br />
Believing in the good, without naming or institutionalizing it, can be 
<br />
inspiring and can make us optimistic and help us going toward it. Many 
<br />
suffering in Europa (still today) can be related to the cynical and 
<br />
fatalist view of many people, making them incapable to thrust 
<br />
themselves (even economically). This could work as self-prophecy.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Even if it is presented as good for society, the child may accept that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because of feelings of empathy for others.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK. Note that such an &quot;empathy&quot; is hard wired in our biological 
<br />
constitution. Many mammals seems to have it at some degree. Some form 
<br />
of autism are described by pathological loss of that empathy. Perhaps 
<br />
Stathis could say more.
<br />
Note that with comp we could try a definition of good and bad parents 
<br />
(!) and even of extremely bad parents. It is simple (if not trivial): 
<br />
the two extremes of bad parents are those who either always say &quot;yes&quot; 
<br />
to their children, or always say &quot;no&quot; to their children. Good parents 
<br />
gives the right amount of balance of yes or no. Extremely bad parents 
<br />
gives also a right amount, but purposefully in the wrong way (this is 
<br />
fortunately rare and belongs to perversity or harassment kind of 
<br />
behavior: children suffer a lot and generally get mad in those case).
