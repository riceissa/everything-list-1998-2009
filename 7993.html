<br />
May I just make some comments on one particular claim in Russell's 
<br />
Theory of Nothing:
<br />
&quot;Self-awareness is a necessary feature of consciousness&quot;
<br />
This would be extremely important if true; but there are problems....
<br />
<br />1. Each night we go psychotic in our dreams. Rare lucid dreams aside, 
<br />
the reason we don't realise we are only dreaming is precisely because 
<br />
of our absence of self-awareness or critical self-insight. The 
<br />
relevant module of the brain has effectively shut down. Yet it would 
<br />
be misleading to call dreams &quot;non-conscious&quot;? Some dreams e.g. 
<br />
nightmares, can be intense and frightening while they last.
<br />
<br />2. More seriously, the idea that self-awareness is a necessary 
<br />
feature of consciousness has profound implications for the moral 
<br />
status of babies, the severely mentally handicapped - and most 
<br />
non-human animals. Clearly, they don't have a sophisticated sense of 
<br />
self. Arguably they lack all self-awareness. But surely, if they have 
<br />
nociceptors and a central nervous system, then they do feel pain - 
<br />
sometimes intensely?
<br />
<br />Tellingly, perhaps, our most intense experiences - e.g. extreme 
<br />
agony, orgasm, blind panic, etc -  are marked by an absence of 
<br />
self-consciousness. Conversely, some of our most sophisticated forms 
<br />
of self-awareness have a very subtle phenomenology indeed [e.g 
<br />
examples so called &quot;higher-order intentionality&quot; -  I think that she 
<br />
hopes that he believes that I want...etc etc]
<br />
Generalizing to other creatures with central nervous systems, one may 
<br />
be sceptical that whales, say, are very intelligent. They may or may 
<br />
not possess rudimentary self-awareness. But it's at least possible 
<br />
that they experience pain more intensely than we do - their &quot;pain 
<br />
centers&quot; are larger for a start.
<br />
Self-awareness may be intimately linked to intelligence; but it's not 
<br />
clear (to me at least) that consciousness per se is linked to 
<br />
intelligence at all.
<br />
<br />3. Also, I think it may be premature (re Russell's comment in ToN on 
<br />
Susan Greenfield) to say that the notion of levels of consciousness 
<br />
is devoid of meaning.
<br />
Yes, there is an absolute &quot;binary&quot; distinction between consciousness 
<br />
and non-consciousness.
<br />
But this absolute distinction doesn't entail that the idea of degrees 
<br />
of consciousness itself is meaningless. Thus pain can be mild, 
<br />
moderate or intense. One can be dimly self-aware or acutely 
<br />
self-aware. And  there are even cases of awareness even while under 
<br />
surgical general anesthesia - though fortunately they are quite rare.
<br />
[etc]
<br />
<br />Apologies if I've misunderstood the argument here.
<br />
Dave
