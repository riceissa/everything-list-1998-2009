<br />
It's an interesting question as to how far we can comfortably or
<br />
meaningfully take counterfactuals.  At some level it is completely
<br />
mundane to say things like, if I had taken a different route to work
<br />
today, I wouldn't have gotten caught in that traffic jam.  We aren't
<br />
thrown into a maelstrom of existential confusion as we struggle to
<br />
understand what it could mean to have different memories than those
<br />
we do.  How could I have not gotten into that traffic jam?  What would
<br />
happen to those memories?  Would I still be the same person?  We deal
<br />
with these kinds of counterfactuals all the time.  They are one of our
<br />
main tools for understanding the world and learning which strategies
<br />
work and which don't.
<br />
<br />Then there are much more extreme counterfactuals.  Apple Computer head
<br />
Steve Jobs gave a pretty good graduation speech at Stanford last week,
<br />
<a href="http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/jobs-061505.html">http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/jobs-061505.html</a>.
<br />
He explains that he was adopted, and his life was changed in a major
<br />
way by the circumstances.  His biological mother, an unwed grad student,
<br />
wanted him raised by college graduates, so he was set to be adopted by
<br />
a lawyer and his wife.  At the last minute the lawyer decided he wanted
<br />
a girl, so Jobs ended up being given to a blue collar couple, neither of
<br />
whom had gone to college.  They were good parents and treated him well,
<br />
sacrificing so he could go to college, but after six months Jobs dropped
<br />
out, seeing little value to consuming his family's entire savings.
<br />
He continued to attend classes on the sly, got into computers and the
<br />
rest is history.
<br />
<br />But imagine how different his life would have been if the original
<br />
plan had gone through and he had been adopted by a successful lawyer,
<br />
perhaps raised in an upper class household with his every wish met.
<br />
He would have gone to an Ivy League college and probably done well.
<br />
But it would have been a totally different life path.
<br />
<br />Does it make sense for Jobs to say, who would I have been if that had
<br />
happened?  Or would he have been such a totally different person that
<br />
this stretches the idea of a counterfactual beyond reason?  I think his
<br />
telling the story demonstrates that he does think this way sometimes.
<br />
Yet none of the memories or experiences that he has would have been
<br />
present in this other version.  At most the two versions might have shared
<br />
some personality traits, but even those are often strongly influenced
<br />
by upbringing - his tenacity in the face of adversity, for example,
<br />
might never have become so strong in a life where everything came easily.
<br />
Probably there are many people in the world who are at least as similar
<br />
to Steve Jobs in personality as the person he would have been if his
<br />
early life had gone that other way.
<br />
<br />The point is that we can imagine a range of counterfactuals where the
<br />
difference is a matter of degree, not kind, from trivial matters all
<br />
the way up to situations where we would have to consider ourselves a
<br />
different person.  There is no bright line to draw that I can see.
<br />
<br />So yes, if you can imagine what it would have been like to eat something
<br />
else for breakfast, then you should be able to imagine what it would have
<br />
been like to be born as someone else.  It's the same basic technique,
<br />
just applied to a greater degree.
