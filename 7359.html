</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; pay a good fraction of my net worth for this opportunity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;Why?  Why would I do it?  Because logic grabs me by the throat and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;*forces* me to   :-)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; What is the logic here exactly, though? From a third person point of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;view,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; why is it objectively &quot;better&quot; to have a lot of copies of you having
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; identical good experiences than it is to have only a single copy have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; same good experience?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;First, I think that it's important to remove the qualifier &quot;identical&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;here. Would two copies cease to be identical if one atom were out of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;place?
</em><br />
<br />I meant something more like &quot;running the same program&quot;--I was thinking in 
<br />
terms of minds running on computers, since that's the only way to insure all 
<br />
the copies run in lockstep. If you're talking about ordinary physical 
<br />
copies, the butterfly effect probably insures their behavior and experiences 
<br />
will diverge in a noticeable macroscopic way fairly quickly.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Hardly.  On another tack, you are the same person, etc., that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you were five minutes ago where strict identicalness isn't even close.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From a third-person POV, why am I the same person? If you don't believe 
</em><br />
there's an objective truth about continuity of identity, isn't it just a 
<br />
sort of aesthetic call?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Second, suppose that someone loves you, and wants the best for you.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;There are a number of ways to describe this, but the infinite level
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;one universe is a good one. The person who loves you (and so has such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a true 3rd person point of view) sees you die here on Earth, and is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sad for you. Yet she understands totally that you are still alive in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;many, many places 10^10^29 from here. Her most logical retort is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you should be alive *here* too; that an extra Jesse here is simply
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;good for Jesse, no matter what is going on far away.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If she finds out that although dead on Earth, you've been copied into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a body out near Pluto, (and have the same quality of life there), she's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;once again happy for you.
</em><br />
<br />That's a pretty unhuman kind of &quot;love&quot; though--if a person I know dies, I'm 
<br />
sad because I'll never get to interact with them again, the fact that 
<br />
versions of them may continue to exist in totally unreachable parallel 
<br />
universes isn't much comfort. Obviously my sadness is not because the death 
<br />
of the copy here means that there are only 10^10^29 - 1 copies of that 
<br />
person rather than 10^10^29 copies.
<br />
<br />By the same token, the relief I'd feel knowing that there's a backup copy 
<br />
who's living on Pluto has to do with the fact that the potential for meeting 
<br />
and interacting now exists again, that all the information in my friend's 
<br />
brain hasn't been lost to me forever. But if I find out that there are *two* 
<br />
backup copies running in lockstep on Pluto, that doesn't make me any happier 
<br />
than I was before, in fact I wouldn't feel a twinge of sadness if one of the 
<br />
copies was deleted to save room on the Plutonian hard drive.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; After all, if they lied to you and never made any copies at all,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; no version of you would ever know the difference.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Well, lots of things can go better or worse for me without me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;being informed of the difference. Someone might perpetrate a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;scam on me, for example, that cheated me of some money I'd
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;otherwise get, and it is still bad for me even if I don't know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;about it.
</em><br />
<br />OK, in that case there are distinct potential experiences you might have had 
<br />
that you now won't get to have. But in the case of a large number of copies 
<br />
running in lockstep, there are no distinct experiences the copies will have 
<br />
that a single copy wouldn't have.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Also, wouldn't the same logic tell you that if we lived in a utopian 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;society
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; where pretty much everyone was happy, it would be immoral to use birth
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; control because we want to make the number of people having happy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; experiences as high as possible?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Yes, exactly.  Each time we can rescue someone from non-existence,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;we should (given that other things are equal).
</em><br />
<br />But if there's already at least one instantiation of a particular program, 
<br />
should we count additional instantiations as distinct &quot;someones&quot;? Aren't 
<br />
they just multiple copies of the same &quot;someone&quot;, so as long as there's at 
<br />
least one copy, that &quot;someone&quot; exists?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; That doesn't seem like a position that anyone who rejects first-person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; thinking would automatically accept.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;They may not. But the two great moral revolutions/revelations of my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;life--- (i) cryonics  (ii) the Hedonistic Imperative (www.hedweb.com)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;--- lay down that life is better than death, and pleasure is better
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;than pain.
</em><br />
<br />But neither of these necessarily justify the idea that redundant copies of 
<br />
the same programs are better than single copies of it.
<br />
<br />The real problem here is that when we talk about what's &quot;better&quot; from a 
<br />
first-person POV, we just mean what *I* would prefer to experience happening 
<br />
to me; but if you want to only think in terms of a universal objective 
<br />
third-person POV, then you must define &quot;better&quot; in terms of some universal 
<br />
objective moral system, and there doesn't seem to be any &quot;objective&quot; way to 
<br />
decide questions like whether multiple copies of the same happy A.I. are 
<br />
better than single copies.
