I'm not a physicist, so I'm asking a question.  How much of this &quot;we 
<br />
have no information loss in this universe&quot; prinicple are we simply 
<br />
assuming at the outset?  I know that a lot of it is unverified theory, 
<br />
like in the case of Stephen Hawking's black hole vs. no black hole from 
<br />
infinity argument, etc.  For instance, are we simply assuming, by the 
<br />
sacred laws of thermodynamics, that in the quantum background there is 
<br />
always an antiparticle for each particle in order to annihilate each 
<br />
other?  Or could it be that particles and antiparticles appear and 
<br />
disappear asymmetrically on their own, under our observational radar, 
<br />
even though that wouldn't be elegant?  Perhaps all these undetectable 
<br />
asymmetries add up to cancel out any observable asymmetries.  Weirder 
<br />
things have happened in quantum physics.  Are we assuming by elegance 
<br />
that there is no information loss?  You can just tell me to go back to 
<br />
my math if you want.

<br />Yes, in principle you could observe such a thing. But it may be that 
<br />
generic
<br />
models exhibiting information loss look like model that don't have
<br />
information loss to internal observers. 't Hooft's deterministic models 
<br />
are
<br />
an example of this.
<br />
<br />I'm also skeptical about observers being able to make more efficient
<br />
machines. The problem with that, as I see it (I haven't read Lloyd's 
<br />
book
<br />
yet) is as follows.
<br />
<br />Consider first a model without information loss, like our own universe. 
<br />
What
<br />
is preventing us from converting heat into work with 100% efficiency is 
<br />
lack
<br />
of information. If we had access to all the information that is present 
<br />
then
<br />
you could make an effective Maxwell's Daemon.
<br />
<br />Lacking such information, Maxwell's Deamon has to make measurements, 
<br />
which
<br />
it has to act on. But eventually it has to clear it's memory, and that 
<br />
makes
<br />
it ineffective.
<br />
<br />To get rid of this problem Maxwell's Daemon would have to be able to 
<br />
reset
<br />
its memory without changing the state of the rest of the universe. This
<br />
could possibly be done in an universe with information loss, but that 
<br />
could
<br />
only work if the Daemon has control over the information loss process. 
<br />
If
<br />
information loss interferes with the actions of the Daemon, then it 
<br />
isn't
<br />
much use.
<br />
<br />You could also think of the possiblity of some ''physical process'' 
<br />
which
<br />
would be sort of a ''passive Maxwell's Deamon'' that could reduce the
<br />
entropy in such universe. Using that you could create a temperature
<br />
difference between two objects. To extract work you now need to let heat
<br />
flow between the two objects. So, at that stage you need an entropy to
<br />
increase again.
<br />
<br />So, to me this doesn't seem to be a generic world in which you have
<br />
information loss, rather a world in which it is preserved but where it 
<br />
can
<br />
be overruled at will. The benefits come from that magical power.
