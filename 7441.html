<br />It's interesting that during an operation, while the patient is well and 
<br />
truly unconscious, the same physiological response to a painful stimulus is 
<br />
seen as in an awake person: when the surgeon makes the first incision, heart 
<br />
rate and blood pressure immediately rise. If you give the patient more 
<br />
opioid analgesic (like morphine or fentanyl), this response is attenuated - 
<br />
again, just as in an awake patient with pain who is given opiods. Another 
<br />
strategy is to use local anaesthetic in conjunction with the general 
<br />
anaesthetic, so that the part of the body the surgeon is working on is numb. 
<br />
It sounds silly: why would you want to make it numb when the patient is 
<br />
unconscious? The reason is, as you suggest, because of the associated 
<br />
physiological response to painful stimuli which is present even when there 
<br />
is (presumably!) no conscious experience of pain.
<br />
<br />Returning to the topic of torture with memory loss, consider the most 
<br />
extreme case. You are to be tortured for the rest of your life. When you get 
<br />
really old you will become demented, or, if you escape that fate, you will 
<br />
have a stroke or a myocardial infarct which will result in brain damage and 
<br />
complete loss of memory and other cognitive facilities, just before you die 
<br />
or end up a vegetable. Therefore, anyone who is tortured will eventually 
<br />
have their memory of the experience completely erased, and it should be OK 
<br />
to torture people.
