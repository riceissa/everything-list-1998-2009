<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It's an interesting question as to how far we can comfortably

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;or meaningfully take counterfactuals.  At some level it is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;completely mundane to say things like, if I had taken a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;different route to work today, I wouldn't have gotten caught 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in that traffic jam.  We aren't thrown into a maelstrom of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;existential confusion as we struggle to understand what it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;could mean to have different memories than those we do.  How 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;could I have not gotten into that traffic jam?  What would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;happen to those memories?  Would I still be the same person?  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;We deal with these kinds of counterfactuals all the time.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;They are one of our main tools for understanding the world and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;learning which strategies work and which don't.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Then there are much more extreme counterfactuals.  Apple 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Computer head Steve Jobs gave a pretty good graduation speech 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;at Stanford last week, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;<a href="http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/jobs-061505.html">http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/jobs-061505.html</a>.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;He explains that he was adopted, and his life was changed in a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;major way by the circumstances.  His biological mother, an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;unwed grad student, wanted him raised by college graduates, so 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;he was set to be adopted by a lawyer and his wife.  At the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;last minute the lawyer decided he wanted a girl, so Jobs ended 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;up being given to a blue collar couple, neither of whom had 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;gone to college.  They were good parents and treated him well, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sacrificing so he could go to college, but after six months 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Jobs dropped out, seeing little value to consuming his 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;family's entire savings.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;He continued to attend classes on the sly, got into computers 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and the rest is history.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But imagine how different his life would have been if the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;original plan had gone through and he had been adopted by a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;successful lawyer, perhaps raised in an upper class household 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with his every wish met.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;He would have gone to an Ivy League college and probably done well.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But it would have been a totally different life path.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Does it make sense for Jobs to say, who would I have been if 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that had happened?  Or would he have been such a totally 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;different person that this stretches the idea of a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;counterfactual beyond reason?  I think his telling the story 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;demonstrates that he does think this way sometimes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Yet none of the memories or experiences that he has would have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;been present in this other version.  At most the two versions 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;might have shared some personality traits, but even those are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;often strongly influenced by upbringing - his tenacity in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;face of adversity, for example, might never have become so 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;strong in a life where everything came easily.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Probably there are many people in the world who are at least 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;as similar to Steve Jobs in personality as the person he would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have been if his early life had gone that other way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The point is that we can imagine a range of counterfactuals 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;where the difference is a matter of degree, not kind, from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;trivial matters all the way up to situations where we would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have to consider ourselves a different person.  There is no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;bright line to draw that I can see.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So yes, if you can imagine what it would have been like to eat 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;something else for breakfast, then you should be able to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;imagine what it would have been like to be born as someone 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;else.  It's the same basic technique, just applied to a greater degree.
</em><br />
<br />Those are counterfactuals regarding personal circumstance, and do not seem
<br />
particularly controversial, even admitting that it is not straightforward to
<br />
define a single theory of personal identity that &quot;covers all the bases&quot;.
<br />
There's a continuous, definable identity that follows a
<br />
physical/causal/genetic/mental chain all the way from when egg and sperm met
<br />
up to Jobs' graduation. It does not seem problematic to alter contingent
<br />
aspects of this identity-chain and yet insist that we retain the &quot;same&quot;
<br />
Jobs.
<br />
<br />It is a great deal harder to see how to make sense of a counterfactual such
<br />
as &quot;Who would I be if my mother and father hadn't had sex?&quot;, or &quot;who would I
<br />
be if they'd had sex a day later and a different egg and sperm had met?&quot;. 
<br />
<br />I have to disagree with you here, and state that this sort of counterfactual
<br />
seems to indeed embody a difference of kind, not just degree. We're not
<br />
talking about &quot;imagining_whats_it_likeness&quot;. We are talking about me *being*
<br />
someone different.
