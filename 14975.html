<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;a material computation? What does matter add?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I would think something has to *perform* the computation. For
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; example, how can a computer program be executed without hardware?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A computer program can be defined mathematically. And, like number (or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tuple of numbers) can be associated with position in physics, computer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; program can be associated with number in computer science. Roughly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; speaking by their encodings.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A computer program execution can be defined mathematically too. Like a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sequence of numbers, or a function, can be associated to movement in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics, a computer execution can be defined by a sequence of numbers,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or an equivalence relation on the set of such sequences.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;Have you a problem with the physicist notion of block universe, where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;time does not &quot;really&quot; exist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; No.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is helpful. Now it is &quot;just a bit of technic&quot; to realize that a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tiny part of arithmetic encodes all by itself a &quot;block-mind&quot;, once you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assume the computationalist hypothesis. All the stopping and non
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stopping program executions are encoded in the arithmetical truth. So
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we can define an inside point of view by the relative execution of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; programs existing in arithmetic. It gives a multilayered complex
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not attibuting mind to the entities appearing there, which look like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you and me here and now, makes such complex structure full of zombies.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A priori there will be too much executions (the white rabbits).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps even so much that the comp hyp would lead to a contradiction.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Empirically, quantum mechanics entails also a class of quantum white
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rabbits or some quantum Harry Potter histories, but quantum mechanics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does provide an explanation why those (quantum) rabbits are relatively
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very rare.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; We don't need real space or time, because these are only abstract
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; notions specifying the relation between physical/material objects.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But the objects themselves are real, have to be real. For if they are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; not real, then we are left with nothing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think we are left with numbers' dreams. Third person realness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *feelings* develops from or in bunches of very long histories, which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are relatively so numerous and entangled that we can share them. No
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doubt we share a very long (cosmic) history. But, assuming the comp
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hyp, we have no ways to distinguish &quot;real&quot; from &quot;virtual&quot;, nor
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;virtual&quot; from arithmetical. We cannot know if we are in a block-mind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or a block-universe. (But they cannot both be computable)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The fact that we cannot make such a distinction is the result of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;movie-graph&quot; argument. Latter Tim Maudlin has found independently an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argument which shows basically the same thing, and put a serious doubt
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the identity thesis in the computationalist philosophy of mind.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Note that the identity thesis is already in difficult position in most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Everett-like interpretation&quot; of QM.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; According to<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy</a>) :
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;In &lt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy</a>&gt;philosophy, mechanism is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;a theory that all natural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;phenomena can be explained by physical causes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To be short I will say Wikipedia is wrong: the idea that all natural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; phenomena can be explained by physical laws is physicalism (or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; materialism, or naturalism. Not mechanism).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mechanism is an assumption in the philosophy of mind, or in cognitive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; science. It is the assumption that &quot;I&quot; am a machine. And digital
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mechanism (in the weak sense I am most of the time using)  is that my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness is &quot;Turing emulable&quot;. It means that my consciousness can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be processed through a computer program execution.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For the reason above, the computer execution does not have to be real
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or virtual. It can be purely arithmetical. From the point of view of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the program which is executed, there is no possible difference.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Actually the program is &quot;statically&quot; executed almost everywhere in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; block-mind structure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am aware that mechanism is the usual theory of mind of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; naturalist/physicalist. And indeed physicalism implies reasonably
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mechanism (unless you believe in the wave packet reduction or some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other &quot;collective hallucinations&quot; (Feynman). This explains probably
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the confusion between mechanism and physicalism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But you better should not confuse them, because *digital* mechanism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entails the falsity of physicalism. Or equivalently, physicalism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entails the falsity of digital mechanism, or equivalently digital
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mechanism and physicalism are incompatible. By logic alone &quot;I&quot; or &quot;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe&quot; cannot be completely described in term of a digital machine.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This shows also that physicalism cannot really entails digital
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mechanism, without being inconsistent.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am not pretending at all that this is completely obvious. It *is* a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bit work demanding of course.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; So mechanism implies physical causes, which implies material. And yet
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; you deny material. So it doesn't seem comp is a form of mechanism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK, but digital mechanism implies only arithmetical causes (like 4
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; divides n implies that 2 divides n).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Physical causes emerge in the mind of the arithmetical observers, in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some sense.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This emergence is not a purely statistical emergence, but a mixture of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; statistical emergence (due to the first person (plural) indeterminacy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bearing on the universal dovetailing or on any block-mind structure),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and of an emergence from that &quot;block-mind structure&quot; which is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constrained non trivially by computer science. See below for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mandelbrot Set videos. They are probable block-mind structure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   Everett Deutch Zurek explanation of bit (mind) from qubit (matter)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; remains correct, but if we take mechanism seriously enough we can see
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that such an explanation has a reverse, i.e. an explanation of qubit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (matter) from bit (mind). But the reverse makes the explanation richer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by &quot;explaining&quot; consciousness, &quot;free-will&quot;, &quot;infinities&quot; ... and this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by the fact, that computer science can explain how and why universal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine can be &quot;aware&quot; of the presence of something they cannot be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entirely aware of, and other things of that kind. This has been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; already well understood mathematically by Emil Post, Gödel at the very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; beginning (but he will forget later) and Judson Webb.  Thist is missed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by Lucas and Penrose, for example. Universal Machine can prove their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; own incompleteness theorem. When consistent, it is easy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (computationally) for them to infer correctly their intrinsical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ignorance, indeterminacy, etc. For them universe(s) are first of all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; big unknown thing(s).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is an important FOR topics, imo, if a bit critical certainly, in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the sense that it shows that David has not pushed the Turing thread as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; far as taking the comp hyp seriously *enough*. No physicists does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that, actually, but David is the closer, well, after J.A. Wheeler.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Digitalism provides also an explanation why, if we look at ourselves
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; close enough, we should have indirect evidence of many computations/
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; histories/worlds. Indeed, up to now, the comp hyp is still a priory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; too much many-wordly. But QM fits better than Newton in that regard.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Digital Mechanism could be wrong, of course, but the &quot;easy white
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rabbit refutation&quot; is blocked by the non triviality of mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computer science. It is a priori too much many-wordly, but no more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; easily prove to be so.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *I* could be wrong too, of course. That why I have submit this work as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a thesis, or as papers, and although there are few people courageous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; enough to study such an extreme interdisciplinary subject, (which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; traverses cognitive science/philosophy of mind, physics, computer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; science, mathematical logic), those who have done so either get the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point, or get the idea that it could be interesting to find precisely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where an error could be.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As a possible help for having some idea or image of the &quot;block-mind&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or Universal Deployment, and its non triviality, you could perhaps
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; take a look on the Mandelbrot Set.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Penrose has conjectured that the Mandelbrot set in undecidable (in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense close to Turing), and this has been proved by Blum, Smale and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Shub. Well, much before Penrose I have made a stronger assumption
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which is that the Mandelbrot set is &quot;creative&quot; in the sense of Post.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That means mainly &quot;Turing-Universal&quot;. I am still conjecturing this.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If that is true, the Mandelbrot set would give a compact and connexe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; plane representation of the &quot;block-mind&quot;, or of the Universal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Deployment.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So you could contemplate those beautiful movies below, bearing in mind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they give only a third person view of the block-mind.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Unlike the Universe of Sets, or even the possible physical universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (in most current theories), the block-mind *does* contain itself or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; versions of itself, indeed with all possible variations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You will see that this is indeed the case for the Mandelbrot Set.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Indeed, the Mandelbrot Set contains itself everywhere. Note that each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the following are generated by a very simple program (mainly an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interation of z := z^2 + C, for each C in the complex plane and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deciding if it goes to infinity or not) + zooming on the result. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; border of the set is infinitely intricate and &quot;complex&quot; (sorry for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pun). The color measures the quickness of the way you go to infinity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in that iteration, and it measures in that way how close you are to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Mandelbrot set.

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; as counting numbers to, say, the law of Gravity? Or a molecule? Your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; theory seems rather abstract, and it would be more helpful if your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; explanations were more specific. And how does the mere existence of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; numbers create reality? If I write 1, 2, 3, 4 etc. on a piece of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; paper, surely that doesn't create a reality? Again I come back the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; the issue, there must be some kind of hardware, matter, physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; stuff, some sort of stuff, which actually *runs* the processes which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; are hapening in reality?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I too would love to hear an answer to this. Of course I believe we are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; dealing with numbers so large that they couldn't even be written
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; down - even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a formula to generate them couldn't be, in fact. Perhaps those sorts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; numbers look like reality when seen from inside...?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would say it is more due to the fact that little numbers can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generate complex gigantic realities.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The big numbers are more in the generation steps than in the original
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seed. Stable realities should be filtered from inside.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Digitalness prevents the need of time, the digital notion of step (a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cousin of the function n+1) is enough.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is also more in the many relations between numbers than in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; numbers themselves.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; See my hopefully not too much lengthy answer to Henry. It is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; delicate point.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In the premisses I am using platonism, not Platonism. In the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; platonism (with a little &quot;p&quot;) is just that we accept the principle of

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Here's the error: substitutible doesn't mean substituted,

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Once comp is assumed, it can be shown that &quot;substituted&quot; means

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;substitutible from inside&quot;. Like &quot;real&quot; means &quot;possible from inside&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Like &quot;now&quot; means &quot;sometime from inside&quot;.  It is an indexical and

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relative notion. I don't say that this is obviously so. It come from

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the fact, that, as I said to Henry, machine cannot distinguish &quot;real&quot;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from &quot;virtual&quot;, from &quot;arithmetical&quot;. See my url for detailed
