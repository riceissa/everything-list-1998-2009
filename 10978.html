I shall quickly try to explain in a bit more detail my idea for what
<br />
Qualia (phenomal accepts of conscious experiences) are again  - Because
<br />
it's clear that no-one yet understands what I was going on about in
<br />
my last post ;)
<br />
<br />The important point is that you first accept the existence of some sort
<br />
of real 'abstract space' where 'abstract entities' reside.
<br />
This idea goes all the way back to Plato and his 'world of forms'
<br />
of course, but many are unaware that there is actually quite strong
<br />
justification from physics for thinking that some sort of 'abstract
<br />
space of mathematical forms' exists.  I recommend Julian Barbour's
<br />
'The End of Time' for good arguments, especially chapter 14.
<br />
Here's an extract from that chapter:
<br />
<br />'...The new arena that Schrodinger introduced is something similar, a
<br />
configuration space....The most important thing about Schrodinger's
<br />
wave mechanics is that it is formulated not in space and time, but in a
<br />
suitably chosen 'configuration space' and time....  (For example-
<br />
for a system of three particles)....each possible arrangement of three
<br />
particles is a triangle and corresponds to a *single point* in (the
<br />
abstract configuration space of this system).  Many people are unaware
<br />
that the wave function is defined on configuration space.  That is
<br />
where (the quantum wave function) lives...Contrary to the impression
<br />
given in many books, quantum mechanics is not about particles in space:
<br />
it is about systems being in configurations - at 'points' in a
<br />
configuration space.  That is something quite different from individual
<br />
probabilities for individual particles being at different points of
<br />
ordinary space.  Each 'point' (in configuration space) is a whole
<br />
configuration (of a system).'
<br />
<br />So QM actually provides strong evidence for thinking that some sort of
<br />
'abstract space of mathematical forms' exists.   If you accept that
<br />
the QM wave function is something 'real', then the point that
<br />
Barbour is making is that the wave function can't exist in ordinary
<br />
space... it has to exist in an *abstract* mathematical configuration
<br />
space.
<br />
<br />Information theory actually makes extensive use of the notion of some
<br />
kind of abstract space.  It's well known that there are very strong
<br />
analogies between thermodynamics (concerned with physical states and
<br />
energy) and information theory (concerned with information and
<br />
*abstract spaces*).
<br />
<br />I'm suggesting that for every *physical* concept we find an analogous
<br />
concept from *information theory*.  All I did was simply try to match
<br />
up all the physics concepts from thermodynamics with concepts from
<br />
information theory.  Look:
<br />
<br />*Energy* is to physics, as *Information* is to Information theory.
<br />
*Location* is to physical space as *State* to is abstract space
<br />
*Extension* is to physical space as *Complexity* is to abstract space
<br />
<br />*Mass* is to physics as *Mathematical Form* is to logic
<br />
*Juncture* is to physics as *Proposition* is to logic
<br />
*Structure* is to physics as *Theory* is to logic
<br />
<br />It's important for me to emphasize that these are not concepts I'm
<br />
pulling out of my arse.  They all have precise definitions.  For
<br />
instance go to John Sowa's ontology web-site to obtain definitions
<br />
for some the second set of terms:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.jfsowa.com/ontology/toplevel.htm">http://www.jfsowa.com/ontology/toplevel.htm</a>
<br />
<br />Precise definitions for the first set of terms come from physics and
<br />
information theory.
<br />
<br />After carrying out this process of matching physics concepts to
<br />
concepts from information theory/logic I found critical gaps.  There is
<br />
nothing  in logic/information theory matching these physics concepts
<br />
listed below:
<br />
<br />*Process*
<br />
*Activity*
<br />
*Situation*
<br />
<br />These are 'Occurents', things with temporal parts, or simply
<br />
*physical processes*
<br />
<br />(For definitions of these go to the ontology link:
<br />
<a href="http://www.jfsowa.com/ontology/toplevel.htm">http://www.jfsowa.com/ontology/toplevel.htm</a>
<br />
<br />But if all thermodynamic concepts from physics can be matched to
<br />
analogous concepts from Information Theory/Logic, then there *should*
<br />
exist something analogous to these physics concepts in Information
<br />
Theory/Logic.
<br />
<br />*Physical processes* consist of *physical objects* moving through
<br />
*physical space*.  Therefore, if the analogy holds:
<br />
<br />*Abstract processes* should consist of *abstract objects* moving
<br />
through *abstract space*.
<br />
<br />We know what *abstract space* is: its configuration/state space as
<br />
explained above:
<br />
<br />*Location* is to physical space as *State* to is abstract space
<br />
<br />We know what *abstract objects* are:
<br />
<br />*Mass* is to physics as *Mathematical Form* is to logic
<br />
<br />Therefore we can deduce what an *abstract process* is:
<br />
<br />It must consist of the 'movement' of mathematical forms through
<br />
state space.  The only conclusion that can be drawn from this is that
<br />
mathematical truth is not fixed, but can vary with time - because
<br />
that's exactly what 'the movement of mathematical forms through
<br />
state space' represents... the shifting of mathematical truth.
<br />
<br />And I suggest *that Qualia are precisely these abstract processes* !!!
<br />
<br />Hope this all makes a bit more sense.
