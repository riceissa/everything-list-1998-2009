<br />We talked about a different related, but easier problem. There one of the
<br />
questions was given that you may have been duplicated depending on the
<br />
result of a coin toss, what is the probability that you're a clone. I
<br />
think we agreed that it is 1/3. In that problem the probabilities do add
<br />
up to one, because you're asking the questions after you're already
<br />
(potentially) duplicated.
<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; her expected return, given that she is alive afterwards, is positive.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And she presumably doesn't care, if she is dead.  She can reason this

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way regardless of whether other universes exist.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This would not necessarily be true in all cases, for example if the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experimenter had an estate and heirs whose welfare was important to

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; her, she might not take the attitude that nothing matters if she is dead
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (likewise if she believes in an afterlife).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But if she only care about her own life, then wouldn't it be rational to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only consider outcomes where she is alive?
</em><br />
<br />To avoid the question of whether she cares about what happens when she is
<br />
dead, we should assume that the experimenter has no savings and normally
<br />
spends all of her income. She was planning to spend her last $2 before
<br />
performing the experiment until her assistant offered her the bet.
<br />
<br />She faces a trade-off between consuming $2 with probability 1 and
<br />
consuming $3 with probability 1/2, so she should choose the former.
<br />
<br />You seem to be talking about a scenario where the $2 would come out of the
<br />
experimenter's savings account. In that case, if she doesn't care about
<br />
what happens when she's dead, she faces a trade-off between consuming $2
<br />
with probability 1/2 and $3 with probability 1/2, so she should choose the
<br />
latter. In any case, I think the paradox is resolved.
<br />
<br />(I will add that most people do care about what happens after they die,
<br />
because that's the way evolution made them. Those who don't care would
<br />
leave less inheritence to their children and so they would have less
<br />
reproductive success.)
