<br />Well, count me as skeptical that the hype about &quot;fuzzy set theory&quot; and 
<br />
&quot;fuzzy logic&quot; has ever, or will ever, live up to some of the claims made 
<br />
by Bart Kosko, Lofti Zadeh, and others. Most of what passes for fuzzy 
<br />
logic just looks like ordinary Bayesian probability.
<br />
<br />Here's a comment from Saunders Mac Lane in his book &quot;Mathematics: Form 
<br />
and Function,&quot; 1986:
<br />
<br />&quot;Not all outside influences are really fruitful. For example, one 
<br />
engineer came up with the notion of a _fuzzy_ set--a set X where a 
<br />
statement x elementof X of membership may be neither true nor false but 
<br />
lies somewhere in between, say between 0 and 1. It was hoped that this 
<br />
ingenious notion would lead to all sorts of fruitful applications, to 
<br />
fuzzy automata, fuzzy decision theory and elsewhere. However, as yet 
<br />
most of the intended applications turn out to be just extensive 
<br />
exercises, not actually applicable; there has been a spate of such 
<br />
exercises.&quot; (. pp 439-40).
<br />
<br />While maybe Mac Lane is a little too snippily dismissive, here we are 
<br />
more than 15 years later and what do we have? Fuzzy rice cookers which 
<br />
look like nothing more than rice cookers with various algorithms Newton 
<br />
could have calculated, fuzzy-logic elevators which are simply 
<br />
implementing similar acceleration algorithms, and not much else. 
<br />
Certainly fuzzy logic has not been significantly in the foundations of 
<br />
mathematics. Logicians have not been using fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic in 
<br />
any significant way, judging by the books and articles I've seen.
<br />
<br />I agree that formal logic is not easily applied to minds. Logicians 
<br />
would agree. A mind is weighing large numbers of inputs, far beyond what 
<br />
would normally fill an entire page of First Order Logic 
<br />
equations....survival has made the ability to reason with uncertainty (a 
<br />
better core concept that calling it &quot;fuzzy logic,&quot; in my opinion) a 
<br />
survival trait. Those minds which can find solutions in the midst of 
<br />
noise and uncertainty tend to reproduce more than those minds which are 
<br />
paralyzed or too slow in reaching survival-enhancing conclusions.
<br />
<br />What we have talked about here in this sub-thread on _modal logic and 
<br />
possible worlds_ is an idealization of logic, just a snapshot or facet 
<br />
of things, in much the same way a &quot;line&quot; or a &quot;plane&quot; is a facet of the 
<br />
world around us (and understandable at some level by birds and reptiles 
<br />
even).
