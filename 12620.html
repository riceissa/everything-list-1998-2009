<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Searle is not a computationalist - does not believe in strong AI - 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; he does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; believe in weak AI. Penrose does not believe in weak AI either.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Yes. In that way Searle is &quot;not even wrong&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Meaning what? I thought you agreed his position was coherent.
</em><br />
<br /><br />In the sense that if you predict that weak AI is possible and strong AI 
<br />
is not, then he can no more be refuted. At least Penrose can be refuted 
<br />
by a success of weak AI, at least in principle. Now you can note that 
<br />
both Penrose and Searle are coherent with respect to comp (called 
<br />
&quot;strong AI&quot; by Searle) in the sense that they are aware of some 
<br />
difficulty between comp and materialism. Of course they are both 
<br />
materialist and so believes that comp must be abandoned.  I prefer to 
<br />
abandon materialism which I have practically always suspect of 
<br />
incoherence even before I learned about QM (which I take as confirming 
<br />
that the notion of primary matter is at least not well defined).
<br />
<br />Just to be clear on vocabulary:
<br />
COMP = I am a digital machine (roughly)
<br />
STRONG AI = digital machine can have qualia/subjective life
<br />
WEAK AI = digital machine can behave exactly like if they does have 
<br />
qualia/subjective life.
<br />
<br />A lot of people confuse COMP and STRONG AI.  But obviously, it is 
<br />
logically possible that a digital machine could have subjective 
<br />
experience, without me being a machine.  Of course if machine can 
<br />
think, this could be taken as an inductive inference argument for 
<br />
*guessing* that I could be a machine myself, but deductively  &quot;Machine 
<br />
can think&quot; does not entail that *only* machine can think, perhaps 
<br />
angels and supergods could too, or whatever. So COMP =&gt; STRONG AI =&gt; 
<br />
WEAK AI, but in principle none of those arrows are reversible.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &lt;snip: see my preceding post to you&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; If there are more arbitrary sequences than third person computations,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; does it follow that arbitrary sequences are not computations?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I guess I miss something (or you miss your statement?). Is it not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; obvious that &quot;if there are more arbitrary sequences than third person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; computations, then some (even most) arbitrary sequences are not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; computations&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK, but my concern was to find room in the arbitrary sequences for all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computations, not the other way around (perhaps I didn't make this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; clear).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Every rational number is also a real number.
</em><br />
<br /><br />We certainly agree on that. And all computable sequences are indeed 
<br />
contained in the set of all sequences.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Let us define what is a computable infinite sequence. A sequence is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; computable if there is a program (a machine) which generates
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; specifically the elements of that sequence in the right order, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; nothing else. The set of programs is enumerable, but by Cantor theorem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the set of *all* sequences is not enumerable. So the set of computable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; sequences is almost negligible compared to the arbitrary one.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Does it mean there is no program capable of generating a non 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; computable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; sequence?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Not at all. A universal dovetailer generates all the infinite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; sequences. The computable one, (that is, those nameable by special
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; purpose, specific,  program) and the non computable one (how? by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; generating them all).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I give another example of the same subtlety. One day a computer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; scientist told me that it was impossible to write a program of n bits
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; capable of generating an incompressible finite sequence or string of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; length m with m far greater than n. I challenge him.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Of course, what is true is that there is no program of n bit capable 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; generating that m bits incompressible string, AND ONLY, SPECIFICALLY,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; THAT STRING.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But it is really easy to write a little  program capable of generating
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that incompressible string by letting him generate ALL strings: the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; program COUNT is enough.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I think this *is* the main line of the *everything* list, or a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; miniature version of it if you want.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, and there are many related examples, like Borges' library; I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would include
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the computations that might be hiding in noise as another such example.
</em><br />
<br /><br />We will have to go back on this. I would compare the Borges' library 
<br />
(or its countable  infinite generalization) as equivalent with the 
<br />
counting algorithm. It generates all (finite) strings, and a lot of 
<br />
computations can be considered as being embedded in those strings. 
<br />
Still I consider that the counting algorithm is not equivalent with a 
<br />
universal dovetailer. I will try to explain the difference with some 
<br />
details, but roughly speaking, what the UD does, and what neither the 
<br />
rock nor the counting algorithm really do, is that the UD generates 
<br />
both the program codes and their finite and infinite running. Saying 
<br />
that all computations are generated by the counting algorithm makes 
<br />
sense only if we add a universal interpreter in the description.
<br />
I can anticipate that you will say this does not change anything from 
<br />
inside. But remember that once we abandon the &quot;physical&quot; supervenience 
<br />
thesis, we will replace it by the computational supervenience thesis 
<br />
which ask us to be precise of what is a mathematical computations. We 
<br />
can no more relate on notion of time space, energy, etc.
<br />
The easy way to do that consists in defining in some axiomatics what 
<br />
will be necessary for both the existence of computations and the 
<br />
existence of internal observer related to those computations. In that 
<br />
case a counting algorithm is just equivalent to the first three axiom 
<br />
of Peano Arithmetic. This is provably not enough to define or execute 
<br />
all programs. It appears that by adding the definition of addition and 
<br />
multiplication (and order) you get the turing universal level (and then 
<br />
with the induction axioms you get the internal lobian observer. 
<br />
Everything will emerge from (mathematical interrelation between those 
<br />
beings).
<br />
I'm afraid I'm not clear, and I will think how to make this clearer 
<br />
without going to much into the technics.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; significant thing in all these cases is that from the third person 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perspective, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information or computation is inaccessible. You need to have the book 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you want
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; already before you can find it in the Library of Babel. However, if 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (or books) can be conscious, then they will still be conscious despite 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being unable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to communicate with the world at the level of their implementation. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The first person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perspective makes these situations non-trivial.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK, but as far as they can communicate from their inside points of view 
<br />
(btw: thanks for the spelling!) you are adding implicitly some addition 
<br />
and multiplication laws. Once we stop to take for granted what exists 
<br />
or not, such little nuance have some importance, especially for 
<br />
deriving concretely physics from something else.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Now, when you run the UD, as far as you keep the discourse in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; third
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; person mode, everything remains enumerable, even in the limit.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But from the first person point of view, a priori the uncountable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; stories, indeed generated by the UD, take precedence on the computable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; one: thus the continua of white rabbits. This results from the lack of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; any possibility from the first person point of view to locate herself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; into UD*. Somehow the first person belongs to 2^aleph_zero histories 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the start.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Can you explain again why only the countable stories appear to the 3rd 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but the 1st person sees the uncountable ones as well? Also, why should 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; white rabbits prefer the uncountable habitat?
</em><br />
<br /><br />The computable stories can be said to be generated by programs, and 
<br />
thus are enumerable (countable).
<br />
But the UD generates not only all programs and their execution, it 
<br />
generates also all data, including all streams, all oracle, etc.
<br />
Of course he never generates a complete streams in one strike, but by 
<br />
dovetailing on the reals (which can be defined by a finite subroutine, 
<br />
he can present such real streams through finite but enough big portion 
<br />
to some program who &quot;want to read them&quot;.
<br />
Now, for an external observer everything at any time (or number of 
<br />
steps of the running of the UD) is countable. We can see finite portion 
<br />
of the stream to be generated with some advance and then presented to 
<br />
the program, then we have to wait a billion years (say) to see the 
<br />
&quot;same program&quot; getting a larger portion of its stream datum.
<br />
Now, put yourself in front of a concrete UD, like in step 7 of the 
<br />
version of UDA in 8 steps.
<br />
cf the pdf slide:  
<br />
<a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/SANE2004Slide.pdf">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/SANE2004Slide.pdf</a>
<br />
To predict your &quot;future history&quot;, and taking into account the first 
<br />
person is unaware of delays of computation introduced by the UD (due to 
<br />
its dovetaling), and taking into account that the UD generates all 
<br />
programs infinitely often (necessarily), and taking into account that 
<br />
the &quot;probability measure&quot; cannot bear on the computational states but 
<br />
only on the (infinite) computational histories: all that entails that 
<br />
you have to take into account ALL computational histories going through 
<br />
your current state. Well, now take just into account the infinite 
<br />
dumbness of the UD, which is that for all programs it will generate its 
<br />
execution on all streams, and thus on all arbitrary sequences 
<br />
(including first person descrition of white rabbits) which makes a non 
<br />
countable set (!!!, by Cantor) then, well, then it *seems* we cannot 
<br />
avoid white noise and flying pigs and all slight variants, etc... OK ? 
<br />
(don't hesitate to say NO, I'm quick and it is not easy). Are you OK 
<br />
with any &quot;taking into account&quot; described above?
<br />
Of course, such measure is a bit too much intuitive: a priori all 
<br />
probabilities of histories add up, and we could a bit naively take this 
<br />
as a refutation of comp. What refrains us to jump toward that 
<br />
conclusion, is that such intuitive probabilities have not enough taken 
<br />
into account the difference between the points of view, something any 
<br />
self-referentially correct universal machine can be shown to be able to 
<br />
do, thanks, not really to incompleteness, but thanks to the fact that 
<br />
machine can reason about their own incompleteness (leading to the 
<br />
arithmetical points of view/hypostases). This motivates then the AUDA 
<br />
(Arithmetical version of UDA,  ... or of Plotinus, actually).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; A similar &quot;explosion of stories&quot; appears with quantum mechanics, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; except
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that here the physicist as an easy answer: white rabbits and Potter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; universe are eliminated through phase randomization (apparently).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I am not satisfied by this answer if only because my motivation is to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; understand where that quantum comes from.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Is complex randomization of histories the only way to force normal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; nature into the shorter path?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Well, my point is that if we take comp seriously, we have to justify
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the absence of rabbits from computer science. In case too much white
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; rabbits remains, comp would be false, and this would be an argument in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; favor of materialism. But, when you interview a universal machine on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; this question you can realize at least that this question is far from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; being settled.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If QM emerges from comp, does that solve the problem?
</em><br />
<br /><br />As far as QM is confirmed by nature, if QM can be justified by comp, it 
<br />
would mean nature confirms comp, and thus its immateriality. In this 
<br />
sense the problem would be solved: materialism would be false. If QM is 
<br />
confirmed by nature (an infinite process, note) and if comp predicts 
<br />
something different, then it will depend. Some circumstances could lead 
<br />
to argument in favor of materialism. I mean I can speculate about this.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Hope you don't mind I continue to comment your post tomorrow,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I appreciate that you are taking the time to reply to my posts; even 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; though
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you are probably repeating yourself, I think I understand things a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; little better
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; every time.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Thanks for saying. Don't hesitate to ask precisions. When I reread 
<br />
myself I am not just ashamed of my spelling, I realize I forget 
<br />
arguments or points, or, often, that I miss the relevant emphasis.
<br />
Things will be clearer when I will describe the UD in term of the Fi 
<br />
and Wi.
