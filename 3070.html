<br />Yes. I prefer to say it generates  all computations going through that
<br />
states(°). Bennett has introduced a nice notion of depth from string, which is
<br />
grosso modo the runtime to produce it. It is still possible (even probable)
<br />
that &quot;me&quot; is deep and &quot;you&quot; are deep so that the occurence in UD* of you
<br />
and me can be taken as evidence that we do share a &quot;long&quot; computation.
<br />
<br />(°) I see Hal Finney says the same thing.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;(Whatever &quot;me&quot; is, is unimportant).  And somehow, these states are joined by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;their similarity to one another, which allows (virtual) motion from one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;state to the next.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I think the relation of similarity, or proximity bears on the
<br />
computations/histories/dreams. But you are correct. The only way
<br />
to keep sharing the same deep computation, and thus sharing our
<br />
domain of undeterminacy, is that the computation is &quot;linear in our common
<br />
ignorance&quot;. This will multiply both of us, in some conservative way,
<br />
and in extremely &quot;explosive&quot; way. 
<br />
I guess the first person *plural* has it origin in such self multiplication
<br />
sharing.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;So, if I am currently sitting in the state of &quot;sitting at my desk&quot;, I have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;several realities branching off from this one where in the next moments I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;rising from my chair&quot;, or &quot;still sitting at my desk&quot;, or &quot;petting a white
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;rabbit&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />In case comp is true, I'm afraid necessarily so. 
<br />
Note that the existence of QM
<br />
gives confirming evidence that there is some branching. And perhaps
<br />
you can guess that comp predicts that any machine looking at her
<br />
neighborood sufficiently closely, i.e. below her level of substitution
<br />
will discover some &quot;observable weirdness&quot; and other continua of
<br />
parallel computations ... 
<br />
Note that histories can be considered as fusing by difference amnesy.
<br />
I really hope to succeed in &quot;rediscovering&quot; the quantum computer
<br />
through &quot;machine's introspection&quot;. 
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;But I am left with one nagging question.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I really hope so Joel. My strongest goal with UDA is to show that
<br />
computationalism or mechanism does not solve *per se* the mind
<br />
body problem. Quite the contrary. &quot;Before UDA&quot; you can believe there
<br />
is only a &quot;consciousness problem&quot;, &quot;after UDA&quot; you got a &quot;body&quot; problem
<br />
too. Understanding comp consists in understanding that matter/space
<br />
/time is necessarily not obvious and must be recovered from the
<br />
space of all computations as seen as some internal points of views. 
<br />
I told you that my UD or your MUCA or Schmidhuber's Great Programmer, ...
<br />
are not the solution, there are only steps
<br />
toward a mathematical *formulation* of the problem.
<br />
<br />Of course the formulation gives insight, (the reversal)... and 
<br />
that's nothing compare to the arithmetisation of that formulation,  
<br />
weird quantum logics, but that's technical ... (if you know modal logic
<br />
search for LASE in the archive).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;1) Where is Time?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Time is *the* first person concept &quot;par excellence&quot;. It is linked
<br />
with intuition, consciousness, but also construction, and truth.
<br />
The arithmetical translation of UDA let me hope that time is captured
<br />
by the modal logic known in the literature as S4Grz.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;1a) What governs the trajectory of one's awareness through all his/her
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;possible states?
</em><br />
<br /><br />The geometry generated by the notion of proximity on the (maximal ?)
<br />
consistent extensions (our alternative &quot;completed&quot; futures).
<br />
Or if you prefer, what governs the possible trajectory of awaraness is
<br />
Schroedinger Equation. Our problem: extract it from the geometry above.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;1c) How do I get from one state to another?
</em><br />
<br /><br />You 3-don't. You 1-do. This must be related to the geometry above.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;1d) Isn't this &quot;awareness&quot;, and its motion path necessarily &quot;outside&quot; those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;states and the Universal Dovetailer?
</em><br />
<br /><br />No. But perhaps you are close. A bizare thing is that if someone look
<br />
at a portion of a representation of UD*, he can say there is, in some sense,
<br />
&nbsp;no awareness possible in that portion. 
<br />
And this remains true for all finite portions of UD*.
<br />
The &quot;meaning&quot; appears only when the whole UD* is considered. This is coherent
<br />
with the fact that the neighborhood of &quot;first person state&quot; are defined
<br />
on that limit. 
<br />
<br />An image is that each instant, each observer moment perhaps, is defined
<br />
by a &quot;trip&quot; from the base of the cone (UD*) to the (non existing) top,
<br />
at infinite speed, just because we cannot be aware of the delays, nor
<br />
of any initial represention. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Since I am into cellular automata, I always assumed that time is implemented
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;naturally... by the automaton... from one tick to the next - just like a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;movie.
</em><br />
<br />That's the integers sequence. No?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Can we really assume UD* exists?  
</em><br />
<br />Unless you are finitist you can realise that with comp you cannot escape its
<br />
existence. You get UD* once you accept the existence of *all* natural numbers,
<br />
and all their describable relations.
<br />
<br />But no problem without changing your mind. Abandoning comp by abandoning
<br />
arithmetical platonisme is a way like another :-) 
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Doesn't it take Time to execute UD?
</em><br />
<br />No. Only a concrete UD, concrete relatively to &quot;your&quot; most probable 
<br />
histories, will take enormous time.
<br />
<br />But tell me, if you postulate that time, how could we explain it.
<br />
What would that time be, and where would it come from?
<br />
<br />You tell me you don't need time or space with Your MUCA, isn't?
<br />
<br />In Platonia it takes neither millimeters nor seconds.
<br />
<br />Arithmetical relation are not &quot;temporal&quot;, 
<br />
still less (with Occam) if we can justify or just identifies
<br />
the discourses on the &quot;temporal&quot; by the &quot;soud introspecting machines&quot;.
