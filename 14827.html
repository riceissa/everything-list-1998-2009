1) Why 1 is more than 0 and simpler than n ?
<br />
<br />'Entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem'... It follows by
<br />
looking at it in a first sight that it would means the one universe
<br />
hypothesis is simpler than MW. Yes, one universe involves many less
<br />
than MW (either there exists a finite number of other universes or
<br />
infinitely many)... Then by O'R we should take the one universe
<br />
hypothesis as simpler because requiring less universes (in this case
<br />
1). But it's an ill way of understanding O'R... It should be
<br />
understood as saying something about the premises, the axioms... One
<br />
shouldn't add an axiom unnecessarily. And in this case none of one
<br />
univers, 42 universes or infinitely many hypothesis are simpler
<br />
relative to each other... and O'R could not help you choose or if it
<br />
could help for something would be to choose the 0 univers
<br />
hypothesis... well 0 &lt; 1 &lt;&lt; oo and this for all values of 0 even big
<br />
ones :)
<br />
<br />2) Why turing emulability of the mind entails first person
<br />
undeterminacy and/or MW ?
<br />
<br />Because if you're a computation then you're not dependant on the
<br />
substrate of the computation... but only to the computation itself. A
<br />
computation is substrate independant.
<br />
Well you'd say it may be substrate independent but still it needs a
<br />
substrate to 'exist'. Ok let's accept that, but let's return on the
<br />
mind and on the hypothesis that the mind is a computation and the
<br />
brain the substrate on which it is run. As a computation is substrate
<br />
independant then what follows is if the mind is a computation it can
<br />
be run on other computational substrate for example on a... computer
<br />
for example. And 'the mind' wouldn't be able to tell if it is run on a
<br />
brain or on a computer. By our hypothesis the mind is a computation,
<br />
and a computation is dependant only on it's state and transition rule,
<br />
if the same input is given to the same algorithm it will yield the
<br />
same result so seeing a brain is of no help because you would see a
<br />
brain even run somewhere else if the same input is given.
<br />
So why this entails first person undeterminacy and/or MW ? let's
<br />
assume we could replicate the computation of your mind (I have assume
<br />
by hypothesis that it is a computation, so replication can be done,
<br />
even if currently we don't have a clue and even we don't know if the
<br />
mind is a computation... but here I assume it just for the argument to
<br />
see what it entails) then I could execute the 'you' computation on a
<br />
computer then if I can, I can also run the 'you' computation not only
<br />
on one computer but on many computers. Ok so now I have at least two
<br />
computers running the same mind (computation)... I switch off one
<br />
computer, the mind die ? hell no, by our hypothesis mind is
<br />
computation and the computation is still running on the other
<br />
computer. So from the point of view of the mind unplugging one of the
<br />
two computers didn't change a thing. Now I'm a real serail killer I
<br />
switch of the last computer running the computation/mind... so now the
<br />
mind die now ?? Let's say I've done a program dump before stopping the
<br />
last computer and I decide 5 years later to rerun the computation from
<br />
this save point and on. Wasn't the mind dead ? If it is and mind ==
<br />
the computation, how can I have the ability to run the computation
<br />
without it being the mind ? It means also that if you're a computation
<br />
you can't know at which 'level' you're run (if you're run on a VM
<br />
running in a VM running in a VM or a non emulated substrate). So if
<br />
mind is a computation to make correct prediction about the next state
<br />
you must take all computation having the same state into account. Even
<br />
using the 'real switch' theory a mind could be run on different 'real'
<br />
(composed of substance) substrate... and the mind will *have* to take
<br />
into account these runs on real substrate to make correct prediction.
<br />
And unplugging one real substrate run will not kill the mind,
<br />
unplugging them all also. The only way would be to not only unplug
<br />
them all but to garantee that it wil *never and ever* be run *again*
<br />
(even only one).
<br />
<br /><br />If I'm run on another computational substrate than
<br />
my brain, If someone pull the plug, I die ?
<br />
