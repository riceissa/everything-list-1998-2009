Hi Bruno,
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  Galen Strawson, 'Realistic monism: why physicalism entails 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; panpsychism' 2006
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; <a href="http://web.gc.cuny.edu/philosophy/people/strawson/rmwpep.pdf">http://web.gc.cuny.edu/philosophy/people/strawson/rmwpep.pdf</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The author admits himself that his doctrine is more a form of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experential/non-experiential-ist (thus dualist) doctrine. It seems to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; me the usual dual naturalism
</em><br />
<br />One could probably call it a kind of property dualism. That is also what 
<br />
sort of bothers me. I am convinced that reality is monistic, and I agree 
<br />
with you that monism is not yet convincingly reached in the paper; but 
<br />
it is progress in the right direction and better than the usual Chalmers 
<br />
&quot;hard problem&quot; talk.
<br />
<br />BTW - a wonderful argumentation against Chalmers can be found on this 
<br />
(excellent!, warmly recommended) blog. Hal Finney writes there sometimes 
<br />
too (mostly in the comments area).
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/04/zombies.html">http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/04/zombies.html</a>
<br />
<br />I frankly do not understand why zombies are taken seriously in 
<br />
philosophy, but this only as an aside.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I can agree with the idea that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;consciousness&quot; is physical, but not as an explanation of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness, still less of course as an explanation of what is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter. It is exactly like Searle, but with &quot;physical&quot; in place of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; biological.
</em><br />
<br />I think that when one takes a broad view - not taking preconceptions, 
<br />
but really thinking things through - it does not matter if we call it 
<br />
&quot;physicalism&quot; or &quot;materialism&quot; or &quot;idealism&quot; - is not the monist 
<br />
position that it all collapses? In the end, the above are only words. 
<br />
More interesting are the _relationships_ that hold (that is why the 
<br />
essence of a scientific theory is the math: the math encodes lawful 
<br />
relationships the referents have with each other).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let me know if you understand that computationalism is just 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; incompatible with that sort of move. Comp reduces completely the mind 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; body problem into a necessary derivation of body-matter from a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; number/mind theory (like computer science, provablity logic + 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intensional variants, etc.).
</em><br />
<br />That is what I would call the important question: comp is an assertion 
<br />
of what relations hold: thus it gives content to the word &quot;mind/matter&quot; 
<br />
etc; my starting position is ontic structural realism.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/structural-realism/">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/structural-realism/</a>
<br />
<br />I accept that we need no substantial &quot;relata&quot; for relations to hold 
<br />
(platonic computation suffices; or better: at the level of TOE it is 
<br />
meaningless to talk about &quot;substance in itself&quot; or whatever - a 
<br />
relational characterization is all and enough.)
<br />
<br />As to what theory of relations hold - for instance, Max Tegmark's 
<br />
plenitude or your comp variant - I am as yet undecided, although I have 
<br />
already once asserted that I like your approach because it goes into 
<br />
technicalities and thus serves to clarify issues - the problems are most 
<br />
often only revealed in the detail.
<br />
<br />To be more specific on the mind body &quot;problem&quot;: I think my position is 
<br />
best expressed with this passage in Alan Watts, The Way of Zen, 1957, 
<br />
Random House, Paperback Edition 1989, p.72:
<br />
<br />QUOTE:
<br />
According to the Yogacara the world of form is cittamatra-	
<br />
&quot;mind only&quot;-or vijnaptimatra-&quot;representation only.&quot; This view	
<br />
seems to have a very close resemblance to Western philosophies
<br />
of subjective idealism, in which the external and material world
<br />
is regarded as a projection of the mind.
<br />
<br />However, there seem to be some differences between the two points of view.
<br />
Here, as always, the Mahayana is not so much a theoretical and 
<br />
speculative construction
<br />
as an account of an inner experience, and a	
<br />
means of awakening the experience in others. Furthermore, the	
<br />
word citta is not precisely equivalent to our &quot;mind.&quot; Western
<br />
thought tends to define mind by opposition to matter, and to
<br />
consider matter not so much as &quot;measure&quot; as the solid stuff
<br />
which is measured. Measure itself, abstraction, is for the West
<br />
more of the nature of mind, since we tend to think of mind and
<br />
spirit as more abstract than concrete.
<br />
<br />But in Buddhist philosophy citta does not stand over against a
<br />
conception of solid stuff. The world has never been considered in terms 
<br />
of a primary substance shaped into various forms by the action
<br />
of mind or spirit. Such an image is not in the history of Buddhist 
<br />
thought, and thus  the problem of how impalpable mind can influence 
<br />
solid matter has never arisen. Wherever we should speak of the material 
<br />
or physical or substantial world, Buddhism employs the term rupa, which 
<br />
is not so much our &quot;matter&quot; as &quot;form.&quot; There is no &quot;material substance&quot; 
<br />
underlying rupa unless it be citta itself.
<br />
<br />END QUOTE
<br />
<br />The last sentence is the best!! Could I interpret your theory as citta = 
<br />
comp?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; With comp, and a bit poetically, the physical is the border of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computer's computer science (the border of computer science as seen by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computers).
</em><br />
<br />There are still some points where I do not follow how this arises in 
<br />
your theory. For instance, for me unresolved (already mentioned earlier) 
<br />
is the granularity issue.
<br />
<br />But, while I have already read your email where you clarify some things 
<br />
I would like to go over your papers once more (it will be in July, as I 
<br />
have much work in June) - and postpone more detailed questions to then.
<br />
<br />But two things which initially strike me as unclear on a relatively 
<br />
high, untechnical level:
<br />
<br />1) you said in a post that your comp implies immortality - but, every OM 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;is composed of infinite number of infinite consistent computations 
<br />
running through it - if OMs thus continue indefinitely into the future 
<br />
(immortality) should they not also continue indefinitely into the past? 
<br />
&nbsp;From where the asymmetry?
<br />
<br />We should not remember being born etc (1st-plural memory -&gt; parents, 
<br />
grandparents, friends etc) but should be &quot;eternal ones&quot;. This does not 
<br />
imply infinite memory - we could forget, things fuzzing out the farther 
<br />
back they are, but one should not remember a starting point, only things 
<br />
getting hazier and hazier (as computations &quot;merge&quot; in the infinite past)
<br />
<br />2) You said in comp only history and geography is contingent. That is 
<br />
also a very important point for me: one of the explanatorily most 
<br />
satisfying principles of current science is the theory of evolution: 
<br />
this theory explains how order can arise even from total randomness. I 
<br />
do not yet see how evolution fits into your account of comp. I mean, if 
<br />
we take the sum of computations describing a valid OM, why should it be 
<br />
more likely that an OM sees itself as arising via evolution as versus 
<br />
for instance (see above) an &quot;eternal one&quot;?
<br />
Could one not see the evidence for evolution as a strong indication for 
<br />
physicalism (in a broad sense, a la computational universes where OMs 
<br />
only arise as substructures evolved in that universe and not directly 
<br />
&quot;simulated&quot;?) (I know you addressed this question earlier, you said you 
<br />
spoke with Schmidhuber about it, I will check it up in July also, but 
<br />
this evolution question really bugs me, that is why I bring it up again :-))
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I have not yet finished Strawson's paper. Up to now, I appreciate 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it because it is quite clear (and thus clearly unconvincing with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; respect to the comp hyp).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thanks for the reference. Best,
</em><br />
<br />I am glad that you enjoy the paper :-) As said above, it is a starting 
<br />
point, not an end point. Every clear contribution sheds some more light 
<br />
on a difficult question (there is too much unclear and confused writing 
<br />
on this subject, even by respected authors)
<br />
<br /><br />Cheers,
<br />
Günther
