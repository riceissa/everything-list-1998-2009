<em class="quotelev1">&gt;understand him, so I'm putting this out for comment.
</em><br />
<br />OK.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The question arises when we accept as a starting point what Bruno
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;calls &quot;comp&quot;, that the universe arises as a result of a computation.
</em><br />
<br />Precisely I mean by comp that I can survive with a digital brain.
<br />
It means that I suppose it exists a level of description of 
<br />
myself such that I survive a functional substitution done at that 
<br />
level.
<br />
<br />I recall that the UD-argument (the PE-omega thought experiment) is
<br />
used to show, argue or even prove that with comp, physics is 
<br />
ultimately a branch of the ``psychology of machines&quot;.
<br />
That ``psychology of machines&quot; will itself appear as the study
<br />
of the stable discourses of self-referentialy  correct machines.
<br />
<br />For most steps of the UD argument, I am using also the hypothesis 
<br />
that my brain is enclosed in my skull, and that my brain is a hot 
<br />
machines (not a quantum brain). But in the last step, I eliminate 
<br />
these supplementary hypothesis. It means that my reasoning does not
<br />
depend on the choice of the level.
<br />
<br />Ultimately there is no more ``universe&quot; or any physical *stuff*.
<br />
Physical laws and physical sensations should remain and be explained
<br />
from the ``psychology of machines&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Then, we want to know, is it possible for the physical laws of space
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and time to be based on a continuum, or must everything be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;quantised?
</em><br />
<br />Very fundamental questions. Even without deriving explicitely the 
<br />
laws of physics from comp, the UD argument gives qualitative 
<br />
information. In particular it shows that we are  necessarily 
<br />
facing continua and most plausibly some uncomputational beasts.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Is the space we are embedded within really a fine grid,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with each cell on the order of 10e-23 cm, or some such small number?
</em><br />
<br />Difficult question. With comp we can expect that there are some
<br />
continuous observable spectrum, and I think position (unlike spin!)
<br />
could be a good canditate, but this is as yet not clear.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Taking the question further, we can ask whether we should expect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the probabilities of, say, a given observation to be a real number, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;or rational.  
</em><br />
<br />Comp implies that probabilities behave exactly like real numbers.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;If real, how is it possible that a TM can produce a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;real number (or an infinite number of real numbers, corresponding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to the infinite number of observations)?
</em><br />
<br />That is the point we are presently discussing in the thread.
<br />
A simple way to figure out how a TM can generates each real numbers
<br />
is by reiteration of the self-duplication experiment.
<br />
Let us say the machine duplicates itself in W and M.
<br />
Imagine we stop after 64 iterations. We got 2^64 machines. 
<br />
Each machine makes a self-localisation experiment after each 
<br />
duplication and write the result (W or M) in its diary.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From the first person point of view most machines will rightly 
</em><br />
consider their stories (obviously identifiable with the sequence of
<br />
W and M with a lenght equal to 64 written in their respective diary)
<br />
as random, even in Kolmogoroff-Chaitin sense.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Then I agree with Bruno that due to computational indeterminacy, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;what he calls the PE-omega (which name I hate, BTW, Bruno), that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;answer is certainly yes, real numbers, ....
</em><br />
<br />Yes. (BTW I hate &quot;PE-omega&quot; too. I use it because I once use it in 
<br />
the list, and I thing it will not help to change names especially 
<br />
for those like myself, and yourself if I remember correctly, who like to
<br />
trip in the archive). But ok. Enough is enough. From now one I will
<br />
use &quot;UD argument&quot; for the &quot;PE-omega&quot;. UD = Universal Dovetailer.
<br />
&quot;UD argument&quot; is also the name of the argument in my thesis.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;.....continuous space and time.
</em><br />
<br />I am not up to the point of being able to speak about space and time.
<br />
Still less about Lagrangian and Energy. Unfortunately.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The point is that whenever we make measurements, we are in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;1-perspective.  I liked his description a few posts back of an oracle
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that we can ask for any digit of a real number.  Whenever we ask for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a digit, we get one, no matter how far down it is in significance.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It doesn't matter that the UD will never produce _all_ the digits
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of any given real.  It's enough that from a first person perspective,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that any given digit will eventually be computed.
</em><br />
<br />Exactly.
<br />
What happens is that the personal feeling of being oneself 
<br />
reconstitute doesn't depend at all of the time the UD will 
<br />
reconstitute your relevant (relative) computational state.
<br />
Whatever way you choose for putting a distribution of probability or 
<br />
credibility on the set of reconstitutions, it will change nothing
<br />
if, in a third person description of the running of the UD, the time
<br />
between the reconstitutions is a googol^googol years. The first
<br />
person are not aware of such delays. That is why we must take into
<br />
account the infinite rather slow UD-generation of *each* real.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;As far as probabilities for observations, these don't have to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;actually be computed by the UTM at all.  
</em><br />
<br />... nor do we need an actual concrete stuffy universe in which
<br />
that UTM would be running.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;They are simply manifest
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to us, in our 1-perspective, because of the measure and because of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computational indeterminism.
</em><br />
<br />Exactly. 
<br />
That follows from the UD argument + a conceptual use
<br />
of Occam's razor, like the one use by Everett.
<br />
We are using here also Church's thesis and a minimal amount of
<br />
arithmetical or computer-theoretical platonism, for sure.
<br />
(And with the movie-graph argument alias the crackpot proof we
<br />
can elimininate the use of Occam's razor. It's useful in case 
<br />
you live in a country full of anti-occamists, but it is not
<br />
the case for this mailing list).
<br />
<br />Note that in the UD argument I am also using a minimal amount of
<br />
folk-psychology for giving a meaning to the expression &quot;survive&quot;.
<br />
This can also be eliminate, by using abstract definition of
<br />
knowledge, observation and belief. In that case we are lead to
<br />
the provability and modal logics. In that case an abstract form
<br />
of the UD leads naturally toward quantum logics.
<br />
<br />Thanks for giving me the opportunity of summarizing myself.
<br />
I intend to put in my URL an english and detailed version of the
<br />
complete UD argument ... soon, hopefully for Christmas.
<br />
<br />Bruno
