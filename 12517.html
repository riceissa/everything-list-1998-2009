<br />
The writer and theoretician of, ummm, comparative beliefs and spiritual 
<br />
practices, Ken Wilbur wrote a book many years ago titled A Sociable God. 
<br />
It was quite a slim book if I remember rightly, in which he examined the 
<br />
uses in English or the word 'religion'. He analysed and teased out nine 
<br />
(9) distinct usages which I can't remember in any detail now, which was 
<br />
interesting at the time. What has stuck with me though is the major 
<br />
distinction he exposed between authentication and legitimation.
<br />
<br />Authentication is the way in which belief and action in accord with 
<br />
one's beliefs affirms one's personal identity and the value of one's 
<br />
existence and achievements.
<br />
<br />Legitimation is the way in which beliefs bolster the authority and 
<br />
socio-political standing of priests and other officials.
<br />
<br />What scientific method has brought to the human species is the clear 
<br />
demonstration that ALL beliefs and assumptions are open to question. 
<br />
Knowledge is only knowledge to the extent that it has not yet been 
<br />
falsified. If a belief or customary assumption about the universe cannot 
<br />
in principle be falsified then acceptance of that belief is a matter of 
<br />
choice and opinion. People who understand the basis of scientific method 
<br />
are forced to question their own beliefs in order to retain their 
<br />
personal integrity and authenticity. People who have not yet understood 
<br />
the full implications of scientific method do not yet know that they are 
<br />
living in denial, but the very nature and power of the sceptical method 
<br />
is perceived as threatening.** This I believe is one of the major 
<br />
motivating influences in the divide between extremism and moderation 
<br />
manifesting in just about all traditional social and cultural 
<br />
organisations in the world.
<br />
<br />I take the ritual murder of Giordano Bruno in Rome in 1600 as emblematic 
<br />
of this divide, and personally take that event as the start of the 
<br />
modern era.
<br />
<br />** I think that by default my view leans more towards Brent's than 
<br />
John's here. Possibly the biggest problem is that religious [wide sense] 
<br />
believers think they really are going to lose something by relinquishing 
<br />
Faith as the basis of thought and action. I respond that the human 
<br />
universe is always potentially infinite, so long as it exists and we 
<br />
believe it to be so.
<br />
<br />And 'Evil'? It is the deliberate treatment of another human as a thing. 
<br />
For a 'machine' to act in an evil manner it would have to be capable of 
<br />
taking responsibility for its actions otherwise it is only the evil tool 
<br />
of an evil person.
<br />

<br />
<br />I think humans valuing knowledge is as fundamental as their valuing food 
<br />
and sex. So there is a recognized epistemological duty. Everyone, in 
<br />
every culture, is contemptuous of the fool and a fool is someone who 
<br />
readily adopts false beliefs.
