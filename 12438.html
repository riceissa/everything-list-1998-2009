<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hans Moravec has defended in this list indeed the idea that even a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; teddy bear is conscious. You could perhaps search in the archive my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reply to him. I will try to sum up what I think about this, but other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things need to be clarified, perhaps.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I put it to the list that there are several factors that are implicit
<br />
and explicit to the notion of consciousness .. which we humans mis-identify
<br />
and mis-weight.  They involve more than the human arrogance that 'our'
<br />
sentience is the gauge to measure any/all other-sentience against.
<br />
<br />Allow me the gedankenexperiment notion that a sentience exists fully
<br />
potentiated and knowledgeable in some pre-existential realm. That
<br />
it suddenly finds itself instantiated in this universe and starts
<br />
enacting 'consciousness'. In a blink of a moment it dematerializes - to
<br />
the horror/wonderment of the rest of us standing here watching the event.
<br />
<br />Make it easier -- a coma patient, inert for decades, re-wakes alone in
<br />
a room, registers its situation and in an instant - dies.  Would that
<br />
moment qualify for 'conscioueness'?   
<br />
<br />The questions arise .. could a true 'sentience' have existed in that brief
<br />
span of time?  I.e, &quot;what is the shortest time span of sentient (self)other
<br />
awareness necessary, to &quot;qualify&quot; for consciousness?
<br />
<br />Whether human-or-not, 'situational awareness', becomes a parameter
<br />
for consciousness, as well.
<br />
<br />-time
<br />
-memory/continuity
<br />
-reactive/interactive capacity
<br />
&nbsp;... etc.
<br />
<br />not just in human terms, but allowed in a spectrum of extent,
<br />
from just-greater-than-zero to some full-functional (for that
<br />
system) capacity.
<br />
<br /><br />When you take the raw parameters criteria, and shrink them
<br />
down to their minimalist extents -- so that all the BASIC
<br />
CONDITIONS of 'sentience' are met/present - whether for a 
<br />
femto-second or 2 days or a billion years; whether capable
<br />
of acting-on-awareness or not, or, only capable of self-registry
<br />
of received-information; and so on .. we reach a point in
<br />
the existential scenario when 'computation' falls away as being
<br />
'too complex' in the conditions-spectrum.
<br />
<br />What we reach in this paring-away scenario - are qualia of
<br />
existence necessary to meet MINIMALISTS conditions for 
<br />
sentience-of-some-sort.  Which would not have to be:
<br />
sentience-of-OUR-sort.
<br />
<br />In the final existential analysis for 'what is sentience/
<br />
consciousness' - it become the smallest, shortest contingient   
<br />
situation for an-aspect OF existence to REGISTER that some
<br />
Batesian &quot;difference that makes a difference&quot; -- is co-present.
<br />
<br />In the final existential analysis of primary qualia of the 
<br />
universe, I preffered in 1996 that the most FUNDAMENTAL
<br />
dynamic change in this universe is some/any CHANGE OF INERTIA
<br />
from a fixed sameness.
<br />
<br />This puts the formative, functional, primal qualiatative aspect
<br />
of sentience/consciousness right in the very fabric of the cosmos.
<br />
<br />It is -not- complex or human consciousness -- which emerges later.
<br />
But it is the primal foundation-presence and qualia on which
<br />
emerged forms of consciousness rely  - in order for those complex forms
<br />
to exist, as they do.
<br />
<br />Food for thought, ladies and gentlemen, food for thought.
