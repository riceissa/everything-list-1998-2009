<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From: &quot;Jesse Mazer&quot; &lt;lasermazer.domain.name.hidden&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;From: &quot;Jacques Mallah&quot; &lt;jackmallah.domain.name.hidden&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;    &quot;You&quot; is just a matter of definition.  As for the conditional 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;effective probability of an observation with characteristics A given that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;it includes characteristics B, p(A|B), that is automatically defined as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;p(A|B) = M(A and B) / M(B).  There is no room to have a rival &quot;relative 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;conditional probability&quot;.  (E.g. A = &quot;I think I'm in the USA at 12:00 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;today&quot;, B=&quot;I think I'm Bob&quot;.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Well, I hope you'd agree that which observer-moment I am right now is not a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;matter of definition,&quot; but a matter of fact.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depends what you mean by that ...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;My opinion is that the global measure on all observer-moments is not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;telling us something like the &quot;number of physical instantiations&quot; of each 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;one, but rather the probability of *being* one particular observer-moment 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;vs. some other one.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, if taken at face value that really doesn't make any sense at all.  
<br />
There is no randomness in the multiverse.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, it is proportional to the *effective*
<br />
&quot;probability of being&quot; one.  In this case, &quot;effective&quot; refers to the role it 
<br />
plays in Bayesian reasoning.  The reason it plays that role is to maximize 
<br />
the fraction of people who, using Bayesian reasoning, guess well.  By 
<br />
&quot;people&quot; here I mean what you would call &quot;instantiations of OM's&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I would be interested to hear what you think the measure means, though, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;since my version seems to require first-person facts which are separate 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;from third-person facts (i.e., which observer-moment *I* am).
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The measure is just the number of observer-moments (where I mean 
<br />
different people count as different people) that see that type of 
<br />
observation.  It is really a measure on the characteristics of OM's, rather 
<br />
than on OM's, since each O-M is counted equally.  # of O-M = # of observers 
<br />
* moments.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;In any case, I'm pretty sure there's room in a TOE for a &quot;conditional 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probability&quot; which would not be directly deducible from the global 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probability distribution. Suppose I have a large population of individuals, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and I survey them on various personal characteristics, like height, IQ, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;age, etc. Using the survey results I can create a global probability 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;function which tells me, for example, what the likelihood is that a random 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;individualis more than 5 feet tall. But If I then want to find out the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;conditional probability that a given individual over 5 feet tall weighs 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;more than 150 pounds, there is no way to deduce this directly given only 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the global probability distribution.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure there is, as you go on to say ...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;In this example it may be that p(A|B) = M(A and B) / M(B), but the point is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that M(A and B) cannot be found simply by knowing M(A) and M(B).
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course it can't, unless you know that A and B are independent.  Why 
<br />
the heck would you even think of trying?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The global measure is on the whole set of OM characteristics:
<br />
M(...,a,b,c,d,...).  To find M(A), you have to set a = A and sum over all 
<br />
possible values of b, c, d, etc.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The global measure has all the information, so to actually use it you 
<br />
have to ignore most of that stuff by summing over irrelevant details.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;And a TOE could conceivably work other ways too. Suppose we have a large 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;number of interconnected bodies of water, each flowing into one another at 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a constant rate so that the total amoung of water in any part stays 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;constant over time. In that case you could have something like a &quot;global 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;measure&quot; which would tell you the probability that a randomly selected 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;water molecule will be found in a given body of water at a given time, but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;also a kind of conditional probability that a water molecule currently in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;river A will later be found in any one of the various other rivers that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;river A branches into. This would approximate the idea that my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consciousness is in some sense &quot;flowing&quot; between different experiences, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;splitting and merging as it goes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Just as the path of a given molecule is determined by the geographical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;relationships between the various bodies of water, so the path of my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;conscious experience might be determined by some measure of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;continuity&quot; between different observer-moments...even though an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observer-moment corresponding to my brain 5 seconds from now and another 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;one corresponding to your own brain at this very moment might have equal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;*global* measure, I would presumably be much more likely to flow into a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;future observer-moment which is more similar to my current one.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appeal of that kind of model is based on the illusion that we can 
<br />
remember past experiences.  We can't remember past experiences at all, 
<br />
actually.  We only experience &quot;memory&quot; because of the _current_ way our 
<br />
brains are structured.  It's possible to &quot;remember&quot; things that never 
<br />
happenned, not just a la &quot;Total Recall&quot; but even in simple cases like 
<br />
swearing that you just parked in one place, but your car is on the other 
<br />
side of the parking lot.  Eyewitness evidence is the least reliable form.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, with actual mind-like hidden variables to play the role of your 
<br />
molecule, what you describe would be theoretically possible, yes.  I have to 
<br />
admit I have no idea what a &quot;mind-like hidden variable&quot; would mean or how 
<br />
one might think that such a thing could be possible.  But as any MWIer 
<br />
should know, hidden variables are unsightly stubble.  I recommend Occam's 
<br />
Razor for a close shave.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Most generally, we can imagine that a TOE defines both a global measure on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;individual observer-moments, but also a &quot;conditional measure&quot; on ordered 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;pairs of observer-moments, or perhaps longer ordered chains. There would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probably be some kind of mathematical relation between the two types of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;measure, but it wouldn't necessarily have to be of the form p(A|B) = M(A 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and B) / M(B) as you said. Do you see anything inherently contradictory 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;about this idea?
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to contradict the idea of an observer-moment as being an 
<br />
experience.  Experiences, by their very nature, are isolated things.  I 
<br />
can't see what it would mean for them to be linked.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;    It means - and I admit it does take a little thought here - _I want to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;follow a guessing procedure that, in general, maximizes the fraction of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;those people (who use that procedure) who get the right guess_.  (Why 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;would I want a more error-prone method?)  So I use Bayesian reasoning with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;the best prior available, the uniform one on observer-moments, which 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;maximizes the fraction of observer-moments who guess right.  No 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;soul-hopping in that reasoning, I assure you.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I'm not sure it's possible to take a third-person perspective on the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;self-sampling assumption.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third person?  Please don't use that kind of terminology.  I guess you 
<br />
mean an objective perspective.  In fact, it's perfectly objective to note 
<br />
that it is the best procedure available for people to use.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;For one thing, the reasoning only works if I assume *my* observer-moment is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;randomly selected
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just a reminder: you don't literally assume it's randomly selected.  
<br />
It's all deterministic.  You do set the fraction of observers who see 
<br />
something equal to the Bayesian probability that you would see it, but that 
<br />
is only a neat little trick that lets you guess well.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;--I can't use anyone else's or I may get incorrect results, as if I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reasoned from Adam and Eve's point of view in the doomsday argument.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not sure what you are saying here, but certainly you have to use 
<br />
what you see, rather than what you don't see.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Then there is what Nick Bostrom calls the &quot;problem of the reference class,&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and I think there is a very good case to be made that the problem can only 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be solved by making reference to some sort of objective measure of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;consciousness level&quot; of a particular observer-moment. For example, suppose 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I find that I was created as one of two &quot;batches&quot; of humans, the first 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;batch containing 950 members and the second containing only 50. One batch 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is all-male and the other is all-female, and I know that which batch is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;which sex was determined by a coinflip, so that a third-person observer 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would say there is a 50% chance that the large batch is the male batch. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;However, since I observe myself to be a male, I use the self-sampling 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;assumption to reason that there is actually a 95% chance that the large 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;batch was all-male, simply because I'm assuming that I'm as likely to be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;any human as any other, and 95% of the humans were members of the large 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;batch.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OK so far, with the disclaimer I gave already regarding &quot;likely to be&quot; 
<br />
language.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;All right so far. But suppose I now find out that one of the two batches 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;was genetically engineered to lack a brain, having no consciousness 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;whatsoever?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;... the &quot;females&quot; in this experiment are going to totally lack 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consciousness.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe you shouldn't have used that particular example ...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's really not a problem.  The procedure works because most of the 
<br />
people that use it will guess as well as possible.  Therefore, it is not 
<br />
designed to work for people that can't use it or that are statues.  You must 
<br />
assume a priori that you are capable of Bayesian reasoning.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the reference class consists of those people capable of 
<br />
Bayesian reasoning.  (Or indeed, those who in fact use it.)  Using this is 
<br />
not arbritrary and there is nothing mystical or magical about it.  It's just 
<br />
that this criterion ensures that the maximum fraction of people who do use 
<br />
it (and therefore _can use it_) will guess well.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, only the humans could use it, so there should be no 
<br />
correlation between the batch size you guess and the gender you are.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I think this should be a matter of degree, rather than an all-or-nothing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;affair.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only to the extent that some creatures might be more or less likely to 
<br />
use the reasoning procedure.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I think other animals, at least other mammals and birds, almost certainly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have some kind of high-level conscious experience, so there is &quot;something 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it is like&quot; to be them, but I don't think I should reason as if I was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;randomly sampled from the set of all these animals, either.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right.  It's as I said above.  By no means do I imply that you must be 
<br />
able to use Bayesian reasoning in order to have consciousness, just that you 
<br />
need to use it in order to be in the correct reference class.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Indeed, I don't think it's just a lucky break that I find myself to be a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;member of what is probably the most intelligent species that has ever 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;existed on planet earth, despite the fact that the number of animals who 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have everlived probably vastly outweighs the number of homo sapiens who 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have ever lived. I think some sort of graded anthropic principle is likely 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to be responsible here...the usual self-sampling assumption perhaps needs 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to be replaced by some kind of weighted self-sampling assumption, with the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;weights&quot; on an observer-moment having something to do with the complexity 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the consciousness involved. Indeed, I think it would be particularly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;elegant if the whole global measure function turned out to be nothing but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this sort of weighted self-sampling assumption, although the weights would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probably have to be determined by more than *just* the level of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consciousness (after all, an observer-moment experiencing a white rabbit 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;could be just as complex as a 'normal' one).
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think you're making the whole question a lot more mysterious and 
<br />
complicated than you need to.  Bayesian reasoning is a guessing procedure, 
<br />
it works due to the way it benefits the majority of guessers, and that means 
<br />
if you're not a Bayesian guesser you shouldn't be taken into account by the 
<br />
optimum procedure.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;In other words, I think a TOE should incorporate a &quot;theory of the anthropic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;principle&quot; rather than just adding it onto a sort of global &quot;physical&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;measure as in theories like Max Tegmark's. The anthropic principle/physical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;measure distinction seems to me to be another version of the old mind/body 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;duality, and it would be nice if a TOE could erase this distinction.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the way I explained it makes sense to you.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;So I guess I should repeat the question, when you talk about a global 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;measure on all observer-moments, what do you think this measure means? Does 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it just represent the &quot;number of instantiations&quot; in the multiverse, so that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;if the vast majority of observer-moments/computations turned out to be of a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;very simple nature, we might need to make additional recourse to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;anthropic principle to explain why we find ourselves to be experiencing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;these particularly complex type of observer-moments?
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That might be one of putting it, yes.  But it's a rather convoluted way 
<br />
of saying that, while most beings may be quite simple, the mere fact that we 
<br />
are thinking about this stuff means that we are at least semi-intelligent.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Or do you think, as I do, that the global measure tells us the actual 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probability that &quot;my&quot; current experience will be a given observer-moment, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and in that case do you agree that the global measure function must already 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;take into account something along the lines of the anthropic principle?
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should mention that the measure to be used in Bayesian reasoning is 
<br />
not exactly the same as the global measure on OM characteristics, since the 
<br />
latter covers all sorts of OMs.  The Bayesian measure is the conditional 
<br />
measure given that we are using the reasoning, M(...|B).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The actual non-conditional measure is still important for things like 
<br />
utility functions, since for example you might want to increase the measure 
<br />
of happy butterflies.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Well, you're assuming that reality itself has no opinion on the definition 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of &quot;me,&quot; that it all depends on my own choice of utility function.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.  Those are two seperate issues.  The definition is just something 
<br />
that allows people to communicate and to make precise their thinking.  The 
<br />
utility function just describes what you want.  There is no objective 
<br />
standard for either, but they are different questions.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Likewise, perhaps someone might have a TOE in which there is no &quot;objective&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;global measure on the set of all observer-moments, that each 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observer-moment would have his own measure defined by what he believes to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be real.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That makes no sense.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;But I think that in both cases the TOE should give me an answer which does 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not depend on my own preferences--as Phillip K. Dick once said, &quot;reality is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away.&quot; I don't think 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I could &quot;save myself&quot; from a hellish fate simply be redefining my utility 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;function so that only those copies which go to heaven are defined as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;me&quot;--whether I find myself in heaven or hell seems to be something imposed 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;on me by external reality, unless the flow of consciousness is a complete 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;illusion.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, it certainly is an illusion.  But again, your utility function has 
<br />
nothing to do with it.  You really have no control over your utility 
<br />
function: you want what you want.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for ending up in hell: by one definition, you end up both in heaven 
<br />
and in hell.  By another, you are just your current OM, so you end up in 
<br />
neither.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By another, you might correspond to a particular implementation of a 
<br />
computation - a mapping from physical to formal states, and in that case you 
<br />
I think you might end up in hell - but that's not random, it all depends on 
<br />
what the mapping is and what the physical situation is.  This one is the 
<br />
closest to what you seem to want, but remember: a mapping can easily enter a 
<br />
region in which the formal states no longer apply or are no longer changing, 
<br />
and then you'd be dead.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as for your utility function - it should give the same results 
<br />
*regardless* of what definitions you use.  Definitions are just a way of 
<br />
talking, and have nothing to do with whether the real situation that exists 
<br />
is one that you approve of.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I talked about this question in an earlier post called &quot;3 possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;views of consciousness:&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;1.  Consciousness is not &quot;real&quot;--our decision to call a system &quot;conscious&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;or not is based only on subjective aesthetic criteria, like &quot;cuteness&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;(Daniel Dennett's example).  The only facts about reality are third-person 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;facts, in this view.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;2.  Consciousness is real, but the feeling of continuity of consciousness 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;over time (the 'flow of related thoughts in time' above) is not.  In this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;view, only moments of experience exist, but nothing flows between these 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;moments.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;3.  Consciousness is real, and so is continuity of consciousness over 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;time.  Proponents of this view may still believe that identity can split 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;or merge though (think of many-worlds, or replicator experiments).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Presumably you'd choose either 1 or 2, although I'm not quite sure which.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not sure just how real consciousness is.  I'm basically a 
<br />
reductionist - that is, I think that the math contains all the facts about 
<br />
consciousness.  I'd like to think that, even if it's really an illusion, 
<br />
then it's at least an interesting or important illusion.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I'm somewhere between #1 and #2.  The only facts are those that are 
<br />
objectively true, and that includes some sort of facts about what it's like 
<br />
to be a particular OM.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;But do you think view #3 is &quot;crazy,&quot; or is it just quantum immortality 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;specifically that you find crazy?
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#3 isn't crazy the way the FIN is, but it's wrong and as I said above 
<br />
it's based on the illusion of remembering past experiences.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;It would be possible to believe in #3 without believing in quantum 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;immortality, of course...I do think that once you accept #3, as well as the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;splitting&quot; and &quot;merging&quot; of consciousness-streams, then are some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;thought-experiments which make quantum immortality very plausible. But 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;they're only plausible if you already find view #3 to be plausible in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;first place.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, even if you believe #3 there's no way the FIN could be plausible.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;    I've explained that in other posts, but as you see, the idea is indeed 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;mathematically incoherent - unless you just mean the conditional effective 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;probability which a measure distribution defines by definition.  And 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;_that_ one, of course, leads to a finite expectation value for ones's  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;observed age (that is, no immortality).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The &quot;expectation value&quot; is a problem, but as I said it's possible to accept 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;#3 without accepting quantum immortality. For example, there could be a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;null observer-moment&quot; (death) which any given observer-moment has a small 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probability of becoming at any given time, and this probability could 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;become large given enough time. Another interesting possibility is that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;whatever &quot;conditional probability&quot; we choose will be nonzero for *any* pair 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of observer-moments, so that there is some tiny probability that my next 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observer-moment will be completely unlike my current one--in situations 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;where the probability of my physical death is large (like observing myself 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;falling off a cliff), perhaps the combined conditional probability of my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;next moment being fairly similar to my current one is smaller than the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;combined conditional probability of a dissimilar next moment, so that I may 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;suddenly find myself waking up from a dream of falling as a totally 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;different person in a different region of the multiverse. In this way my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;conscious experience could be infinite even if at any given time I find 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;myself as a finite organism with a finite memory.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case I can see no point to the whole construct.  If you jump 
<br />
randomly to other people and lose all of your old memories - what's the 
<br />
point of being the original person vs. the other person?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Finally, if conditional measure and global measure mutually determine each 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;other in some way, there might be a way in which &quot;young&quot; observer-moments 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;could have greater global measure than &quot;old&quot; ones. Imagine an experiment 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;where I am duplicated, as in Bruno Marchal's example, once in Moscow and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;once in Washington. Then a year later, if a democrat wins the U.S. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;presidency, the Washington twin will be duplicated 1000 times; if a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;republican wins the presidency, the Moscow twin will be duplicated 1000 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;times. Even though this subsequent duplication happens a year after the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;original Moscow/Washington split, I think it could have an effect on my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;original first-person probability of finding myself in Moscow vs. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Washington (since after all this is done, 1000 out of 1001 descendants of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the original person will remember having ended up in the city corresponding 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to the future president)...we might then have the strange effect that I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would have a pretty good idea of who was going to win the presidency a year 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;from now based on whether I found myself in Washington or Moscow, even 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;though this prophecy would be useless to everyone else since they'd have no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;way of knowing which twin has a lower measure/probability of being 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;experienced.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people on this list think that way; I see no reason to believe in 
<br />
such hidden variables.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;something like the anthropic principle may also be involved in the fact 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that I find myself at this particular point in human history, on the verge 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of a possible &quot;technological singularity&quot; which could make my indefinite 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;survival seem entirely natural (see
</em><br />
<a href="http://www.aleph.se/Trans/Global/Singularity/">http://www.aleph.se/Trans/Global/Singularity/</a>).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a bit more pessimistic ...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How about this scenario.  In the future, humanity could be replaced by a 
<br />
machine.  That is, at first there may be many machines, but they will reduce 
<br />
their numbers - not by dying, but by merging into one being, thus losing 
<br />
measure.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;So, there are a variety of ways I can imagine solving the &quot;expected age&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;problem without having to throw out quantum immortality.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You haven't done so.  Even if the present measure is proportional to the 
<br />
number of future copies, the total measure would remain constant as a 
<br />
function of time (as future guys have less measure per capita but greater 
<br />
numbers), so the expected age would still diverge.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I expect you'll find them all somewhat crazy...that's why, for now, I'd 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;rather focus on the more general question of whether you think it's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;completely impossible that the correct TOE would make continuity of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consciousness into something &quot;objective&quot; rather than something defined only 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;by our own choices about utility functions.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's an illusion.  Why should it be real as well?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You see a floating man; it's certain that there are smoke and mirrors on 
<br />
the stage producing the illusion of that floating man, you saw that 
<br />
equipment backstage before the show.  You even know how the trick can be 
<br />
done.  Why do you put such stock into the idea that in addition to all that, 
<br />
there is really a floating man there?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I don't entirely rule out the possibility that continuity of consciousness 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is a kind of illusion, but I still don't see how you can have grounds to be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sure that it is.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure, eh?  I'm 'sure'.  But I'm a scientist, not a mathematician.
