<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Instead of those memories they have other memories. We forget things all

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;for information loss anyway. My point is then that we should forget about

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;all of the information contained in the OM and just sample from the entire

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;set of OMs.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The notion of a ''successor'' is not a fundamental notion at all. You can

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;define it any way you like. It will not lead to any conflict with any

</em><br />
<br />You are right about death with a (not completely up to date) backup of your 
<br />
mind being equivalent to memory loss, and you are right about the notion of 
<br />
a successor not being fundamental to physics. Nevertheless, we can still ask 
<br />
questions *given* our innate &quot;theory&quot; of personal identity, which has 
<br />
evolved to be very powerful and difficult to change, and very consistent 
<br />
from person to person. What this means is that if I were facing imminent 
<br />
execution, try as I might, I would not get much consolation from the belief 
<br />
that other versions of me in the multiverse will not be killed. In fact, I 
<br />
don't really care what happens to versions of me in parallel branches. What 
<br />
I care about is what is happening to me now, and what will happen to me in 
<br />
the future. When I consider my immediate future, I consider and worry about 
<br />
the fate of all those versions of me who remember almost everything about me 
<br />
up to and including the present moment, which for them will be a moment ago. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the future comes and I find myself to be one of the aforementioned 
<br />
versions, I immediately lose interest in all the other parallel versions, 
<br />
because they are no longer potentially me.
<br />
<br />Using the above structure, at the point where I am just about to have the 
<br />
lethal injection, what I hope for is that there will be at least one version 
<br />
of me in the multiverse who has just experienced having the injection a 
<br />
moment ago, but has somehow survived. In other words, if one or more such 
<br />
versions exist anywhere in the multiverse, then this is necessary and 
<br />
sufficient for me to survive my execution.
<br />
<br />It may be easy to find logical flaws in the above credo, but I maintain that 
<br />
it is so deeply ingrained in each of us that it would be very difficult to 
<br />
overcome, except perhaps on the intellectual level. One could imagine other 
<br />
beliefs about personal identity that might have evolved if there were the 
<br />
appropriate selection pressure; for example, identifying as part of a group 
<br />
or swarm organism. The point is, our belief is not scientifically or 
<br />
philosophically &quot;right&quot;; it is just our belief.
