Assuming there is just one real universe, a natural question would be
<br />
which universe is real. The traditional bayesian way of answering this
<br />
question would be to use something like the principal of indifference to
<br />
come up with a prior probability for each possible universe being real,
<br />
and then take into account any knowledge one might have about the real
<br />
universe to compute a posterior probability. I'm going to give that a try. 
<br />
<br />Suppose the only thing you know about the real universe is that it is the
<br />
output of some program running on some particular universal prefix machine
<br />
U. The principal of indifference would tell you to assign a uniform
<br />
distribution for the input tape of this machine. That is, each cell of the
<br />
input tape has probability 1/2 of being 0 and 1/2 of being 1, independent
<br />
of all other cells. It's not clear where the knowledge that the universe
<br />
is the output of a computer program comes from, but let's use this
<br />
distribution as the prior and see what happens. This setup is very similar
<br />
to the one in Juergen Schmidhuber's paper, except we have only one prefix
<br />
machine running one program. It turns out to have counter-intuitive
<br />
consequences.
<br />
<br />One piece of information about the real universe you have direct access to
<br />
is your own mind state. This is captured in the statement D = &quot;The real
<br />
universe contains at least one person with mind state M&quot; where M is your
<br />
current mind state. I'm going to assume this is the ONLY piece of
<br />
information about the real universe you have direct access to. Everything
<br />
else must be computed from the prior and this data. The justification for
<br />
this is that I can't think of any other information that is not part of or
<br />
derived from D.
<br />
<br />Right away you know that any universe that does not contain at least one
<br />
person with mind state M cannot be real. It's also not hard to see that
<br />
for any two universes that both contain at least one person with mind
<br />
state M, the ratio of their posterior probabilities is the same as the
<br />
ratio of their priors. This means the universe most likely to be real
<br />
given D is the one that has the highest prior among the universes that
<br />
contain at least one person with mind state M.
<br />
<br />I don't have a proof for this, but I'm fairly confident that for any
<br />
reasonable prefix machine U and normal human mind state M, this universe
<br />
would be the counting universe, i.e. the universe generated by the program
<br />
that enumerates all possible bit strings. This is because the counting
<br />
program is the shortest program whose output includes at least one
<br />
encoding of a person with mind state M.
<br />
<br />Well the conclusion is really absurd, but is there anything wrong with the
<br />
argument? If not we'll have to either come up with another prior for the
<br />
1UH, or give it up. I think it may not be possible to find a non-contrived
<br />
prior for the 1UH that would lead to intuitive results, but I'll have to
<br />
work out the arguments for that.
