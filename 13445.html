What do others on this list think about Mark Tegmark's definition of
<br />
consciousness:
<br />
<br />&quot;I believe that consciousness is, essentially, the way information
<br />
feels when being processed. Since matter can be arranged to process
<br />
information in numerous ways of vastly varying complexity, this
<br />
implies a rich variety of levels and types of consciousness.&quot;

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; How do you derive (a) ethics and (b) human-friendly ethics from reflective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; intelligence?  I don't see why an AI should decide to destroy the world,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; save the world, or do anything at all to the world, unless it started
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; off
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; with axioms and goals which pushed it in a particular direction.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; When reflective intelligence is applied to cognitive systems which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; reason about teleological concepts (which include values, motivations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; etc) the result is conscious 'feelings'.  Reflective intelligence,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; recall, is the ability to correctly reason about cognitive systems.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; When applied to cognitive systems reasoning about teleological
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; concepts this means the ability to correctly determine the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; motivational 'states' of self and others - as mentioned - doing this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; rapidly and accuracy generates 'feelings'.  Since, as has been known
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; since Hume, feelings are what ground ethics, the generation of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; feelings which represent accurate tokens about motivational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; automatically leads to ethical behaviour.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Determining the motivational states of others does not necessarily involve
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; feelings or empathy. It has been historically very easy to assume that other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; species or certain members of our own species either lack feelings or, if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they have them, it doesn't matter. Moreover, this hasn't prevented people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from determining the motivations of inferior beings in order to exploit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them. So although having feelings may be necessary for ethical behaviour, it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is not sufficient.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bad behaviour in humans is due to a deficit in reflective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; intelligence.  It is known for instance, that psychopaths have great
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; difficulty perceiving fear and sadness and negative motivational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; states in general.  Correct representation of motivational states is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; correlated with ethical behaviour.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Psychopaths are often very good at understanding other peoples' feelings, as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evidenced by their ability to manipulate them. The main problem is that they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't *care* about other people; they seem to lack the ability to be moved
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by other peoples' emotions and lack the ability to experience emotions such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as guilt. But this isn't part of a general inability to feel emotion, as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they often present as enraged, entitled, depressed, suicidal, etc., and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; these emotions are certainly enough to motivate them. Psychopaths have a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; slightly different set of emotions, regulated in a different way compared to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the rest of us, but are otherwise cognitively intact.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thus it appears that reflective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; intelligence is automatically correlated with ethical behaviour.  Bear
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in mind, as I mentioned that: (1) There are in fact three kinds of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; general intelligence, and only one of them ('reflective intelligence')
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is correlated with ethics.    The other two are not.  A deficit in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; reflective intelligence does not affect the other two types of general
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; intelligence (which is why for instance psychopaths could still score
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; highly in IQ tests).  And (2) Reflective intelligence in human beings
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is quite weak.  This is the reason why intelligence does not appear to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; be much correlated with ethics in humans.  But this fact in no way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; refutes the idea that a system with full and strong reflective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; intelligence would automatically be ethical.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps I haven't quite understood your definition of reflective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intelligence. It seems to me quite possible to &quot;correctly reason about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cognitive systems&quot;, at least well enough to predict their behaviour to a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; useful degree, and yet not care at all about what happens to them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Furthermore, it seems possible to me to do this without even suspecting that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the cognitive system is conscious, or at least without being sure that it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious.
