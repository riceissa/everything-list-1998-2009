Stathis:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Stathis [from the other posting again]: 'There is good reason to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;believe that the third person observable behaviour of the brain can
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be emulated, because the brain is just chemical reactions and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chemistry is a well-understood field.'
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MP: Once again it depends what you mean. Does 'Third person
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;observable behaviour of the brain' include EEG recordings and the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;output of MRI imaging? Or do you mean just the movements of muscles
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which is the main indicator of brain activity? If the former then I
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;think that would be very hard, perhaps impossible; if the latter
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;however, that just might be achievable.
<br />
<br /><br />Huh? I think it would be a relatively trivial matter to emulate MRI and 
<br />
EEG data, certainly compared to emulating behaviour as evidenced by 
<br />
muscle activity (complex, intelligent behaviour such as doing science or 
<br />
writing novels is after all just muscle activity, which is just chemical 
<br />
reactions in the muscles triggered by chemical reactions in the brain). &quot;
<br />
<br />MP: 'relatively trivial'? I think perhaps you underestimate what it 
<br />
involved; '... the brain is just chemical reactions, and chemistry is a 
<br />
well-understood field' reinforces this view. My point is that it is NOT 
<br />
just chemical reactions, but chemical reactions which take place in 
<br />
embodiment of multiple overlapping, inter-penetrating and 
<br />
self-organising hierarchies of dynamic structures. I think that various 
<br />
avenues of research are showing that a key feature of brain functioning 
<br />
which 'binds' together the 'just chemical' activities of multiple brain 
<br />
regions at any given moment and simultaneously at multiple scales of 
<br />
size, intensity and frequencies, is the harmonic resonance and 
<br />
interference patterns generated by wave forms which are made up of the 
<br />
combined actions of billions of neurons propagating thousands of 
<br />
impulses per second to form dynamic interaction patterns.
<br />
<br />I think the only way to truly grasp the scope of what is occurring is 
<br />
through visual imagination but linking one's ideas also to the 
<br />
experience of musical polyphony and rhythms. The trick is to 'see' in 
<br />
the mind's eye that the *effective* structures which make things happen 
<br />
and which constitute our experiences are in fact the wave patterns 
<br />
composed of swarms [or flocks, herds, shoals, clouds] of 
<br />
depolarisations. The neurons, ganglia, and whatever other 'physical' 
<br />
structural features you like to think about, are WHERE the dynamic 
<br />
interaction structures take place. Much work has been done to show that 
<br />
synapses vary in a metastable way in response to how they are used by 
<br />
the interaction patterns in which they participate, as also do dendrites 
<br />
which may move, extend, contract or die off in response to how they are 
<br />
used. The figurative nature of these patterns is embodied in the 
<br />
multiple, distributed locations in which most of their activity takes 
<br />
place and also in the characteristic temporal consistency of interaction 
<br />
between the spatially discrete or contiguous but contrastive locations. 
<br />
Furthermore it seems very likely, if not yet certain, that many 
<br />
synergistic effects will be occurring such as the occurrence of electric 
<br />
fields oscillating in directions orthogonal to the propagation of impulses.
<br />
<br />MRI scans may be very good for pinpointing the topological features of 
<br />
this dynamic activity but not so the temporal details. On the other hand 
<br />
EEG records can give much better detail for some temporal features but 
<br />
the spatial resolution is very course and confined to areas near the 
<br />
skull. New techniques using laser beams passed through parts of the 
<br />
brain are capable of giving millisecond resolution to some events 
<br />
occurring deeper within. So also can very thin electrodes which report 
<br />
events within or near individual neurons, but here the problem is the 
<br />
limit to how many needles are allowed to be inserted into a human 
<br />
cortical pin cushion: not many! One day though someone is going to 
<br />
develop a kind of nanobot which can migrate unobtrusively through brain 
<br />
tissue and broadcast radio pulses describing the activity of neurons 
<br />
near by as well as key features of electric fields and other ambient 
<br />
conditions.
<br />
<br />Stathis:'As for scientific research, I never managed to understand why 
<br />
Colin thought this was more than just a version of the Turing test. '
<br />
<br />MP: I think the key point is that successful basic science involves a 
<br />
degree of spontaneous creativity that is not merely an algorithmic 
<br />
implementation of rules, as opposed to, say, a competent chess-playing 
<br />
program or a merely classificatory program. It involves the construction 
<br />
of a new way of looking at the world, and then the testing of 
<br />
predictions which arise from the construct. In passing I would say this 
<br />
also is a key test for defining what is a REAL world. I tend to think 
<br />
that a Matrix of the eponymous Hollywood movie type, would suffer from 
<br />
being a Zenoverse: the resolution of time and space would be so lumpy as 
<br />
to REQUIRE a belief in a designer.
<br />
<br />Stathis: 'I can meaningfully talk about &quot;seeing red&quot; to a blind person 
<br />
who has no idea what the experience is like ... '
<br />
<br />MP: OK, but can he or she meaningfully understand you?
<br />
<br />Stathis: 'it is possible to conceive of intelligently-behaving beings 
<br />
who do not have an internal life because they lack the right sort of 
<br />
brains. I am not suggesting that this is the case and there are reasons 
<br />
to think it is unlikely to be the case, but it is not ruled out by any 
<br />
empirical observation'.
<br />
<br />MP: 'internal life' can mean a variety of things. One could be strongly 
<br />
tempted to think that some participants on the Jerry Springer [sp?] 
<br />
show, experience perceptual qualia but nothing else! I am pretty sure 
<br />
that the majority of mammals and birds are like this, reptiles maybe, 
<br />
fish also to various degrees. Worms and insects? I dunno.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     MP: I agree with the first bit, but I do not agree with the last

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     bit. If you adopt what I call UMSITW [the Updating Model of Self

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     In The World], then anything which impinges on consciousness, has

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     a real effect on the brain. In effect the only feasible zombie

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     like persons you will meet will either be sleep walking or

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     otherwise deficient as a consequence of drug use or brain trauma.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     I think Oliver Sachs's book The Man Who Mistook His Wife For a Hat

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     gives many examples illustrating the point that all deficiencies
