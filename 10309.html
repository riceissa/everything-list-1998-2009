</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Evolving. The evolution of the construct from state to state makes it feel

<br /><br />Why shouldn't it just *be* time ?

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; and that it's appearance

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Presumably, what is *necessarily* like when you are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in it , since there is no contingency in Platonia.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Platonia has not been instantiated. Our universe has. Our universe may
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; act, somewhere, somehow, as if it were interacting with entities in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; platonia, but that does not make platonic entities 'real' any more than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; real/imaginary power vectors delivered out your power-outlet make the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; square root of -1 real.
</em><br />
<br />You are in line with my prejudices on that one!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I await an apriori deduction of qualia from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; relational structures....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why stop there? What about an a-priori deduction of mass from relational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structures? Or space? Or electric fields? Or gravity?
</em><br />
<br />Most of those just *are* relational
<br />
structrures, AFAICS.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  All the same...and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; none of these have been predicted by any abstract model or 'lumpy/thingy'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ontological thinking.
</em><br />
<br />The physics we have is structural/relation from
<br />
top to bottom. It was predicted from observation, or rather
<br />
hypothesis/deduction/refutatin/confirmation...
<br />
<br />The question is what can futher be predicted from that. If
<br />
qualia cannot, they are presumably fundamental in some way...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The abstract model predicts things that behave
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'model'-ly. Parameters/variables in the model match adequately when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; compared to reality. They do not describe what it is actually made of....
</em><br />
<br />I agree. Physics goes no further than isomorphism.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; f = ma says nothing about what mass is. It says what mass _does_.
</em><br />
<br />I agree.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Of course: it is well founded empirically. We have abundant
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; evidence that only certaint things exist within a given spatial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; volume (contingency) that they endure through time, and so on.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No. We have abundant evidence of some'thing' behaving as per an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; abstraction of 'thing' at the scales we explore. We have NOT proven that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; these laws apply at all scales..indeed we have abundant evidence to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contrary! Absense of evidence is not evidence of absense.
</em><br />
<br />That is not really the issue. The issue is that only
<br />
some things exist, only some laws apply, and so on.
<br />
<br />Somethingism vs. everythingism.
<br />
<br />Time, in particular, is not a mere mathematical construct. It is
<br />
actually
<br />
quite hard, if not impossible, to capture the passing (a series) of
<br />
time
<br />
mathematically. That is precisely why Platonists and othe mathematical
<br />
literalists tend argue that it doesn't exist.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Timeless universe, universes where everything that can exist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; does exist, are not well founded empirically.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No they are not. Again a mathematical model (quantum mechanics) that seems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to imply multiple universes does not mean that they exist....
</em><br />
<br />There is a big difference between multiple universes and everything.
<br />
Physical multi-world-ism is basically on the somethingist side of the
<br />
fence.
<br />
Schordinger's equation means some things are definitely impossible.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Only that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; model makes it look like it does. I can imagine any number of situations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where the fuzziness of the ultra-scale world obeys the rules of a QM-like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; model.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For example, the perfectly deterministicly repeated trajectory of whatever
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an electron is made of through 35.4 spatial dimensions is going to look
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; awfully fuzzy to critters observing it as course scales within 3
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dimensions. QM depicts fuzziness... and 'aha' the universe is made of QM?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not so. It merely appears to obey the abstraction QM provides us.
</em><br />
<br />Fuzziness can be accomodated within physics in a way that
<br />
qualia can't.
<br />
<br />A 35.4 dimensional universe is just a minute corner of Platonia.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; QM says nothing about what the universe is actually constructed of. It is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not constructed of quantum mechanics! It is constructed of something that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behaves quantum mechanical-ly.
</em><br />
<br />Physicalism in general assumes that there is some substrate to
<br />
to physical behaivour/porperties...but it is assumed to be only
<br />
a bare substratee with no interesting properties of its own.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Perhaps this:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Waving a bit of it ('stuff', the relational-substrate) around in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; circle
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; (for example) in indirect 'as-if' symbolic representation as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; computation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; of an abstraction X in no way instantiates X or Xness,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Why not? What *does* implementation consist of ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Being the stuff, the substrate. It's the only thing actually instantiated.
</em><br />
<br /><br />hmmm. But if you wave a *real* thing around, it is surely
<br />
stuff, in itself...?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;  it instantiates
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; 'being_waved_around_in_a_circle_ness' from the point of view of being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; 'stuff' (1st person) and the behaviour 'waving_around_in_a_circle_ly'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (3rd
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; person). Note that the 3rd person is actually derived from the 1st
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; perspective of the observer! This third person can pretend
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; 'waving_around_in_a_circle_ly' is X, but that's all there is...play
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; acting.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; The third person perspective is manufactured in the eyes of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; beholder.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Perhaps rather than '1st Person Prime' as an assertion, maybe '3rd
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; not prime' is a lesser and more justified position. The fact is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; is no such thing as a 'third person'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Ontologically ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No, experientially.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Nobody experiences 'third person'.
</em><br />
<br />Everybody experiences a me/not-me distinction...even
<br />
if you want to argue solipsistically that hey
<br />
ar &quot;within&quot; consciousness.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Everybody has a 1st person experience
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only.
</em><br />
<br />I don't think so. My thoughts are 1st person in a way
<br />
that the keyboard I am typing on isn't.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is no such thing as an objective view. There is merely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behaviour called objectivity which serves to extract regularities which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subsequently become described with natural laws. If you care to treat the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; collection of natural laws as a kind of 'lens' through which to view the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe, then that view could be regarded as a 'third person view'. But
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nobody ever has that view. The universe thus viewed does not exist. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ontology of that view does not exist.
</em><br />
<br />How do you know ? Surely you mean &quot;it doesn't seem to
<br />
exist form my 1st person POV&quot;
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; What you have is a communicable 1st
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; person perspective that yet another 'first person perspective' can find
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; it looks. No-one ever has a 'third person' perspective.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Epistemologically ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No. Experientially.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; See above. The collection of laws as a set of beliefs is _not_ a third
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person perspective. Adopting the beliefs results in behaviours that enable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the prediction of 1st person experiences (the behaviour of the natural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world as observed). This is how science works. This behaviour (acting as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if the natural laws ran the universe) instantates the causal ancestry of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all our technology. It really works ..but..
</em><br />
<br />Well, maybe it works *because* there is a third person (or 0 person
<br />
world). Otherwise it is just a mssive coincidence that a lot
<br />
of different 1st-person views get coordinated togehter.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Any further attribution of natural laws beyind the status of (albeit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; highly structured and systematically calibrated) beliefs is not justified.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; =======================
</em><br />
<br /><br />Surely the refusal to believe in a pefectly good explanation for what
<br />
would otherwise be a mere coincidence is not justified.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The fundamental and, IMO fatal assumption being made here and throughout
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this thread, is that a _description_ of the universe acquired/validated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with 1st person experience (= our only and entire source of scientific
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evidence) necessarily means that a natural law thus established is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; literally involved in the structure and causal necessities of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe. This is plain unjustified nonsense.
</em><br />
<br />I disagree. Structure is alright as far as it goes. If you can predic
<br />
observations,
<br />
you are onto something. Only *something*, mind...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What we get with empirical laws is a model/abstraction that the universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; _appears_ to obey.
</em><br />
<br />Ye-e-e-s. But don't knock the &quot;appearing&quot;. It doesn't come for free.
<br />
There is an infinity of theories which the universe *doesn't* seem to
<br />
obey!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The models are very predictive and useful. But they are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; devoid of causal necessity and say nothing about the underlying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; composition of the universe.
</em><br />
<br />Having predictive power but no causal necessity is much better than
<br />
having neither!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Natural laws say WHAT but are mute as to WHY.
</em><br />
<br />I disagree. Any kind of law allows you to answer causal and
<br />
counterfactual
<br />
questions. They don't answer &quot;what is&quot; questions except by appeal
<br />
to furethe behaviour and structure (and atom &quot;is&quot; protons, neutrons
<br />
ane electrons,..but they &quot;are&quot; jsut things that behave ia  certain
<br />
way).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Take any laws of the natural world X. The physics of it is called Xics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (eg quantum mechanics). The natural world is _not_ constructed of Xics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The natural world merely behaves Xically in the specified context.
</em><br />
<br />Yes.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; That we happen to have a universe that is describable in models .ie. that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happens to implement the necessary calculi in the context of our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observations... this is a simply a property of the universe not yet
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explored.
</em><br />
<br />hmmm. Well it could just be a property of thrid-personness or
<br />
objectiveity as far as behaviour is concerned.
<br />
<br />Why not ?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The so-called 'unreasonable effectiveness' of mathematics has us
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; duped into a mass delusion that somehow the natural world is literally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constructed of our abstractions.
</em><br />
<br />Yes. But mathematics is effective enough to demonstrate objectivity
<br />
with regard to structures functions, laws etc.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Furthermore it also seems to have us duped that further considerations of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical idealisations and abstractions in general likewise tells us
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something about the composition of the actual underlying natural world....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for example that it is the result of a computer running one of our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; abstractions.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I couldn't agree more!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; As a result, instead of exploring the native structure of the universe as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a natural mathematics in its own right with all its axioms established in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a 'big-bang', we are diverted into mental machinations of entities whose
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relationship with the actual universe is merely an assumption.
</em><br />
<br />The vast majority of phsyicists do explore the mathematics of
<br />
the universe in its own right.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm hoping this also addresses some of David Nyman's queries.
