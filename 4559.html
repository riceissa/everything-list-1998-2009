said
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ok but here history has its basic inescapable role.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And brain physics or psychiatry should only make things
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; less predictable, I think.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno
</em><br />
<br />I can imagine that Immanual Kant could have had a similar
<br />
problem to that which I have been left with, in designing his
<br />
own categories. Kant is recognised as one of the greatest
<br />
of Western philosophers, and as well, always showed a
<br />
keen and continued interest in science and cosmology.
<br />
<br />Now like Kant, I see science and mathematics as a important
<br />
goal for further study. But life is changing so much today I
<br />
believe that there may well be a necessity to, at least
<br />
temporarily, abridge the necessity to meet every metaphysical
<br />
exactitude, dilemma and indeed sometimes somewhat bogus
<br />
problem  in quite so much detail.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;I pointed out here that a great many people go much further
<br />
&nbsp;than this, for example futurists and the like. (see for example
<br />
&nbsp;the work of Ed Regis for many examples of this). But Kant
<br />
pointed out that it is certainly necessary to have some kind
<br />
of rough roadmap (like for example his own categories) to
<br />
proceed from and indeed to frequently adhere to. And one
<br />
of the problems can arise if one does not have at least some
<br />
such roadmap. Now I would not, and more often than not do
<br />
not, disagree with Drexler but here I think we have a problem
<br />
where ordinary scientists throughout the field of physics can
<br />
see that Drexler must use the word 'nanotech' with some
<br />
meanings valid for the future but, even with the present
<br />
existence of  nanotech Institutes, feel that many of the
<br />
more useful applications of Drexler's work must be 'some
<br />
time away'. But science always wants to do its experiments
<br />
now, at this moment and here is where I may call lack of
<br />
at least a small level of  'metaphysical planning' can let us down.
<br />
<br />Hence I take the trouble to try to do a small amount of
<br />
planning or surveying first, not necessarily a large amount
<br />
of planning but enough to get us started withou writing
<br />
long philosophical tomes if I can avoid that.
<br />
<br />Hence I start with the four categories as defined on 19 April
<br />
and I quote:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I give four rough categories and do not claim other than pro tem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; practical (not metaphysical) justification for them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       1.Crowd psychology. (as can apply and be applied mathematically in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stock market shifts and pressures, etc.). Market surveys, neural network
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stock studies, Lewin, Leeper, Wertheimer etc but ultimately shading into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; category 4. at least for the three names just mentioned.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;        2. Religion. It could be God, (ones own or someone else's -
</em><br />
(partly
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; covered by 4)) etc.etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;        3. Statistical &quot;luck&quot;. May cover anthropic-type arguments,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; approaches like that of Rees (astro-ph/0101268) etc. etc. May also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lead to rational and semi-rational arguments about Newcomb paradox,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Monty Hall style arguments etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;        4. Psychiatry. Already much used by police in forensics trying to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pinpoint crimes, and more generally to predict reactions of people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; individually and en bloc, as I pointed out in this forum on the 16th.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ('monkey see, monkey do'). Often used for monkeys, people with damaged
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; minds etc. but can clearly find other uses, such as perhaps the public
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of a whole country. (Stanley Milgram's famous studies are probably
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mainly more 1 than 4, but since the categories are for classification
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only that probably hardly matters).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But these are just a few of the options and as I pointed out, what seems
</em><br />
to
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; work at least in a limited way is brain physics (approach 4), and this
</em><br />
has
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the virtue that quite basic and variable ideas can be tried, tested and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; improved on or disgarded. And most importantly it remains for the most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; part as science and not conjecture or simply educated guessing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I daresay marketing managers or science fiction film screenplay writers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; might prefer a different approach. They would likely want to use
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; spindoctors or image consultants etc.(roughly approach 1 with some 3).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br /><br />Accordingly for the moment I retain my categories as they
<br />
are and place semantic or formal history in category 1 and some
<br />
aspects of mathematical history in category 3. Category 3 thus
<br />
includes the Everett approach, Deutsch's work and so on - at
<br />
least until it can be better placed or the categories altered by
<br />
real need. I point out that the general Everett approach is
<br />
accepted a great deal nowadays in preference to Copenhagen.
<br />
So far there is no real need to worry at all about Copenhagen
<br />
in category 4. Category 4 by implication, blamelessly brings
<br />
its own mathematical baggage with it  (We might have had a
<br />
problem there if Penrose's model or schema for the brain were
<br />
accepted, and then might have had to adjust our categories
<br />
slightly but in possibly significant ways; however it is not
<br />
generally accepted at this time. So we do not have to either
<br />
do this, or even, quite importantly, need to make a guess).
<br />
Thus (like Deutsch) but unlike Penrose, we remain as described
<br />
within the mainstream framework of physics.
<br />
<br />Bruno makes an important point about history. Now here
<br />
we see that if by some chance Penrose's interpretation
<br />
of the brain turns out to be correct, then history may well
<br />
come into it in that it will be a historical fact that we may
<br />
have to revise our categories.
<br />
<br />Similarly if we, and by this I mean most scientists in the
<br />
world, feel that God  physically appeared from the
<br />
sky and said his say, at say 3 pm next Saturday afternoon,
<br />
then we certainly have to reconsider the work of  Vilanur
<br />
Ramachandran! At the moment this seems unlikely, but
<br />
will, at least for now, not stop us from worshipping
<br />
whatever God we choose which could for example be
<br />
chosen from the God-of-the-Month Club
<br />
<a href="http://community-2.webtv.net/magentashadow/GOMC/">http://community-2.webtv.net/magentashadow/GOMC/</a>
<br />
or indeed at the Church of our choosing.
<br />
<br />And while I have to admit that all this comes quite close
<br />
to admitting that we can set up a mathematical
<br />
axiom-system for our categories, for various reasons
<br />
possibly including Chaitin's work, Berry's work and
<br />
for excellent practical reasons as well - I do not
<br />
think that it as yet does.
