<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I take it you don't believe in &quot;quantum immortality&quot; or the &quot;RSSA&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br />Given MWI, you know what happens if you commit suicide. You may affect an
<br />
increase in your average well-being at the cost of a decrease of your total
<br />
measure. (By &quot;you&quot; I here mean the totality of observer-moments that are
<br />
subjectively similar in certain ways to your present observer-moment). It is
<br />
then depends on your preferences whether suicide is rational. I believe most
<br />
people actually do care about their total measure. If qm suicide became
<br />
common, creatures would evolve to care about their total measure. Such
<br />
creatures would get a greater measure. 
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suppose, without the MWI, he 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would know that on a usual day a deer is 1% likely to turn
<br />
up.  But since 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is not a usual day, but the day that will determine
<br />
whether he gives 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rise to a race, he would think a deer probably will turn up
<br />
which then means 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he won't reproduce.  (And not reproducing would give his own
<br />
case more 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;effective probability, which is why he thinks it's likely.)
<br />
<br />So far I'm with you...
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he believes the MWI however, then he knows there is a
<br />
branch where a 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deer turns up and one where it doesn't.  He knows that for a
<br />
usual day the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;effective probability of a deer turning up is about 1%.
<br />
Since he has no 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reason to believe the laws of nature are specially
<br />
configured to correlate 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the amplitude of the wavefunction's branches with his
<br />
actions (especially 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;since such correlation would be hard to reconcile with QM),
<br />
he will still 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;believe the effective probability of a deer turning up is
<br />
just 1%.
<br />
<br />You may be confusing subjective and objective probability. Let's say that
<br />
the subjective probability is 1%. This is compatible with the objective
<br />
probability being, for instance, 99.9%. Adam may be ignorant as to whether
<br />
the objective probability is 99.9% or 0.0001%, but his degrees of beliefs in
<br />
these two possibilities may be such that his subjective probability for deer
<br />
turning up is 1%. (Subjective probability can be set equal to the weighted
<br />
sum over the potential objective probabilities that the system may have (for
<br />
all you know) of producing a given outcome; the weights being given by your
<br />
subjective probability of each such objective chance being the actual
<br />
chance.)
<br />
<br />Applying this to the present case: he may think that there is a 99%
<br />
probability that the objective probability of deer is 0.000001% (&quot;no deer in
<br />
the neighbourhood) and a 1% probability of the objective probability being,
<br />
say, 99.9% (a deer is about to appear). After forming his reproductive
<br />
intention, the objective probability would remain unchanged, but Adam's
<br />
subjective probability that the objective chance is high (99.9%) would
<br />
increase dramatically (perhaps to 80%, just to pick a number), provided the
<br />
no outsider requirement is satisfied. This would lead to his subjective
<br />
probability of deer appearing also increasing.
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, in QM there will be many branches even
<br />
before that day.  So 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it's also true that branches will exist, with about equal
<br />
amplitude to his 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;own where e.g. maybe the weather was different and he chose
<br />
a different day 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to go &quot;deer hunting&quot;, where the Earth has two moons, or
<br />
indeed where the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;first man's name was Jack, etc.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These sort or branches do act exactly like regular old
<br />
alien worlds for 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this purpose.  Thus even if someone hands him a spin 1/2
<br />
particle, state 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unknown, he should not consider it just to have some
<br />
wavefunction which he 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;could apply the &quot;Adam paradox&quot; to like a classical coin; he
<br />
must also 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consider the already parallel branches where the equivalent
<br />
particle has 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some other wavefunction, and there are other versions of him
<br />
there to see 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it.
<br />
<br /><br />If there are all these other fat branches in the world, then yes, I agree
<br />
with that. However, Adam and Eve were there from the beginning, before there
<br />
deer paths had begun to spread out much as a probability cloud over the
<br />
terrain. Or at least we can suppose they were - that's the nice thing about
<br />
thought experiments!
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I do find the premise that he can be certain that no
<br />
type of MWI can 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be true hard to swallow.
<br />
<br /><br />He wouldn't have to be certain about that. 
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">		&gt;Of course, everything I say in the thesis is compatible
</em><br />
with accepting R=Ru 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">		&gt;(i.e. setting the reference class equal to the class of all
</em><br />
observers) 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">		&gt;provided one is also willing to accept the Adam&amp;Eve
</em><br />
paradox.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You still haven't presented any way to determine the
<br />
proper &quot;reference 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;class&quot;.  I suggest you use the logical approach: include all
<br />
observers.
<br />
<br /><br />I don't see what's so particularly &quot;logical&quot; about that. In either case, we
<br />
have to deal with borderline cases and such, and make some seemingly rather
<br />
arbitrary postulations.
