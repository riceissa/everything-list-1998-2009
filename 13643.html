<br />
David,
<br />
We have reached some
<br />
understanding in the 'asifism' thread, and I would summarise
<br />
that, tilted towards the context of this line of this thread, 
<br />
more or less as
<br />
follows.
<br />
<br />Existence -
<br />
*	The irreducible primitive is existence per se;
<br />
*	that we can know about this implies differentiation in and of
<br />
that which exists;
<br />
*	that we can recognise both invariance and changes and
<br />
participate in what goes on implies _connection_.
<br />
<br />I am sure there must be mathematical/logical formalism which
<br />
could render that with exquisite clarity, but I don't know how
<br />
to do it. Plain-English is what I have to settle for [and aspire
<br />
to :-]
<br />
<br />There are a couple of issues that won't go away though: our
<br />
experience is always paradoxical, and we will always have to
<br />
struggle to communicate about it.
<br />
<br />Paradox or illusion -
<br />
I think people use the word 'illusion' about our subjective
<br />
experience of being here now because they don't want to see it
<br />
as paradoxical. However AFAICS, the recursive self-referencing
<br />
entailed in being aware of being here now guarantees that what
<br />
we are aware of at any given moment, i.e. what we can attend to,
<br />
can never be the totality of what is going on in our brains. In
<br />
terms of mind, some of it - indeed probably the majority - is
<br />
unconscious. We normally are not aware of this. [Duh, that is
<br />
what unconscious means Mark!] But sometimes we can become aware 
<br />
[acutely!]
<br />
of having _just been_ operating unconsciously and this is 
<br />
salutary, once the sickening embarrassment subsides anyway :-0
<br />
<br />For those of us who have become familiar with this issue it is
<br />
no hardship but there are many who resist the idea. The least 
<br />
mortifying example that is _easy to see in oneself_ is what 
<br />
happens when we look for something and then find it: before we 
<br />
find it the thing is 'not there' for us, except that we might 
<br />
believe that it is really. Then we find it; the thing just pops 
<br />
into view! As mundane as mould on cheese, but bloody marvellous 
<br />
as soon as you start thinking about how it all works!
<br />
<br />But I have to *challenge you to clarify* whether what I write 
<br />
next really ties in completely with what you are thinking.
<br />
I'll try it in point form for brevity's sake.
<br />
<br />Behaviour and consciousness -
<br />
*	Consciousness is something we know personally, and through 
<br />
discussion with others we come to believe that their experience 
<br />
is very similar.
<br />
*	Good scientific evidence and moderately sceptical common sense 
<br />
tell us is this experience is _intimately and exclusively_ bound 
<br />
up with the activity of our brains. Ie the experience - the 
<br />
conscious awareness of the moment as well as the simultaneous or 
<br />
preliminary non-conscious activity - is basically what the brain 
<br />
does, give or take a whole range of hormonal controls of the 
<br />
rest of the organism. This can be summarised as 'The mind is 
<br />
what the brain does', at least insofar as 'consciousness' is 
<br />
concerned, and the brain does it all in order to make the body's 
<br />
muscles move in the right way.
<br />
*	People's misunderstanding about how we are conscious seems to 
<br />
centre around how mere meat could 'have' this experience.
<br />
*	The answer is that the brain is structured so that behaviours 
<br />
- potentially a million or more human behaviours of all sorts - 
<br />
can be *stored* within the brain. This storage, using the word 
<br />
in a wide sense, is actually changes to the fine structures 
<br />
within the brain [synapses, dendrite location, tags on DNA, etc] 
<br />
which result in [relatively] discrete, repeatable patterns of 
<br />
neuronal network activity occurring which function as sequences 
<br />
of muscle activation
<br />
*	For practical purposes behaviours usually involve muscles 
<br />
moving body parts appropriately. [If muscles don't move, nobody 
<br />
else can be sure if anything is going on]. However, within the 
<br />
human brain, learning also entails the formation of neuronal 
<br />
network activity patterns which become surrogates for or 
<br />
alternatives to overtly visible behaviours. Likewise the 
<br />
completely internal detection of such surrogate activities 
<br />
becomes a kind of surrogate for perception of one's own overt 
<br />
behaviours or for perception of external world activities which 
<br />
would result from one's own actions.
<br />
*	Useful and effective response and adaptation to the world 
<br />
requires the review of appropriateness of one's overt behaviour 
<br />
and to be able to adjust or completely change one's behaviours 
<br />
both at very short notice and over arbitrarily long periods 
<br />
depending on the duration of the effects of one's actions. This 
<br />
entails responding to one's own behaviours over whatever time 
<br />
scale is necessary.
<br />
*	Behaviours, once learned, become habitual i.e. they are evoked 
<br />
by appropriate circumstances and proceed in the manner learned 
<br />
unless varied by on-going review and adjustment. Where the 
<br />
habitual behavioural response is completely appropriate, we are 
<br />
barely conscious of the activity; we only pay attention to 
<br />
novelties and challenges - be they in the distant environment, 
<br />
our close surroundings, or internal to our own bodies and minds.
<br />
<br />Who? -
<br />
*	The concept of responding to one's own responses being the 
<br />
basis of consciousness causes some to complain that this implies 
<br />
some kind of infinite regress of observers. What actually 
<br />
happens is that internal brain behaviours [discrete network 
<br />
activations] occur as surrogates for all the relevant 
<br />
environmental features of interest, including one's own body and 
<br />
the storyline we are following. Where surrogates for 
<br />
environmental features are linked in with surrogates for 'self' 
<br />
[body and storyline] and with network activations that stand for 
<br />
relationships between those features of environment and self, 
<br />
THAT, moment by moment, is something which exists. So there is 
<br />
'something it is LIKE something to be' and that is what it is. 
<br />
The registration of novelty and the responses to it, reviewed in 
<br />
ceaseless recursive cycles, gives us the basis of subjective time.
<br />
<br />I have put this description in terms of 'behaviours' because I 
<br />
am practising how to deal with the jibes and stonewalling of 
<br />
someone who countenance only 'behavioural analysis' 
<br />
descriptions. I am happier recognising that most internal 
<br />
behaviours can be called 'representations' - it is much more 
<br />
succinct.
<br />
<br />Regards
<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thank you Colin.  'Eloquence' or 'gibberish'?  Hmm...but let us

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proceed...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; where I identify &lt;&lt;&lt;???&gt;&gt;&gt; as a &quot;necessary primitive&quot; and comment that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'computation' or 'information' or 'complexity' have only the vaguest of an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; arm waving grip on any claim to such a specific role. Such is the 'magical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; emergence' genre.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Just so.  My own 'meta-analysis' is also a (foolhardy?) attempt to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; identify the relevant 'necessity' as *logical*.  The (awesome) power
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of this would be to render 'pure' 3-person accounts (i.e. so-called
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'physical') radically causally incomplete.  Some primitive like yours
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would be a *logically necessary* foundation of *any* coherent account
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of 'what-is'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Strawson, and Chalmers, as I've understood them, make the (IMO)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fundamental mis-step of proposing a superadded 'fundamental property'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the 'physical' substrate ('e.g. 'information').  This has the fatal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; effect of rendering such a 'property' *optional* - i.e. it appears
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that everything could proceed just as happily without it in the 3-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person account, and hence 'consciousness' can (by some) still airily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be dismissed as an 'illusion'.  The first move here, I think, is to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stop using the term 'consciousness' to denote any 'property'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My own meta-analysis attempts to pump the intuition that all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; processes, whether 0, 1, or 3-person, must from *logical necessity* be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; identified with 'participative encounters', which are unintelligible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the absence of *any* component: namely 'participation', 'sense',
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and 'action'.  So, to 'exist' or 'behave', one must be:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) a participant (i.e. the prerequisite for 'existence')
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) sensible (i.e. differentiating some 'other' in relationship)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3) active (i.e. the exchange of 'motivation' with the related 'other')
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and all manifestations of 'participative existence' must be 'fractal'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to these characteristics in both directions (i.e. 'emergence' and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'supervention').  So, to negate these components one-by-one:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) if not a participant, you don't get to play
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) if not sensible, you can't relate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3) if not active in relationship, you have no 'motivation'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; These logical or semantic characteristics are agnostic to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'primitive base'.  For example, if we are to assume AR as that base,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then the 'realism' part must denote that we 'participate' in AR, that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'numbers' are 'mutually sensible', and that arithmetical relationship
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is 'motivational'.  If I've understood Bruno, 'computationalism'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generates 'somethings' at the 1-person plural level.  My arguments
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; against 'software uploading' then apply at the level of these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'emergent somethings', not to the axiomatic base. This is the nub of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the 'level of substitution' dilemma in the 'yes doctor' puzzle.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In 'somethingist' accounts, 'players' participate in sensory-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; motivational encounters between 'fundamental somethings' (e.g.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conceived as vibrational emergents of a modulated continuum).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The critical move in the above argument is that by making the relation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between 0,1, and 3-person accounts and the primitives *self-relation*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or identity, we jettison the logical possibility of 'de-composing'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; participative sensory-motivational relationship.  0,1, and 3-person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are then just different povs on this:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 0 - the participatory 'arena' itself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1 - the 'world' of a differentiated 'participant'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3 - a 'proxy', parasitising a 1-person world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'Zombies' and 'software' are revealed as being category 3: they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'parasitise' 1-person worlds, sometimes as 'proxies' for distal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; participants, sometimes 'stand-alone'.  The imputation of 'soft
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behaviour' to a computer, for example, is just such a 'proxy', and has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no relevance whatsoever to the 1-person pov of the distal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'participatory player'.  Such a pov can emerge only fractally from its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *participative* constitution.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; A
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; principle of the kind X must exist or we wouldn't be having this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; discussion. There is no way to characterise explanation through magical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; emergence that enables empirical testing. Not even in principle. They are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; impotent at all prediction. You adopt the position and the whole job is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; done and is a matter of belief = NOT SCIENCE.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, I'm happy on the above basis to make the empirical prediction:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No 'computer' will ever spontaneously adopt a 1-person pov in virtue
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of any 'computation' imputed to it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You, of course, are working directly on this project.  My breath is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bated!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For me, one of the most important consequences of the foregoing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relates to our intuitions about ourselves.  We hear from various
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; directions that our 1-person worlds are 'epiphenomenal' or 'illusory'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or simply that they don't 'exist'.  But this can now be seen to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; vacuous, deriving from a narrative fixation on the 'proxy', or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'parasite', rather than the participant.  In fact, it is the tacit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumption of sense-action to the parasite (e.g. the 'external world')
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that is illusory, epiphenomenal and non-existent.  Real players -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; participators - inherit the precursors of *all* their characteristics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from the primitives on which they supervene: hence the fundamental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'spontaneity' (i.e. 'given-ness') of the primitives must also emerge,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mutatis mutandis, at the 1-person level.  This is crucial, because we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can now stop gibbering about 'illusion' (which of course isn't to say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that we can never be mistaken).  Our personal worlds really are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'something like' - sensorily, motivationally - the explanatory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; primitives on which they supervene.  After all, sans magic, how else
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could it be?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Cheers
