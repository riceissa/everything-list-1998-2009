<br />Perhaps I should do better. The last Renaissance revived and polished  
<br />
the methods of Socrates and the other thinkers of the pre-Roman  
<br />
universe. The way the knowledge was re-assimilated was with a heavy  
<br />
flavouring of Roman fascism. The mathematical universe of Islam and  
<br />
the pre-Islamic thinkers had to be accommodated as well. The argument  
<br />
method (not the only method of exploring a terrain of ideas) was  
<br />
perhaps in use before, but Socrates had developed it into a formidable  
<br />
procedure.
<br />
<br />I am mainly concerned with the effect of Socrates. Pythagoras and  
<br />
Plotinus and all the other guys you love are in the pantheon of  
<br />
mathematicians - they are the &quot;Good Greeks&quot;. These guys knew how to  
<br />
ask the right questions. Socrates knew less about asking questions but  
<br />
he knew a hell of a lot about giving answers. Socrates never asked  
<br />
fishing questions. (&quot;Fishing question&quot;: a real and honest demand for  
<br />
information; you don't know if the fish will bite, where, when etc.)  
<br />
Socrates only asked &quot;Hunting questions&quot;. (&quot;Hunting question&quot;: when you  
<br />
have the animal - the target - in your sights.) Socrates wanted people  
<br />
to confirm his opinions which he would hoodwink everybody into  
<br />
imagining were the morally responsible ones to hold.
<br />
<br />&quot;You wouldn't elect your best athletes by lot now would you?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;No we wouldn't&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;So why would you elect your politicians by lot?&quot;
<br />
<br />The required response is embedded in the comparison; a fake  
<br />
comparison. The technique involves taking two really quite different  
<br />
things and making them appear the same. Its a kind of a magic trick.  
<br />
Works every time. However, there may well be excellent reasons for  
<br />
electing politicians anonymously (risk of bribery, corruption etc.)  
<br />
Pure sophistry. I love it. Aristotle was simply wrong so no need to  
<br />
bother with him anymore.
<br />
<br />But then, Socrates never set out to be a constructive thinker. He is  
<br />
nowhere as imaginative as Plotinus and Pythagoras. Socrates' purpose  
<br />
was to attack and remove 'rubbish'. Socrates will show brilliantly  
<br />
that all suggestions offered are wrong or faulty in some way. Not ONCE  
<br />
does Socrates offer a better idea. &quot;Not My Job&quot; rules with him. &quot;I am  
<br />
not here to help you forge ideas I am here to help you find the true  
<br />
ideas, the ones you can trust. Its just that you have to come with the  
<br />
ideas I criticise.&quot; He seemed to believe that if you simply attack  
<br />
what is wrong, or in error, then what you are left with will be true  
<br />
and trustworthy. This has left us with our obsession with criticism.
<br />
<br />There is a remarkable paradox in how the revival of Greek argument  
<br />
thinking in the last Renaissance served a dual purpose. On the one  
<br />
hand, humanistic thinkers used the system of reason and logic to  
<br />
attack the dogma that suffocated society. On the other hand, Church  
<br />
thinkers led by Thomas Aquinas developed the same argument logic into  
<br />
a powerful way of defeating numerous heresies that were forever  
<br />
surfacing. This argument/logic type of thinking became standard in  
<br />
seminaries, universities and schools. The paradox is that Church  
<br />
thinkers and non-Church (humanistic) thinkers found equal value in the  
<br />
methods. Perhaps this is not too surprising given that the new methods  
<br />
were a clear and obvious advance on the existing ones.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; OK - so get the bloody Athenian Academy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; doors yanked open and let's get this thing sorted out by golly! You
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; have great reverence for Greek thinking, Bruno - I just want to slap
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; them all around the gills for their lack of design, their lack of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; creative, generative thinking energy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You try to provoke me, I guess. I am not so much reverent with all  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Greeks. You know that I believe that Aristotle was wrong on  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; metaphysics, or at least responsible for the beginning of the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; departure from rational mysticism and Platonism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />Of course - I merely continue the triage of defective ancient Greek  
<br />
thinkers by one more Greek. Plato and Pythagoras and Plotinus and  
<br />
Euclid are all in the mathematic pantheon and above reproach (I won't  
<br />
forgive Plato the slaves or the fascination with Sparta, though). I am  
<br />
rather concerned with the legacy of Socrates though. The Greeks  
<br />
bequeathed us argument and democracy and we have wanted to keep the  
<br />
two together ever since because nobody can conceive of how to operate  
<br />
a democracy without argument. Plato gave us &quot;the Truth&quot; which we are  
<br />
always said to be after. So our traditional thinking system is like  
<br />
that: it is based on the search for &quot;the truth&quot;. It was never a case  
<br />
of being in search of &quot;the best design&quot;. Truth has to be uncovered and  
<br />
checked by logic and argument (supplemented by statistics and other  
<br />
methods). The result is a strong tendency toward negativity and  
<br />
attack; the very nadir of creativity in other words. Negativity and  
<br />
fear are seen to be a powerful way of uncovering the truth or,  
<br />
securing compliance with somebody's definition of it. Negativity and  
<br />
attack can also provide the attacker with a very seductive and  
<br />
addictive feeling of satisfaction as well. The Crusades were an  
<br />
exercise in taking all of this for a jolly walk.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It's all argument bloody
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; argument.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is what I like. I appreciate arguments. It is my way.
</em><br />
<br /><br />What's wrong with a simple discussion? Why does there always have to  
<br />
be a winner and a loser? Why do we have to make like adversaries when  
<br />
what we want to do is share perceptions and explore a topic? Why can't  
<br />
there be as many theories about something as heads in the room? We all  
<br />
lay out our piece of the mosaic and in the end we have the Big  
<br />
Picture. I try not to confuse thinking with perception. Argument, as  
<br />
the executive function of critical (vertical) thinking lacks design  
<br />
energy. Argument makes you right, that's all. Nothing is constructed  
<br />
or created by argument. Argument was never for the purpose of  
<br />
generating new ideas. Argument was invented to weed out all the  
<br />
inferior or incorrect ideas as a way of having some confidence in what  
<br />
is probably an arbitrary conclusion locked in by the original choice  
<br />
of premises anyway. Remember, after Goedel, any argument is only as  
<br />
good as its starting premises which can never be proved from within  
<br />
the argument.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I am right sir and you are wrong sir! The truth lies with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; me! No sir it is you who are wrong sir!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not at all. Once we argument, we never have to talk on who is right  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or wrong. We let people figure out by themselves. Science is doubt  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and doubt and doubt, and always doubt. Certainty and conviction is  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; madness. Plato never pretends to be right. He presents points of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; view and people discussing and trying to solve problems, like &quot;what  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is knowledge&quot; in the Theaetetus.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK - you are being very scholarly in your deployment of this word  
<br />
&quot;argument&quot;. I do feel there is more, much more though, to the  
<br />
scientific method than just criticism and attack. A hypothesis arises  
<br />
in the first place as an act of imagination.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; You are without merit! So what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; have these two guys created while yelling at each other?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The scientific attitude, in all direction, including mystic  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiences. It last for 8 century, and stopped when Justinien close  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the academy of Plato in Athen. It never really came back, although a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; few bits survive in the middle east and bubbled out in Europa later.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Just a little bit. The main fundamental inquiry (theology) did  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; remain in the hand of the &quot;authorities&quot;, making both science and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; religion a sort of religion. We are still, and actually more and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more so, victim of that schizophrenia.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />So - there it is. Just as I say - the Church banished creativity and  
<br />
the creative interpretation of information. People were forbidden to  
<br />
use conceptual imagination in understanding data. Creativity was seen  
<br />
as evil and suspect and the work of sorcerers and witches and  
<br />
alchemists. Anybody who could &quot;think&quot; in the medieval period better  
<br />
have good connections in society. As soon as &quot;thinking&quot; came back into  
<br />
fashion at the Renaissance, the Church once again felt threatened by  
<br />
rising levels of education in society and in some very direct sense,  
<br />
this is WHY the Church invented school. To impart the &quot;right&quot;  
<br />
knowledge to those who had the right beliefs. We cannot underestimate  
<br />
the extent to which education today is the product of this miserable  
<br />
state of affairs.
<br />
<br />In Japan, where there was never any exposure to Hellenistic or Arabic  
<br />
or Roman influences, it turned out rather differently. The Japanese  
<br />
never wasted any time arguing about the rights and the wrongs of  
<br />
anything. The Japanese method was to encourage everyone to think how  
<br />
everything might be improved and to trial as many ideas as possible. A  
<br />
high failure rate of ideas must be envisaged in this style, but the  
<br />
result is that innovation and design-thinking is encouraged.
