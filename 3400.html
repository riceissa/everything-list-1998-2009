<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; My intuition doesn't tell me whether or not I would have a 'feeling'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; free will if I were aware of my subconscious decision processes; but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; it's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; pretty clear that I could be completely un-conscious and still
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; behave with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'free will'; whatever it is.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My suggestion is that it's lack of knowledge of these subconscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; processes which gives you a feeling of free will. If you don't know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what a feeling of free will means (hence the quotes?) I'd suggest it's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the feeling that you reached a decision uninfluenced by anything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; external to yourself. 
</em><br />
<br />You're right, I don't think I know what 'free will' feels like.  Do you?
<br />
&nbsp;Have you ever had a feeling of no-free will?  The only think like that
<br />
I can think of is having a cramp, or a tremor or a tick.  I suppose Dr.
<br />
Strangelove must have had a feeling like that as his right hand tried
<br />
to strangle him.  I can't agree that it's a feeling that I reached a
<br />
decision uninfluenced by anything external to me.  Would that mean
<br />
putting on a sweater when I'm cold, or because I like the way it looks
<br />
wouldn't be free will.
<br />
<br />Suppose your consciousness were delayed even more than in the Grey
<br />
Walter carousel experiment (more than you now compensate for).  Suppose
<br />
there were a 3sec delay instead of 0.30sec.  I think you'd feel
<br />
out-of-control; even though nothing had changed about your decision
<br />
processes.
<br />
<br />However if you could follow all the subconscious
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; processes (you couldn't of course, by definition your consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; isn't aware of them) then you'd see that what felt like an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'uninfluenced' decision was actually the result of past numerous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; influences, which had caused your brain to have a particular
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; configuration.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, presumably you *could* be unconscious and have free will, in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense that your actions couldn't be predicted accurately by some other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; agent. (Try to swat a fly and you will see what I mean!)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; What if your subconscious decision processes became known to you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; *after* you had made your decision and 'felt' that free will. Would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; you feel something different then?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't see what you mean. You'd probably feel different from how you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; felt when you made your decision whether you became aware of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subconscious processes or not. 
</em><br />
<br />It's just a thought experiment.  I imagine that I'm in some amazing
<br />
brain scanner that is connected to a computer that has analyzed all my
<br />
past decisions, so that when I make a decision (like putting on my
<br />
sweater) the computer immediately displays a list of the reasons and
<br />
how they contributed to my decision.  Just the sort of thing that is
<br />
done with some AI decisions programs.  Would I &quot;feel&quot; any different?  I
<br />
don't think so.
<br />
<br />If you DID become &quot;aware&quot; of the s.p.s
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it could only be as the result of years of laboriously tracing through
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; neural connections inside some map that someone made of your brain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; while you were making the decision. (And presumably more years of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tracing through previous maps of your brain which showed how various
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; events in the past caused it to be configured the way it was at the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time, if you want a FULL understanding.) I'm not sure that you could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ever become &quot;aware&quot; of all this in any realistic sense of the word.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps a super-intelligent alien could apprehend the processes in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your brain &quot;at a glance&quot; and see what was going on, and THEY would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; feel that your decision was an inevitable consequence of how your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain was configured, but YOU couldn't.
</em><br />
<br />It seems to me there are two cases: In one case the circumstances and
<br />
who you are lead to a unique decision.  So the decision is
<br />
'deterministic'.  It may be to complex to comprehend, but at least in
<br />
principle it is explicable.  In some other cases it may be that the
<br />
decision is a close one and it goes one way and not the other because
<br />
of some quantum event that is *in principle* uncaused.
