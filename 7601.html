<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; True, it isn't always necessary to compute things in the same order--if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; you're simulating a system that obeys time-symmetric laws you can always
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; reverse all the time-dependent quantities (like the momentum of each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; particle) in the final state and use that as an initial state for a new
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; simulation, and the new simulation will behave like a backwards movie of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; original simulation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;One problem with this in practice is that it seems that the information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;needed to specify the final state is far greater than the information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;needed to specify the original state, at least with physics like ours.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In our universe, you could take a snapshot at some time that recorded all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the particle motions in a brain.  Then you could evolve it forward and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;produce the successive subjective experiences.  However, I don't think the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;snapshot has to be completely detailed.  Some sloppiness is acceptable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The brain is robust and you could change the details of thermal motions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;very considerably and the brain would still work fine.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If you took a snapshot at the end and evolved it backward it would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;also work, in theory, but in practice it would not work unless every
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;detail of every motion was precise to an incredible degree.  (This is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ignoring issues of QM state reduction and such, I'm basically considering
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a Newtonian clockwork here.)  It's like, it's easy to come up with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;motions to scramble an egg; but to come up with motions to unscramble
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;one will require absolute precision in every respect.  The result is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that the information requirements for specifying a final-state based
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;simulation that includes an arrow of time are exponentially greater than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the information needed to create a plausible initial-state simulation.
</em><br />
<br />I've sometimes thought that if uploads are ever created, and can be run in a 
<br />
simulation with time-reversible fundamental laws, it would be very 
<br />
interesting to take a snapshot at the end of a simulation and do the trick 
<br />
of reversing everything, but with a tiny perturbation--the simulation might 
<br />
appear to behave like a reversed version of the original run for a little 
<br />
while, but then the butterfly effect would probably kick in and the upload's 
<br />
psychological arrow of time would *reverse* in the middle of the simulation. 
<br />
What would this feel like subjectively, from the upload's point of view? 
<br />
Obviously he wouldn't have a memory of experiencing everything backwards, 
<br />
but it still would be interesting to interview the upload about it 
<br />
afterwards. For example, what would happen if the reversal of the upload's 
<br />
psychological arrow of time happened at the same moment that the entropic 
<br />
arrow of time reversed in the simulated physical world around the upload, 
<br />
and at that moment pieces of a vase were rushing together to reassemble, but 
<br />
instead failed to meet up exactly and just broke apart again? The upload 
<br />
should have a memory of seeing the vase fall, but at the moment it landed it 
<br />
might appear to behave very strangely, assuming the upload didn't just 
<br />
perceive himself blacking out at that moment.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If we then add the concept of measure based inversely on the size of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the information description, we find that almost all measure of such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;simulations comes from initial-state based ones rather than final-state
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;based.
</em><br />
<br />And perhaps something like this could help explain the low-entropy big bang, 
<br />
which is apparently the source of the arrow of time in our universe and yet 
<br />
doesn't have any agreed-upon explanation by physicists. It would certainly 
<br />
be interesting if even a complete theory of quantum gravity didn't explain 
<br />
it, so that the only remaining option would be either &quot;intelligent design&quot; 
<br />
or some sort of &quot;meta-physical&quot; explanation in terms of a multiverse with 
<br />
different types of universes having different measure.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But since I don't have a well-defined mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; theory of what it means for two computations to have the same &quot;causal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; structure&quot;, I'm not sure whether the causal structure would actually be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; different if you computed a universe in reverse order. When I think of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;causal structure&quot;, I'm not really presupposing any asymmetry between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;cause&quot; and &quot;effect&quot;, I'm just imagining a collection of events which 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; linked to each other in some way like in a graph, but the links need not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; have any built-in direction--if two events are linked, that doesn't mean 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; event is the cause and the other is the effect, so the pattern of links
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; could still be the same even if you did compute things in reverse order.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;From what I've read about loop quantum gravity, it's a theory in which 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;space
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and time emerge from a more primitive notion of linked events, but I'm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; pretty sure it's not a time-asymmetric theory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;My feeling is that causality, like time, is in the eye of the beholder.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It's not an inherent or fundamental property.  Rather, it is a way that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;we can interpret events in some kinds of universes.  Completely chaotic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;universes (where every moment is random and uncorrelated with the next)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would not have causality in any meaningful sense.  Likewise for static
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;universes.
</em><br />
<br />But if such a chaotic universe is computable, then for those of us watching 
<br />
the computation from the outside, the read/write head of the Turing machine 
<br />
is still obeying regular laws, in terms of when it decides to flip a 
<br />
particular bit or change its internal pointer-state or move from one 
<br />
location on the bitstring to another...if it's possible to define a 
<br />
mathematical notion of &quot;causal structure&quot; for any particular algorithm, I 
<br />
would think it would be possible to apply it to *all* algorithms. But 
<br />
perhaps no such mathematical notion of causal structure will be 
<br />
forthcoming...the reason I'd guess it is is that such a notion would seem 
<br />
essential for defining what it means to &quot;instantiate&quot; a particular observer 
<br />
in such a way that you don't count things like lookup tables, and also so 
<br />
that you don't end up concluding that random thermal vibrations in a rock 
<br />
actually instantiate all possible algorithms (the problem discussed in 
<br />
Chalmers' paper &quot;Does a Rock Implement Every Finite-State Automaton?&quot; at 
<br />
<a href="http://cogprints.org/226/00/199708001.html">http://cogprints.org/226/00/199708001.html</a> ).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In fact I would suggest that causality only exists in our universe in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;areas where there is an arrow of time; that is, in areas which are far
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;from equlibrium and where entropy is unusually low.  The problem in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;equilibrium regions is that you can always look at things two ways.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Suppose particle A collides with B and changes its course so that B
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;collides with C.  We can express this as that A causes B to hit C.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But all the physics works just as well in the reverse direction, in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;equilibrium, so we could just as easily say that C caused B to hit A.
</em><br />
<br />Well, that's what I was talking about in my last post when I said that my 
<br />
intuition of &quot;causal structure&quot; is not a time-asymmetric one, that it would 
<br />
only be about saying two events are causally related without specifying one 
<br />
as the &quot;cause&quot; and the other as the &quot;effect&quot;. And as I said, my 
<br />
understanding of loop quantum gravity is that it does involve some notion of 
<br />
building spacetime out of relationships between events without any 
<br />
time-asymmetry being involved.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Scerir has also posted some interesting paradoxes along these lines
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;relating to QM.  Suppose we have a photon that passes through a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;polarizer oriented at 20 degrees from vertical, then through one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;oriented at 40 degrees, and makes it through both.  At the end we would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;say its polarization was 40 degrees.  But what was it between the two
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;polarizers?  Conventionally we would say that the first polarizer made its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;polarization become 20 degrees and the second polarizer then changed the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;polarization to 40 degrees.  But actually you can just as easily argue
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that the photon polarization was 40 degrees between the two polarizers.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;That interpretation works just as well, a sort of retroactive causality.
</em><br />
<br />What would the MWI say about this? Whatever it would say, I'm pretty sure it 
<br />
wouldn't say that there was a single photon in a definite state between the 
<br />
two polarizers.
