Hi,
<br />
<br />[ALL]
<br />
Lee, I seem to have miss-attributed the source of my guffaw that lead to my
<br />
little outburst to Bruno. Apologies to all as appropriate... :-)
<br />
<br />[John Mikes]
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Brent, Colin and Bruno:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I had my decade-long struggle on 3-4 discussion lists (~psych and ~Physx)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about &quot;objective reality&quot; being really &quot;subjective virtuality&quot; - and I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; finally won. 
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Assuming (!) an existing 'reality' (=not being solipsist) also assumes
</em><br />
<br />Isn't this old sophist chestnut getting a bit tired? I am so happy to
<br />
_applaud_ your assumption. More than that I would add to the discussion a
<br />
demand from anyone who thought that arguing that issue justify how it can
<br />
possibly lead to anything useful other than the endless swapping of lexical
<br />
tokens chasing metaphor rainbows (double whammy metaphor there....sorry!)
<br />
followed by silence and no progress... for this is the empirically
<br />
available, supportable outcome of all such discussion, time and time again.
<br />
Time to just dump the whole thread as fun, intriguing, instructive, useful
<br />
training for 1st year philosophy and campfire rah-rah.... but not a
<br />
contribution useful to any scientific endeavor.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; that impacts arrive at one's mind (what is it?) which interprets them to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a suitable understanding within the limitations we have.  That is widely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; called the &quot;objective reality&quot;. (Brent went a step further in his &quot;agreed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; upon&quot; clause). It was exciting how differently the students of different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; disciplines gave in.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Subjective is ambiguous: pertaining to the subject (person) thinking, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pertinent to &quot;a subject&quot; to speak about. This later is frequently called
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; object. So we have a semantical mess (why not in this, too?) and we fall
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the trap. We have no ways (tools, understanding) to get to &quot;the real
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thing&quot; whatever that may be, sending those impacts to us. Agreed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intersubjectively, or not. (We - sort of - agreed on this list lately to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; speak about &quot;percept of reality&quot;).
</em><br />
<br />The practical effect of a belief in an objective view is the surgical
<br />
excision of the scientist from the process. Some clarity can be added here
<br />
by reversing ( a surgical resection?) that process and treating the
<br />
scientist (as scientists do all the time for absolutely everything but
<br />
themselves!) as a situated agent inside the scientists natural environment -
<br />
the universe. 
<br />
<br />I ask the list to simply draw this situation. Draw a scientifically studied
<br />
'thing'. Then add next to it the scientist doing the studying. Then box them
<br />
both inside a universe.
<br />
<br />When you do this you have applied the science of situated agency to the
<br />
scientist. The clarity that emerges is startling. Take a look at the
<br />
picture.. you will see that the John's &quot;the real thing&quot; is Kant's &quot;Ding an
<br />
Sich&quot; and that whatever it is, the scientist and the object of scientific
<br />
study are BOTH made of it. More than that, the universe containing them is
<br />
_also_ made of it.
<br />
<br />Then take another look at &quot;percept of reality&quot;... inside the cranium of the
<br />
scientist in your diagram is &quot;mind&quot;, which delivers a view of the studied
<br />
object in the &quot;first person&quot; to the scientist. Using this idea we cansee
<br />
immediately that we can indeed get at the 'noumenon' - the 'ding an sich' -
<br />
because we have conclusive proof that whatever &quot;it&quot; is, it delivered
<br />
subjective experience into the head of the scientist AND presents the
<br />
information accurately enough for the scientist to make really useful
<br />
predictions (via behaving objectively) via the descriptions provided by the
<br />
contents of the experience of the scientist...
<br />
<br />The existence of the subjective experience in and of itself is surely
<br />
definitive proof that we can scientifically investigate structural schemes
<br />
of 'ding an sich' that simulataneously provide the subjective experiences
<br />
that behave as per the empirical descriptions we then derive from its
<br />
contents. This is a massive simultaneous equation set and results in two
<br />
intimately related set so of natural laws...one about &quot;ding an sich&quot; and the
<br />
other, what we already call 'laws of physics'. Subjective experience can act
<br />
as an evidence base for BOTH, because the two sets of descriptions are not
<br />
in the same domain of knowledge.
<br />
<br />So I would definitely _disagree_ with Kant's assertion that the noumenon is
<br />
unassailable. There is one subtlety here... logically you can only get at a
<br />
science of the noumenon by forcing the science thus enabled to make
<br />
predictions of brain material. It is only in brain material where empirical
<br />
science is utterly voiceless.... (we have 2500 years of voicelessness here!
<br />
QED) in predicting structures and conceptual bases for the delivery of mind
<br />
consistent with empirically derived laws based on the usage of that mind. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; To Colin's experiment a question: are blind people not capable of thinking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; straight? &quot;scientific&quot; is an odd word and could be 'subject' to debate:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; IMO all sciences (conventional that is) are based on some model-view, at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; least are topically limited and observed within such limitations. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The new ways of 'free thinking' what we try to exercise on this one and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some other lists lately, try to think broader, if not quite without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; boundary-limitations (it would wash away whatever one could state into a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wholeness of ambiguity). Paradoxes, (unexpected) i.e. emerging novelties,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; axioms, givens etc. are products of model-limitations. The visual is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the only restriction we suffer from, simply the most studied one.
</em><br />
<br />Blind people can think straight, yes, but isolate them as situated
<br />
agent-scientists.... they have no means of apprehension or 'grounding' in
<br />
any causal way with that which is studied (at least in the visual sense).
<br />
Braille science of some sort could occur...I would argue the science
<br />
impoverished, not impossible. You can extend the argument by mentally
<br />
'closing the eyelids' on all subjective modalities...In that state the
<br />
cognitive agent-scientists would not be able to agree there was even
<br />
something there to study, let alone observe it... 
<br />
<br />Subjective experiences are thus _literally_ the causal ancestors of
<br />
empirical laws... not in a information flow sense... I mean LITERALLY as
<br />
hard physics - the noumenon dance -... a tortuous causal train that may be,
<br />
without it we would have no science and without it thus we would have no
<br />
novel technology. Just as Lucy is our causal ancestor in hard physics,
<br />
subjective experiences are thus _proven_ causal ancestors of all technology!
<br />
When the cognitive agent-scientist acting 'as if' the empirical law was
<br />
literally driving the natural world, the cognitive agent can configure
<br />
initial conditions which include a desired target inside the causal
<br />
trajectory thus reified. That is what technology is.
<br />
<br />This physics of the &quot;ding an sich&quot; I'd actually call &quot;ENTROPY CALCULUS&quot;, a
<br />
calculus which naturally bestows upon a suitably configured meta-mathematics
<br />
(here-after called the cognitive-agent-as-scientist) the physics of 'mind'
<br />
which would then include &quot;a personal identity&quot;.... a nifty idea, eh? Once
<br />
configuration of the entropy calulus makes atoms and scientists, where the
<br />
atoms inside a scientists head behave in such a way as to instantiate those
<br />
things resulting in experience.....One 'dig-an-sich' dance does it all!
<br />
<br />In this system we scientist are merely the metamathematics of an instantated
<br />
entropy calculus! No other mathematics ever gets instantated, except as
<br />
cognitive artefacts - abstractions - by the scientist... :-)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I thank Colin for the wise par about the 'objective'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />:-)
<br />
<br />...I seem to have gone on a bit! Sorry....I'll address other posts later...
<br />
<br />Cheers
<br />
<br />Colin of the ding-an-sich
