Hi Kim,
<br />
<br />I'm afraid I probably don't understand your question. It seems to me  
<br />
you are using in an informal context some  terms like if they have  
<br />
precise meaning.
<br />
I will make a try, so as to be clearer on the point raised by Günther  
<br />
and Abram.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1. A system with a defined set of rules but no definite description
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (an electron?)
</em><br />
<br /><br />Perhaps with a bit of imagination I can give sense to this. It raises  
<br />
an important question: can we simulate the observable behavior of an  
<br />
electron with a classical computer? I think that the answer is NO. For  
<br />
example if the electron is in a superposition state UP+DOWN, and you  
<br />
observe it with the {UP, DOWN} obervable, you will see it UP or DOWN  
<br />
with a truly random probability 1/2. It can be proved that such a  
<br />
truly random process cannot be simulated on a classical computer.
<br />
What you can simulate with a classical computer is the coupled system  
<br />
PHYSICIST+ELECTRON. In that case, the result of the simulation is the  
<br />
MW-situation PHYSICIST UP + PHYSICIST DOWN, and the probability 1/2  
<br />
comes from the fact that the physicist has been duplicated. So the  
<br />
probability is a first person point of view.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2. A system with a definite description but no rules governing it   
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (???)
</em><br />
<br />Theoretical computer science is born dues to the complexity of  
<br />
defining what &quot;definite description&quot;, and &quot;rules&quot; can mean. Without  
<br />
delving more in computer science I can only point to informal example.
<br />
<br />It can be argued that the set of true propositions in Arithmetic admit  
<br />
a definite description. For example we can defined it easily in naïve  
<br />
set theory, and we can have a pretty idea of what that set consists  
<br />
in. But we cannot generate such a set with a computer, and it that  
<br />
sense there can be no rule governing it. Most set of numbers are of  
<br />
that type. They escape the computable realm. For example the Universal  
<br />
dovetailer will generate only a tiny (but very important) part of  
<br />
arithmetical truth, indeed, with Church thesis, it can be said it  
<br />
generates the whole of the computable part of arithmetic. In math  
<br />
there are many things that we can define and talk about, but that we  
<br />
cannot compute. This makes the difference between constructive or  
<br />
intuitionist mathematics and classical mathematics.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Based on Abram's original distinction, as a way of separating the two
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; types of machine that Günther specified.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I would be pleased if someone can explain this link. Let me quote  
<br />
Stathis Papaioannou:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; From the SEP article:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Turing did not show that his machines can solve any problem that can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be solved &quot;by instructions, explicitly stated rules, or procedures&quot;,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nor did he prove that the universal Turing machine &quot;can compute any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; function that any computer, with any architecture, can compute&quot;. He
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proved that his universal machine can compute any function that any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Turing machine can compute; and he put forward, and advanced
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; philosophical arguments in support of, the thesis here called Turing's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thesis. But a thesis concerning the extent of effective methods --
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which is to say, concerning the extent of procedures of a certain sort
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that a human being unaided by machinery is capable of carrying out --
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; carries no implication concerning the extent of the procedures that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machines are capable of carrying out, even machines acting in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; accordance with 'explicitly stated rules'. For among a machine's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; repertoire of atomic operations there may be those that no human being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unaided by machinery can perform.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is this just being pedantic in trying to stick to what the great man
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; actually said? What is an example of a possible operation a machine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could perform that a human, digital computer or Turing machine would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be unable to perform?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I probably mention such an example above: to generate a truly random  
<br />
event. And the old Copenhagen QM, which admits a reduction of the wave  
<br />
packet,  could have inspired for a time the believe that nature can do  
<br />
that. But after Einstein-Bohr-Podolski (EPR) paper, even Bohr realised  
<br />
that the collapse of the wave cannot be a &quot;mechanical&quot; phenomenon, and  
<br />
most Copenhagians will have to say that the quantum wave function  
<br />
describe knowledge state, and not nature or physical systems. With  
<br />
Everett everything becomes clearer: nature does not collapse the wave,  
<br />
and thus, does not provide any examples of a machine generating truly  
<br />
random events. Randomness appears in the mind of the multiplied  
<br />
observers, exactly like in the mechanical self-duplication experience.  
<br />
That is why Everett and comp fits so well together.
<br />
<br />Of course Everett could be wrong, and comp could be wrong, and  
<br />
naturalism could be right: but it is up to the naturalist to say what  
<br />
is the machine's atomic operation that a Turing machine cannot  
<br />
complete. If it is the generation of a truly random event, and if this  
<br />
is based on the wave collapse, then I can understand (but you will  
<br />
have to solve all the problem raised by the collapse, you will have to  
<br />
abandon the theory of relativity like Bohm and Bell suggested, etc.).  
<br />
Or you say like Searle that &quot;only special machine can think:  
<br />
biological brain&quot;. In that case we have to suppose something very  
<br />
special about the brain: it generates consciousness. But this is just  
<br />
a blocking argument: it could be interesting only if it points on  
<br />
something special in the brain that a digital machine cannot imitate.  
<br />
Without such specification it is just equivalent with the *assumption*  
<br />
that the brain is not a digital machine.
<br />
<br />To escape the consequence of comp, a naturalist has to specify either  
<br />
a non causal mechanism (like generation of truly random events), or  
<br />
actual infinities, like a neuron with an analog infinite information  
<br />
state. But non causal events and actual infinities are not the kind of  
<br />
things that naturalist find appealing. I really know only Penrose for  
<br />
suggesting the existence of such non computable events in nature.
<br />
To escape comp, it is thus more honest to invoke supernatural thing,  
<br />
like in some (non platonist) &quot;religion&quot;.
<br />
<br />I am quite open to the idea that comp could be wrong, and I respect  
<br />
all those who believes so, but I will not hide that I do find the  
<br />
arguments based on nature against comp quite unconvincing if not being  
<br />
just dishonest hand waving directed by wishful thinking or taste.
<br />
<br />Except the very speculative and quasi-abandoned quantum wave collapse,  
<br />
nothing in nature points on any atomic machine operation which would  
<br />
be non-Turing emulable. Needless to say, collapse of wave is not  
<br />
really in the spirit of the everything-list type of TOE, but that is  
<br />
not an argument, of course.
