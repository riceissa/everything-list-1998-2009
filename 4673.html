Hi All,
<br />
<br />I have often try to explain what is mathematical realism.
<br />
May I quote the full section 24 of G. H. Hardy's &quot;A Mathematician's
<br />
Apology&quot; which explain so well what I try to say?  I will then make
<br />
some comments, offer an apology myself, and finish
<br />
by two conjectures.
<br />
Let us first listen to Hardy:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;There is another remark which suggests itself here and
<br />
which physicists may find paradoxical, though the paradox
<br />
will probably seem a good deal less than it did eighteen years
<br />
ago. I will express it in much the same words which I used
<br />
in 1922 in an address to Section A of the British Association.
<br />
My audience then was composed almost entirely of physicists,
<br />
and I may have spoken a little provocatively on that account;
<br />
but I would still stand by the substance of what I said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I began by saying that there is probably less difference
<br />
between the positions of a mathematician and of a physicist
<br />
than is generally supposed, and that the most important seems
<br />
to me to be this, that the mathematician is in much more direct
<br />
contact with reality. This may seem a paradox, since it is the
<br />
physicist who deals with the subject-matter usually described
<br />
as 'real'; but a very little reflection is enough to show that the
<br />
physicist's reality, whatever it may be, has few or none of the
<br />
attributes which common sense ascribes instinctively to reality.
<br />
A chair may be a collection of whirling electrons, or an idea in
<br />
the mind of God : each of these accounts of it may have its
<br />
merits, but neither conforms at all closely to the suggestions of
<br />
common sense.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went on to say that neither physicists nor philosophers
<br />
have ever given any convincing account of what &quot;physical reality&quot;
<br />
is, or of how the physicist passes, from the confused mass of
<br />
fact or sensation with which he starts, to the construction of the
<br />
objects which he calls &quot;real&quot;. Thus we cannot be said to know
<br />
what the subject-matter of physics is ; but this need not prevent
<br />
us from understanding roughly what a physicist is trying to do. It
<br />
is plain that he is trying to correlate the incoherent body of crude
<br />
facts confronting him with some definite and orderly scheme of
<br />
abstract relations, the kind of scheme which he can borrow
<br />
only from mathematics.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mathematician, on the other hand, is working with his own
<br />
mathematical reality. Of this reality, as I explained in § 22, I take
<br />
a &quot;realistic&quot; and not an &quot;idealistic&quot; view. At any rate (and this was
<br />
my main point) this realistic view is much more plausible of
<br />
mathematical than of physical reality, because mathematical
<br />
objects are so much more what they seem. A chair or a star is not
<br />
in the least like what it seems to be ; the more we think of it, the
<br />
fuzzier its outlines become in the haze of sensations which surrounds
<br />
it ; but &quot;2&quot; or &quot;317&quot; has nothing to do with sensation, and its properties
<br />
stand out the more clearly the more closely we scrutinize it. It may
<br />
be that modern physics fits best into some framework of idealistic
<br />
philosophy---I don't believe it, but there are eminent physicists who
<br />
say so. Pure mathematics, on the other hand, seems to me a rock
<br />
on which all idealism founders: 317 is a prime, not because we think
<br />
so, or because our minds are shaped in one way rather than another,
<br />
but *because it is so*, because mathematical reality is built that way.&quot;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;G. H. Hardy,   &quot;A Mathematician's Apology&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cambridge University Press, 1940.
<br />
<br />Comment:
<br />
-Idealism is what we call solipsism or subjective idealism, as opposed
<br />
to objective idealism, or platonism and which Hardy called
<br />
mathematical realism.
<br />
Hardy is a well known Number Theorist, and he exemplified his &quot;realism&quot;
<br />
with numbers. It should be clear, from preceding posts, how much
<br />
I agree with him. Nevertheless I take such a realist position as obvious
<br />
only for number theory. I am less sure that such a realism is defendable
<br />
for set theory. For example no one would say &quot;R or C is well-ordered not
<br />
because we think so, or because our minds are shaped in one way rather than 
<br />
another, but *because it is so*, because mathematical reality is built that 
<br />
way.&quot;
<br />
It follows from the axiom of choice that all sets can be well-ordered, indeed.
<br />
But we can manage to build different set concepts for which the axiom
<br />
of choice is natural or is not natural.
<br />
In other texts Hardy insists very much on the importance of &quot;proof&quot;, and I
<br />
guess that is what makes, for him, mathematician closer to reality .
<br />
Consider Riemann Hypothesis. It tells that some function from C to C
<br />
annihilates itself only on a precise subset of C. It has been verified for 
<br />
*many*
<br />
(billions) values. But mathematicians will only believe it if a proof is given.
<br />
Once such a proof is given they will have a contact with &quot;their reality&quot; that
<br />
no physicist will ever have. But, by incompleteness, we can expect
<br />
that even &quot;pure&quot; number theory will be more and more experimental.
<br />
<br />Now, Hardy lacks Church thesis and comp and so seems not aware that
<br />
the physical reality could be mathematical reality &quot;seen from inside&quot;,
<br />
in which case, &quot;empiricalness&quot; can be justified by &quot;incompleteness&quot;,
<br />
and this, of course makes the distinction between physics and mathematics,
<br />
still more fuzzier.
<br />
<br />Apology: I have not finish my promised paper. I'm infinitely sorry.
<br />
Worst: I have begin a new one. The fact is that I begin to smell a shortcut
<br />
between &quot;number theory&quot; and physics. I have already mentioned
<br />
Watkins' website: <a href="http://www.maths.ex.ac.uk/~mwatkins/zeta/index.htm">http://www.maths.ex.ac.uk/~mwatkins/zeta/index.htm</a>
<br />
Actually this goes against comp and the derivation of physics from &quot;machine
<br />
psychology&quot; (alias the logic of self-reference), unless there is a connection
<br />
between self-reference and prime number, which is what I'm looking for.
<br />
<br />I am converging toward two quasi-opposite conjectures:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;-1) The prime numbers emulates (in some precise but technical way)
<br />
a universal  *quantum computer*.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;-2) Some variant of the self-reference logic emulates a universal
<br />
*quantum computer*.
<br />
<br />&quot;2)&quot; is a consequence of comp (cf my thesis). &quot;1)&quot; is currently doubtful 
<br />
because
<br />
the physics which is currently extracted from the primes seem to be
<br />
irreversible (which is not good for quantum computing!).
<br />
Still, I believe that both &quot;1)&quot; and &quot;2)&quot; are partially true, and that the 
<br />
difference
<br />
between the two conjectures can lead to a way of using &quot;pure&quot; number theory
<br />
for measuring the degree of truth of the comp hypothesis.
<br />
Note that in any case where &quot;1)&quot; or &quot;2)&quot; is correct, some Pythagorism
<br />
would be assessed. &quot;2)&quot; gives a more important role of the observer/machine
<br />
in the &quot;fabric of reality&quot;.
<br />
<br />Bruno
