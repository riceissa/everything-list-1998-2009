</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Let us try to be &quot;very precise&quot;, then. I propose you the iterated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; self-duplication experience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Assuming computationalism, we survive. (I guess you agree).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Here is the question. Do you expect the (infinite) sequence in {W,M}* 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; appearing on your t-shirt to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;                     computable   or   uncomputable ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; In case you want to restrict to the finite sequences appearing at each 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; step,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I propose then we stop the experience after 1000 steps. In that experience
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; do you expect the sequence of W and M (lenght = 1000) to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;                    compressible or not compressible ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Bruno
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Very precise? T-shirt? Never mind, I think I now completely understand
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;your reasoning.  Contradicting my announcement to give up I'll try once
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;more to point out your unspoken assumptions and what is unsatisfactory 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;about them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;You expect finite future observation sequences to be incompressible,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;because most binary strings are incompressible.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I asked you a question. I didn't ask you to demolish a answer I have
<br />
not given !
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The unspoken assumption is a uniform distribution on equal-sized prefixes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of possible futures. 
</em><br />
<br /><br />I am afraid you anticipate to much. I agree that in the finite case
<br />
the uniform distribution is funny and almost inescapable. In particular
<br />
if we do the experience, my computationalist moral and my democratic
<br />
feelings entail that I will listen to each 'Schmidhubers' after 1000 
<br />
steps.
<br />
And I will try to communicate with all of them, and feel more at ease with
<br />
the majority, who, as you agree below will answer &quot;uncomputable&quot;.
<br />
<br />But, actually, I do not pretend I am able to organize that democracy, 
<br />
and that distribution. Through *all* my proof  the distribution
<br />
remains  unknown. 
<br />
<br />What I have done is terribly modest (even if it looks like a 180 degree 
<br />
revolution). I (just) prove that IF there is a level such that I survive
<br />
a finite substitution) THEN the following are equivalent:
<br />
<br />-solving the mind body problem,
<br />
-extracting the laws of physics from 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;psychology/computer-science/number-theory.
<br />
-defining that distribution.
<br />
<br />At least, that is what I do in the first part of my thesis. In the
<br />
second part I show how to isolate the distribution by the
<br />
interview of the UTM. But let us forget this second part for some
<br />
time.
<br />
<br /><br />Note also:
<br />
1) with Everett: The iterated self-duplication experiment is not a 
<br />
*thought* experiment, just look 1000 times a Schroedinger cat and 
<br />
write M or W on your t-shirt according to the 
<br />
death/alive state of the cat  (of course each Schmidhuber will 
<br />
be isolated, and can still *pretend* (without proof) to be a 
<br />
'compressible' one).  
<br />
2) with comp : it is not a thought experiment either, the UD 
<br />
does slowly all the multiplications in the platonic realm.
<br />
<br />(But I see in your second paper that you disagree with standart QM, 
<br />
which does hold phenomenologically in Everett, though).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;When you say indeterminacy you just mean probability 2^-n for each prefix
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of size n. There is nothing &quot;shocking&quot; or &quot;weird&quot; about it (your words);
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you just assume one particular computable probability distribution on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;finite prefixes of futures. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;That's ok. Although it does represent a limitation, because there are many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;other computable probability distributions on possible universe histories,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and theories of everything (TOEs) should take all of them into account.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Then, however, you make a bold step and generalize from computable things
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to noncomputable things: you expect infinite future observation sequences
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to have no finite description, because most infinite binary strings do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not have one.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The unspoken assumption is a uniform distribution on all infinite strings.
</em><br />
<br />I don't make that assumption. I aknowledge that sometimes I talk like
<br />
I am doing it, in general to simplify illustrations of some point. Sorry.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The problem was pointed out repeatedly - one cannot generalize from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;finite prefixes to a continuum of infinite objects without leaving the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;realm of computation and dovetailers. 
</em><br />
<br />Here I disagree, but let's go on. (You are correct from the 3-person
<br />
point of view (3P-POV), but it is not necessarily correct from the 
<br />
1P-POV.)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Any dovetailer producing a growing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;binary tree can output only countably many nodes, never a continuum.
</em><br />
<br />I agree here ! But I am not interest in the output of the UD. I even
<br />
considered the UD as a typically never stopping nor outputing program.
<br />
You misunderstand my use of the UD.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The issue of 3rd person vs 1st person is irrelevant here. 
</em><br />
<br />No. It is *here* that the issue of 3rd person vs 1st person is quite
<br />
relevant. See below.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;So is the issue
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of enumerating the reals in a &quot;list&quot; - it is already enough to observe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that in countable time you cannot produce uncountably many things, only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;their prefixes.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK (but it will be no relevant)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;For a long time your claim that &quot;there is no computable universe to which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;we belong&quot; has not made any sense to me, but now I realize that what you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;really mean is just that if our universe is uniform randomly sampled from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the interval of real numbers then with probability 1 it is not computable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This is an ancient result.
</em><br />
<br /><br />This is a progress in your understanding. And my point has 
<br />
probably some relations with this ancien result, although I have not
<br />
prove that, still less use it in my thesis or paper. 
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Your underlying assumption is the existence of a noncomputable selection
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;process selecting one of uncountably many objects.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Not at all. The uncomputability comes frrom the fact that I don't
<br />
know in which computation I am.
<br />
I just do listen to Schmidhuber1 *and* Schmidhuber2 in the
<br />
(simple) duplication process, for exemple. In fact I don't believe 
<br />
there is any selection process. I give a similar status to each 
<br />
person (third person description) and I listen to the discourse of 
<br />
each one (first person descriptionS).
<br />
<br />&quot;Taking the two&quot; is really in the spirit of the *everything* list.
<br />
&quot;listen to the discourse of each one&quot; is exactly what Everett has 
<br />
done, in .
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This has nothing to do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with your computable 2^-n prefix probabilities above, or with computation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in the limit, or with dovetailing, or with truly algorithmic TOEs. You
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have a NONalgorithmic approach here.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I have told you before that comp entails a necessarily NONalgorithmic 
<br />
approach. If we are machine we cannot know which machine we are,
<br />
and we cannot know which computational pathS support us. We can
<br />
only make (hopefully correct) guesses. My realm is classical 
<br />
arithmetical truth. That includes a lot of definite but uncomputable
<br />
truth. I can guess you will, like most people who eventually
<br />
understand my proof, reject COMP (the arithmetical platonist part).
<br />
<br />But you should remember that the set of all total computable functions
<br />
has no total universal computable function. I should read more 
<br />
carefully your second paper, but the great programmer in the first
<br />
paper create and execute programs which does not stop on some
<br />
input, and this in some unprovable ways. 
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;To summarize: There are many possible computable distributions on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;equal-sized prefixes of futures.  You pick a uniform one, perhaps
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;because unbiased coin tosses seem natural to you.  But as soon as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it comes to infinite objects the uniform distribution is LESS natural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;than many others, because infinite sequences of coin tosses do not yield
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;describable results, and thus do not even exist from any descriptive point
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of view. You seem to think you can save the situation by &quot;dovetailing&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;over ALL infinite sequences constituting a continuum. But the continuum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is beyond dovetailing.  This forces you to leave the countable and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;constructive realm and invoke your nonconstructive &quot;arithmetic realism&quot;,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;whatever that may be. Your &quot;proof&quot; just restates that the reals are not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;countable, or that one cannot compute universes that are not computable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in the limit.  On the other hand you do assume the very existence of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;things noncomputable in the limit. This existence does not derive from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;your dovetailer argument, since the dovetailer always will stay in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computable realm. So you make a major assumption besides those rooted
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in computability theory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;---
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I guess Occam wouldn't like this additional noncomputability assumption,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this assumption of the existence of nondescribable things, because it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;unnecessary, given what we know. There are describable ways of assigning
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;nonvanishing probabilities to certain infinite futures characterized by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;finite descriptions.  Of course, the corresponding describable selection
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;processes will never select any future that is not computable in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;limit, but we can discard those anyway, because they don't even exist, in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the sense that we cannot even describe them, not even through a dovetailer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;which at best can output finite representations of all futures computable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in the limit, but never the full continuum!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Such reasoning leads to algorithmic TOEs as opposed to nonalgorithmic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;approaches like yours (or Tegmark's, who does mention Kolmogorov
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;complexity at some point but avoids details).
</em><br />
<br /><br />I am indeed closer to Tegmark. You takes too little. Tegmark
<br />
takes too much.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;As long as the distribution is approximable or computable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in the limit, one can show that only histories with finite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;descriptions can have nonvanishing probability, and that only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;histories with short descriptions can have large probability:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;<a href="http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/toesv2/node34.html">http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/toesv2/node34.html</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;That's why flying rabbits etc. are unlikely.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />To summarize: I don't make any assumtion on the distribution. 
<br />
My result is a reduction of the mind-body problem to the
<br />
problem of the origin of the machine's belief in thelaws of physics,
<br />
itself reduced to the serach of that distribution.
<br />
Some aspect of your work woulod confirm my work, unfortunately
<br />
that will not happen if you don't take into account the
<br />
point of views of the machines embedded into the *grand*
<br />
computation.
<br />
<br />Here you 
<br />
demolish an answer I did not provide. You miss my point because
<br />
you still don't see the relevance of 1/3 person distinction.
<br />
<br />I hope your are not really a constructivist because they don't
<br />
believe in neither the uncomputable nor in the third person.
<br />
They don't accept the arithmetical realism in my standart
<br />
(classical) view of comp. (They don't need to study my proof!).
<br />
<br />I appreciate your work, but my proof shows it is just a beginning.
<br />
You can reject my &quot;classical comp&quot;, as I should call it perhaps, 
<br />
but then you will miss not only the solution of the mind-body 
<br />
problem, but you will also miss the origin of the physical laws too.
<br />
<br />At least you agree with something. In the experience of self
<br />
multiplication , there is an uncertainty, and so there is a
<br />
distribution of probability, belief, whatever ... I will call it
<br />
The Unknown Distribution TUD (not to confuse with the UD!).
<br />
<br />Now let us go back to the relevance of 1/3 person distinction.
<br />
For reason of clarity, and because I'm not sure people will read
<br />
this post until here, I ask the next question in another
<br />
post. I let it in the same thread.
<br />
Well, I will post it tomorrow. (get late in my work ...).
<br />
It will be a little post with a &quot;very precise&quot; question.
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />
Bruno
