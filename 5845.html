<br />Sorry Jesse, I can see in retrospect that I was insulting your intelligence 
<br />
as a rhetorical ploy, and we shouldn't stoop to that level of debate on this 
<br />
list.
<br />
<br />You say that you &quot;must incorporate whatever information you have, but no 
<br />
more&quot; in the envelopes/money example. The point I was trying to make with my 
<br />
envelope/drug example is that you need to take into account the fact that 
<br />
the amount in each envelope is fixed, but again you are right, it was not 
<br />
exactly analogous. But you have passed over the final point in my last post, 
<br />
which I now restate:
<br />
<br />(1) The original game: envelope A and B, you know one has double the amount 
<br />
of the other, but you don't know which. You open A and find $100. Should you 
<br />
switch to B, which may have either $50 or $200?
<br />
<br />(2) A variation: everything is the same, up to the point where you are 
<br />
pondering whether to switch to envelope B, when the millionaire walks in, 
<br />
and hidden from view, flips a coin to decide whether to replace whatever was 
<br />
originally in envelope B with either double or half the sum in envelope A, 
<br />
i.e. either $50 or $200.
<br />
<br />Now, which game would you prefer to play, (1) or (2)? They are not the same. 
<br />
In game (1), if the $100 in A is actually the higher amount, if you switch 
<br />
you will get $50 for sure; but in game (2) if the $100 is actually the 
<br />
higher amount you have a 50% chance of getting $200 if you switch. It works 
<br />
in the reverse way if the $100 is the lower amount - you could lose $50 
<br />
rather than gain $100 - but the possible gain outweighs the possible loss.
<br />
<br />Look at it another way: game (2) is actually asymmetrical. The amount you 
<br />
win if you play it many times will be different if you switch, because you 
<br />
really do have more to gain than to lose by switching (and the millionaire 
<br />
will have to pay out more on average). On the other hand, intuitively, you 
<br />
can see that your expected gains in game (1) should be the same whether you 
<br />
switch or not. The paradox comes from reasoning as if you are playing game 
<br />
(2) when you are really playing game (1).
