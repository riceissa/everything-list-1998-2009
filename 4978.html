<br />I guess as a mathematical Platonist my main objection is to mathematical 
<br />
objects that cannot be defined in any finite way. For example, pi may have 
<br />
an infinite number of digits, but we can define the notion of a Turing 
<br />
machine and then come up with a finite description of a program that will 
<br />
eventually output every single one of those digits. And it is possible to go 
<br />
further than just the computable reals--Turing defined the notion of an 
<br />
&quot;oracle machine&quot; which, in addition to the operations of a Turing machine, 
<br />
can also decide whether any given Turing machine halts in a finite time. It 
<br />
may not be possible to actually construct an oracle machine in our universe, 
<br />
but the notion seems perfectly well-defined, and as a Platonist I would 
<br />
think a question like &quot;what is the nth digit of the oracle machine program 
<br />
#m&quot; must have a single true answer. And then it is possible to define the 
<br />
notion of a 2nd-level-oracle machine that can decide if any 1st-level-oracle 
<br />
machine program halts in a finite time, an omega-level-oracle machine that 
<br />
can decide if any finite-level-oracle machine halts in a finite time, etc. 
<br />
For any number that can be specified in terms of a program for a 
<br />
hypothetical machine which itself has a finite well-defined description, I 
<br />
am willing to believe that number &quot;exists&quot; in the Platonic sense.
<br />
<br />But just based on the fact that the number of descriptions of any kind in 
<br />
the English language must be countable, there cannot be more than a 
<br />
countable infinity of numbers with finite descriptions of any kind. 
<br />
Therefore the reals would have to include all kinds of numbers that have no 
<br />
finite description at all. I am not sure I believe such things exist, and 
<br />
for a similar reason I am not sure I believe that every member of the 
<br />
hypothetical &quot;power set of the integers&quot; exists either. Am I necessarily 
<br />
denying the use of proof by contradiction by doing this? Can you explain how 
<br />
proof by contradiction would force one to accept the existence of 
<br />
&quot;indescribable&quot; numbers/sets? I think the universe of mathematical objects 
<br />
with a &quot;finite description&quot; in the general sense I describe above is a lot 
<br />
larger than the universe of mathematical objects which an intuitionist would 
<br />
accept, although I'm not sure about that.
