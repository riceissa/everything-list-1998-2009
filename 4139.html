<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not quite due to possible interferences. We do have empirical evidences
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for those &quot;worlds&quot; imo. (if only the two slits + Bell or better GHZ)
</em><br />
<br />While I find Deutsch fairly persuasive, the verdict is of course not 
<br />
yet in whether MWI is the correct interpretation. The double slit 
<br />
results had a &quot;traditional&quot; wave mechanics interpretation 75 years ago 
<br />
(&quot;wave-particle duality&quot;), and this remains a viable interpretation 
<br />
even today. (I'm not talking about popularity, either on this list or 
<br />
in the overall community, just &quot;technical viability.&quot;)
<br />
<br />However, I take your point that full Lewis-Stalnaker-D. Lewis modal 
<br />
realism is &quot;more disjoint&quot; than the &quot;less disjoint&quot; (initial 
<br />
interference of branching worlds) MWI. In terms of topology, one might 
<br />
say full modal realism is the discrete (perhaps Zariski) topology, 
<br />
while MWI has more notions of closeness, overlap, etc. (I think this 
<br />
could be worked out, but I haven't.)
<br />
<br />Certainly after a time interval where decoherence occurs, the 
<br />
interaction between macroscopically different worlds is essentially 
<br />
zero.
<br />
<br />So, I will amend my earlier statement to read: &quot;After the very early, 
<br />
entangled period, MWI looks, then, like just another variant of &quot;modal 
<br />
realism.&quot; To wit, there IS a universe in which unicorns exist, and 
<br />
another in which Germany won the Second World War, but these universes 
<br />
are forever and completely out of touch with us.&quot;
<br />
<br />And since the time of entanglement/coherence is small for most systems, 
<br />
most worlds in MWI are as &quot;far apart&quot; as modal realism worlds are.
<br />
<br />(Digression: I wonder what kind of work has been done on _evolution_ in 
<br />
topology, e.g., the transition of systems from &quot;overlapping open sets&quot; 
<br />
to the &quot;discrete&quot; topology? Looks like nucleation and growth out of a 
<br />
continuous medium, or formation of tree structures, perhaps.)
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; A very natural generalisation (!). Just replace the hom Sets by hom 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Categories.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In which you can again replace the hom sets by hom categories ....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What is intriguing is the existence of coherence conditions making 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constructions apparently very genuine for many stuff from quantum 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; field theories.
</em><br />
<br />Baez (IIRC) has an anecdote about talking with a noted quantum field 
<br />
theorist at a conference. The theorist was highly skeptical of 
<br />
&quot;generalized abstract nonsense&quot; (i.e., category theory). Baez told him 
<br />
about some of the developments and the theorist went off to sleep on 
<br />
it. The next morning he buttonholed Baez and said &quot;Braided monoidal 
<br />
categories are really cool&quot; (I'm paraphrasing from memory).
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have used the smullyan trees for the G and Co. theorem provers. The 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tableaux
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure reflects  in some way the Kripke structure. Posets appears 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; S4-like modal logic.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You should study Gentzen presentation of logic which are naturally 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; related
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to categories. An indigest but brilliant introduction to many 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (intuitionnist)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logics is the North-Holland logic book by Szabo: Algebra of proofs.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To bad he miss the braided monoidal categories ... For a categorician, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; knots
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory is a branch of logic.
</em><br />
<br />I haven't gotten to knots yet, except for a look a few years ago at the 
<br />
Vaughan Jones stuff on classifications of knots (more related to string 
<br />
theory, which I did a little bit of reading on).
<br />
<br />Gentzen is referred to, of course, in the books on logic I'm reading, 
<br />
but I'm still absorbing the more basic stuff.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;Possible worlds,&quot; something I only encountered in any form (besides 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Borges, Everett, parallel universes sorts of references) in the past 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; several years, is my real touchstone.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; And, more mundanely, I think it applies to cryptography and money. I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; had a meeting/party at my house a few weeks ago with about 50 people 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; in attendance (gulp!). We had a series of very short presentations. I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; gave a very rushed 10-minute introduction to intuitionistic logic, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; mainly focused on my &quot;time as a poset, a lattice&quot; example, citing the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; natural way in which &quot;not-not A&quot; is not necessarily the same as A. If 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the past of an event is A, then not-A is its future. But the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; not-future is larger than the original past, as &quot;incomparable&quot; (in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the poset/trichotomy sense) events influence the future. Or, put in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; relatitivity/cosmology terms, which many people are more familiar 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; with, ironically, events outside the light cone of the present figure 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; into the future. So the natural causal structure of spacetime is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; intuitionistic, a Brouwerian lattice.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Very plausible. But be careful of the solipsist move here.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Unless I miss something, like a universal first person may be, I really
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't know.
</em><br />
<br />I'm not following you here.
<br />
<br />If you're commenting on my &quot;it applies to cryptography and money,&quot; we 
<br />
can talk about it further (though it gets away from the focus of the 
<br />
Everything list, except in the interesting mathematics and logic).
<br />
<br />If you're referring to the cosmological points, my argument is just my 
<br />
own reinterpretation of points made by Smolin, Markopoulou, Sorkin, and 
<br />
others. Time is the most natural ordering we have, and the time of 
<br />
non-absolute spacetime is a natural partial ordering (because some 
<br />
events are incomparable, are not in order relative to each other). This 
<br />
is a point made by Goldblatt and (apparently) many years earlier by 
<br />
Arthur Prior (whose books I have not yet seen...an updated reprint of 
<br />
one of his classics is coming in November, and  I expect to read it 
<br />
then).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think---with comp---
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that those brouwerian lattices emerge from the non distributive 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structures
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which rises from the coherent glueing of all little pieces of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consistent (in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logical sense) histories.
</em><br />
<br />Sounds interesting, but I'm not getting a clear mental picture of it. 
<br />
Could you provide a natural transformation from your internal picture 
<br />
to one I might be able to form?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Enough for this digression. But MWI, belief, possible worlds, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; alternate forms of logic, knowledge, category theory, toposes, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; more are all deeply &quot;intertwingled,&quot; as Ted Nelson would say. It's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; all math. Good stuff.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes. And the intertwingling grows up the deeper is the fundamental 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; question, isn't it?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />It's certainly my focus. Great stuff.
<br />
