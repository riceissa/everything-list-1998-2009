&nbsp;&nbsp;*The universe is not just black and white...*
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
Or another way to state that is that two truth values (true and false) 
<br />
are insufficient to describe all propositions.
<br />
<br />I propose the following:
<br />
If the universe exists and if for all things X and Y, the utterance &quot;X 
<br />
contains Y&quot; is &quot;proposition,&quot; then the universe must &quot;operate&quot; with more 
<br />
than the two usual truth values, true and false.
<br />
<br />Consequently, since the universe does exist, and if we assume that &quot;X 
<br />
contains Y&quot; is decidable, then at least three truth values are necessary 
<br />
to describe the state of all &quot;propositions.&quot;
<br />
<br />First the definitions and then the argument for the above proposition. 
<br />
IMHO, the only room you might have for disagreement is in the 
<br />
definitions, as the argument is valid.
<br />
<br />*Definitions*
<br />
/Proposition/
<br />
Define a proposition to be something that can be decided, given enough 
<br />
resources (such as computational power), and mapped to a single truth 
<br />
value. An example of a proposition is &quot;I perceive the sky to be blue&quot; as 
<br />
that is decidedly true (in good weather). Another is &quot;I perceive the sky 
<br />
to be green,&quot; which is decidedly false. A proposition is a statement 
<br />
that is decidable, meaning there is a &quot;best&quot; truth value to assign to 
<br />
that statement. If there are only two truth values then an example of a 
<br />
non-proposition is &quot;this statement is false,&quot; the liar's paradox. Later, 
<br />
we will see that &quot;If the universe exists then it operates on more than 
<br />
two truth values&quot; is a proposition as well because it will be decidedly 
<br />
true.
<br />
<br />/TV/
<br />
Let TV be a set, to be determined, consisting of truth values, possibly 
<br />
such as TV = {true, false}, that represents all truth values 
<br />
-sufficient- to allow for -all- propositions to have a unique, 
<br />
assignable truth value, i.e., sufficient to decide all propositions.
<br />
<br />/The universe/
<br />
For the purposes of this argument, the universe is the totality of all 
<br />
that exists. Remark: what exists isn't completely clear and people 
<br />
disagree on what exists; some, for example, believe that nothing exists 
<br />
save themselves; this is called solipsism. Nevertheless, the definition 
<br />
of universe stands as whatever that totality of all that exists is.
<br />
<br />/Thing/
<br />
X is a thing if, and only if, X is or can be an object of thought. 
<br />
(Slightly modified version of definition 3 from dictionary.com.)
<br />
<br />/Containment/
<br />
One thing /contains/ another thing (where the 'another thing' is allowed 
<br />
to be the first thing) if and only if the first thing has all of the 
<br />
second thing's contents or constituent parts. In other words, all 
<br />
content and/or constituent parts within the second thing is also content 
<br />
of the first thing. (Slightly modified version of definition 3 from 
<br />
dictionary.com.) Examples: the solar system contains the planet earth 
<br />
and water molecules contain hydrogen. The primary example is the 
<br />
universe: the universe contains -all- things.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />*Argument*
<br />
/Overview/
<br />
The argument is an augmented form of Russell's theorem, sometimes 
<br />
referred to as Russell's paradox, which proves that in Zermelo Frankel 
<br />
set theory there is no set which contains every other set. The twist is, 
<br />
this time, when talking about the universe, we know it exists. However, 
<br />
we'll use the fact that a particular statement is a proposition except 
<br />
it is neither true nor false. Recall that a proposition must have a 
<br />
decidable truth value in order to be a proposition; so since this 
<br />
statement is a proposition, there must be at least one extra truth value 
<br />
that this proposition is most accurately mapped to in TV.
<br />
<br /><br />/The case for the universe operating on more than two truth values./
<br />
<br />/Premise 1/
<br />
The universe as defined exists.
<br />
<br />/Premise 2/
<br />
For all things X and Y, the utterance &quot;X contains Y&quot; is a proposition. 
<br />
(Intuitively, I think the proposition &quot;X contains Y&quot; is 'usually' false.)
<br />
<br /><br />Suppose the universe exists and for all things X and Y, the utterance &quot;X 
<br />
contains Y&quot; is a proposition. Consider the thing that contains all 
<br />
things that don't contain themselves. Let's denote this thing by the 
<br />
letter D. D is a thing because it is now an object of thought. The 
<br />
universe, which contains all things, and itself exists by assumption, 
<br />
contains D in particular as D is a thing.
<br />
<br />Now consider the utterance &quot;D contains D.&quot; By assumption, &quot;D contains D&quot; 
<br />
is a proposition. (X and Y are both D in this particular case.)
<br />
<br />/&quot;D contains D&quot; can't be true/
<br />
Suppose that &quot;D contains D&quot; is a true proposition. Then, by the 
<br />
definition of D, &quot;D does not contain D&quot;. Therefore, &quot;D contains D&quot; is 
<br />
false. Since &quot;D contains D&quot; can't be both true and false, our original 
<br />
assumption that &quot;D contains D&quot; is a true proposition is incorrect. 
<br />
Consequently, &quot;D contains D&quot; is not a true proposition.
<br />
<br />/&quot;D contains D&quot; can't be false/
<br />
A similar argument shows that &quot;D contains D&quot; can't be false. If we 
<br />
suppose &quot;D contains D&quot; is false, then &quot;D does does not contain D&quot; is 
<br />
true. However, by the definition of D, &quot;D contains D&quot; is then true since 
<br />
D contains all things that don't contain themselves. This contradiction 
<br />
implies that &quot;D contains D&quot; is not false.
<br />
<br />/Conclusion/
<br />
So we've established that &quot;D contains D&quot; is neither true nor false. By 
<br />
premise 2, &quot;D contains D&quot; is a proposition; by the definition of 
<br />
proposition, &quot;D contains D&quot; must have a decidable truth value. Since 
<br />
this truth value is neither true nor false, there must be a third truth 
<br />
value which &quot;D contains D&quot; is assigned to. This completes the argument.
