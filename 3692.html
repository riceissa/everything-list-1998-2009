Dear Friends,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been thinking very hard about the title question and its
<br />
implications, re: Goedel's constructions and Goedel numbering/coding. I
<br />
refer the the following papers:
<br />
<br />1) <a href="http://nl.ijs.si/~damjan/phen.html">http://nl.ijs.si/~damjan/phen.html</a>
<br />
2) <a href="http://www.math.princeton.edu/jfnj/texts_and_graphics/LOGIC/talk.CMU/Hil36.rtf">http://www.math.princeton.edu/jfnj/texts_and_graphics/LOGIC/talk.CMU/Hil36.rtf</a>
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can find in psychology cases of Dysmorphia, such as
<br />
(<a href="http://www.cosmeticsupport.com/info/bdd3.html">http://www.cosmeticsupport.com/info/bdd3.html</a> ,
<br />
<a href="http://www.anred.com/musdys.html">http://www.anred.com/musdys.html</a>), where a distortion of the self-image
<br />
occurs. The fact that distortions themselves are possible seems, IMHO, to
<br />
require us to consider whether or not there is an assumption implicit in
<br />
discussions of Self-reference modeled in terms of Goedel's (and Church,
<br />
Turing, et al) treatment of the question of completeness and provability of
<br />
formal systems what should be examined more closely.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, we have the following quotes:
<br />
<br />from 1)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     &quot;Self-reference in formal arithmetic can be compared to a formal way of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-recognition in the mirror. The basis for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this comparison is the role of the Gödel code in arithmetical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-reference. The comparison is developed in a series of diagrams which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; show the stages of construction of a self-referential sentence and relate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them to the irreflexivity of vision and ways of overcoming it. The aim of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the comparison is to turn arithmetical slf-reference into an idealized
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; formal model of self-recognition and the conception(s) of self based on this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; capacity.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt;      The incompleteness of a formal system does not make it unsuitable for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; building models of the mind, but, on the contrary, as Hofstadter's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comparison suggests, it is precisely its incompleteness which makes a formal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; system suitable for modeling the mind.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Furthermore, it can be said that a mirror-like device cannot be used to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; overcome incompleteness because it has already been used in producing it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Namely, the self-reference of a sentence on which arithmetical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; incompleteness depends is indirect, by way of a numerical code: the sentence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; refers to a certain number which belongs to that sentence itself under some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; system of numeric coding of sentences as numbers. This Gödel code functions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as a numerical mirror in which a sentence can refer to itself, &quot;see itself&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     To re-use Hofstadter's comparison, just as I cannot see my face, in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particular my eye(s), except in a mirror, so sentences of arithmetic cannot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; refer to, &quot;see&quot; themselves, except in a numerical mirror. More generally,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this is how a sentence of arithmetic can refer to another formula: by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; refering to its numerical image, Gödel number.&quot;
</em><br />
<br />from 2)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  &quot;An Hierarchy of Levels
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     So we evolved the idea that the formal system serving to extend a given
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; basic system (or &quot;ground level&quot;) could be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structured by making use of special functions enabling references to levels.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In effect, if we used references indicating a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; higher level then it would become permissible to &quot;overview&quot; the formulae and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; procedures of a lower level.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;      And the basic idea, at least at the beginning of the construction of an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hierarchy of extension levels, is quite like Turing's  concept in that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; first extension level, the first level above the ground level, incorporates
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the possibility to prove as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theorem the Goedel assertion for the logical system of the &quot;ground level&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;      The first higher level, corresponding in our approach to any acceptable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definition of the first ordinal number, would be &gt; such that the Goedel
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assertion from the ground level would now become provable if that Goedel
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assertion had been simply added as an axiom usable on the higher level. Or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instead it would be effective to introduce as an axiom an assertion of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; formal consistency of the ground level logic. This type of assertion can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seen to imply the assertion of Goedel's type. Formal consistency is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assertion to the effect that &quot;on the ground level nothing false can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proved.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;      The verbal argument for the truth of Goedel's formula depends in effect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on an overview of the specific formal system in  which it is stated and on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the basis of the axioms, etc. of which it was constructed. Also this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argument depends on the assumption that that formal system is actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perfectly consistent. Our idea of extension and of &quot;hierarchical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; introspective logics&quot; is that there is to be considered an hierarchy of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; levels of logic such that higher levels have an &quot;overview&quot; of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proceedings and results obtainable on lower levels.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Thus the totality is &quot;introspective&quot; because it is looking inward to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; study itself but this self-study is not unrestricted.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And effectively a higher level is supposed to be able to see the truth of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Goedel assertion deriving from a lower level by a process analogous to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; verbal argument originally known for the truth of the Goedel assertion in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; formal system although there is no proof of that assertion in that original
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; formal system.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;      A logical system cannot effectively state its own consistency; this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relates to the incompleteness originally found by Goedel. But one logical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; system CAN easily state the formal consistency of another system. We use
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this idea in creating our hierarchy of levels so that on a higher level it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is possible to, in effect, assume the validity and the consistency of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proceedings possible on lower levels.&quot;
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is whether or not it is unproblematic to assume that the
<br />
numbering via a mapping between the  &quot;levels&quot; to the set of ordinals and the
<br />
isomorphism between Goedel numbers and Z (the integers). Is the well
<br />
ordering of the ordinals and integers prior to any instantiation thereof?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is further compounded by David Deutsch's paper: Machines, Logic
<br />
and Quantum Physics (<a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/math.HO/9911150">http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/math.HO/9911150</a>):
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  &quot;Though the truths of logic and pure mathematics are objective and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; independent of any contingent facts or laws of nature, our knowledge of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; these truths depends entirely on our knowledge of the laws of physics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Recent progress in the quantum theory of computation has provided practical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instances of this, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; forces us to abandon the classical view that computation, and hence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical proof, are purely logical notions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; independent of that of computation as a physical process. Henceforward, a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proof must be regarded not as an abstract object
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or process but as a physical process, a species of computation, whose scope
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and reliability depend on our knowledge of the physics of the computer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concerned. &quot;
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which leads to the related question: Why is it that there seems to be a
<br />
difference between physical systems (viz: objects of experimentation having
<br />
observable properties) and formal (and informal) representations of such
<br />
(viz: Goedelian codes, quantum algorithms, information structures, etc.)?
<br />
<br />Kindest regards,
<br />
<br /><br />Stephen
