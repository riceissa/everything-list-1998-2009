<br />
I want to describe in more detail how I see the Universal Distribution
<br />
(UDist) applying to the measure of observers and observer moments.
<br />
I apologize in advance for the length of this message; someday I will
<br />
collect this and my others on this topic into a set of web pages.
<br />
<br />To briefly reiterate, in this model every information pattern or object
<br />
is said to exist in a Platonic sense.  These are the only things that
<br />
exist.  Further, these objects are associated with a measure defined by
<br />
the Universal Distribution or UDist, which is defined with respect to a
<br />
given Universal Turing Machine (UTM).  Basically the measure of an object
<br />
is the probability that a random program run through that UTM produces
<br />
that object.  Another way to think of the measure is as the fraction
<br />
of all programs which produce that object.  You can also imagine an
<br />
infinite array of UTMs, each one working on a distinct input program
<br />
and producing outputs, where the measure of an object is proportional
<br />
to the fraction of the outputs match that object pattern.
<br />
<br />To apply this concept to observers, we first need to think of an observer
<br />
as an information pattern.  I adopt a block universe perspective and think
<br />
of time as a dimension.  Then we can see the dynamic activity that is
<br />
part of an observer's thinking as producing a pattern in space and time.
<br />
<br />Let us consider the human brain.  Our current theories are that thinking
<br />
and perception can be thought of as reflecting the activity of neural
<br />
cells.  These cells fire off electrical impulses at various rates
<br />
and times, and are hooked up into an elaborate and complex network of
<br />
interconnections, whose properties change over time.
<br />
<br />It seems reasonable that a complete record of the neural activity and
<br />
dynamics of the interconnection map over a period of time would be an
<br />
effective and accurate representation of the information associated
<br />
with the mental activity during that time period.  In fact this is
<br />
probably more detailed than is needed; clearly much neural processing
<br />
is unconscious, and further, small variations in individual cell activity
<br />
will not produce perceptual changes in consciousness.  But at this point
<br />
we cannot be certain about what parts could be simplified or eliminated.
<br />
No doubt with future study of brain function we will gradually gain a
<br />
greater understanding of consciousness and we could reduce the information
<br />
content needed to fully specify an observer's experiences even further.
<br />
<br />It is an instructive exercise to try to estimate how much information
<br />
is needed to specify this representation of an observer as it exists
<br />
within some window of time.  Obviously this will be very approximate.
<br />
I'll take 1E10 (10^10 or 10 billion) as the number of neurons and
<br />
1E5 (10 thousand) as the number of connections per neuron.  Representing
<br />
this map takes 1E10 * 1E5 * 33 bits per connection or about 3E16 bits.
<br />
Then we need to specify the connection strength for each connection;
<br />
perhaps 20 bits is about right, which gives 1 part in a million accuracy.
<br />
This gets us up to 6E17 bits.
<br />
<br />This is a static representation.  As the brain thinks, these connection
<br />
strengths change.  My understanding is that they don't change very fast.
<br />
Some estimates I have seen suggest that long term memory can only record
<br />
1 bit per second.  I know that sounds amazingly slow but it reflects
<br />
how much we forget.  Even if this is low by 10 orders of magnitude
<br />
it still means that the information needed to record changes in the
<br />
interconnection map is insignificant next to the information needed
<br />
to specify the map in the first place, which I estimated as 6E17 bits.
<br />
So I will not count this information contribution, not because it doesn't
<br />
happen, but because it is so small compared to the information in the
<br />
static network.
<br />
<br />Next we need to record the actual neural firing patterns.  Neurons fire
<br />
at a maximum rate of about 1000/sec, but we need to record more than
<br />
the firing rates.  Relative timing of the neurons is important as well,
<br />
both because the brain seems to record information in that timing,
<br />
but also because whether a neuron fires or not depends on the relative
<br />
timing of the various impulses it receives.
<br />
<br />Let's suppose we record the neural firing activity at the microsecond
<br />
level; not just a boolean value about whether it fired, but some
<br />
indication of the neuron's level of activation and its recovery rate.
<br />
We will use a 20 bit value to represent this, and record it every
<br />
microsecond.  This takes 1E10 * 20 * 1E6 bits, times the number of
<br />
seconds, or 2E17 times the number of seconds.
<br />
<br />The bottom line from all this estimation, which is obviously very very
<br />
rough, is that it takes (6+2s) times 10^17 bits to record the pattern
<br />
associated with s seconds of brain activity, in enough detail that we
<br />
could plausibly claim to have fully captured the essence of those seconds
<br />
of consciousness.  That's 10^18 bits for 2 seconds of consciousness.
<br />
<br />10^18 bits is about 100 million gigabytes.  For comparison, typical new
<br />
computer disks today are about 100-500 gigabytes.  So it is a pretty
<br />
big chunk of data.
<br />
<br />What is the point of this calculation?  Effectively, it gives us a lower
<br />
bound on the measure of a possible set of observer moments.  Even if
<br />
nothing else works, we could write a program which would output this
<br />
particular pattern simply by embedding that pattern in the program itself.
<br />
We could do the UTM equivalent of &quot;print 1001011110010...&quot;  to print out
<br />
whatever pattern we want.  The size of that program will be roughly the
<br />
size of the information pattern itself, in this case roughly 10^18 bits.
<br />
And the measure of that information pattern will be 1/2 to this power,
<br />
or 1/2^(10^18).  This is an astronomically low measure.
<br />
<br />In effect, this measure estimates the probability of a given moment of
<br />
consciousness appearing purely at random, out of random noise.  This
<br />
answers the question sometimes posed of whether the random vibrations
<br />
in the atoms of air or a rock crystal are conscious, since we could
<br />
select a subset of them and match them against the information pattern of
<br />
consciousness described above.  The answer is that the only program which
<br />
could do so would embed the entire information pattern within it, and the
<br />
measure of such a program is the tiny figure quoted above.  Assuming that
<br />
there are non-infinitesimal sources of measure for a given consciousness,
<br />
then the contribution from these other sources is undetectable.
<br />
<br />So what other sources of measure might there be?  In other words,
<br />
how could we write a much shorter program which could output this same
<br />
information pattern?
<br />
<br />One thing we could do is to try to compress the redundancy out of the
<br />
pattern.  As I have defined it, even though I tried not to be terribly
<br />
excessive in the number of bits I allocated to the various terms, there
<br />
is certainly some redundancy.  For one thing, I proposed to record
<br />
each neuron's firing pattern independently, even though in principle a
<br />
neuron's firing should be able to be computed from its inputs and the
<br />
interconnection matrix, both of which are recorded.  In that case we
<br />
might get by with only storing the inputs to the brain from the perceptual
<br />
nerves, and use the stored interconnection matrix to compute everything
<br />
else.  This could greatly reduce the per-second information requirement.
<br />
<br />However I don't think this will work as well as it sounds, because I
<br />
suspect that the brain is chaotic in nature and so small changes in
<br />
initial conditions will lead ultimately to totally different output.
<br />
Even though I stored the interconnections with a precision of 1 in a
<br />
million, that may not be enough to keep the reconstructed brain pattern
<br />
identical to the recorded one.  Likewise, my failure to store the changes
<br />
in brain interconnections will probably not be a successful strategy if
<br />
they have to be kept accurate in order to keep the simulation in sync
<br />
with the reality.  I would not be surprised if ceasing to record the
<br />
precise internal firing patterns, and trying to reconstruct them, will
<br />
require additional information to be stored which will largely eliminate
<br />
the savings.  And besides, at least for relatively brief observer moments
<br />
of less than a few seconds, the interconnection network took more room
<br />
than the neural firing patterns, so you aren't going to save that much.
<br />
<br />No, we need a much more radical strategy to shrink the program.  And here
<br />
is where it is so remarkable that instead of 10^18 bits, or even perhaps
<br />
10^14 bits if we could compress the data by a factor of 1000, I estimate
<br />
that only about 10^5 bits would be enough to encode this information,
<br />
perhaps even 10^4.  The contribution to measure from such a short program
<br />
is so much larger than the &quot;brute force&quot; 10^18 version that the latter
<br />
can be completely neglected.
<br />
<br />So how do we record this brain pattern in so little data?  The answer
<br />
is that we adopt a completely different approach.  Instead of specifying
<br />
all of the information, we instead specify the natural laws and initial
<br />
conditions for a universe which is suitable for the evolution of life
<br />
and intelligence.  The program runs and creates that universe, and then
<br />
outputs the brain pattern which one of the observers in that universe
<br />
is experiencing.  I will show below that the information content of such
<br />
a program is plausibly of the order I claimed.
<br />
<br />This requires an implicit assumption that the brain pattern in question
<br />
can in fact be produced by an observer who evolved naturally and is
<br />
experiencing the events in a plausible universe.  In other words, this
<br />
will not work for all brain patterns that we could ever imagine.  But if
<br />
our own brain patterns represent actual experiences in a real universe,
<br />
a universe which is not too implausible, then it should work for them.
<br />
So I will assume that this is the case.
<br />
<br />The program to output the brain pattern can be conceptually divided
<br />
into two parts.  One part computes the universe, and the other outputs
<br />
the observer moments in question, in the format described above, as an
<br />
interconnection matrix and record of neural firings.  We can estimate
<br />
the size of the program by the sum of the estimated sizes of the two
<br />
parts.
<br />
<br />How big a program is needed to create our universe?  Nobody knows, but the
<br />
answer seems to be, not that big.  One of the most striking properties
<br />
of the natural laws which have been discovered so far is that they are
<br />
mathematically simple.  Explaining why this is so is considered a major
<br />
philosophical puzzle, and answering this question is one of the biggest
<br />
successes of the UDist principle.
<br />
<br />We don't yet have a complete theory of the laws of physics, but given
<br />
what is known, quantum theory and relativity, and prospective new models
<br />
like string theory and loop quantum gravity, it certainly doesn't appear
<br />
that they will be very big.  Wolfram gave an estimate that the universe
<br />
could be completely modelled using 5 lines of Mathematica code.  Now,
<br />
Mathematica has an extensive mathematical library but I doubt that most
<br />
of it is used.  5 lines of code times 70 characters per line times 8 bits
<br />
per character is about 3E3 bits.  Let's assume that the math functions
<br />
triple the size and we get about 1E4 bits.
<br />
<br />We also need to specify the initial conditions, but there again the
<br />
information content seems to be low.  I quoted Tegmark last week that the
<br />
information content of the big bang is &quot;close to zero&quot;.  I don't know how
<br />
to translate this into a specific number of bits but I will assume that it
<br />
is substantially less than 1E4 bits and not increase the estimate so far.
<br />
<br />So we have it that a program of about 1E4, 10 thousand, bits should be
<br />
able to re-create our universe in all its glory, including observers
<br />
like ourselves (in fact, exactly like ourselves).  That is our estimate
<br />
for the size of the first part of the program which will output the
<br />
information pattern for a given sequence of observer moments.
<br />
<br />For the size of the second part, we are given the output of the first
<br />
part, a complete representation of the state of nature at every point and
<br />
every instant in the universe, and we need to output a nicely ordered data
<br />
structure representing an observer's mental activity as described above.
<br />
<br />There are several problems here.  One is that the universe is very big,
<br />
and potentially has many observers who have many observer-moments.  We
<br />
need to select a particular starting moment of a particular observer so as
<br />
to output the pattern above.  A related problem is just identifying where
<br />
the observers are in that vast expanse of space-time.  Another problem
<br />
is that the &quot;natural&quot; way of expressing the universe's state as output
<br />
by the first program may not be very similar to what we perceive as the
<br />
universe around us.  It appears, based on our understanding of physics,
<br />
that it is going to be expressed as a theory of what we understand as
<br />
the very small, at the Planck scale, 1E-35 meters and 1E-44 seconds.
<br />
It is likely, then, that the output of the universe program is going to
<br />
be expressed at that scale.  From that perspective, the activity of a
<br />
neuron is both enormous and insubstantial, effectively just a very large
<br />
scale averaging of the much more dynamic activity at this, the natural
<br />
scale of physics.
<br />
<br />This last problem, the difference in scale, can probably be dealt with
<br />
very simply.  It may be enough simply to average the state over a large
<br />
region in order to get a good, macroscopic (in this context, meaning at
<br />
the scale of atoms and molecules) view of what is going on; or it may
<br />
be that subatomic particles like electrons and quarks will be clearly
<br />
represented even at the Planck scale and we can use them to identify
<br />
atoms and molecules at the larger scale.
<br />
<br />The next problem is to locate and localize the observer within the entire
<br />
framework of spacetime.  The way I envision this being done is that
<br />
the position of the observer's brain in space and time is hard-coded
<br />
into the program.  The position can be expressed as a fraction of the
<br />
size of the universe, to the required resolution.  I would think that
<br />
for a program which is going to analyze neural structure, nanometer
<br />
resolution is enough to localize the brain.  The typical synaptic gap
<br />
between neurons is about 10-20 nm.  In terms of time, since I sought
<br />
microsecond resolution for the neural state, localizing the observer
<br />
to microsecond resolution should be adequate.
<br />
<br />The size of the universe is unknown, but let us for convenience work with
<br />
the size of the visible universe, about 3E10 (30 billion) light years.
<br />
This is 3E35 nanometers.  It takes about 118 bits to represent a number
<br />
of that size, and we have 3 dimensions, so it takes about 350 bits to
<br />
fully localize a brain in space the size of the visible universe.
<br />
<br />In terms of time, the universe is about 1E10 (10 billion) years old,
<br />
which is 3E23 microseconds.  80 bits is enough for that.  Putting these
<br />
together, 350+80 or about 430 bits will give us a starting point accurate
<br />
to a microsecond and a nanometer for producing a description of a brain.
<br />
<br />The actual analysis software should be straightforward.  We need to locate
<br />
all the neurons, record their interconnection patterns, and then their
<br />
firing rates and activity levels.  All of these have relatively simple
<br />
physical correlates given that you can analyze matter at an arbitrarily
<br />
fine scale.  Locating the neurons can be done by tracing their outer
<br />
membranes.  The interconnection patterns should be determined by the
<br />
amount of area they have in common, the number and distribution of
<br />
vessicles and receptors in the area, and basic chemistry as to whether
<br />
the connection is inhibitory or excitatory.  This is a matter of simple
<br />
geometry and counting.  Likewise, the activity level is a function of
<br />
the concentration of various chemicals inside vs outside the neural
<br />
membrane and can be calculated very simply.
<br />
<br />This level of software is adequate to create the data structure defined
<br />
above for completely specifying the neural activity which corresponds
<br />
to a given set of observer moments.  It amounts to simple counting,
<br />
area calculation, and averaging.  My guess again is that 10^4 to 10^5
<br />
bits is fully adequate to perform these tasks.  Adding the &lt; 10^3 bits
<br />
needed to localize the observer still keeps it within this range.
<br />
<br />Combining the software to create the universe, perhaps 10^4 bits, and the
<br />
software to output the observer description, about 10^4 to 10^5 bits,
<br />
we get the size proposed above, 10^4 to 10^5 bits for a self-contained
<br />
program which will output the observer description in question.  On this
<br />
basis we can use a number like 1/2^(10^4) as an estimate for the measure
<br />
of such a set of observer moments.
<br />
<br />Hopefully this explanation will clarify how we can apply the UDist
<br />
model to calculate measure of observer moments as well as other
<br />
information structures.  It also illustrates how far we are from the
<br />
scientific knowledge necessary to come up with more precise estimates
<br />
for the information content of conscious entities.
<br />
<br />Nevertheless, even with the crude level of knowledge available today,
<br />
we can make many powerful predictions from this kind of model.  One case
<br />
described above is the paradox of whether conscious entities exist all
<br />
around us due to vibrations in air molecules, which this analysis lets us
<br />
reject in a quantitative sense.  Hans Moravec in particular has argued
<br />
that such entities have a reality equal to our own, which is clearly
<br />
wrong.  A similar analysis disposes of the long standing philosophical
<br />
debate over whether a clock implements every finite state machine (and
<br />
hence every conscious entity).  Other puzzles, such as the impact on
<br />
measure of replays and duplicates can also be addressed and solved in
<br />
this framework.  I have described other predictions and solutions in my
<br />
earlier messages on this topic.
<br />
<br />Again, I hope that by laying out my calculations in this much detail it
<br />
will help people to see somewhat concretely how the Universal Distribution
<br />
works and how you can analyze measure using actual software engineering
<br />
concepts.  It makes the UDist much more real as a useful tool for
<br />
understanding measure and making predictions.
