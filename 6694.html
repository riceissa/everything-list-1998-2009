<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Concerning the white rabbits, I don't see how Tegmark could even 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; address the problem given that it is a measure problem with respect 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to the many computational histories. I don't even remember if Tegmark 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is aware of any measure relating the 1-person and 3-person points of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; view.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not sure why you say *computational* wrt Tegmark's theory. Nor do I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand exactly what you mean by a measure relating 1-person &amp; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3-person.
</em><br />
<br />This is not easy to sum up, and is related to my PhD thesis, which is 
<br />
summarized in english in the following papers:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/CC&amp;Q.pdf">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/CC&amp;Q.pdf</a>
<br />
<a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/SANE2004MARCHAL.pdf">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/SANE2004MARCHAL.pdf</a>
<br />
<br />or in links to this list. You can find them in my webpage (URL below).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Tegmark is certainly aware of the need for a measure to allow 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; statements about the probability of finding oneself (1-person pov, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK?) in a universe with certain properties. This is listed in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; astro-ph/0302131 as a &quot;horrendous&quot; problem to which he tentatively 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; offers what looks suspiciously like Schmidhuber's (or whoever's) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Universal Prior as a solution.
</em><br />
<br />Could be promising heuristic, but is deeply wrong. I mean I am myself 
<br />
very suspicious that Universal Prior can be used as an explanation per 
<br />
se.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Of course, this means he tacitly accepts the restriction to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computable functions).
</em><br />
<br /><br />You cannot really be tacit about this. If only because you can gives 
<br />
them basic role in more than one way. Tegmark is unclear, at least..
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So I don't agree that the problem can't be addressed by Tegmark, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; although it hasn't been. Unless by &quot;addressed&quot; you mean &quot;solved&quot;, in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which case I agree!
</em><br />
<br />To adress the problem you need to be ontologically clear.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let's suppose with Wei Dai that a measure can be applied to Tegmark's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everything. It certainly can to the set of UTM programs as per 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Schmidhuber and related proposals.
</em><br />
<br />Most such proposals are done by people not aware of the 1-3 
<br />
distinction. In the approach I have developed that difference is 
<br />
crucial.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Obviously it is possible to assign a measure which solves the White 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Rabbit problem, such as the UP.  But to me this procedure is very 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suspicious.
</em><br />
<br />I agree. You can serach my discussion with Schmidhuber on this list. 
<br />
(search on the name &quot;marchal&quot;, not &quot;bruno marchal&quot;: it is an old 
<br />
discussion we did have some years ago).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  We can get whatever answer we like by picking the right measure.
</em><br />
<br />I mainly agree.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; While the UP and similar are presented by their proponents as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;natural&quot;, my strong suspicion is that if we lived in a universe that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was obviously algorithmically very complex, we would see papers 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arguing for &quot;natural&quot; measures that reward algorithmic complexity. In 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fact the White Rabbit argument is basically an assertion that such 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measures *are* natural.  Why one measure rather than another? By the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logic of Tegmark's original thesis, we should consider the set of all 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible measures over everything. But then we need a measure on the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measures, and so ad infinitum.
</em><br />
<br />I mainly agree.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One self-consistent approach is Lewis', i.e. to abandon all talk of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure, all anthropic predictions, and just to speak of possibilities 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rather than probabilities.  This suited Lewis fine, but greatly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; undermines the attractiveness of the everything thesis for physicists.
</em><br />
<br />With comp the measure *is* on the *possibilities*, themselves captured 
<br />
by the &quot;maximal consistent extensions&quot; in the sense of the logicians.
<br />
I have not the time to give detail, but in july or augustus, I can give 
<br />
you all the details in case you are interested ....
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &lt;SNIP&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; more or less recently in the scientific american. I'm sure Tegmark's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; approach, which a priori does not presuppose the comp hyp, would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; benefit from category theory: this one put structure on the possible 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; sets of mathematical structures. Lawvere rediscovered the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Grothendieck toposes by trying (without success) to get the category 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of all categories. Toposes (or Topoi) are categories formalizing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; first person universes of mathematical structures. There is a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; North-holland book on &quot;Topoi&quot; by Goldblatt which is an excellent 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; introduction to toposes for ... logicians (mhhh ...).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Hope that helps,
</em><br />

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Bruno
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not really. I know category theory is a potential route into this, but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I havn't seen any definitive statements and from what I've read on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this list I don't expect to any time soon. I'm certainly not going to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; learn category theory myself!
</em><br />
<br /><br />At least you don't need them for reading my work. I have suppressed all 
<br />
need to it because it is a difficult theory for those who have not a 
<br />
sufficiently &quot;algebraic mind&quot;. In the long run I believe they will be 
<br />
inescapable though. If only to learn knot theory, which I have reason 
<br />
to believe as being very fundamental for extracting geometry from the 
<br />
UTM introspection (as comp forces us to believe unless my thesis is 
<br />
wrong somewhere ...).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You overlooked a couple of direct queries to you in my posting:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; * You still havn't explained why you say his system is &quot;too big 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (inconsistent)&quot;. Especially the inconsistent bit. I'm sure a level of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explanation is possible which doesn't take the whole of category 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory for granted.  Also, if you have a proof that his system is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inconsistent, you should publish it.
</em><br />
<br />I was alluding to the fact that no mathematician has ever succeed to 
<br />
define the &quot;whole of math&quot; in a consistent way, and since, logics shows 
<br />
you just cannot do it. The idea is that if you can define the whole of 
<br />
math, you transform it into a mathematical object living with other 
<br />
mathematical objects around. Direct argument can be done by the 
<br />
diagonalization technic. See perhaps the book by Grim &quot;the incomplete 
<br />
universe&quot; which is very clear on that point:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Grim, P. (1991). The Incomplete Universe. The MIT Press, Cambridge, 
<br />
USA.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; * Is it correct to say that category theory cannot define &quot;the whole&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because it is outside the heirarchy of the cardinals?
</em><br />
<br />Not really. This is just a technical problem which can be overcomed in 
<br />
some nice or less nice way. But category theory is hardly the whole of 
<br />
math!
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And another mathematical query for you or anyone on the list:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I've overlooked until now the fact that mathematical physics restricts 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; itself to (almost-everywhere) differentiable functions of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; continuum. What is the cardinality of the set of such functions? I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rather suspect that they are denumerable, hence exactly representable 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by UTM programs.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps this is what Russell Standish meant.
</em><br />
<br />Beside the error you corrected yourself, I'm afraid that the 
<br />
mathematical nature of physical objects, if that exists, depends on to 
<br />
many other questions. Mathematically, with some notion of computability 
<br />
on the reals (which I prefer not to use, because unlike computability 
<br />
on the natural numbers, there is no &quot;church's thesis&quot; bearing on it, 
<br />
and no standard on which everyone agree) it is possible to argue on the 
<br />
existence of non turing emulable solution of some &quot;resonnable&quot; 
<br />
differential equation.
<br />
But we don't need this. I have argue (let us say) that if WE are turing 
<br />
emulable, then reality, whatever it is, cannot be turing emulable.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I must insist though, that there exist mathematical objects in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; platonia which require c bits to describe (and some which require 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more), and hence can't be represented either by a UTM program or by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the output of a UTM.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hence Tegmark's original everything is bigger than Schmidhuber's.  But 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; these structures are so arbitrary it is hard to imagine SAS in them, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so maybe it makes no anthropic difference.
</em><br />
<br /><br />That's why I insist so much that Schmidhuber's does not take the comp 
<br />
hyp seriously enough. Comp is necessarily much closer to Tegmark's 
<br />
ontology, but then Tegmark miss comp. Both seems not to be aware that 
<br />
the mind-body problem is not yet solved. And both overlooks the 
<br />
consequence of incompleteness phenomenon (although Schmidhuber on that 
<br />
point is probably (just) a little bit closer to my work).
