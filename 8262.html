Hal gives the correct explanation of what's going on. In general,  all you
<br />
have to do to analyze the problem is to consider all contributions to a
<br />
particular state and add up the amplitudes. The absolute value squared of
<br />
the amplitude gives the probability, which may or may not contain an
<br />
interference term.
<br />
<br />A simple minded formal description can be given as follows:
<br />
<br />If you pass a photon through two slits then close to the screen its state
<br />
would be of the form:
<br />
<br />Integral over z of [1 + Exp(i delta(z))] |s,z&gt;
<br />
<br />Here z denotes the postion on the screen, s is just a label for the photon
<br />
and Exp(i delta(z)) is the phase shift between the two paths which gives
<br />
rise to the interference term. Delta(z) will be zero exactly inbetween the
<br />
two slits and will be nonzero elsewhere. The probability of having the
<br />
photon at z is obtained (up to normalization) by taking the absolute value
<br />
squared of the prefactor of |s,z&gt;, which is 2 + 2 cos(delta(z)).
<br />
<br />Let's do the same for the two entagled photons. The entangled photon pair
<br />
can be denoted as:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;|p_x,s_y&gt; + |p_y,s_x&gt;
<br />
<br />here x and y denote the polarization states.
<br />
<br />If you pass s through the two slits then the state becomes:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[1 + Exp(i delta(z))] |p_x,s_y,z&gt; +  [1 + Exp(i delta(z))] ||p_y,s_x,z&gt;
<br />
<br />This has to be integrated over z, but let's focus only at the contribution
<br />
at some fixed position z. The prefactors of both state vectors |p_x,s_y,z&gt;
<br />
and |p_y,s_x,z&gt; are of the same form as in the single photon case and thus
<br />
you get an interference term Cos(delta(z) as above. If you put the quarter
<br />
wave plate in then instead of
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[1 + Exp(i delta(z))] |p_x,s_y,z&gt; you get:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;|p_x,s_r,z&gt; +  Exp(i delta(z))  |p_x,s_l,z&gt;
<br />
<br />And the complete state vector becomes:
<br />
<br />|p_x,s_r,z&gt; +  Exp(i delta(z))  |p_x,s_l,z&gt;+
<br />
<br />|p_y,s_l,z&gt; +  Exp(i delta(z))  |p_y,s_r,z&gt;
<br />
<br /><br />All the four state vectors are orthogonal. The probability that you detect
<br />
the photon s at z is just the sum of the absolute value squared of the four
<br />
terms, which is constant and doesn't contain an interference term.
<br />
<br />Now let's pass photon p through the polarizer (45 degrees w.r.t. x). This
<br />
amounts to measuring the polarization state of photon p in the basis |p_x&gt; +
<br />
p_y&gt; and |p_x&gt; - p_y&gt;. If you don't discard one of these two states and keep
<br />
them both then, as Hal rightly points out, nothing changes. If you
<br />
substitute:
<br />
<br />|p_x&gt; = |a&gt; + |b&gt;;
<br />
<br />|p_y&gt; = |a&gt; - |b&gt;
<br />
<br />in the state vector above you get:
<br />
<br /><br /><br />|a,s_r,z&gt; +  Exp(i delta(z))  |a,s_l,z&gt;+
<br />
<br />|a,s_l,z&gt; +  Exp(i delta(z))  |a,s_r,z&gt;+
<br />
<br /><br />|b,s_r,z&gt; +  Exp(i delta(z))  |b,s_l,z&gt;+
<br />
<br />- |b,s_l,z&gt; -  Exp(i delta(z))  |b,s_r,z&gt; = (collecting the prefactors of
<br />
like state vectors)
<br />
<br />=
<br />
<br />[1 + Exp(i delta(z))]|a,s_r,z&gt; + [1 + Exp(i delta(z))]|a,s_l,z&gt; +
<br />
<br />[1 - Exp(i delta(z))]|b,s_r,z&gt; - [1 -  Exp(i delta(z))] |b,s_l,z&gt;
<br />
<br />The absolute value squared of the terms with the p photons in the |a&gt; state
<br />
contains the term 2 Cos (delta(z)), but for the b terms this is - 2
<br />
Cos(delta(z). If you don't observe the polarization of the p photon, the
<br />
interference terms would thus cancel. This is obvious since all we have done
<br />
is to write down the same state in a different basis. But if you do observe
<br />
the polarization of the p photon, then can measure the probability of
<br />
detecting s at position z and p in polarization state |a&gt; then you have to
<br />
add up the absolute value squared of |a,s_r,z&gt; and |a,s_l,z&gt;. Then you do
<br />
get the Cos(delta(z) interference term.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The questions I have regard the replacement of the Coincidence Counter
</em><br />
(from
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; here on: CC) in the  above experiment with a more complicated apparatus.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; What if we replace the CC with one of the following:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 1) a carefully sealed, exquisitely well insulated box with a printer
</em><br />
inside
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; it.  The printer is  hooked up so that it prints, on paper, an exact
</em><br />
record
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of everything that comes into the CC.  Then,  to &quot;erase&quot; the printed
</em><br />
record,
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the whole box is melted, or annihilated using nuclear explosives, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; whatever.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The CC is not what is &quot;erased&quot;.  Rather, the so-called erasure happens
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the photons while they are flying through the apparatus.  Nothing in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the experiment proposes erasing data in the CC.  So I don't really see
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what you are getting at.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; What will the outcome be in these experiments?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It won't make any difference, because the CC is not used in the way you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; imagine.  It doesn't have to produce a record and it doesn't have to erase
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any records.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let me tell you what really happens in the experiment above.  It is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; actually not so mystical as people try to make it sound.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We start off with the s photon going through a 2 slit experiment and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; getting interference.  That is standard.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now we put two different polarization rotations in front of the two slits
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and interference goes away.  The web page author professes amazement,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but it is not really that surprising.  After all, interference between two
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; photons would typically be affected by messing with their polarizations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is not all that surprising that putting polarizers into the paths
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could mess up the interference.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But now comes the impressive part.  He puts a polarizer in front of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other photon, the p photon, and suddenly the interference comes back!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Surely something amazing and non-local has happened now, right?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not really.  This new polarizer will eliminate some of the p photons.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; They won't get through.  The result is that we will throw out some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the measurements of s photons, because if the p photon got eaten
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by its polarizer, the CC doesn't trigger as there is no coincidence.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (This is the real reason for the CC in this experiment.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So now we are discarding some of the s photon measurements, and keeping
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some.  It turns out that the ones we keep do show an interference pattern.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If we had added back in the ones we discarded, it would blur out the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interference fringes and there would be no pattern.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The point is, there is no change to the s photon when we put the polarizer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; over by p.  Its results do not visibly change from non-interference
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to interference, as the web page might imply.  (If that did happen,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we'd have the basis for a faster than light communicator.)  No, all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that is happening is that we are choosing to throw out half the data,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and the half we keep does show interference.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The only point of the CC, then, is to tell us which half of the data
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to throw out of the s photon measurements.  Destroying the CC and all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the other crazy things you suggest have nothing to do with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiment.  The CC is not what is &quot;erased&quot; and it does not create a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; permanent record.  It is only there to tell us whether a p photon got
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; through its polarizer or not, so that we know whether to throw away
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the s photon measurement.
