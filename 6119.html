This is the same post: COMBINATORS VI
<br />
I'm just searching a way to format it so that it is
<br />
more readable in the archive.
<br />
<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
I will provide a detailed solution of the last problem
<br />
for those who have perhaps missed the beginning.
<br />
<br /><br />Verify that S = B(BW)(BBC). That is
<br />
verify that B(BW)(BBC)xyz = xz(yz)
<br />
This should be much easier.
<br />
<br /><br />One awful solution would be, reminding that
<br />
B = S(KS)K, and that W = SS(KI)
<br />
and that C = S(BBS)(KK), that is
<br />
S((S(KS)K)(S(KS)K)S)(KK), to substitute
<br />
those the occurence of B, W and C by they
<br />
SK-programs, giving:
<br />
<br />S = B(BW)(BBC) =
<br />
<br />S(KS)K((S(KS)K)SS(K(SKK)))((S(KS)K)(S(KS)K)(S((S(KS)K)(S(KS)K)S)(KK)))
<br />
<br />... and then applying that expression on xyz.
<br />
<br />Obviously we have not programmed the elementary
<br />
compositor B, the elementary permutator C and the
<br />
elementary duplicator W for not using them. Yet this
<br />
gave an interesting definition of S in term of itself and
<br />
this rises the question if there is not some general
<br />
recursion phenomenon there and indeed there will be
<br />
a very general such phenomenon captured by a
<br />
combinator which is neither an eliminator, nor a
<br />
permutator, nor a duplicator, nor even an identificator
<br />
(like Ix = x) and which was called the paradoxical
<br />
combinators by Curry and Feys and is known today
<br />
as the fixed point combinator but that's for later.
<br />
<br />So I recall:
<br />
<br />Bxyz = x(yz)
<br />
Wxy = xyy
<br />
Cxyz = xzy
<br />
<br />And 'course:
<br />
Kxy = x
<br />
Sxyz = xz(yz)
<br />
<br />And let us verify that S = B(BW)(BBC)
<br />
I recall &quot;=&quot; means &quot;act similarly&quot;; thus we must
<br />
show that:
<br />
<br />B(BW)(BBC)xyz = Sxyz = xz(yz)
<br />
<br />Well Bxyz = x(yz) and please remember that
<br />
Bxyz abbreviates (((B x) y) z) and in particular
<br />
<br />B(BW)(BBC)x abbreviates (((B (BW)) (BBC)) x)
<br />
and that that matches!
<br />
<br />Another practical way (more practical than
<br />
by adding the left parenthesis!) is to fully
<br />
abbreviate the expression (like I do usually) and
<br />
remember that B (here) is trigged by its dynamic
<br />
when presented with three arguments and that
<br />
argument are *arbitrary* combinators:
<br />
<br />so the expression B(BW)(BBC)xyz is
<br />
<br />B (BW) (BBC) x y z
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1        2    3
<br />
<br />and you can write the dynamic of B by B123 = 1(23), meaning
<br />
that 1 denotes its first argument (BW), 2 its second (BBC) and
<br />
3 denotes x, so that
<br />
<br />B(BW)(BBC)x gives (BW)((BBC)x) that is (fully abbreviated)
<br />
<br />BW(BBCx). We must yet apply it to y and then z:
<br />
<br />BW(BBCx)y
<br />
<br />Oh! here we have a choice! Indeed
<br />
the B-dynamic match the first occurrence
<br />
of B and the second one. A famous result,
<br />
known as Church Rosser Theorem tells
<br />
us that as far as thereduction will converge
<br />
on some stable molecule, the path, and
<br />
thus those choice does not matter: we will
<br />
get the same stable molecule. Soon or
<br />
later we will come back on this, but let us
<br />
just choose the leftmost reduction (another
<br />
theorem will make some advertising for that
<br />
strategy, but things will appear to be non
<br />
trivial though ...). So we apply the B-rule
<br />
on leftmost B in: B W (BBCx) y giving
<br />
W((BBCx)y) that is (fully abbrev.)
<br />
W(BBCxy), and now we have also a
<br />
choice: either we apply W(BBCxy)
<br />
directly on z, or we reduce it further.
<br />
You could verify those alternate path
<br />
as exercise; let us apply W(BBCxy)
<br />
directly on z. This gives W(BBCxy)z
<br />
(and Wab = abb) thus W(BBCxy)z gives
<br />
(BBCxy)zz = (fully abbrev.) BBCxyzz,
<br />
and this gives by the B-rule B123 = 1(23),
<br />
(where 1, the first argument of B
<br />
is B itself, and 2 is C and 3 is x)
<br />
B(Cx)yzz which by the B
<br />
rule again (with 1 = (Cx), 2 = y, 3 = z)
<br />
gives (Cx)(yz)z, which by the C-rule C123= 132
<br />
(with 1 = x, 2 = (yz) 3 = z gives xz(yz). That's Sxyz
<br />
and so we have shown that
<br />
B(BW)(BBC) behaves like S.
<br />
<br />To sum up: S = B(BW)(BBC) because
<br />
B(BW)(BBC)xyz
<br />
= BW(BBCx)yz
<br />
= W(BBCxy)z
<br />
= (BBCxy)zz
<br />
= B(Cx)yzz
<br />
= Cx(yz)z
<br />
= xz(yz) which what Sxyz gives.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Of course the original exercise I gave was harder: program
<br />
S from B, W and C. It consisted in finding that B(BW)(BBC) or
<br />
something similar. But how could we have found such expression?
<br />
A nice thing is that the verification above, which just use the
<br />
dynamics of B, C and W gives us the answer: just copy the
<br />
execution above in the reverse order (cf programming here is
<br />
inverse execution). I do it and I comment:
<br />
<br />?xyz = &lt; B, C, ...&gt;xyz = xz(yz)
<br />
<br />xz(yz) so this is what we want as the
<br />
result of B C W application
<br />
on xyz. So we must transform
<br />
xz(yz) as &lt;B,C ..&gt;xyz, that is
<br />
get those final &quot;x)y)z)&quot;, or
<br />
xyz in fully abb. form.
<br />
<br />Cx(yz)z what a clever move! we are
<br />
at once close to xyz, except
<br />
that we have two parentheses
<br />
too much, and one z to much.
<br />
To suppress one z we will
<br />
isolate it by moving the right
<br />
parenthesis to the left. That's
<br />
the inversion of the B-rule, so
<br />
we arrive at:
<br />
<br />B(Cx)yzz and applying again the
<br />
B-rule, we get
<br />
<br />(BBCxy)zz I let some left parenthesis
<br />
so that the W-rule
<br />
applicability is highlightened
<br />
<br />W(BBCxy)z And now there just
<br />
remains a right parenthesis
<br />
we would like to push on the
<br />
left, which we can do by
<br />
two successive inverse B rule:
<br />
The first gives (with 1 = W, 2
<br />
= (BBCx) and 3 = y:
<br />
<br />BW(BBCx)yz the second gives
<br />
with 1 = (BW), 2 = (BBC)
<br />
and 3 = x:
<br />
<br />B(BW)(BBC)xyz we got what we wanted:
<br />
<br />S = B(BW)(BBC). Both gives xz(yz) when
<br />
given x y and z (in that order!).
<br />
<br /><br />Question: is there a systematic method such
<br />
that giving any behavior like
<br />
<br />Xxyztuv = x(yx)(uvut) &lt;or what you want)
<br />
<br />can generate systematically a corresponding
<br />
SK or BWCK -combinator?
<br />
The answer is yes. I let you meditate the question.
<br />
(This point will be made clear when we will meet
<br />
the terrible little cousins of the combinators
<br />
which are the *lambda expression*, (and which
<br />
in our context will just abbreviate complex
<br />
combinators), but I propose to progress
<br />
and make sure that the
<br />
SK combinator are Turing Universal.
<br />
<br />I am not yet decided when I really should
<br />
introduce you to the paradoxical combinators,
<br />
which are rather crazy. Smullyan call
<br />
them wise birds, but I guess
<br />
it is an euphemism!
<br />
<br />Mmhhh... Showing turing-universality
<br />
through the use of some paradoxical
<br />
combinator is easy (once we have defined
<br />
the numbers), but there is a risk you take
<br />
bad habits! Actually we don't need the
<br />
paradoxical combinators to prove the turing
<br />
universality of the SK forest, mmmmh...
<br />
<br />Well actually I will be rather buzy so I give
<br />
you the definition of a paradoxical combinator
<br />
and I let you search one.
<br />
<br />First show that for any combinator A there
<br />
is a combinator B such that AB = B.
<br />
B is called a fixed point of A. (like the center
<br />
of a wheel C is a fixed point of the rotations of
<br />
the wheel: RC = C). It is a bit amazing that
<br />
all combinators have a fixed point and that is
<br />
what I propose you try to show. Here are hints for
<br />
different arguments. 1) Show how to find a fixed
<br />
point of A (Arbitrary combinator) using just B, M
<br />
and A. (Mx = xx I recall). 2) The same using just the
<br />
Lark L (Lxy = x(yy) I recall).
<br />
Now, a paradoxical combinator Y is just a
<br />
combinator which applied on that A will give the
<br />
fixed point of A; that is YA will give a B such that
<br />
AB = B, that is A(YA) gives YA, or more generally
<br />
Y is a combinator satisfying Yx = x(Yx).
