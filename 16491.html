<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Your position as you have described it sounds a lot like ASSA only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; without taking measure into consideration.  I am curious if you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; believe there is any merit to counting OMs or not.  Meaning, if I have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; two computers and set them up to run simulations of the same mind, are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there two minds or one?
</em><br />
<br />If the simulations are identical, then there is only one mind, which
<br />
exists in Platonia.  The information in the computer simulation is
<br />
just a &quot;shadow&quot; of the actual platonic information.  In reality, there
<br />
is no objectively existing computer running a simulation.  There is
<br />
just your perception of this.
<br />
<br />So, ultimately, I think there's no merit in counting OMs.  Every OM
<br />
exists once, and only once, and they exist along a continuum where by
<br />
every variation is realized.  Certain types of variation from one
<br />
instant to the next results in the subjective experience of the flow
<br />
of time.  Variations &quot;perpendicular&quot; to this results in the subjective
<br />
feel of different personal identities.
<br />
<br />See my previous reply to Bruno today for further details on white
<br />
rabbits.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let's say I devised an evil simulation in which a mind suffers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; horribly and is tortured, and I set the simulation to run each day,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and at the end of the day reset the simulation to the initial state,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such that after the first day, no new information or computations take
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; place, but they are repeated.  If given the choice, would you unplug
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the computer to stop the suffering of the mind in the computer, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; having already been simulated once would you consider it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; futile/meaningless to stop it.
</em><br />
<br />I would consider it futile or meaningless to stop it.  Even if I
<br />
stopped you from running it the first time, even that would be
<br />
meaningless, because the horribly suffering mind actually exists in
<br />
Platonia, not in your computer simulation.  Your feeling of having
<br />
&quot;caused&quot; their suffering is an illusion.
<br />
<br />BUT, if there was no cost to me, I'd probably go ahead and stop you,
<br />
just in case I'm wrong.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If the number of implementations of minds does not matter and if all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiences already exist, then would it not be meaningless to do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anything?
</em><br />
<br />Everything is meaningless.  BUT, as it turns out, I have no choice in
<br />
the matter.  My will is not free.  Even if I'd like to just say,
<br />
&quot;screw it, none of this matters, I quit&quot;, I still get up every day and
<br />
go to work.  Why?  Because I am not the master of my fate.  I am not
<br />
the captain of my soul.  This lack of real choice (i.e., free will) is
<br />
already clear from physicalism, but even more so with a version
<br />
platonism where all possible experiences must be realized.
<br />
<br />But really I think we lost &quot;meaningfulness&quot; before we even got to
<br />
platonism.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; All actions, whatever the consequence would be rendered
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; neutral, having already happened somewhere.  If no act of good or evil
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter this philosophy leads to utter fatalism.
</em><br />
<br />Correct.  Though, utter fatalism is not necessarily as bad as it
<br />
sounds.  It just takes a little getting used to.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't consider something happening with 100% probability to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mutually exclusive with happening more than once.  The question is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whether or not that makes any difference to the observer(s?).
</em><br />
<br />I don't think it makes any difference to the observers if, from your
<br />
perspective something happens to them 1000 times.  What matters to
<br />
them is how many times it happens to them from their perspective.  I
<br />
don't think that you having the experience of running your identical
<br />
torture simulation 1000 times has any significance whatsoever for the
<br />
entities being tortured.
<br />
<br />There SEEMS to be a relationship between the observer moments, but in
<br />
fact there is not.  In this respect it's kind of like the subjective
<br />
experience of the flow of time.
