Schmidhuber suggests that there is just one program, as simple as possible,
<br />
and the simples program generates all possible universes with their
<br />
complement of consciousness or lack of it.  So he and I agree that the fact
<br />
that there is an awful lot of 'noise' does not matter.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Subject:	Re: consciousness based on information or computation?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Several people have noticed that a very simple program can create a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pattern or even, by some definitions, a process which imitates our minds.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A trivial counting program eventually creates all possible patterns,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and you can map any string into a four-dimensional space-time diagram
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which is isomorphic to an entire universe.  It seems, then, that even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a trivial program like this ought to be able to create structures which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are identical to our minds down to the smallest detail, and therefore,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perhaps, we should conclude that we are likely to be the product of such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a trivial program.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If I understand him, Wei suggests that a way around this is to notice that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the valid mind or valid universe produced in this way is buried amidst
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an unimaginably large amount of garbage.  To estimate the contribution a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particular program makes to instantiating a mind we should look not only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at the size of the program, but also at the difficulty of identifying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or locating the mind amongst its output.  Here we have a very simple
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; program, but if we then wanted to point to where in its output we had
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a mind-creating universe being produced, we would have to specify a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; huge amount of information.  Combining these two we find that the total
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information needed to both *create* and *locate* the mind in the output
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the program is very large, making the contribution of that program
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be very small.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This approach also offers a solution to the problem that even in our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; own universe, you can select subsets of, say, water molecule collisions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which produce patterns identical to our own consciousness.  A vat of water
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as big as my brain has billions of water molecules in each region which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is of the size of my neurons, and in the time my neurons fire, billions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of water molecule collisions will occur in each such region.  By paying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attention to only a tiny subset of these water molecule collisions, we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can find a pattern of collisions which is identical to the pattern of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; firings of my neurons when I am thinking.  Of course, to do this we have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to ignore the billions of other collisions we aren't paying attention to,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but it might seem that adding more collisions cannot change the existence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the patterns that are sufficient for consciousness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, Wei's approach calls attention to the size of the program needed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to select those molecules to pay attention to.  In practice we would seem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to need a full-sized neural simulation to do that.  This would be a very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; large program, so the actual contribution of such random collisions to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my consciousness would be vanishingly small.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This approach seems to move away from the question, is this system
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious?  That is no longer seen as having a yes/no answer.  Instead, we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; try to say, how much contribution does this system make to a given mind?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If we can have a short program to define the laws of physics which govern
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the system, and another short program can identify the mind states with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; states of the system, then it makes a relatively large contribution.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But if either of these two programs must be large, then it makes a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; small contribution.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is somewhat counter-intuitive to downgrade the mental contribution
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of a pattern just because it is lost among a large amount of noise.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; From the external perspective, maybe it makes sense; information that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is buried is less useful than information which is easily exposed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But mental activity seems like an &quot;inner&quot; quality; the string doesn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;know&quot; whether it is surrounded by noise or is out in the open; it should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be equally conscious either way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However if we accept the initial idea that short programs make more of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a contribution, I don't see a problem in saying that short *output* also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; makes more of a contribution.  Why, after all, should minds produced by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; short programs be considered to make a larger contribution than those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for long ones?  We have to make some implicit assumptions in order to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; make this work.  Sometimes we imagine an actual computer cranking out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; programs and running them, with short programs getting more run time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than long ones.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; With this kind of mechanistic picture, we could also imagine that programs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which take more time to produce their output could also make less of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contribution.  Programs which produce larger output could be penalized
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in this way or simply by virtue of their greater resource requirements.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There does not seem to be a unique measuring system for estimating
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the contribution of any given program to the overall reality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Penalizing programs for program size, run time, or output size all seem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; somewhat plausible.  With this kind of model it does make sense that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contribution a given output pattern makes would depend on details of how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it was produced by the program, including how much other output there was.
