</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; states in the computation is always the same as their order in any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; sequence of conscious experience in which they appear? For example, if

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; there is a computation of states A, B, and C then is that a possible

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; sequence in consciousness?  In general there will be another, different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; computation that computes the states in the order A, C, B, so is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; too a possible sequence in consciousness?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hypothetical situation, assuming an objectively existing physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe. All of the particles in the universe kick into reverse and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; start going backwards. For some reason every particle in the universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instantaneously reverses course. And also space begins contracting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instead of expanding. Everything in the universe hits a rubberwall and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bounces back 180 degrees.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So now instead of expanding, everything is on an exact &quot;rewind&quot; mode,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and we're headed back to the &quot;Big Bang&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The laws of physics work the same in both directions...if you solve
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them forward in time, you can take your answers, reverse the equations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and get your starting values, right?  With the possible exception of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; kaon decay, but we'll leave that aside for now.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is what they always go on about with the &quot;arrow of time&quot;. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; laws of physics work the same forwards and backwards in time. It's not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; impossible for an egg to &quot;unscramble&quot;, it's just very very very very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very unlikely. But if it did so, no laws of physics would be broken.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And, in fact, if you wait long enough, it will eventually happen.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Okay, so everything has reversed direction. The actual reversal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; process is, of course, impossible. But after everything reverses,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everything just plays out by the normal laws of physics. Only that one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instant of reversal breaks the laws of physics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; External time is still moving forward, in the same direction as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; before. We didn't reverse time. We just reversed the direction of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; every particle.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So, now photons and neutrinos no longer shoot away from the sun -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instead now they shoot towards the sun, which when the photons and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; neutrinos and gamma rays hit helium atoms, the helium atoms split back
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; into individual hydrogen atoms, and absorb some energy in the process.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Again, no physical laws are broken, and time is moving forward.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, back on earth, everything is playing out in reverse as well. You
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; breath in carbon dioxide and absorb heat from your surroundings and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; use the heat to break the carbon dioxide into carbon and oxygen. You
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exhale the oxygen, and you turn the carbon into sugars, which you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; eventually return to your digestive track where it's reconstituted
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; into food, which you regurgitate onto your fork and place it back onto
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your plate.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Okay. So, still no physical laws broken. Entropy is decreasing, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that's not impossible, just very unlikely under normal conditions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now. Your brain is also working backwards. But exactly backwards from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; before. Every thought that you had yesterday, you will have again
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tomorrow, in reverse. You will unthink it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My question is, what would you experience in this case? What would it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be like to live in this universe where &quot;external&quot; time is still going
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; forward, but where all particles are retracing their steps precisely?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The laws of phsyics are still working exactly as before, but because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all particle trajectories were perfectly reversed, everything is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rolling back towards the big bang.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In my opinion, we wouldn't notice any difference. We would not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience the universe moving in reverse, we would still experience
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it moving forward exactly as we do now...we would still see the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe as expanding even though it was contracting, we would still
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; see the sun giving off light and energy even though it was absorbing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; both. In other words, we would still see a universe with increasing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entropy even though we actually would live in a universe with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; decreasing entropy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And why would that be the case? Because our mental states determine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what is the past for us and what is the future. There is no &quot;external
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arrow of time&quot;. The arrow of time is internal. The past is the past
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because we remember it and because the neurons of our brains tell us
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that it has already happened to us. The future is the future because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it's unknown, and because the neurons of our brains tell us that it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will happen to us soon.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If there is an external arrow of time, it is irrelevant, because as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this thought experiment shows it doesn't affect the way we perceive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time. Our internal mental state at any given instant determines what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is the future and what is the past for us.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</em><br />
<br />I was with you up to that last sentence.  Forward or backward, we just 
<br />
experience increasing entropy as increasing time, but that doesn't 
<br />
warrant the conclusion that no process is required and an &quot;instant&quot; 
<br />
within itself has an arrow of time.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In fact, you could run the universe forwards and backwards as many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; times as you wanted like this. We would never notice anything. We
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would always percieve increasing entropy. For us, time would always
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; move forward, never backwards.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My point being, as always, that our experience of reality is always
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entirely dependent on our brain state. We can't know anything about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the universe that is not represented in the information of our brain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; state at any given instant.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Forwards or backwards, it's all just particles moving around, assuming
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; various configurations, some of which give rise to consciousness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Again, assuming that there actually is an external physical world.  We
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could, I think, apply the same idea to running a computer simulation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of a human brain in reverse where instead of computing the next state,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we compute the previous state.
</em><br />
That was my point in asking Bruno whether there is a universal 
<br />
reversible computer (Turing machines obviously aren't reversible).  
<br />
Since a QM (without collapse) model of the universe is reversible, 
<br />
absent a reversible computer either the universe could not be computed 
<br />
or QM is wrong.
