<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I've endured this thread long enough!  Let's get back to something I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can understand!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Why?&quot; you'll ask.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'll reply, &quot;Because your audience is shrinking!  I've plotted the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Audience vs. Topic, and find that, in 12.63 months, there is a 91% 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probability that, if the topic doesn't become understandable to one 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with an IQ of 120, your audience will be zero, and the only expositor 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will be Bruno. 
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I thought only politicians were interested in audience (during 
<br />
electoral period!).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not that there's anything wrong with that, but we must acknowledge 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that Bruno speaks a language that very few of us can understand. 
</em><br />
<br /><br />Please ask when you don't understand, unless you are not interested. I 
<br />
insist enough that there is no stupid questions. Perhaps, like so many 
<br />
(especially in france and Belgium) you get some traumatic experience 
<br />
with math and you did persuade yourself you cannot understand math. My 
<br />
experience is that people who believes they does not understand math, 
<br />
well in 99,9999% are just imagining difficulties which does not exist 
<br />
at all. They are too much clever! Like henry Poincare I believe 
<br />
mathematics is the easiest of all the fields. Human psychology is the 
<br />
most complex one.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno, and probably Russell and a few others, are clearly Homo 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Superior, while the rest of us are mere Homo Sapiens.&quot;
</em><br />
<br /><br />I am talking to the the Machina Universalis. Todays, with the exception 
<br />
of those who got a highly injured brain, current universal machines are 
<br />
still *very* far from being as clever as the stupidest human.
<br />
I bet you have just miss some definition, in which case it is all 
<br />
normal you miss the track.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You will then say, &quot;Our discourse is meant for Homo Superior.  If you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.&quot;
</em><br />
<br /><br />I am addressing the most &quot;inferior&quot; of all the creatures, the simple 
<br />
mind common to all of us (but yes sometimes traumatized by teaching 
<br />
driven by pure competition or moral sadism. Note that, I have nothing 
<br />
against competition *per se*, but everything against competition for 
<br />
competition and form of social elitism based on it, which has lead us 
<br />
to some form of in-numeracy.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'll reply, &quot;Damn!  I was hoping to learn something!&quot;
</em><br />
<br /><br />Just tell us what you don't understand. Do you grasp the notion of 
<br />
function from N to N? Do you know what N refers to? Just ask. You have 
<br />
the opportunity of being in front of a math teacher who is willing to 
<br />
explain you the basic starting from zero. Not just because I would be 
<br />
so compassionned, but because later it will be capital to understand 
<br />
that what I say can be understandable, in some sense, by very simple 
<br />
machine.
<br />
<br />What are your relation with computers? Theoretical computer science is 
<br />
a field which you can get startling results quickly when starting from 
<br />
zero. This is rather uncommon.
<br />
<br />Also, we are discussing since years. It is all normal that we arrive at 
<br />
delicate points needing to be more specific, especially in 
<br />
counterintuitive-land.
<br />
<br />Come back in the kitchen Norman. You can understand the thread, and if 
<br />
you ask all the needed question, perhaps the audience will grow up 
<br />
again!  Because then many other will benefit from your questions.
<br />
<br />I don't believe in non-mathematicans!  Those who say &quot;I have never 
<br />
understand math&quot; are just either snobbish, or have been mentally 
<br />
destroyed by some mad teacher (frequent in some country).
<br />
<br />Bruno
