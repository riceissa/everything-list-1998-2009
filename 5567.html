<br />

<br />
:
<br />
: I mean are there any circumstances in which you'd act differently if you
<br />

<br />
:
<br />
: (no)
<br />
<br />Let me see if I follow this.  According to decision theory, we take
<br />
those actions which maximize expected utility.  Expected utility for
<br />
the outcome of an action is a weighted average of the utility of each
<br />
possible outcome, weighted by the probability that each outcome occurs.
<br />
The probability for an outcome is ultimately based on one's belief in
<br />
the nature of the world.
<br />
<br />Knowing the nature of the world is hard, and we can have only uncertain
<br />
information about it.  One way to express this uncertainty is to
<br />
say that we might live in any one of many different possible worlds,
<br />
and to estimate a probability distribution over the possibilities.
<br />
Bayesian reasoning then gives us rules for how we should update these
<br />
probabilities, based on observations.
<br />
<br />Multiverse theory introduces a new complication.  If a Tegmarkian or
<br />
even Schmiduberian multiverse model is true, or might be true, then we
<br />
need a rule to estimate how likely we are to live in one element of that
<br />
multiverse or another.  This rule produces a numerical probability value
<br />
for each element of the ensemble of universes, which we call a measure.
<br />
The measure is necessary for us to go from the abstract multiverse model
<br />
to a set of rules that allows us to make predictions about what we will
<br />
see, and therefore to take effective actions.
<br />
<br />(Actually, the measure is usually considered as being a property of
<br />
an element of the multiverse ensemble, i.e. a property of an entire
<br />
universe, rather than the probability of a specific observer being in
<br />
that world.  Then we need yet another rule to go from the measure of a
<br />
multiverse branch to the probability that we are actually in that branch.
<br />
But for the present purpose we can combine these two rules and just let
<br />
the measure be the probability of a branch being &quot;real&quot; for a particular
<br />
observer.)
<br />
<br />In the context of Bayesian reasoning, the measure is problematic,
<br />
because it introduces an extra degree of freedom in our universe model.
<br />
Rather than having simply a probability distribution over possible
<br />
universes, we have to consider that among the possible universes are
<br />
multiverses, and then there are an infinite number of possible measures
<br />
for each possible kind of multiverse.
<br />
<br />These measures are a hard problem and it's not clear what the right
<br />
way is to think of them.  There are various philosphical arguments that
<br />
one measure or another is the most likely to be true.  However it would
<br />
seem that no such argument can be conclusive, hence we must always admit
<br />
some uncertainty in the possible measure.  It's also not clear whether
<br />
observation allows us to constrain measure, because in a multiverse model
<br />
we observe only a small part of the multiverse, and so we can't judge
<br />
the conditional probabilities necessary to apply Bayesian reasoning.
<br />
Can we say, for example, that our observations of the universe imply
<br />
(if a multiverse model were true) that the measure must be such that
<br />
our universe has a relatively large measure?  Maybe not, because even
<br />
if our universe had a small measure, we would still be here observing it.
<br />
<br />Anyway, I think Wei's point is that if we admit even the possibility that
<br />
a multiverse model is true, then the shape of our mental possible-universe
<br />
space becomes inconsistent or redundant.  We have all these various
<br />
possible universes as in standard Bayesian reasoning, and among them we
<br />
add the multiverse.  But the multiverse includes all possibilities, and
<br />
in particular it includes all of the non-multiverse possible universes
<br />
we were considering originally.  So it's redundant to consider these
<br />
possible universes outside the context of the multiverse, since we
<br />
can get the same set of possible universes by looking solely within
<br />
the multiverse.  And given our freedom to choose the measure for the
<br />
universes within the multiverse, we can reproduce all of our probability
<br />
estimates for non-multiverse possible universes, even if we just consider
<br />
the multiverse.
<br />
<br />Therefore, as Wei says, we can give the multiverse a probability of 1,
<br />
and choose a measure over the worlds within the multiverse to match any
<br />
desired probability distribution over possible worlds.
<br />
<br />I see two possible problems with this.  The first is that it's not clear
<br />
that we have this much freedom in our choice of measure.  Some Bayesians
<br />
may accept the philosophical arguments which say that certain measures
<br />
are preferred.  The second is that if we did have complete freedom in
<br />
choosing a measure, how can Bayesianism work in this model?  Specifically,
<br />
how should we update our beliefs in response to observations?  In the
<br />
standard Bayesian model we have specified rules to follow.  Would that
<br />
imply that if we accept the multiverse as certain, we must still apply
<br />
those specific rules to update our estimates of measure?  That seems
<br />
inconsistent with the assumption that measure is freely chosen.
