Tianran Chen wrote (in private reply to my earlier post, but I thought 
<br />
this discussion
<br />
generally interesting, hope that's ok Tianran):
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;i do agree that many very valuable point of view had been 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;criticised unfairly due to their 'group selection' nature. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;however, i am quite convinced that there are fundamental 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;problems embedded in it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;first of all, i think to look at evolution through a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;individual or group point of view is always dangerous. since 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;they are not the fundamental unit of evolution. evolution, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(in the sense which it is referred to in most biology 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;context) DOES NOT manipulate individual NOR species directly, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;instead, it is always the small packets of genetic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;information (such as gene or meme) that is being 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;manipulated. so, it is a safe theory about evolution should 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;always able to be translated into languages in terms of gene 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;or meme, and if a theory cannot, then it is not safe to use. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and this is exactly the problem of 'group selection'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
But just because it is the genes are being manipulated DIRECTLY does not 
<br />
mean that
<br />
other factors are not important to understanding what's going on, and 
<br />
understanding what
<br />
factors may be most ESSENTIALLY driving a particular evolutionary 
<br />
direction.
<br />
For example, biology now understands that it is not single genes, but 
<br />
sets of genes acting together in
<br />
regulatory networks, that are the fundamental units of &quot;functionality&quot; 
<br />
and therefore, of
<br />
&quot;adaptive or maladaptive functionality&quot; in organisms.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;BECAUSE THE EVOLVABLE &quot;GOAL&quot; IS NOT SIMPLY TO MAXIMIZE THE
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;CHANCE OF SURVIVAL OF AN ORGANISM OF THE NEXT SHORT-TERM ENCOUNTER.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;THE &quot;GOAL&quot; IS TO MAXIMIZE THE PROBABILITY OF SURVIVAL OF THE SUM TOTAL
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;OF ALL OF THE ORGANISM'S ENCOUNTERS UP TO WHEN THE ORGANISM REPRODUCES.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;    
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;disagree. a gene's 'goal' is to maximize the availability of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;its own copies in the entire gene pool. so to look at it in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;individual level, it implies that an individual is more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;likely to behave in such a way that it tend to maximize the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;chance of some gene to replicate. and 'some gene' here, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;refered to not only genes in its own body, but also in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;other's body. one thing to notice here is that very often, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;individual try to do so at the cost of its own chance for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;breed. such behavior can be found commonly in social 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;animals, symbiosis systems, and etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;again, here mention about the 'goal' of a gene. but what i 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;really mean is that due the the selection pressure, genes 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;who had survived selections behave in the way as if they had 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the 'goal' although they are really blind about future. so 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the 'goal' is simply a short hand notation, do not take it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;literally.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
You'll note that I was the one who started the practice of putting 
<br />
&quot;GOAL&quot; in quotes, indicating
<br />
that it is not to be taken literally, but as a stand-in or short-hand 
<br />
for a complex set of factors
<br />
that lead to a tendency of evolution to support one kind of trait over 
<br />
another.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;valid theories has to be general enough to explain all sorts 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of things in the domain, not just part of them. and now 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;better theories does exist (such as self-gene, and memic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;evolution). so 'group selection' SHOULD be marked as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;obselete.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />I disagree with your last clause.
<br />
To me, a fan of general theories of emergent complex ordered systems,
<br />
of which life evolution is only one example, one of the most fundamental 
<br />
questions
<br />
is what is the best scope-boundary that best defines what is the most 
<br />
&quot;interesting&quot; or
<br />
&quot;systematic&quot; or &quot;robust&quot; system. What I mean by this is that we have a 
<br />
degree of free reign
<br />
about what elements (of the world, universe, what have you) that we 
<br />
choose to include in
<br />
our definition of a system. Or in other words, for ANY particular set of 
<br />
elements that have something
<br />
to do with each other, some crazy guy will have the right to call THAT 
<br />
collection a perfectly
<br />
valid system; his most important system perhaps. So you can imagine 
<br />
possible &quot;system-scopes&quot;
<br />
or &quot;system-boundaries&quot; as being an infinitely variable set of concentric 
<br />
spheroids overlapping,
<br />
Venn-diagram-like, being at wide ranges of spatiotemporal scales, and 
<br />
including/excluding
<br />
different elements.
<br />
<br />Faced with such a scenario, one is forced to ask &quot;are there any 
<br />
universal principles that would
<br />
let me decide which &quot;boundary-spheroid&quot; is the most &quot;systematic&quot; or 
<br />
consideration-worthy system
<br />
(at this spatiotemporal scale in this vicinity, anyway)?
<br />
<br />Or, both generalizing and specializing a bit; given that, for example 
<br />
natural systems tend to be
<br />
&quot;fractally functional&quot;; that is, comprised of nested layers of 
<br />
smaller-scale functional systems, we can
<br />
ask &quot;how (at what scale boundaries) do we best divide this natural 
<br />
system up into nested layers (i.e. where
<br />
if anywhere are the best-defined layer boundaries (those layer 
<br />
boundaries that are the best at separating of
<br />
distinct functionalities) , and for EACH spatio-temporal-scale layer of 
<br />
this natural system, what are the
<br />
best-defined system-scope spheroids? What are the system-scope spheroids 
<br />
that perhaps are the best
<br />
clusters of negative entropy at that spatiotemporal scale?
<br />
<br />Now to me, the evolutionary issue is to figure out how and why 
<br />
&quot;fractally functional&quot; natural systems evolve
<br />
their functionality at all of their spatio-temporal scale layers (and 
<br />
thus how they maximize, AT EACH
<br />
LAYER-SCALE (and fractal-functionality system level) their
<br />
pattern robustness and pattern-longevity, compared to competitor patterns.
<br />
<br />The direct variations (mutations, recombinations) in genes are an 
<br />
important part of this picture, to be
<br />
sure, but analyzing the whole evolution-trend question in terms of 
<br />
individual mutations of individual genes
<br />
is akin to saying that &quot;it's all the quantum wave equation, really&quot; 
<br />
about all of the phenomena in physics, large
<br />
and small. It's true, but it's also fairly trivially true. Every theory 
<br />
has a scope of application, and there is room
<br />
for other theories at different levels to explain aggregate phenomena 
<br />
that are not directly or concisely
<br />
explainable by the purely reductionist &quot;atomic&quot; theory.
<br />
<br />Many of the &quot;aggregate-level&quot; theories will be wrong, and/or hard to 
<br />
demonstrate, but that does not say
<br />
that all of them are wrong. Just that the right ones will be hard to 
<br />
tease out.
<br />
<br />Cheers,
<br />
Eric
