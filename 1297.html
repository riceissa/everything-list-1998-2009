<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What do you think?

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Where exactly are the holes?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; One is what I mentioned earlier, that a trivial program which enumerates
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and executes (in dovetailing, interleaved form) all possible programs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; will create every mind in every possible situation.  This is a very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; short program and hence is the most likely universe for us to live in.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't see this as a hole at all.  Maybe I'm missing something, but I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thought the whole point of postulating a universal dovetailer was that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it creates &quot;everything&quot; from zero information (or as near as dammit).
</em><br />
<br />To see that it is a hole, you have to know what the argument is that it
<br />
is a hole in!
<br />
<br />The argument attempts to explain why we don't see flying rabbits or
<br />
other magical exceptions to the natural and simple laws of physics.
<br />
The reason, according to this argument, is that universes with simple
<br />
laws of physics can be described (simulated) with a shorter program
<br />
than universes which have complicated laws of physics with all kinds of
<br />
exceptions like magical flying rabbits.  The argument further assumes that
<br />
universes exist with greater probability the shorter their program is.
<br />
Since flying-rabbit universes have larger programs than non-flying-rabbit
<br />
ones, they are therefore of lower probability.  Hence we are unlikely
<br />
to be living in a flying-rabbit universe.
<br />
<br />That is the argument.  The hole is that it does not work if we consider
<br />
one of the shortest possible universe programs, the universal dovetailer
<br />
(UD).  This simple program creates, as part of its output, flying rabbits.
<br />
Yet it is an incredibly simple program, hence it is very high probability.
<br />
In fact, it is very likely that we do live in the universe created by
<br />
this program, and since that universe has flying rabbits in it we have
<br />
failed to explain why we don't see flying rabbits.
<br />
<br />To resolve this, we have to do one of two things, as I see it.  We can
<br />
disallow the UD as a legal &quot;universe&quot; simulator, by saying that it doesn't
<br />
really create one universe, it creates multiple ones.  And if we do that,
<br />
we can then restrict our attention to programs which create only single
<br />
universes, and then indeed we find that flying-rabbit universes are less
<br />
probable than others.
<br />
<br />However to take this step we need an objective basis for doing so.
<br />
We could say that &quot;one universe&quot; is identified with a single spacetime
<br />
manifold, or is some kind of structure that has a certain amount of
<br />
connectivity and continuity.  Since the UD creates multiple independent
<br />
structures with no connection to each other, we could argue that it
<br />
objectively creates multiple universes.  However this adds considerable
<br />
baggage to the theory.
<br />
<br />The other possibility, which was proposed by Wei Dai and is the one
<br />
which makes sense to me, is to state that the probability of an event
<br />
or structure is not just a matter of how probable the universe is which
<br />
creates it.
<br />
<br />Rather, you have to look at how easy it is to localize that particular
<br />
structure within the universe.  A simple program which outputs an enormous
<br />
universe which has, buried in one tiny place, a copy of my mind, should
<br />
not count for much.  A more complex program which outputs a smaller
<br />
universe in which my mind is a proportionately bigger piece might actually
<br />
contribute more, even though the program to create the universe is larger.
<br />
<br />Hence, the solution is to say that the contribution to the probability of
<br />
structure A in universe X is the size of the program to create universe X,
<br />
plus the size of the program which, given universe X, outputs structure A.
<br />
<br />There is a very strong precedent for this in Kolmogorov complexity.
<br />
We say that the complexity of a string is the size of the smallest program
<br />
which outputs (only) that string.  We could write a trivial counting
<br />
program to output all strings, but that doesn't mean each such string
<br />
has a small complexity.  If you have two programs, one which outputs many
<br />
strings, and the other which takes that output and selects some particular
<br />
substring for output, then the sum of the sizes of those two programs
<br />
represents the total size of the program to output that substring.  It
<br />
is this total size which is used to calculate K. complexity.
<br />
<br />This is exactly what Wei proposes to do for measuring probabilites in
<br />
the context of the multiple universes.  It is not enough to know the
<br />
probability of a universe which includes the desired structure (my mind,
<br />
say) somewhere; you also need to add in a measure of how hard it is to
<br />
localize that structure within that universe.
<br />
<br />This plugs the hole in the argument above, because even though the UD
<br />
outputs a flying-rabbit universe, localizing that universe within the UD
<br />
output is going to take at least as large a program as one which creates
<br />
it in the first place.  Hence the net contribution of the UD to the
<br />
probability of any given structure is no larger than for a straightforward
<br />
program which implements that structure.  The hole is thereby plugged.
<br />
