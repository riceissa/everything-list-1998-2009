<br />
An observer is a pattern in space-time (a physical process) which 
<br />
engages in the processing and storage
<br />
of information about its surroundings in space-time. Its information 
<br />
processing is such that the observer
<br />
creates abstracted, isomorphic, representative symbolic models of the 
<br />
structures and processes surrounding
<br />
it, as well as other, purely abstract informational model structures. 
<br />
The observer has subprocesses of itself
<br />
which process its representative models in such a way as to model, 
<br />
simulate, or calculate relations between
<br />
informationally connected local parts of the space-time surroundings of 
<br />
the observer. These &quot;cognitive&quot;
<br />
subprocesses also model, simulate, or calculate relations between the 
<br />
observer process itself and its
<br />
surrounding structures and processes in space-time.
<br />
<br />An observer is constrained to exist as a substructure of  an 
<br />
informationally self-consistent medium,
<br />
and a medium in which notions of change, locality, and metric space and 
<br />
time can be defined.
<br />
<br />Further, an observer is constrained to exist in a locale which has a 
<br />
thermodynamic range of variation,
<br />
and a fine-grained structural variety suitable for the random 
<br />
coalescence of structures (slow localized processes)
<br />
which can attain auto-poietic (pattern-self-sustaining) properties 
<br />
relative to alternative patterns of organization of
<br />
matter and energy. As a restatement and refinement of that constraint; 
<br />
the locale of the observer must be suitable
<br />
for the emergence of and growth of stable, organized complex systems 
<br />
with adequate degrees of freedom to explore
<br />
many possibilities for their form and function. Only in such a 
<br />
constrained environment could an observer
<br />
general-information-processing-and-epresenting-and-abstracting process 
<br />
arise spontaneously and maintain itself
<br />
long enough to do meaningful observation of its surroundings.
<br />
<br />An observer is constrained to perceive only informationally 
<br />
self-consistent states (with respect perhaps to some
<br />
notion of locality and metric space-time) that its medium exhibits. It is
<br />
conceivable that the medium exhibits other, informationally mutually 
<br />
inconsistent states, but any aspect of the
<br />
&quot;extent&quot; of these other pseudo-states of the medium can in principle
<br />
not be perceived by any information receiver and processor  such as the 
<br />
observer.
