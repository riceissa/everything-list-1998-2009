<br />
Two issues I wish to mention, here.
<br />
<br />Firstly, I present a few rapid-fire ideas about objective morality,
<br />
culminating in an integration of aesthetics, intelligence, and
<br />
morality, all in a few brief sentences ;)
<br />
<br />Secondly, I give a mention to computer scientist Randy Pausch, who
<br />
recently died.
<br />
<br />As regards the first issue:
<br />
<br />It’s been said there are clear ways to determine physical and
<br />
mathematical facts, but nothing similar for values. But, in point (2)
<br />
below I point out what appears to be an objectively existing set of
<br />
values which underlies *all* of science.  I present two brief but
<br />
profound points that I what readers to consider and ponder carefully:
<br />
<br />Point (1) there is a clear evolution to the universe. It started from
<br />
a low-entropy-density state, and is moving towards a higher-entropy
<br />
density, which, remarkably, just happens to coincide with an increase
<br />
in physical complexity with time. In the beginning the universe was in
<br />
a state with *the lowest possible* entropy. This is expressed in the
<br />
laws of thermodynamics and big bang cosmology. So it simply isn’t true
<br />
that there is no teleology (purpose) built into the universe. The laws
<br />
of thermodynamics and modern cosmology (big bang theory) clearly
<br />
express the fact that there is.
<br />
<br />Point (2) the whole of science relies on Occam’s razor, the idea that
<br />
the universe is in some sense ‘simple’. It must be emphasized that
<br />
Occam’s razor pervades all of science – it is not simply some sort of
<br />
‘add on’. As Popper pointed out, an infinite number of theories could
<br />
explain any given set of observations; therefore any inductive
<br />
generalization requires a principle – Occam’s razor – to get any
<br />
useful results at all.
<br />
<br />Here is the point that most haven’t quite grasped - Occam’s razor is
<br />
*a set of aesthetic principles* - the notion of ‘simplicity’ is *a set
<br />
of aesthetic principles*; Why? Because it is simply another way of
<br />
saying that some representations are more *elegant* than others, which
<br />
is the very notion of aesthetics! I repeat: the whole of science only
<br />
works because of a set of *aesthetic principles* - a *set of values*.
<br />
<br />If all values are only subjective preferences, it would follow that
<br />
the whole of science relies on subjective preferences. But subjective
<br />
preferences have only existed as long as sentiments – therefore how
<br />
could physical laws have functioned before sentiments? The idea that
<br />
all values are subjective leads to a direct and blatant logical
<br />
contradiction.
<br />
<br />Both these points are related and simply inexplicable without
<br />
appealing to objective terminal values. At the beginning of time the
<br />
universe was in the simplest possible state (minimal entropy density).
<br />
Why? Occam’s razor is wide-ranging and pervades the whole of science.
<br />
The simple is favored over the complex – that is– Occam’s razor is a
<br />
set of aesthetic value judgments without which not a single Bayesian
<br />
result could be obtained.
<br />
<br />*Every single Bayesian result rests on these implicit value judgments*
<br />
to set priors. It must be repeated that *not one single scientific
<br />
result could be obtained* without these secret (implicit) value
<br />
judgments which set priors, that our defenders of the Bayesian faith
<br />
on these forums are trying to pretend are not part of science!
<br />
<br />The secret to intelligence is aesthetics, not Bayesian math.
<br />
Initially, this statement seems preposterous, but the argument in the
<br />
next paragraph is my whole point, so it merits careful reading (the
<br />
paragraph is marked with a * to show this is the crux of this post):
<br />
<br />*As regards the optimization of science, the leverage obtained from
<br />
setting the priors (Occam’s razor – aesthetics – art) is far greater
<br />
that that obtained from logical manipulations to update probabilities
<br />
based on additional empirical data (math). Remember, the aesthetic
<br />
principles used to set the priors (Occam’s razor) reduce a potentially
<br />
infinite set of possible theories to a manageable (finite) number,
<br />
whereas laborious mathematical probability updates based on incoming
<br />
empirical data (standard Bayesian theory) is only guaranteed to
<br />
converge on the correct theory after an infinite time, and even then
<br />
the reason for the convergence is entirely inexplicable.
<br />
<br />The * paragraph suggests that aesthetics is the real basis of
<br />
intelligence, not Bayesian math, and further that aesthetic terminal
<br />
values are objectively real.
<br />
<br />For those who do initially find these claims preposterous, to help
<br />
overcome your initial disbelief, I point to a superb essay from well-
<br />
respected computer hacker, Paul Graham, who explains why aesthetics
<br />
plays a far greater role in science than many have realized:
<br />
<br />‘Taste for Makers’: <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/taste.html">http://www.paulgraham.com/taste.html</a>
<br />
<br />As regards the second issue, I’d like to draw readers’ attention to
<br />
computer scientist Randy Pausch. Randy Pausch was a computer scientist
<br />
who developed the famous ‘Alice’ software to teach programming in a
<br />
virtual reality setting. He was a virtual reality expert, a professor
<br />
in Human-Computer Interaction at Carnegie Mellon University. In
<br />
August, 2007 he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and given 3-6
<br />
months to live. He gave a famous ‘Last Lecture’ which spread virally
<br />
(via ‘YouTube’) and inspired millions (this was followed by a book
<br />
‘The Last Lecture’). He died on 25th July, 2008 .
<br />
<br />The Randy Pausch Memorial Footbridge connects the Gates Center for
<br />
Computer Science, with an adjacent arts building, symbolizing the
<br />
bridge between art and science.
