<br />
<br /><br /><br />Phenomenology
<br />
<br />Roughly speaking, phenomenology is a philosophical approach which
<br />
studies common features of human consciousness while remaining
<br />
non-committal about what is &quot;outside&quot; consciousness. It is very broadly
<br />
related to metaphysical idealism and scepticism. It differs from the
<br />
stronger versions of scepticism by not going so far as to deny a world
<br />
outside consciousness. It differs from the stronger versions of
<br />
idealism in its insistence on studying common features of multiple
<br />
consciousnesses, thus avoiding, if by fiat, consciousness.
<br />
<br />The Phenomenlogy Approach to Science
<br />
<br />The Phenomenological Approach to Science consists of a number of claims
<br />
which are not always distinguished by the proponent of phenomenalism:
<br />
* Science can be done in a phenomenological way
<br />
<br />* Science is done in a phenomenological way
<br />
<br />* Science should be done in a phenomenological way
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Science and physics.
<br />
<br />The idea that science should be non-committal about the existence of
<br />
its objects of investigation would come as quite a surprise to the
<br />
average geologist or botanists. Phenomenalism in science is realyabout
<br />
physics, since the existence of quarks or magnetic fields is so much
<br />
more deniable -- at least dubitable -- than the existence of rocks or
<br />
flowers.
<br />
<br />&quot;Phenomenological&quot; physics.
<br />
<br />There is a certain kind of procedure in physics which is called
<br />
&quot;Phenomenological&quot;. It consists of finding a pattern within data
<br />
without -- for the time being -- relating it to any deeper laws or
<br />
principles. This is at least analogous to what phenomenologists want.
<br />
It is perhaps not the same thing, because it deals with
<br />
instrument-readings, not literal phenomena, ie conscious experiences --
<br />
see Operationalism and phenomenology.
<br />
The other issue is that this procedure is very much second-best within
<br />
physics. The establishment of a &quot;Phenomenological&quot; pattern is regarded
<br />
as only a prelude to the job finding a deep theoretical interpretation
<br />
(see Hume's problem).
<br />
<br /><br />Operationalism and phenomenology.
<br />
<br />Operationalism is the idea that the content of a scientific theory goes
<br />
no further than operations and measurements that can be performed with
<br />
laboratory equipment.an approach to science that is at least parallel
<br />
to phenomenology. Like phenomenology it eschews &quot;deep&quot; explanations,
<br />
and seems considerably more applicable to physics than to the special
<br />
sciences. At a pinch, an electron might be a bundle of
<br />
instrument-readings, but a bacterium is hardly a microscope!
<br />
<br />Hume's problem.
<br />
<br />Hume's critique of causality hinges on the unobservability of causes as
<br />
such. Realism supposes that causes exist but are unobservable, like the
<br />
magnetic field that causes iron filings to form a pattern. Strict
<br />
empiricism and phenomenalism have little option but to reject
<br />
causality. Phenomenalism does so quite explicitly with its stated
<br />
preference for &quot;description&quot; over causal explanation.
<br />
But is science illegitimate in positing causes? Hume's arguemnt really
<br />
has bite when dealing with necessary connections between events. The
<br />
explanatory mechanisms posited by scientific realism are always
<br />
revisable, so apriori necessity is not asserted.
<br />
<br /><br />Patterns and prediction.
<br />
<br />The revisability of scientific theories -- along with their
<br />
confirmability and their falsifiability - -all depend on their ability
<br />
to predict. The phenomenalist's substitute for prediction is pattern.
<br />
But the mere fact that a pattern of experience has held in the past in
<br />
no guarantee that it will continue to hold in the future. Of course, a
<br />
phemomenalist scientist can go through the same motions of
<br />
theory-confirmation as a realist physicist, she just can't give an
<br />
account of why prediction works when it works, because she is not
<br />
confirming anything beyond the data itself. Rather than saying &quot;the
<br />
Higgs Boson exists&quot;, she is saying something like &quot;the Higgs pattern
<br />
has held up to now. This is relevant to the question of whether science
<br />
(or at least physics) should adopt the phenomenological approach. It
<br />
cannot do so without changing anything. What is changed is that a
<br />
certain kind of explanatory understanding, the ability to answer &quot;why&quot;
<br />
questions, has to be foregone.
<br />
Most scientists see themselves in the business of explaining and
<br />
understanding, and so prefer realism to phenomenalism.
<br />
<br />I suppose the phenomenologist could still mount an argument to the
<br />
effect that science should adopt phenomenalism because science should
<br />
abandon explantory understanding. But explanatory understanding is
<br />
evidently a good thing. The phenomenlogist presumably thinks abandoning
<br />
it would lead to a better thing. The main candidate seems to be
<br />
enhanced autonomy and significance for areas other than science.
<br />
<br /><br />Universality and particularity.
<br />
<br />We are beginning to see how the particularism of phenomenology connects
<br />
up with its preference for shallow explanation. The point of
<br />
explanation is to link data together in a causal framework. Hume's
<br />
problem shows that causality must be found in &quot;depth&quot;, so abandoning
<br />
depth amounts to abandoning explanation. It seems, then, that
<br />
preserving the autonomy of non-scientific fields is the ultimate
<br />
motivation of phenomenology. For instance, Creatonism and evolution are
<br />
just different patterns in experience with no ultimate truth behind
<br />
them. This rescues creationism from being disproved by science, without
<br />
giving it (or anything else) the status it really wants -- that of
<br />
being actually true. Having rejected &quot;depth&quot;, and therefore, too a
<br />
large extent, explanation itself, phenomenology is in an awkward
<br />
position when it comes to promoting itself. It cannot claim to be a
<br />
better theory when it is not really in the business the theories are
<br />
in, the business of explanation. This is an instance of the problem of
<br />
self-refutation which affects all sceptical approaches to some extent.
