Dear Eugen,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has any thought been made among the AI community as to how to prevent 
<br />
the constructed AI from being Solipsists? How does one AI deal with the 
<br />
existence of other AI? Don't they have the same Turing Test problem, but 
<br />
even more accutely given the thesis of hardware independence?
<br />
<br />Kindest regards,
<br />
<br />Stephen
<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, so are people. I am actually in a state of bewilderment at

<br />People have lots of state, and interestingly the current electrochemical
<br />
activity (the spatiotemporal pattern of spiking) is only a minor part of it.
<br />
The pattern of a person is readily regenerated from a flat-EEG lacune, so 
<br />
the
<br />
state is encoded as neuranatomy, not as electrochemical activity of the
<br />
neuroanatomy. At the very least, we still consider those the same person.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; the present moment at how you are using some words  :-)
</em><br />
<br />It's not entirely my fault, the common use of words like &quot;program&quot; to
<br />
describe activity of a physical object (a person) is somewhat misleading.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Very unusual choice for meanings of words. On your usage, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; chess program... oops, there isn't a single chess program! I
</em><br />
<br />A chess program pressed on a CD is a single program, regardless how many
<br />
copies are pressed (provided, no errors occur). Multiple instances of a 
<br />
chess
<br />
program running perfectly synchronized are still one program, compared bit 
<br />
by
<br />
bit at the same clock tick (very fast very large systems run into hairy
<br />
relativistic issues, in regards to clocks and comparisons). Once they're
<br />
allowed to deviate, they become distinct individuals.
<br />
<br />Now this is quite silly in case of a chess program, because it doesn't
<br />
represent a very complex world. It is rather close to a genetically
<br />
homogenous population of C. elegans, which are all very close to being the 
<br />
same
<br />
archetypal worm, since their neuronal connectivity is genetically 
<br />
determined.
<br />
If you have a behaving complex animal it has to represent a lot of
<br />
information about itself, and its environment.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; mean to say that on your usage of terms, after the chess
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; software (if I may) plays 1. e4 it becomes a different program
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; after I reply 2. Nf3.  I better avoid using the word &quot;program&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if we are to communicate!
</em><br />
<br />We have to settle for somewhat cumbersome but more precise terms like
<br />
individuals (a static frame snapshot of the state), and a similiarity metric
<br />
over the space of individuals, and evolution trajectories over the state
<br />
space of individuals (several subsequent static frame snapshots). If you 
<br />
look
<br />
at a molecular dynamics program dumping trajectory frames it's exactly the
<br />
same.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hopefully, I can refer to what I want as a Turing Machine, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you won't pull the rug out from under me by saying that each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time it goes into a new state, it's a different Turing Machine.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, and no. The device is the same, but it encodes different individuals
<br />
depending on state of its tape. The computer is the same, but it can run
<br />
quite a large number of different programs.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Biology doesn't make a clean distinction between software and hardware.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I agree there is similarity/homology between me-former and me-today,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; but that similarity is difficult to measure at a low level. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Synchronizing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; spatially separate discrete systems and make measurements on bit vectors 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; something relatively simple, at least in gedanken.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes. So what do you think about the possibility of uploading?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is, transferring your entire intelligence and values from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; its present biological substrate to a silicon-based one. Do you
</em><br />
<br />Silicon doesn't compute very well, so I would prefer a more generic
<br />
&quot;in machina&quot; to an &quot;in silico&quot; (which is about to become as archaic as in
<br />
&quot;in relais&quot; or &quot;in tubus vacuo&quot;).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; consider it possible that technology from the year 3000 (were it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; somehow applied to where you are at this moment) could transform
</em><br />
<br />No problem, assuming cryonics works.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; you into a robot who didn't know that the transformation had
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; taken place, and yet you would then consist of a system where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there was a clean distinction between hardware and software?
</em><br />
<br />Absolutely (though there are considerable difficulties present in mapping a
<br />
scanned slab of neuroanatomy voxels to a slab of computing molecules; this
<br />
involves automatic feature extraction and hierarchical model building by
<br />
machine learning, and is quite beyond the state of the art in modelling).
<br />
<br />The hardware is simple enough (a molecular electronics/spintronics CA
<br />
would suffice, and probably be even optimal, though you'd probably need a
<br />
mole of switches for a low-level simulation of a human primate), but
<br />
there is going to be an awful lot of state.
<br />
<br />For all practical purposes you can consider a person a very, very large bit
<br />
vector, making only sense in the right computational context, of course.
