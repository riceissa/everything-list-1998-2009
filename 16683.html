<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; May be you could study the UDA, and directly tell me at which step

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; your &quot;theory&quot; departs from the comp hyp.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Okay, I read over your SANE2004 paper again.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; From step 01 of UDA:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;The scanned (read) information is send by traditional means, by mails
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or radio waves for instance, at Helsinki, where you are correctly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reconstituted with ambient organic material.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Okay, so this information that is sent by traditional means is really
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think where consciousness lives.  Though not literally in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical instantiation of the information.  For instance if you were
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to print out that information in some format, I would NOT point to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; large pile of ink-stained paper and say that it was conscious.  But
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would say that the information that is represented by that pile of ink
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and paper &quot;represents&quot;, or &quot;identifies&quot;, or &quot;points to&quot; a single
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instant of consciousness.
</em><br />
<br /><br />This like confusing the universal dovetailer and the counting algorithm.
<br />
Such information have no absolute content, they depend on universal  
<br />
number.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So, what is the information?  Well, let's say the data you're
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; transmitting is from a neural scan and consists of a bunch of numbers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indicating neural connection weights, chemical concentrations,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; molecular positions and states, or whatever.  I wouldn't even say that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this information is the information that is conscious.  Instead this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information is ultimately an encoding (via the particular way that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain stores information) of the symbols and the relationships between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; those symbols that represent your knowledge, beliefs, and memories
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (all of the information that makes you who you are).  (Echoes here of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) stuff that I referenced before)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; From step 08 of UDA:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Instead of linking [the pain I feel] at space-time (x,t) to [a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine state] at space-time (x,t), we are obliged to associate [the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pain I feel at space-time (x,t)] to a type or a sheaf of computations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (existing forever in the arithmetical Platonia which is accepted as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existing independently of our selves with arithmetical realism).&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So instead I would write this as:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Instead of linking [the pain I feel] at space-time (x,t) to [a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine state] at space-time (x,t), we are obliged to associate [the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pain I feel at space-time (x,t)] to an [informational state] existing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; forever in Platonia which is accepted as existing independently of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ourselves.&quot;
</em><br />
<br />Same remark.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; You have to see that, personally, I don't have a theory other than  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; assumption that the brain is emulable by a Turing machine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I also believe that, but I think that consciousness is in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information represented by the discrete states of the data stored on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Turing machine's tape after each instruction is executed, NOT in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the actual execution of the Turing machine.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree with this. It is the comp hyp. Except it is a bit fuzzy, and  
<br />
contradict what
<br />
you say above and in other posts.
<br />
&nbsp;From now on I will assume you are assuming comp.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The instruction table of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Turing machine just describes one possible way that a particular
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sequence of information states could be produced.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Execution of the instructions in the action table actually doesn't do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anything with respect to the production of consciousness.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Are you talking about the physical execution, in which case what you  
<br />
say is a consequence of the MGA, or of a platonic execution?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The output
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; informational states represented by data on tape exists platonically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even if the Turing machine program is never run.  And therefore the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness that goes with those states also exists platonically,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even if the Turing machine program is never run.
</em><br />
<br /><br />In platonia all Turing machines run. Or you mean: never run in our  
<br />
physical universe, in which case we agree.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; OK. So, now, Kelly, just to understand what you mean by your  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; theory, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; have to ask you what your theory predicts in case of self-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; multiplication.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, first I'd say there aren't copies of identical information in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Platonia.
</em><br />
<br /><br />It is a bit ambiguous, but the UD, in platonia makes a lot of  
<br />
*relmative* copies, a bit like the Mandebrot set contains an infinity  
<br />
of copies of itself. It is a ket point because those relative copies  
<br />
will explain eventually the vansihing of the white rabbits and explain  
<br />
the origin of the believe in physical space-time and dynamics in the  
<br />
static context of platonia.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; All perceived physical representations all actually point
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to (similarly to a C-style pointer in programming) the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; platonically existing information state.  So if there are 1000
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; identical copies of me in identical mental states, they are really
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just representations of the same &quot;source&quot; information state.
</em><br />
<br /><br />The UD runs C++ in Platonia, but also amm ways to implement all  
<br />
programs including those who makes many relative copies, like the e- 
<br />
mail will multiplied this posts.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Piles of atoms aren't conscious.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Information is conscious.
</em><br />
<br /><br />A person is conscious. Animals can be conscious, perhaps plant.
<br />
Actually I still have no clue of what you mean by &quot;information&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1000
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; identically arranged piles of atoms still represent only a single
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information state (setting aside putnam mapping issues).
</em><br />
<br /><br />There is no mapping issue. The mapping always makes sense relatively  
<br />
to a mapping machine, and eventually on the basic mapping you whoose  
<br />
and which has to be part of the theory. I have chosen, to fix the  
<br />
things, elementary arithmetic, although they are in infinity of  
<br />
equivalent mappings. We need one as basic immaterialist ontology if we  
<br />
don't want been lead to zombies or nihilism.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information state is conscious, not the piles of atoms.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Is not an information state a pile of 1 and 0?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, once their experiences diverge so that they are no longer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; identical, then they are totally seperate and they represent (or point
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to) seperate, non-overlapping conscious information states.
</em><br />
<br /><br />This can make a bit more sense.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; To see where does those probabilities come from, you have to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; understand that 1) you can be multiplied (that is read, copy (cut)  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; pasted in Washington AND Moscow (say)), and 2) you are multiplied (by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 2^aleph_zero, at each instant, with a comp definition of instant not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; related in principle with any form of physical time).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, probability is a tricky subject, right?
</em><br />
<br /><br />That is what a politician told me when I show him, years ago, that its  
<br />
argument was a misuse of statistic. A good way for not answering. In  
<br />
our context the notion of consciousness is far more tricky than the  
<br />
notion of probability. And you don't answer the question.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; An interesting quote:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Whereas the interpretation of quantum mechanics has only been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; puzzling us for ~75 years, the interpretation of probability has been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doing so for more than 300 years [16, 17]. Poincare [18] (p. 186)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; described probability as &quot;an obscure instinct&quot;. In the century that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has elapsed since then philosophers have worked hard to lessen the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; obscurity. However, the result has not been to arrive at any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consensus. Instead, we have a number of competing schools (for an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; overview see Gillies [19], von Plato [20], Sklar [21, 22] and Guttman
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [23]).&quot; (<a href="http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/quant-ph/pdf/0402/0402015v1.pdf">http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/quant-ph/pdf/0402/0402015v1.pdf</a>)
</em><br />
<br /><br />On all interesting subject there are competing views. It is a non  
<br />
argument.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The fact is that your explanation, that we are in an typical  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; universe,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; because those exist as well, just does not work with the comp hyp. It
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; does not work, because it does not explain why we REMAIN in that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; typical worlds.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Some Brunos will remain in typical worlds, and never see any other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; type of world.  But other Brunos are finding themselves in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; white-rabbit-worlds at every instant.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree. The question is this: how is it that I find in worth to  
<br />
prepare a cup of coffee. How is it that it is reasonnable to bet, as I  
<br />
do all the time that I will stay in anon rabbit world so that, for  
<br />
example, it makes sense to type on this keyboard? My point is that  
<br />
with comp, we can no more use the usual explanation that we are living  
<br />
in a lawful universe.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You are a &quot;typical world Bruno&quot;,
</em><br />
<br /><br />Thanks. But for how long?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and there will ALWAYS be typical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world Brunos who ask &quot;If Kelly's theory is correct why am I still in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; typical world?&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And the answer is, since every possible Bruno exists, there must exist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some Brunos who only see typical worlds.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So with this in mind, how could some Brunos NOT REMAIN in a typical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world?
</em><br />
<br /><br />? Because of you say above. Some 3-Bruno will be separated and some  
<br />
will belong to non typical world. My question is what is the  
<br />
probability for the 1-Bruno, here and now, to wake up in the body of  
<br />
such white rabbit sort of 3-bruno?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What could possibly explain the absence of all &quot;typical world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Brunos&quot;?
</em><br />
<br /><br />We already agree that all worlds exist. Both the typical and the non  
<br />
typical. The question remains: why should I bet I will stay during the  
<br />
next second in a typical universe. yet I am typing on this keyboard  
<br />
because I find it worth to do it, meaning I am betting I will stay in  
<br />
such a typical universe, at least for some time. The question is: how  
<br />
to justify those bets once we abandon the notion of primitive physical  
<br />
universe. Where does the appearance of a lawful and stable physical  
<br />
universe come from. Of course I have the beginning of the answer in  
<br />
the comp theory (cf UDA+AUDA).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It seems to me that, as far as I can put meaning on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; your view, the probability I will see a white rabbit in two seconds  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; as great than the probability I will see anything else, and this is  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; contradiction with the fact. What makes us staying in apparent lawful
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; histories?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The probability that a Bruno will see a white rabbit in 02 seconds is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 100%.
</em><br />
<br /><br />A Bruno. Or Bruno? I begin to feel you talk like if 1-Bruno = 3-Bruno,  
<br />
but this would mean you stop at the second step of UDA.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The probability that a Bruno will NOT see a white rabbit in 2
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seconds is ALSO 100%.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I am talking about the relative probabilities. The question is really:  
<br />
what is the probability that in two seconds I will see a white rabbit.  
<br />
If you tell me 100%, then let me do the experiment/experience. I wait  
<br />
for two seconds. I have not seen a white rabbits. Your 100% prediction  
<br />
is refute. Your theory is incorrect. Given that comp has not yet been  
<br />
refuted today, it means that your theory is not comp, or you have a  
<br />
wrong interpretation of comp.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The key part here is the use of &quot;a&quot;, as in &quot;a Bruno&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK, then. So I reiterate the question you again, and please note that  
<br />
I am asking for the 1-personal expectations. The difference between  
<br />
&quot;Bruno&quot; and the infinitely many 3-Bruno is the key to understand the  
<br />
UD reasoning.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Future Brunos are independent of &quot;present Bruno&quot;, except for their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; memory of you.  Again, there's nothing &quot;real&quot; that ties together
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instants of consciousness except for the &quot;feeling&quot; of continuity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that's provided by memory.
</em><br />
<br /><br />With comp, what ties the instants of consciousness are the infinitely  
<br />
many universal numbers which generates (in platonia) the computations  
<br />
between the computational states corresponding to those relative  
<br />
instants of consciousness. Only we cannot know which one are &quot;acting&quot;,  
<br />
and below our level of substitution, they are all &quot;acting&quot; at once  
<br />
&quot;acting&quot; in the mathematical computer science sense (it is a globally  
<br />
static and platonic sense).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So with probability, you're asking &quot;what is the likelyhood that I will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; see X as opposed to Y&quot;.  But YOU aren't going to see anything, you're
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tied to the present.  Some future version of you will see X.  And a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different future version of you will see Y.  And there will be other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; future versions of you that see A through W also.
</em><br />
<br /><br />If that was true, planning anything would make no sense at all.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So here I guess we get into issues of personal identity over time, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; maybe also questions of transworld identity.  From SEP
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (<a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/identity-personal/">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/identity-personal/</a>):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;What does it take for a person to persist from one time to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; another—that is, for the same person to exist at different times? What
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sorts of adventures could you possibly survive, in the broadest sense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the word 'possible'? What sort of event would necessarily bring
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your existence to an end? What determines which past or future being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is you? Suppose you point to a child in an old class photograph and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; say, “That's me.” What makes you that one, rather than one of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; others? What is it about the way she relates then to you as you are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; now that makes her you? For that matter, what makes it the case that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anyone at all who existed back then is you? This is the question of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; personal identity over time. An answer to it is an account of our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; persistence conditions, or a criterion of personal identity over time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (a constitutive rather than an evidential criterion: the second falls
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; under the Evidence Question below).&quot;
</em><br />
<br /><br />One of my oldest paper &quot;Mechanism and personal identity&quot; points on the  
<br />
comp answer, which is the answer above. It raises a mathematical  
<br />
problem of probability (UDA), and the logic of self-reference (AUDA)  
<br />
provides the math for evaluating those probabilities. The &quot;probability  
<br />
one&quot; has been shown to obey a quantum logic, and that is the beginning  
<br />
of the comp justification of the well founded beliefs in the  
<br />
appearance and stability of a physical universe, and this without  
<br />
invoking it a priori, which is forbidden by the UD reasoning.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; What does you theory predict about agony and death, from the first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; person point of view?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, I'm guessing that there is no first person death.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; We are all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subjectively immortal, and all possible futures await.  Some of them
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very bad.  Some of them very good.
</em><br />
<br /><br />With different probabilities. That is why we are partially responsible  
<br />
of our future. This motivates education and learning, and commenting  
<br />
posts ...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In one of my futures I will never experience a good thing again.  It
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will be nothing but suffering, misery, and humiliation for eternity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; BUT, on the plus side, in another future I will never experience
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; another bad thing again.  It's blue skies and flowers for as far as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the eye can see.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Most futures will be some mix of the two.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To be honest, the thought of the good futures doesn't make up for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thought of the bad futures.  BUT, such is life.  I suspect.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Hmm...  Life provides tools for planning. If you jump out of a window,  
<br />
there is a high probability you will experience some bad future, but  
<br />
if you plan to take the lift, you diminish, at least locally, the  
<br />
probability that you end up in that bad future.
<br />
<br />My diagnostic is that you miss the universal numbers and their  
<br />
relative probabilities. You confuse the notion of (apparent) physical  
<br />
running, and the many platonic &quot;running&quot; existing (in the usual  
<br />
mathematical sense)  in Platonia (alias elementary arithmetic).
