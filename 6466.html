Of course the worlds need to be prepared in just the right way, of
<br />
course...&lt;
<br />
<br />I suppose these &quot;other worlds&quot; are potential life-form carrying bodies of
<br />
this (our) universe, because as far as I know we have no way(s) to access
<br />
any information from other universes  (that MAY be) - unless we take our
<br />
speculations for 'real'.
<br />
<br />Does the &quot;prepared&quot; mean some adjustment to understand the diverse
<br />
situations in terms familiar to us here? that would mean a humanization
<br />
(anthropomorphization) of the non-human.
<br />
Would that be productive in the scientific sense?

--------------------------
<br />
to Jeanne:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;My own comment is that there are pure 1st person phenomena, and there re
</em><br />
1st person phenomena shared with other conscious beings. The first  variety
<br />
should not be accorded with any real significance, beyond that of a dream,
<br />
or whatever. The latter shared type is the basis of objective science. With
<br />
my TIME and PROJECTION postulates, or with
<br />
COMP, there are 1st person phenomena shared  by _all_ conscious beings. This
<br />
last type we can truly label objective.  &lt;
<br />
<br />The word &quot;share&quot;...I find it OK as 'communicate to', not as making it a
<br />
common experience. The 2nd part startled me a bit, the reference to
<br />
'objective science' may suppose that the 'time' etc. experiences would be
<br />
common and identical to all conscious beings.
<br />
First off: objective science is a model, inherited evolutionarily from
<br />
learning similar stuff from reports of those who earlier constructed them as
<br />
their 1st pers. explanations.
<br />
Secondly: even in this case every 'conscious being' makes up his own 1st
<br />
person mindstuff from such reports and not two may be completely identical.
<br />
Not even in clones. Machines: yes.
<br />
We can try to share it, but the result will be personnified by the acceptor
<br />
into 'his' 1st pers.mindcontent. Unless we introduce some &quot;objective
<br />
knowledge&quot; to ourselves, exempt from the minds interpretation.
<br />
That is what I would label 'truly objective'.
<br />
<br />And once we are at you attachments, you remarked to Hal:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;...Whether eternal life in &quot;heaven&quot; or &quot;hell&quot; is your experience will
</em><br />
depend very much on your own actions.&lt;
<br />
<br />Do you consider 'eternal' a &quot;long long time&quot;? Does e.g.infinite mean very
<br />
much or very long? (or a small circle? G. Cantor's problem...).  I think
<br />
'eternal' is atemporal, cannot be measured 'in time', or expressed by a
<br />
timespan, so why not consider it really as timeless: when it starts it
<br />
immediately also ends instantaneously.
<br />
So heaven or hell may not last at all (ha ha).
<br />
<br />Cheers
<br />
