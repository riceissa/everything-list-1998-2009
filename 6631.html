<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Consider the Cantor hierarchy and the way that &quot;nameability&quot; seems to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; become more and more difficult as we climb higher and higher.
</em><br />
<br />Yeah, remember Rudy Rucker's joke in &quot;Infinity and the Mind&quot; where
<br />
he points out &quot;It is interesting to note that the smaller large
<br />
cardinals have much grander names than the really big ones. Down
<br />
at the bottom you have the self-styled inaccessible and indescribable
<br />
cardinals loudly celebrating their size, while above, one of the
<br />
larger cardinals quietly remarks that it is &quot;measurable&quot;.&quot;
<br />
<br />What has happened, I think, is that the seventh or eighth time that
<br />
your mind is completely blown, even having your mind *blown* gets
<br />
familiar---and even perhaps a bit dull.  The Red Queen could also
<br />
have told Alice that every day before breakfast, she has her
<br />
whole world view turned upside-down and inside-out at least several
<br />
times.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     The reason why this question has no answer is because there is no point
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at which the question about &quot;First Causes&quot; can be posed such that an answer 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; obtains that is provably True. This is the proof that Bruno's work shows us,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; taking Gödel's to its logical conclusion.
</em><br />
<br />Come on, now. Nobody here, understands what Bruno's done, except
<br />
*maybe* Bruno. You draw the most sweeping conclusions from the smallest
<br />
things. Common sense tells one that questions about &quot;First Causes&quot;
<br />
don't have any answers of substance, but it's a stretch to say that
<br />
this comes from rumination about Gödel's theorem.  Sounds just like
<br />
the people who derived moral relativism from Einstein's work.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Additionally, the notion of a &quot;first cause&quot;, in itself, is fraught with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tacit assumptions. Consider the possibility that there is no such a thing as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a &quot;first cause&quot; just as there is no such thing as a privileged frame of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reference. We are assuming that there is a &quot;foundation&quot; that is manifested
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by the &quot;axiom of regularity&quot;:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/axiom-of-regularity?method=5">http://www.answers.com/topic/axiom-of-regularity?method=5</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Every non-empty set S contains an element a which is disjoint from S.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Exactly how can Existence obey this axiom without being inconsistent?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Before we run away screaming in Horror at this thought, consider the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implications of Norman's statement here:
</em><br />
<br />You misunderstand what the axiom is saying. (I admit, I was 
<br />
shocked and appalled at your rewording of it---but then it
<br />
turned out that *you* were not the criminal who reworded it
<br />
this way. It's actually in the link you provide!! (Thanks.))
<br />
<br />Well, at least liability if not criminality, unless it's
<br />
immediately added that what this is saying is that we
<br />
demand that any S set have the property, in order to
<br />
qualify as being a real set, that it is not incestuous
<br />
with at least one of its elements: I mean, there is at
<br />
least one of its elements that it doesn't share an element
<br />
with.
<br />
<br />For example, if S = {a,b,c}, say, then we cannot have 
<br />
a = {b,c}, and b = {a}, and c = {a,b,c}, because then it's,
<br />
like, totally devoid of substance. Whereas if there was
<br />
some *honest* element d in S such that d = {a, S, c, f},
<br />
then while it is pretty wild to have S itself, along with
<br />
the other suspiciously incestuous elements like a and c
<br />
contributing to the potential delinquency, at least it has
<br />
f, which makes it free from total engagement in perverse
<br />
behavior.
<br />
<br />*Regularity* was the nicest axiom that Zermelo found that
<br />
saved us from the very worst kind of circularity, I guess.
