<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Yes, but the point is that almost all of us on this list want to *find*

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;satisfactory theory of measure&quot; to apply to &quot;everything&quot;, so it's a

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Harry

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Wanting to find a measure theory doesn't mean you have

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;found one, and if you havent found one, it isn't a straw man
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to say so.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />But it is a straw man to say &quot;everything-theories makes the prediction that 
<br />
Harry Potter universes should be just as likely as lawlike ones&quot;, because in 
<br />
fact they do *not* make that definite prediction. If you had just said

something like, &quot;everything theories do not yet have any rigourous proof

that Harry Potter universes should be less likely than lawlike ones&quot; I 
<br />
wouldn't object.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  Some rough

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; proposals for such a theory of measure have been made in this list in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that a theory of consciousness assigning relative and absolute

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probability

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;idea).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;You are not going to get anywhere with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;UDA until you prove mathematical Platonism, and your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;argument for that -- AR as you call it --
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;just repeats the same error: the epistemological
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;claim that &quot;the truth -alue of '17 is prime is mind-independent&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;is confused with the ontological claim &quot;the number of 17 exists
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;separately
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;from us in Plato's heaven&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But that is really all that philosophers mean by mathematical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;platonism,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that mathematical truths are timeless and mind-independent--
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;nope.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;Platonists about mathematical objects claim that the theorems of our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;mathematical theories - sentences like '3 is prime' (a theorem of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;arithmetic) and 'There are infinitely many transfinite cardinal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;numbers' (a theorem of set theory) - are literally true and that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;the only plausible view of such sentences is that they are ABOUT
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;ABSTRACT OBJECTS &quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;(emphasis added)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; What do the words &quot;abstract object&quot; mean to you? To me, if propositions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; about numbers have a truth independent of human minds or beliefs, that's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; equivalent to saying they are true statements about abstract 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;objects--how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; could a statement be objectively true yet not be about anything?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;By having sense but no reference, for instance.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_and_reference">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_and_reference</a>
</em><br />
<br />The sense/reference distinction is about the possibility of our having 
<br />
multiple mentally distinct terms which map to the same real-world 
<br />
object...but what would &quot;sense but no reference&quot; mean? A term that is 
<br />
completely meaningless, like a round square? I don't see how there can be an 
<br />
objective, mind-independent truth about a term that doesn't refer to any 
<br />
coherent object or possibility. Can you think of any statements outside of 
<br />
math or logic that you would say have &quot;sense but no reference&quot; but also have 
<br />
a mind-independent truth value?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The case for mathematical Platonism needs to be made in the first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;place; if numbers do not exist at all, the universe, as an existing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;thing, cannot be a mathematical structure.
</em><br />
<br />Again, what does &quot;exist&quot; mean for you?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;However, the basic case for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;objectivity of mathematics is the tendency of mathematicians to agree
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;about the answers to mathematical problems; this can be explained by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;noting that mathematical logic is based on axioms and rules of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;inference, and different mathematicians following the same rules will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;tend to get the same answers , like different computers running the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;same problem.
</em><br />
<br />&quot;Tend to&quot;, although occasionally they can make mistakes. For the answer to 
<br />
be really objective, you need to refer to some sort of ideal mathematician 
<br />
or computer following certain rules, but that is just another form of 
<br />
Platonism.

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this is itself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an ontological claim, not a purely epistemological one.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;Quite. Did you mean that the other way around ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; No, I was responding to your comment:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;You are not going to get anywhere with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;UDA until you prove mathematical Platonism, and your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;argument for that -- AR as you call it --
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;just repeats the same error: the epistemological
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;claim that &quot;the truth -alue of '17 is prime is mind-independent&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;is confused with the ontological claim &quot;the number of 17 exists
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;separately
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;from us in Plato's heaven&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Here you seem to be saying that &quot;the truth value of '17 is prime' is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; mind-independent&quot; is a purely &quot;epistemological&quot; claim.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It certainly *could* be, at least. Platonism is *not* the only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;philosophy of mathematics!
</em><br />
<br />I think it's the only philosophy of mathematics that says that mathematical 
<br />
statements have a *mind-independent* truth-value, though.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  What I'm saying is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that it's necessarily ontological, as are any claims about the objective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (mind-independent) truth-value of a given proposition.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So you are claiming that mathematical Platonism is not merely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;true but *necessarily* true ? That is quite a claim!
</em><br />
<br />No, you misunderstood. I'm saying that *if* you believe that mathematical 
<br />
statements have a mind-independent truth-value, that is necessarily is 
<br />
equivalent to what I understand &quot;mathematical Platonism&quot; to mean. Of course, 
<br />
you may not in fact believe that mathematical statements have any such 
<br />
mind-independent truth-value.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Few would literally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; imagine some alternate dimension called &quot;Plato's heaven&quot; where 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;platonic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; forms hang out, and which is somehow able to causally interact with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; brains to produce our ideas about math.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;Some do. In any case, if numbers don't exist at all -- even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;platonically --
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;they they cannot even produce the mere appearance of a physical world,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;as Bruno requires.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But what does &quot;exist&quot; mean in this context? Do you think it makes sense 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; say that there is are objective truths about objects which do not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;exist&quot; in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; any sense?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Truth-values attach to **sentences**. Those are the only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;objects a non-Platonist needs.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  That does not make sense to me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;That's hardly a counterargument. Are you familiar
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with the rivals to Platonism ? See below.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; On the other hand, the idea that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; mathematical objects &quot;exist&quot; in the sense of there being objective 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;truths
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; about them need not necessarily imply that possible self-aware observers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; within complex mathematically-describable worlds would &quot;exist&quot; in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that they'd be actual conscious beings whose experiences are just as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;real as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; yours or mine (although I think it's a lot more elegant to assume they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; would).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I ma saying that not only does mathematical Platonism &quot;not necessarily&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;imply consious observers within Platonia , it just doesn't imply
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it *at all*. (For heavens' sake, it doesn't even imply
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computational *processes*, since Platonia is timeless!)
</em><br />
<br />Most physicists today take a &quot;spacetime&quot; view of the universe in which the 
<br />
notion of a global objective past, present and future is meaningless (for 
<br />
any given event, it is of course true that everything in its future light 
<br />
cone objectively lies in its future and everything in its past light cone 
<br />
objectively lies in its past, but there is no objective truth about whether 
<br />
events not in either light cone lie in the first event's past, future, or 
<br />
present). Philosophically, I don't think the notion of time &quot;really moving&quot; 
<br />
is even coherent--how could the present &quot;move&quot; without introducing a second 
<br />
time dimension, for example? Are you familiar with McTaggart's distinction 
<br />
between the A-series and the B-series view of time? Are you arguing for the 
<br />
A-series here? If so I think few physicists would agree--see for example 
<br />
<a href="http://tinyurl.com/nesh7">http://tinyurl.com/nesh7</a>
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But I think it's this question of the consciousness of different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; possible beings within mathematical structures that's the key one in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;every universe exists vs. only one universe exists&quot; debate, not whether
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; mathematical laws are describing the behavior of &quot;stuff&quot; or whether the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; mathematical relationships between events alone are all there is (how 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; we possibly tell the difference? Believing in 'stuff' as opposed to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; bare-bones mathematical relationships is not something that leads to any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; distinct measurable consequences, so it has no connection to any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;empirical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; results of science).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;As I have stated several times, the maths-only theory leads to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Harry Potter universes.
</em><br />
<br />It leads to them, but it doesn't necessarily lead to the idea that they have 
<br />
a high probability. Again, you would need to define a measure on 
<br />
universes/observer-moments to make any predictions about this one way or 
<br />
another--until then these &quot;everything&quot; ideas are simply incomplete 
<br />
hypotheses, a bit like string theory (which also has not been developed to 
<br />
the point where it can make definite predictions on many physical issues, 
<br />
although I certainly think string theory is much, much closer to being a 
<br />
real predictive theory than the very speculative everything-ideas).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;That is its observatioanl consequence.
</em><br />
<br />It's not an observational consequence if you don't happen to be in one of 
<br />
the Harry Potter worlds! No multiverse theory predicts that observers should 
<br />
have an omniscient view of all universes, they only see the one they are 
<br />
living in.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Why Mathematics Works
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Mathematics is the theoretical exploration of every possible kind of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;abstract structure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The world has some kind of structure; it is not chaos or featureless or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;void
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Therefore, it is likely that at least some of the structures discovered
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;by mathematicians are applicable to the world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(It would be strange if everything mathematicans came up with was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;empirically applicable, and might tend one towards Platonism or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Rationalism, but this is not the case. It might be possible for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mathematicians working completely abstractly and theoretically to fail
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to include any empirically useful structures in the finite list of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;structures so far achieved, but maths is not divorced from empiricism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and practicallity to that extent -- what I say in (1) is something of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;an idealisation).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Empiricism: The &quot;maths is physics&quot; theory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Mathematical empiricism is undermined by developments since the 19th
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;century, of forms of mathematics with no obvious physical application,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;such an non-Euclidean geometry. I should probably say no obvious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;application at the time since non-Euclidean geometery -- or curved
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;space -- was utilised in Einstein's General Theory of Relativity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;subsequent to its development by mathematicians. So M.E. has two
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;problems: the existence of mathematical structures with no (currently)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;obvious physical application, and the fact that the physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;applicability of different areas of mathematics varies with time,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;depending on discoveries in physics. Todays mathematical game-playing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;may be tomorrow's hard reality. It is also undermined by mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;method, the fact that maths is a chalk-and-blackboard (or just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;thinking) activity, not a laboratory activity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Platonism: Objectivity and objects.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Both Platonism and Empiricism share the assumption that mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;symbols refer to objects. (And some people feel they have to believe in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Empiricism simply because Platonism is so unacceptable). Platonism gets
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;its force from noting the robustness and fixity of mathematical truths,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;which are often described as &quot;eternal&quot;. The reasoning seems to be that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;if the truth of a statement is fixed, it must be fixed by something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;external to itself. In other words, mathematical truths msut be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;discovered, because if they were made they could have be made
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;differently, and so would not be fixed and eternal. But there is no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reason to think that these two metaphors --&quot;discovering&quot; and &quot;making&quot;--
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are the only options. Perhaps the modus operandi of mathematics is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;unique; perhaps it combines the fixed objectivity of discovering a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physical fact about the external world whilst being nonetheless an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;internal, non-empirical activity. The Platonic thesis seems more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;obvious than it should because of an ambiguity in the word &quot;objective&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Objective truths amy be truths about real-world objects. Objective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;truths may also be truths that do not depend on the whims or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;preferences of the speaker (unlike statements about the best movie of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;flavour of ice-cream). Statements that are objective in the first sense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;tend to be objective int he second sense, but that does not mean that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;all statements that are objective in the second sense need be objective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in the first sense. They may fail to depend on individual whims and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;preferences without depending on anything external to the mind.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Formalism: Mathematics as a game.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Both Platonism and Empriricism share the assumption that mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;symbols refer to objects. An alternative to both is the theory that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;they do not refer at all: this theory is called formalism. For the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;formalist, mathematical truths are fixed by the rules of mathematics,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not by external objects. But what fixes the rules of mathematics ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Formalism suggests that mathematics is a meaningless game, and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;rules can be defined any way we like. Yet mathematicians in practice
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are careful about the selection of axioms, not arbitrary. So do the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;rules and axioms of mathematics mean anything or not ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The reader may or may not have noticed that I have been talking about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mathematical symbols &quot;referring&quot; to things rather than &quot;meaning&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;things. This eliptically refers to a distinction between two different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;kinds or shades of meaning made by Frege. &quot;Reference&quot; is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;external-world object a symbol is &quot;about&quot;. &quot;Sense&quot; is the kind of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;meaning a symbol has even if does not have a reference. Thus statements
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;about unicorns or the bald King of France have Sense but not Reference.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Thus it is possible for mathematical statments to have a sense, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;therefore a meaning, beyond the formal rules and defintions, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;stopping short of external objects (referents), whether physical or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Platonic. This position retains the negative claim of Formalism, that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mathematical symbols don't refer to objects, and thus avoids the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;pitfalls of both Platonism and Empiricism. Howeverm it allows that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mathematical symbols can have meanings of an in-the-head kind and thus
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;explains the non-arbitrary nature of the choice of axioms; they are not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;arbitrary because they must correspond to the mathematician's intuition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;-- her &quot;sense&quot; -- of what a real number or a set is.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So far we have been assuming that the same answer must apply uniformly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to all mathematical statmentents and symbols: they all refer or none
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;do. There is a fourth option: divide and conquer -- some refer and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;others don't.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Constructivism: How Real Are The Real Numbers?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Mathematical Platonism is the view that mathematical objects exist in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;some sense (not necessarily the sense that physical objects exist),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;irrespective of our ability to display or prove them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Constructivism is an opposing view, according to which only objects
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;which can be explicitly shown or proven exist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Some constructivists believe in constructivism as an end in itself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Others use it as a means to an end,namely the elimination of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;infinities.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Real numbers (numbers which cannot be expressed in a finite number of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;digits) are a particular problem for both kinds of constructivist. For
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the first, because most real numbers cannot be shown. Some are well
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;known, such as pi and e (the base of natural logarithms). These can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;generated by an algorithm; a sort of mathematical machine, where if you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;keep turning the handle, it keeps churning out digits. Of course, real
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;numbers are not a finite string of digits, so the process never
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;finishes. Nonetheless, the fact that the algorithm itself is finite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;gives us a handle on the real number, an ability to grasp it. However,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the real number line is dense, so between any of these well known real
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;numbers are infinities of intransigent real numbers, whose digits form
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;no pattern, and which therefore cannot be set out, either as a string
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of digits, or as an algorithm.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Or, at least, so the Platonists would have it. What alternatives are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;available for the constructuvist ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;1. All numbers are equally (ontologically) real.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;2. The accessible real numbers (the transcendental numbers) are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(ontologically) real, and the other (mathematically) &quot;real&quot; numbers are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;3. No (mathematically) real number is (ontologically) real.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;1. is the position constructivists are trying to get away from. 3 is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;hardly tenable, since some irrational numbers, such as pi, *can* be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;constructed. And (2) contradicts the idea of density -- it suggests the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;real number line has gaps. Moreover, something like the requirment of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;denstity can be asserted without making any strong ontological
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;commitments towards the reality of the real number line.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Quasi Empiricism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;A number of recent developments in mathematics, such as the increased
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;use of computers to assist proof, and doubts about the correct choice
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of basic axioms, have given rise to a view called quasi-empiricism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This challenges the traditional idea of mathematical truth as eternal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and discoverable apriori. According to quasi-empiricists the use of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computer to perform a proof is a form of experiment. But it remains the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;case that any mathematical problem that can in principle be solved by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;shutting you eye and thinking. Computers are used because mathematians
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;do not have infinite mental resources; they are an aid. Contrast this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with traditonal sciences like chemistry or biology, where real-world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;objects have to be studied, and would still have to be studied by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;super-scientitists with an IQ of a million. In genuinely emprical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sciences, experimentation and observation are used to gain information.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In mathematics the information of the solution to a problem is always
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;latent in the starting-point, the basic axioms and the formulation of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the problem. The process of thinking through a problem simply makes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this latent information explicit. (I say simply, but of ocurse it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;often very non-trivial). The use of a computer externalises this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;process. The computer may be outside the mathematician's head but all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the information that comes out of it is information that went into it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Mathematics is in that sense still apriori.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Having said that, the quasi-empricist still has some points about the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;modern style of mathematics. Axioms look less like eternal truths and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mroe like hypotheses which are used for a while but may eventualy be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;discarded if they prove problematical, like the role of scientific
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;hypotheses in Popper's philosophy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Thus mathematics has some of the look and feel of empirical science
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;without being empricial in the most essential sense -- that of needing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;an input of inormation from outside the head.&quot;Quasi&quot; indeed!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Peter D Jones 5/10/05-26/1/06
</em><br />
<br />Is Peter D Jones a philosopher? I have my doubts that philosophers of 
<br />
mathematics would see the categories described here as mutually exclusive. 
<br />
For example, a formalist, to the extent he believes there is an objective 
<br />
truth about whether certain statements are derivable from a set of axioms 
<br />
and rules of inference, is just a species of platonist as I would define it; 
<br />
the objective truth necessarily involves an &quot;ideal&quot; case of following the 
<br />
rules without any possibility of error, not any specific mathematician or 
<br />
computer which may slip up in deriving new propositions from the axioms. In 
<br />
this case the ideal axiomatic system is the &quot;abstract object&quot; which there 
<br />
are objective truths about, since the truths cannot refer to any specific 
<br />
attempt to implement the system in the real world. Some formalists may not 
<br />
think in this way, but in this case they do not really believe there are 
<br />
objective mind-independent truths about axiomatic systems.
