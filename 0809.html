<br />
<br />Right on!!!
<br />
<br />I realize and acknowledge that several of us have independantly rediscovered 
<br />
many consequences of the MWI, and I will not take that credit away from you. 
<br />
However, let me tell you my side of the story.
<br />
<br />I have written a whole book on the subject. Many of the ideas I have 
<br />
presented in this forum are lifted straight out this book. In it, I discuss, 
<br />
not just the RELATIVE aspects of consciouness but its RELATIVISTIC aspects, 
<br />
trying to merge the basic postulates of relativity with physical laws,  the 
<br />
MW,  the cosmological principle, information theory ( c.f., mutual or 
<br />
&quot;relative&quot; information),  consciousness and free will. I explain how the 
<br />
relationship between our own rationality and the existence of rational 
<br />
physical laws. Fearing the nihilistic implications of this material, I also 
<br />
discussed ethics if such a theory was generally accepted. I started this book 
<br />
in June 1998 and finished the first draft in December 1998 before I connected 
<br />
with this group. At that time I sent queries to seven agents. They all turned 
<br />
me down.
<br />
<br />The book is too far out, too unbelievable, and I just don't have the 
<br />
credentials to be believed. If any one of you knows of a good way to publish 
<br />
such a book, please let me know.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />I think this comment is uncovering a profound link between free will
<br />
and conciousness. MWI provides us with a natural solution to the free
<br />
will vs determinism conundrum. (David Deutsch gives a good discussion
<br />
of this in his FOR book). I have argued that a Turing machine
<br />
can never be concious, because it can't have free will. The output
<br />
states of the Turing machine are precisely given by the program and
<br />
the inputs. One needs at least to inject a little randomness in the
<br />
algorithm, which then offers a real choice between MWI branches for
<br />
the machine to travel down. It is this possibility of choice that
<br />
gives us our psychological sense of time, another important
<br />
characteristic of conciousness, and is also naturally related to the
<br />
arrow of time induced by the second law.
<br />
<br />However, the perverse flip side of this situation is that an
<br />
unconcious Turing machine can implement a universe in which
<br />
conciousness exists, at least this is how I understand Bruno's
<br />
thesis. Of course the &quot;time&quot; in which the Turing machine executes its
<br />
program is completely unrelated to the &quot;time&quot; that the concious
<br />
entities implemented by the TM experience.
<br />
<br />Thus, it would seems, conciousness is very much a relative concept,
<br />
just as free will and time would be.
