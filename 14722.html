Hi Günther,

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The author admits himself that his doctrine is more a form of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; experential/non-experiential-ist (thus dualist) doctrine. It seems to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; me the usual dual naturalism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One could probably call it a kind of property dualism. That is also  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sort of bothers me. I am convinced that reality is monistic, and I  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; agree
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with you that monism is not yet convincingly reached in the paper; but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it is progress in the right direction and better than the usual  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Chalmers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;hard problem&quot; talk.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; BTW - a wonderful argumentation against Chalmers can be found on this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (excellent!, warmly recommended) blog. Hal Finney writes there  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sometimes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; too (mostly in the comments area).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/04/zombies.html">http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/04/zombies.html</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I frankly do not understand why zombies are taken seriously in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; philosophy, but this only as an aside.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Zombie are important in philosophy, a bit like zero is important in  
<br />
Number Theory, or like the empty set is important in Set Theory, I  
<br />
think. For example, it is easy to show that if Bohm QM is correct,  
<br />
then the Everett Universal waves if full of zombies, even zombie  
<br />
lacking a material (here: = made of particles) body, yet discussing  
<br />
and sending mails like you and me. Another example: if comp is false,  
<br />
just arithmetical truth, it can be argued, is similarly full of  
<br />
zombie. So, if we accept some &quot;no zombie principle&quot;, Bohm and non- 
<br />
comp would be easy to refute. Alas, comp entails the possibility of  
<br />
zombie, or at least local zombies: entities without consciousness  
<br />
acting like a human being for a finite time (a bit like a fake  
<br />
policeman on the road).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I can agree with the idea that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;consciousness&quot; is physical, but not as an explanation of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; consciousness, still less of course as an explanation of what is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; matter. It is exactly like Searle, but with &quot;physical&quot; in place of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; biological.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think that when one takes a broad view - not taking preconceptions,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but really thinking things through - it does not matter if we call it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;physicalism&quot; or &quot;materialism&quot; or &quot;idealism&quot; - is not the monist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; position that it all collapses? In the end, the above are only words.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Once we are sure we understand each other, the terms are not  
<br />
important. But collapsing them before could create some confusion.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; More interesting are the _relationships_ that hold (that is why the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; essence of a scientific theory is the math: the math encodes lawful
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relationships the referents have with each other).
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK. But the math can also sometimes hides the conceptual  
<br />
difficulties. When we apply math we have to be clear on the reason  
<br />
why we apply such or such math, and this cannot be explained purely  
<br />
mathematically, even (and I would say especially) if we end up with a  
<br />
&quot;mathematicalist philosophy&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Let me know if you understand that computationalism is just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; incompatible with that sort of move. Comp reduces completely the mind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; body problem into a necessary derivation of body-matter from a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; number/mind theory (like computer science, provablity logic +
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; intensional variants, etc.).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is what I would call the important question: comp is an assertion
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of what relations hold: thus it gives content to the word &quot;mind/ 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; etc; my starting position is ontic structural realism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/structural-realism/">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/structural-realism/</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I accept that we need no substantial &quot;relata&quot; for relations to hold
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (platonic computation suffices; or better: at the level of TOE it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaningless to talk about &quot;substance in itself&quot; or whatever - a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relational characterization is all and enough.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As to what theory of relations hold - for instance, Max Tegmark's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; plenitude or your comp variant - I am as yet undecided, although I  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; already once asserted that I like your approach because it goes into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; technicalities and thus serves to clarify issues - the problems are  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; often only revealed in the detail.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Recall that half of my work is concerned with the first person  
<br />
indeterminacy (the content of all my early publications, the six  
<br />
first step of the UDA).
<br />
And there is no math there, and frankly, it is what I consider to be  
<br />
my main and most easily understandable contribution, even if it has  
<br />
the shape of questioning. It is because some mathematician get some  
<br />
problem with that 1-indeterminacy that I have tackled QM and  
<br />
eventually computer science. Each year I met people who have  
<br />
difficulties with the notion of the comp (3-deterministic) 1- 
<br />
indeterminacy. I know some other understand it quickly, yet, even in  
<br />
this list I am not sure many have got the UDA utimate point. Comp is  
<br />
not a variant of Tegmark (if only because I publish it 10 years  
<br />
before): the approach is very different. Tegmark started from  
<br />
physics, and *proposed* a purely mathematical ontic frame for the TOE.
<br />
I start from a &quot;philosophical or theological principle&quot;, actually the  
<br />
belief in the comp &quot;reincarnation&quot;, and derive from it that the  
<br />
physical laws have to emerge and evolve from statical numbers'  
<br />
relations. It is a proof, or an argumentation. Comp is the direct  
<br />
digital version of one of the oldest philosophical hypothesis,  
<br />
already in Plato, Milinda's Question, etc., called Mechanism, by  
<br />
Descartes and ... Judson Webb.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To be more specific on the mind body &quot;problem&quot;: I think my position is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; best expressed with this passage in Alan Watts, The Way of Zen, 1957,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Random House, Paperback Edition 1989, p.72:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; QUOTE:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; According to the Yogacara the world of form is cittamatra-	
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;mind only&quot;-
</em><br />
<br /><br />I see we have serious common grounds. I am a fan of both Alan Watts  
<br />
and of the whole Yogacara (and the Yoga-Vasistha, etc.). I make this  
<br />
link utterly clear in my (long) french text: &quot;Conscience et  
<br />
Mécanisme&quot;. Indeed I call the modal second-incompleteness formula
<br />
<br />Dt -&gt; DBf
<br />
<br />by the Lao-Tseu Watts Valadier principle. Mainly through Alan Watts'  
<br />
&quot;The wisdom of insecurity&quot;. The consistency of truth makes consistent  
<br />
the provability of the false. Or if shit does not happen then shit  
<br />
can happen!
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; or vijnaptimatra-&quot;representation only.&quot;
</em><br />
<br /><br />I guess you know Vasubandhu's &quot;Five Treatises on *Mind Only*&quot;. It is  
<br />
a must for the Mahayana Buddhist Idealists.
<br />
Oh I see on the net some people have seen the link with Plotinus.  
<br />
Many links, here is one:
<br />
<a href="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/thomas.htm">http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/thomas.htm</a>  (I have not the  
<br />
time to read it, so ...)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This view	
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seems to have a very close resemblance to Western philosophies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of subjective idealism, in which the external and material world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is regarded as a projection of the mind.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK, although I prefer to call this &quot;objective idealism&quot; and to  
<br />
reserve &quot;subjective idealism&quot; for the more solipsistic form of  
<br />
idealism. But perhaps your classification is more standard. The  
<br />
confusion is explained by the fact that Eastern thinkers and Western  
<br />
thinkers sometimes switch respectively the first and third Greek gods/ 
<br />
hypostases.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, there seem to be some differences between the two points  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of view.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here, as always, the Mahayana is not so much a theoretical and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; speculative construction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as an account of an inner experience, and a	
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; means of awakening the experience in others.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes, like Plotinus. Yet like Plotinus, many Mahayana buddhist are  
<br />
very good theoretician and rationalist too.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Furthermore, the	
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; word citta is not precisely equivalent to our &quot;mind.&quot;
</em><br />
<br /><br />Note that in french we don't have a translation for mind. according  
<br />
to the context it is translated by &quot;esprit&quot; (spirit) or pensée  
<br />
(thought ).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Western
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thought tends to define mind by opposition to matter, and to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consider matter not so much as &quot;measure&quot; as the solid stuff
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which is measured. Measure itself, abstraction, is for the West
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more of the nature of mind, since we tend to think of mind and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; spirit as more abstract than concrete.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But in Buddhist philosophy citta does not stand over against a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conception of solid stuff. The world has never been considered in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; terms
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of a primary substance shaped into various forms by the action
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of mind or spirit. Such an image is not in the history of Buddhist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thought, and thus  the problem of how impalpable mind can influence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; solid matter has never arisen. Wherever we should speak of the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; material
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or physical or substantial world, Buddhism employs the term rupa,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is not so much our &quot;matter&quot; as &quot;form.&quot; There is no &quot;material  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; substance&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; underlying rupa unless it be citta itself.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I can agree. But the problem is not to convince buddhist, but the  
<br />
west. And the only way is to show that such different conception  
<br />
leads to different experimental results. Also, in the west, it is not  
<br />
to hard to explain how mind act on matter (how fear leads to atomic  
<br />
bombs, ...). The difficulty is more to explain how matter (brain) is  
<br />
related to mind, which is not just information processing (like  
<br />
eliminativists believe), but information processing together with  
<br />
inner incorrigible experience. I think I got the best explanation in  
<br />
the sense that I can explain why machine cannot explain this, but can  
<br />
explain why they cannot explain this for necessary reasons.
<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; END QUOTE
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The last sentence is the best!! Could I interpret your theory as  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; citta =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comp?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Hmmm.... I know I take the risk of looking like if I am very  
<br />
immodest, But I have no theory, just questions. I am an humble  
<br />
logician trying to explain to my fellow (even weakly)-materialist,  
<br />
that if they believe we can survive with an artificial digital brain/ 
<br />
body then they have to explain me where the white rabbits are gone.
<br />
Of course they told me that Bohr, Dirac, Feynman have given *the*  
<br />
explanation, but my whole point is in pointing that if I do survive a  
<br />
digital substitution the Feynman move has to be explained without  
<br />
postulating a world or a wave of whatever.
<br />
At first sight the comp digital hypothesis is so strong that there is  
<br />
an inflation of so many white rabbits and white noise that comp looks  
<br />
ridiculously false.
<br />
Then, and only then I temper that conclusion by showing that  
<br />
incompleteness makes the measure problem highly difficult and then I  
<br />
got also the shadow of the shadow of why, in fine, the probable 1- 
<br />
plural histories interfere making the Feynman moves, empirically  
<br />
motivated, understandable in the comp frame. But that is almost an  
<br />
accident in my life, my main motivation resides in explaining that  
<br />
the mind-body problem is not yet solved, yet can be scientifically  
<br />
addressed.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; With comp, and a bit poetically, the physical is the border of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; computer's computer science (the border of computer science as  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; seen by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; computers).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There are still some points where I do not follow how this arises in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your theory. For instance, for me unresolved (already mentioned  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; earlier)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is the granularity issue.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Perhaps one day we should really come back to each step of the UDA.  
<br />
You should understand by yourself that comp makes impossible any form  
<br />
of granularity in the physical world. I do have a conceptual problem  
<br />
with loop gravity, for example. But of course all this leads to  
<br />
difficult questions in both math and physics. And again, the non  
<br />
triviality of the hypostases brought by incompleteness makes any  
<br />
definitive conclusion premature.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But, while I have already read your email where you clarify some  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would like to go over your papers once more (it will be in July,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have much work in June) - and postpone more detailed questions to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Actually I will also be more and more busy. Good time to make a stop.  
<br />
Others can take the opportunity to clarify their approaches, perhaps  
<br />
(as I and others suggest many time) to find a way to explain what  
<br />
they are doing in everyday language.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But two things which initially strike me as unclear on a relatively
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; high, untechnical level:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) you said in a post that your comp implies immortality - but,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; every OM
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   is composed of infinite number of infinite consistent computations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; running through it - if OMs thus continue indefinitely into the future
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (immortality) should they not also continue indefinitely into the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; past?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  From where the asymmetry?
</em><br />
<br /><br />They most reasonably do continue indefinitely in some &quot;logical past&quot;.  
<br />
Yes, you are right.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We should not remember being born etc (1st-plural memory -&gt; parents,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; grandparents, friends etc) but should be &quot;eternal ones&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You are right. But we do forget things, and histories do fuse.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This does not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; imply infinite memory - we could forget, things fuzzing out the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; farther
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; back they are,
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; but one should not remember a starting point,
</em><br />
<br /><br />Do you remember one? Really? Ot is it an intellectual prejudice,  
<br />
because you have been told.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; only things
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; getting hazier and hazier (as computations &quot;merge&quot; in the infinite  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; past)
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes. But before being able to handle quantitatively the white  
<br />
rabbits, I don't think we can be more precise here.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) You said in comp only history and geography is contingent. That is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; also a very important point for me: one of the explanatorily most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; satisfying principles of current science is the theory of evolution:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this theory explains how order can arise even from total randomness. I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do not yet see how evolution fits into your account of comp.
</em><br />
<br /><br />But a priori, even the mundane act of drinking coffee does not fit  
<br />
comp. If you succeed in showing that evolution does not fit comp, I  
<br />
would take this as a step toward a refutation of comp (unless  
<br />
creationist provides arguments but they seems not even searching  
<br />
one ....).
<br />
Evolution will probably be explained once we have an explanation of  
<br />
the physical laws. Today, for sure, comp explain nothing. It explains  
<br />
only why the supposition of a material world cannot be invoked to  
<br />
explain the appearance of a physical world. You must realize my  
<br />
contribution is very modest (even if radical). It is negative, or  
<br />
destructive. It is a proof or argument that physicalness itself does  
<br />
evolve in some machine psychological/theological logical space,  
<br />
related to numbers. I show mainly that the comp hyp is very strong  
<br />
and hardly believable, yet the best we have for the mind, but today,  
<br />
it does not yet explain matter at all (abstraction made of the 4th  
<br />
and 5th hypostases which give only a propositional logic for the  
<br />
machine-observables).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I mean, if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we take the sum of computations describing a valid OM, why should  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more likely that an OM sees itself as arising via evolution as versus
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for instance (see above) an &quot;eternal one&quot;?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Here you are quick about evolution. What would be like a starting  
<br />
point? An exploding star generating the carbon atoms?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Could one not see the evidence for evolution as a strong indication  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physicalism (in a broad sense, a la computational universes where OMs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only arise as substructures evolved in that universe and not directly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;simulated&quot;?) (I know you addressed this question earlier, you said  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; spoke with Schmidhuber about it, I will check it up in July also, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this evolution question really bugs me, that is why I bring it up  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; again :-))
</em><br />
<br /><br />I like very much the evolution theory, and sometimes I explain that  
<br />
the UDA leads to the necessity to extend it to the laws of physics  
<br />
themselves. But asking me if evolution fits comp would be like asking  
<br />
to a nuclear physicist how he explains the history of the game of  
<br />
chess. The nuclear physicist can then only point on some plausible  
<br />
reduction, but nothing relates nuclear physics and chess a priori.  
<br />
Likewise, either the physics eventually derived from comp explains  
<br />
the usual physical facts, or it does not. If it does not comp is  
<br />
refuted, and if it does, evolution can be explained by the usual  
<br />
arguments. I have no doubt we share a very long and deep history  
<br />
which splits in the future as well as in the past, but comp does not  
<br />
yet explain what is a physical past, nor what is a physical future.  
<br />
Much works remain to be done. &quot;Modern physics&quot; has progress mainly  
<br />
because physicists have abstracted themselves from the mind-body  
<br />
problem. My work show that the seemingly obvious &quot;we are machine&quot;  
<br />
idea put new hard conceptual problem for the foundations of physics.  
<br />
Comp does not threatened physics, it calls for purely arithmetical  
<br />
foundations, explaining away the 1 and 3-rabbits.
<br />
<br />You can compare my work with Galileo thought experiment showing that  
<br />
Aristotle dynamics (more heavy things fall more quickly on the  
<br />
ground) is inconsistent. My work is intended to show that materialism  
<br />
(even very weak) is inconsistent with computationalism (even very  
<br />
weak). Comp leads to an hard &quot;matter problem&quot;. The mind is more easy  
<br />
thanks to computer science and mathematical logic.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But I have not yet finished Strawson's paper. Up to now, I appreciate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; it because it is quite clear (and thus clearly unconvincing with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; respect to the comp hyp).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Thanks for the reference. Best,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am glad that you enjoy the paper :-) As said above, it is a starting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point, not an end point. Every clear contribution sheds some more  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; light
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on a difficult question (there is too much unclear and confused  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; writing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on this subject, even by respected authors).
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes. But then we have to admit (it *is*my point!) that the subject  
<br />
matter is also very difficult. And when you see &quot;serious&quot; cognitivist  
<br />
like Dennett being tempted  to follow eliminative philosophy, like  
<br />
Strawson has seen, you can measure how far we are to even succeed in  
<br />
formulating our questions.
<br />
<br />Best regards, Günther. See you in July. A good thing we are busy in a  
<br />
synchronous way!
<br />
