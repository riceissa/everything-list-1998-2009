2009/8/10 Bruno Marchal &lt;marchal.domain.name.hidden&gt;:
<br />
<br />Bruno, I'm broadly in agreement with your comments, and merely
<br />
re-emphasise a few points below on which I'm being a stickler.  Also,
<br />
I have some further comments and questions on step 8.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; In this light
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; it becomes self-evident that any and all explanatory entities -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; physical, computational, or whatever - are severely restricted to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; domain of epistemology.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't see why. I would not put arithmetic in epistemology, or only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in a very large sense of epistemology, the epistemology of the 0-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person views!. It seems clearer to accept them ontologically like in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the usual practice of math. Could be only a vocabulary problem here.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, I normally wouldn't dispute this point, but but I'm being a
<br />
stickler here.  In the strictest sense the ontological equivalence of
<br />
anything whatsoever to the indexical OFP can only be an assumption -
<br />
albeit one that might be justifiable in the case of the best theory.
<br />
Beyond this, that the unique qualitative nature of the OFP *is* as it
<br />
appears, is in principle outside the scope of explanation itself.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  IOW - as Bruno says above - they are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; theoretical constructions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, but this does not mean those construction does not refer to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something real independently of us, and this is what I assume for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comp
</em><br />
<br />I agree, as above that it is the whole point of our endeavours to say
<br />
that the construction *refers* to something real.  But I think perhaps
<br />
that the something thus referenced is not best characterised as being
<br />
real *independently* of us, but rather *constitutive* of us and our
<br />
(most general) environment.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Even if the whole existence get annihilated, 17 would still be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prime.
</em><br />
<br />I understand that it is justifiable to take this as your point of
<br />
departure and don't really wish to make an argumentative point out of
<br />
it.  Nonetheless, in passing, perhaps I have a more radical intuition
<br />
of annihilation than you.  One can waste a lot of breath speculating
<br />
on 'nothing' because, strictly I guess, there can be nothing at all it
<br />
can refer to.   I could demonstrate this, given infinite time, simply
<br />
by flatly rejecting *any* survivor of such annihilation that you or
<br />
anyone cared to propose, to the crack of doom.  On this basis, even
<br />
'17 is prime' is a goner.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; So far so obvious.  But - as has again been recognised immemorially -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; solipsism is a dead-end and hence we seek a theory to capture the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; relation between the OFP and its environment.  But immediately we are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; faced with the notorious 'explanatory gap', and it seems to me that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; its most precise expression is in the gap between ontology and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; epistemology.  Indeed, what conceivable strategy could raise these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; theoretical constructions - to which the OFP uniquely lends existence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; - to the ontological certainty of their host?  Is there a coherent way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to conceive what it could mean to *be* a theoretical entity (as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; opposed to postulating or observing one)?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is the point of saying &quot;yes&quot; to the doctor. You don't say yes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because the new brain is a good modelisation of your brain, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because you bet it will enact yourself completely, relatively to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; neighborhood.
</em><br />
<br />Yes indeed, this is my point.  There is no way to *conceive* in
<br />
advance what it would mean to *be* such an enactment (i.e. to be
<br />
*sure*) so you can only bet that saying yes will not affect the state
<br />
of the indexical OFP.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You may confuse the reality of number, and the reality of machine/
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theories talking about those numbers. Numbers are not viewed as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theoretical construction. The theoretical construction are our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theories on the numbers. It simplifies things.
</em><br />
<br />I agree that this assumption simplifies things, and as you say it is
<br />
one shared by all mathematicians.  But again, in the final analysis,
<br />
numbers can only be 'viewed' as ontologically real, not *known* to be.
<br />
&nbsp;But this is true of any assumption whatever, and I freely concede
<br />
your points about the simplicity of the assumptions in the case of
<br />
comp.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; All theories demands faith, but the faith needed for understanding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that 17 is prime is not comparable to the act of faith needed to say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; yes to the doctor.
</em><br />
<br />Agreed.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  It's no use appealing to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; notions of 'what it's like to be a brain' - nor what it's like to be a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; COMP-quale - because we can never say that it is 'like anything to be'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the stuff of epistemology.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Assuming comp we can still say that it is like you feel right now.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Only zombie cannot understand, but if they are good zombie, they will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have no problem to fake that they understand.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, *assuming* comp.  We cannot *know* what it is like to be a
<br />
comp-quale, but we may have sufficient faith to bet that it's like
<br />
'what you feel right now'.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Hence we must see our theorising and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; observing - in physical, computational, or whatever terms - *in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; relation* to ontological certainty, not as constitutive of it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That's right.
</em><br />
<br />Hooray!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I thought this was obvious.
</em><br />
<br />You may have heard the following story.  A professor of mathematics
<br />
enters the lecture room with a sheaf of papers and writes a complex
<br />
theorem on the blackboard.  He turns to the students and says &quot;ladies
<br />
and gentlemen, this of course is obvious&quot;.  He then shuffles his
<br />
papers, looks at the board again and continues more doubtfully &quot;at
<br />
least, I think it is obvious&quot;.  Then he stares fixedly at the board
<br />
for ten minutes without speaking, looking increasingly uncomfortable.
<br />
Finally, he rubs out the theorem and leaves the room.  The students
<br />
are nonplussed, but remain in their seats.  Thirty minutes later, the
<br />
professor re-enters the room, looking disheveled but happy.  He writes
<br />
exactly the same theorem on the blackboard with a flourish, turns to
<br />
his audience and announces triumphantly &quot;ladies and gentlemen, I was
<br />
right - it IS obvious!&quot;
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Rather, they stand in some theoretical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; relation to RITSIAR, but strictly on the epistemological side of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; explanatory gap.  They are 'real as far as theory takes us', or if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; further jargon is unavoidable: RAFATTU.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well frankly this will depend of the first &quot;T&quot; of RAFATTU. It depends
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the theory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; With the comp theory, quarks, electrons, planet and galaxies are not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ontologically real.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; With string theory, they may be real.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, real in the relative sense we have been discussing.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; My argument against the *physical* instantiation of a computational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; mind (i.e. in any non-eliminative sense) rests on the claim that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; very arbitrariness of possible physical instantiations of a given
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; computation (cf Hofstadter) violates the criterion of direct
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; supervention on *specific* physical entities and relations from which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; a class of emergent phenomena inherits physical - as opposed to merely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; mental (and hence egregiously question-begging) - stability.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think that this what the movie graph argument makes necessary.
</em><br />
<br />Good, I'm glad we agree.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Naturally, all this is per physics as ordinarily understood.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Tolerating such a violation is tantamount to accepting (and this is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; notoriously claimed by Hofstadter et al) that *any* arbitrarily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; assembled set of physical entities deemed to be in the required
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'functional' relation (e.g. - famously - in an anthill) necessarily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; stabilises exactly the same 'mental state'.  AFAICS this is by itself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; quite sufficient to reveal such a 'mind' as intrinsically unphysical -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and a fortiori un-RITSIAR.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hmm... things are more subtle, but in a first approximation this can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be useful.
</em><br />
<br />Remember, I mean 'unphysical' in terms of standard physical theory.
<br />
By un-RITSIAR, in this instance, I mean that in these strictly
<br />
physical terms (i.e. without comp) such a mind doesn't even exist -
<br />
hence 'a fortiori'.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; My argument assumes, however, that - per physicalism - a running
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; computation (as opposed to its specification)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is important to distinguish a program (immaterial static object)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and a computation (an immaterial &quot;dynamic&quot; object, which can be finite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or infinite, but is best handled when accepting it is infinite,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because in that case a dynamic can be defined by a function from N to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anything: it is a sequence of things). If not, people get troubled by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the existence of running computation in platonia/arithmetical truth.
</em><br />
<br />Ah, but my argument attempts to distinguish a computation (immaterial
<br />
dynamic object) and an implementation of a computation (material
<br />
dynamic process) - again, per standard physical theory - as a
<br />
refutation of standard comp *in these strictly physical terms*.  My
<br />
point is, that per physicalism, a computation must be implemented in
<br />
some physical mechanism in order to have any real - i.e. physical -
<br />
effects (at least this was true the last time I did any programming).
<br />
Hence the existence of 'immaterial objects' in this case is simply
<br />
irrelevant to any effects that would be strictly justifiable as
<br />
ontologically real, per physicalism.  Consequently, I agree that the
<br />
reversal of ontological primacy you stipulate is necessary to save
<br />
comp.
<br />
<br />Your argument however seems to be based not on the physical
<br />
implementation but the 'immaterial' computation to which it is
<br />
postulated - per standard comp - to be equivalent.  Is this right?
<br />
(More on this below.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; necessarily requires
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; *some* physical activity to transform inputs to outputs (e.g. in terms
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of logic gates).  Step 8, however, seems to take a step beyond this by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; proposing that a running computation can take the form of (as opposed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to merely being described by) a machine *state*: i.e. without the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; requirement of activity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No, activity is required. But activity is just a function from N to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; set of states. The movie graph show that a machine cannot distinguish
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical activity from such an arithmetical activity. A computation is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an infinite set of numbers such that there is a universal number
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generating that sequence.
</em><br />
<br />When you say that &quot;activity is just a function from N to set of
<br />
states&quot;, you again seem to refer to 'immaterial activity'.  It seems
<br />
to me that what you are saying amounts to this:
<br />
<br />If it is the case that, per comp, it is the 'immaterial' activity of
<br />
the running program, regardless of specific implementation, that
<br />
implements the function and hence the mind, then this is
<br />
indistinguishable by the machine from it simply *being* the function
<br />
and hence the mind.  Standard comp is then seen to refute - or at
<br />
least make irrelevant - its own basis in materiality.  Is this right?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; And in any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; case, in what way is step 08 intended to extend intuition beyond my own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; argument, which - as I have tried to show - also elicits the insight
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that the direct supervention of 'functional' relations on functions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; themselves - not on their arbitrarily-defined physical tokens - is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; central to the recovery of 'mind' from computation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; See above.
</em><br />
<br />Have I succeeded in answering my own question?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The discovery of the universal machine is the creative bomb which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; makes comp possible and plausible. Universal machine, like computers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and brains, are not trivial mathematical object at all. To study comp
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; without computer science, is like doing cosmology without QM and GR.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course we can have the deepest intuition right, by experience, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to make a sharble verifiable theory, I am afraid we cannot dismiss
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some math ...
</em><br />
<br />Vous avez raison cher maitre, j'en suis sur.
