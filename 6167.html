<br />
------------------------
<br />
[RS]:
<br />
Since we live in a quantum mechanical world, randomness is inherently
<br />
quantum mechanical. Chaos, as a classical mechanism will amplify
<br />
quantum randomness.
<br />
[JM]:
<br />
Rather: &quot;we call the world we live in a QM-al one, because based on the
<br />
limited information humanity gathered over the past 2-3 millennia a QM was
<br />
derived and adjusted with our limited view of the world&quot;, so the statement
<br />
should fit. Earlier such statements did expire and we have no proof that
<br />
future enrichment of the epistemic cognitive inventory we get will not
<br />
change the QM-based worldview as it did the Flat earth earlier.
<br />
[RS]:
<br />
However, from the point of view of extracting sufficient randomness to
<br />
fool opponents in an evolutionary setting, classical chaos is good
<br />
enough. No agent will have the computational power of Laplace's daemon
<br />
[JM]:
<br />
poor daemon still could only compute known facts. Future discoveries are
<br />
hard to include into ongoing computations - however Ms Daemon may have
<br />
deeper insight than our cognitive inventory (knowledge-base)
<br />
of today.
<br />
[RS]:
<br />
I'm dealing with these questions in an artificial life system - Tierra
<br />
to be precise. I have compared the original Tierra code, with one in
<br />
which the random no. generator is replaced with a true random
<br />
no. generator called HAVEGE, and another simulation in which the RNG
<br />
is replaced with a cryptographically secure RNG called ISAAC. The
<br />
results to date (and this _is_ work in progress) is that there is a
<br />
distinct difference between the original Tierra PRNG, and the other
<br />
two generators, but that there is little difference between HAVEGE and
<br />
ISAAC. This seems to indicate that algorithmic randomness can be good
<br />
enough to fool learning algorithms.
<br />
[JM]:
<br />
I am sure you do a decent job. Tierra, however, does not include facts
<br />
that will be discovered (observed?) centuries from now. So the system
<br />
is based on a limited model of today's (yesterday's?) modeling. It may
<br />
give valuable answers to situations we face now, but your remark about
<br />
applying the unknowable (RNGs) does not secure the outcome to match
<br />
&nbsp;the future ways we may find later on.
<br />
Of course this is the way to do research, science and the (limited model
<br />
based) results are treasures for the further work. Our entire technology has
<br />
been developed this way.

<br />(PS: you assure us that the 'attachment format' you apply is harmless.
<br />
I agree, but to read it one has to open the attachment, then open the text
<br />
(4 clicks) and it appears on a different screen from the one a reply can be
<br />
written.
<br />
Several members give us the convenience of reading their posts on the page
<br />
where the list is answerable.
<br />
JM, just an old grouch.)
