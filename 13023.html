<br />
Firstly a big thank you to Russell Standish for providing that 
<br />
incredibly succinct 'bit stream' summary of universal-dovetailer 
<br />
ontology. [Though only a vocational mathematician would seriously call 
<br />
it 'very simple' even if it does have less than 1% of Bruno's word count 
<br />
for his essay on the subject.] Having the two approaches to the problem 
<br />
at hand has allowed me to get a bit of purchase on the beasty.
<br />
<br />Thanks also to Stathis for that simple and lovely, 'obvious', question 
<br />
from left-field. I am now convinced that, no matter what others might 
<br />
say, each number is in fact a process. Bruno referred to some kind of 
<br />
Platonia, some unspeakably not-anywhere place as the source of numbers 
<br />
and other mathematical objects or relationships. That is all well and 
<br />
good but as far as I can see - still - the numbers and other 
<br />
mathematical objects that people use are words in the strictest sense. 
<br />
They arise in human minds through inter-subjective induction, empathic 
<br />
copying [mirror neurons], interaction with the world, etc. But they are 
<br />
created anew in each brain that learns them, same as all other 
<br />
constructs. Their fantastic power comes about because they reflect - 
<br />
emulate and simulate - emergent properties of the rest of the universe.
<br />
<br />That this happens so successfully in so many people leads me to infer 
<br />
that the underlying principle organising the human mind, just as that 
<br />
organising the Great IT, the Multiverse, what ever, is harmonic resonance.
<br />
<br />**************
<br />
Meanwhile -
<br />
SP: 'How do you know that you are the same person from moment to moment 
<br />
in ordinary life? The physical processes in your brain create 
<br />
psychological continuity; that is, you know you are the same person 
<br />
today as yesterday because you have the same sense of personal identity, 
<br />
the same memories, woke up in the same environment, and so on. It is 
<br />
necessary and sufficient for survival that these psychological factors 
<br />
are generated, but it doesn't matter how this is achieved.'
<br />
<br />MP: Yep! I am a story! I am not like a story, I *am* a story. It is *my* 
<br />
story and I'm sticking to it, except when I find there are aspects of it 
<br />
I don't like. The problem [or a problem] is that this does not take away 
<br />
any of the intrinsic paradox of our experience. As I have said many 
<br />
times our experience is what it is like to be the portrayal of self in 
<br />
the world created within one's brain. The rendition in its details is 
<br />
effectively *about* being a person in his/her world, moment by moment. 
<br />
The experience we argue about, and other, possibly less benighted, 
<br />
persons write poetry and songs about, is simply what it is like to be 
<br />
this rendition. The primary practical paradox for each of us is that 
<br />
unless this distinction is pointed out repeatedly, we mistake the 
<br />
rendition, the story,  for the world itself. We are doomed to live ever 
<br />
like this. From the recesses of my dark corner it looks as if Bruno can 
<br />
show us conclusively that this subjective-objective distinction is an 
<br />
inherent feature of any kind of universe that we humans have any real 
<br />
hope of understanding.
<br />
<br />and as per the first part above, I think that the answer to the binding 
<br />
question in each domain is harmonic resonance. As far as I can see it 
<br />
accounts for why the pure gasses like to form molecular pairs; there 
<br />
have been reports recently that our sense of smell relies on inter and 
<br />
intra molecular vibrations as the fundamental [pun unintended] mechanism 
<br />
for detection and recognition of minuscule amounts of thousands of 
<br />
different airborne molecules; Steven Lehar has been banging his head 
<br />
against the wall for many years trying to point out to people how 
<br />
harmonic resonance can easily explain a huge range of Gestalt type 
<br />
capabilities clearly effected within the brain; correlations of brain 
<br />
wave frequencies have been discovered marking temporally related 
<br />
activities of the hippocampus and cortical regions shown through MR 
<br />
imaging to be involved in the creation or activation of memories. And 
<br />
the list goes on.
<br />
<br />NB: I hope that my imaginary destination in your speculation of possible 
<br />
post mortem exploits for my erstwhile sceptical soul is not a 
<br />
post-Freudian slip. I know that many of my contributions to this and 
<br />
other lists have lacked the erudite succinctness of those with greater 
<br />
talents; failure of concentration [AKA 'ADD'] has been a characteristic 
<br />
of life for me, but I think that 'awaking' to the innards of a black 
<br />
whole would do more than wonderfully concentrate the mind: concentration 
<br />
itself would become the major problem even for a ghost! =-O
