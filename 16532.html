<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maudlin only showed that *if* you define &quot;causal structure&quot; in terms

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/everything-list.domain.name.hidden/msg16244.html">http://www.mail-archive.com/everything-list.domain.name.hidden/msg16244.html</a> 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  you can see that I was trying to come up with a definition of the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;causal structure&quot; of a set of events that did *not* depend on  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; counterfactuals...look at these two paragraphs from that post,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particular the first sentence of the first paragraph and the last  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sentence of the second paragraph:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;It seems to me that there might be ways of defining &quot;causal  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure&quot; which don't depend on counterfactuals, though. One idea I  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; had is that for any system which changes state in a lawlike way over  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time, all facts about events in the system's history can be  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; represented as a collection of propositions, and then causal  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure might be understood in terms of logical relations between  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; propositions, given knowledge of the laws governing the system. As  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an example, if the system was a cellular automaton, one might have a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; collection of propositions like &quot;cell 156 is colored black at time- 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; step 36&quot;, and if you know the rules for how the cells are updated on  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; each time-step, then knowing some subsets of propositions would  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; allow you to deduce others (for example, if you have a set of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; propositions that tell you the states of all the cells surrounding  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cell 71 at time-step 106, in most cellular automata that would allow  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you to figure out the state of cell 71 at the subsequent time-step  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 107). If the laws of physics in our universe are deterministic than  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you should in principle be able to represent all facts about the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; state of the universe at all times as a giant (probably infinite)  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; set of propositions as well, and given knowledge of the laws,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; knowing certain subsets of these propositions would allow you to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deduce others.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;&quot;Causal structure&quot; could then be defined in terms of what logical  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relations hold between the propositions, given knowledge of the laws  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; governing the system. Perhaps in one system you might find a set of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; four propositions A, B, C, D such that if you know the system's  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; laws, you can see that A&amp;B imply C, and D implies A, but no other  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proposition or group of propositions in this set of four are  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sufficient to deduce any of the others in this set. Then in another  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; system you might find a set of four propositions X, Y, Z and W such  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that W&amp;Z imply Y, and X implies W, but those are the only deductions  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you can make from within this set. In this case you can say these  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; two different sets of four propositions represent instantiations of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the same causal structure, since if you map W to A, Z to B, Y to C,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and D to X then you can see an isomorphism in the logical relations.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That's obviously a very simple causal structure involving only 04  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; events, but one might define much more complex causal structures and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then check if there was any subset of events in a system's history  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that matched that structure. And the propositions could be  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; restricted to ones concerning events that actually did occur in the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; system's history, with no counterfactual propositions about what  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would have happened if the system's initial state had been different.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For a Turing machine running a particular program the propositions  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; might be things like &quot;at time-step 35 the Turing machine's read/ 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; write head moved to memory cell #82&quot; and &quot;at time-step 35 the Turing  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine had internal state S3&quot; and &quot;at time-step 35 memory cell #82  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; held the digit 1&quot;. I'm not sure whether the general rules for how  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Turing machine's internal state changes from one step to the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; next should also be included among the propositions, my guess is  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you'd probably need to do so in order to ensure that different  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computations had different &quot;causal structures&quot; according to the type  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of definition above...so, you might have a proposition expressing a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rule like &quot;if the Turing machine is in internal state S3 and its  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; read/write head detects the digit 1, it changes the digit in that  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cell to a 00 and moves 2 cells to the left, also changing its  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; internal state to S5.&quot; Then this set of four propositions would be  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sufficient to deduce some other propositions about the history of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this computation, like &quot;at time-step 36 the Turing machine's read/ 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; write head moved to memory cell #80&quot; and &quot;at time-step 36 the Turing  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine had internal state S5.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So if we define causal structure in terms of relationships between  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; propositions concerning the history of the Turing machine in this  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way, then look at propositions concerning the history of the Olympia  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine described by Maudlin when it was emulating that Turing  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine program, it's not clear to me whether it would be possible  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to map propositions about the original Turing machine to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; propositions about Olympia in such a way that you'd be able to show  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; their causal structures were isomorphic (I think it is clear that  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such a mapping would be impossible in the case of your MGA 01 though,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so if we identify OMs with causal structures this would suggest that  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the brain which functioned via random cosmic rays correcting errors  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would not have the same inner experience as the brain which was  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; functioning correctly and did not require these cosmic rays).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But either way, what is clear is that the presence or absence of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inert machinery designed to guarantee the correct counterfactuals  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would not affect the answer, since we'd only be looking at  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; propositions about events that actually occurred in the course of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Olympia machine's operation. If it turned out there was an  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; isomorphism between these propositions and the propositions about  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the operation of the original Turing machine, then that would show  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maudlin was too quick to dismiss the original Olympia machine (the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one lacking the counterfactual machinery) as giving rise to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; phenomenal experience (even though the armature behaves in a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; monotonous way, the way the troughs influence each other via pipes  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; might be enough to ensure that the causal structure associated with  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Olympia's operation does depend on what program is being emulated).  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If there wasn't such an isomorphism, then there still wouldn't be an  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; isomorphism even with the counterfactual machinery added, so that  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could make it more clear why the Olympia machine was not really  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;instantiating&quot; the same computation as the original Turing machine.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Maudlin shows that you can reduce almost arbitrarily the amount of  
<br />
physical activity for running any computation, and keep their  
<br />
computational genuineness through the use of inert material. So the  
<br />
isomorphism you introduce vanish on the original Olympia (Pre-olympia).
<br />
<br />Olympia *is*  &quot;Pre-Olympia&quot; + Klara (the inert (for the computation  
<br />
PI) machinery needed for the counterfactuals) OK? Olympia run the  
<br />
computation PI.
<br />
<br />The point of Maudlin is that for any computation there exists a a  
<br />
Klara machinery such that you can built a &quot;Pre-Olympia&quot; which will  
<br />
execute, with an arbitrarily small amount of  physical activity (even  
<br />
with none) that computation. And this in the usual sense that the  
<br />
counterfactuals are preserved, thanks to the Klara.
<br />
<br />The price for keeping your &quot;causal structure&quot; isomorphism not  
<br />
vanishing consists, indeed, in making consciousness supervening on the  
<br />
logical and immaterial relations bringing a local story about a  
<br />
probable local relatively consistent &lt;self-environment&gt; structure.
<br />
<br />Again, see the Movie graph for a simpler (and older) argument not  
<br />
based on the counterfactual issue.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One interesting thing about defining causal structure this way is  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that we could talk about causal structures being contained in pure  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical structures like the set of true propositions about  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arithmetic. A Platonist should believe that if you take the set of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all well-formed formulas concerning numbers and arithmetical  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; operations (as well as logical symbols like 'there exists' and 'for  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all'), then there is a particular infinite set of WFFs which  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; represents all true propositions about arithmetic, even if Godel  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; showed that this infinite set cannot be generated by any finite set  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of initial propositions taken as axioms (and it also cannot be  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generated by a computable infinite set of axioms, I think).
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you take any finite subset of true propositions (P1, P2, P3, ...,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; PN), then these propositions will be logically interrelated in some  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particular way--it might be that if you start out taking P2 and P3  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as axioms you can deduce P5 from this but you can't deduce P4, for  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; example. I imagine representing each proposition as a dot in a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; diagram, and then arrows would show which individual dots or  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; collections of dots in this finite set can be used to deduce other  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dots in the same finite set. This diagram would define a unique  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;causal structure&quot; for this set of propositions, and then if you  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have a set of propositions about something different from  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arithmetic, like the history of a particular Turing machine  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computation,
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />The history of a particular Turing machine computation does belong to  
<br />
arithmetic. Already to Robinson Arithmetic. (Roughly: Peano Arithmetic  
<br />
without the induction axioms). You need just a Sigma_1 complete theory  
<br />
for the ontology. It is enough to (meta)define a richer internal  
<br />
epistemology justifying why, &quot;from inside&quot; things appear (and in some  
<br />
sense are) much richer. This is not obvious and technically relies on  
<br />
Gödel's compeleteness and incompleteness theorem, or Skolem theorem.  
<br />
It is long to explain, yet very short to understand, and utterly  
<br />
clear, if you are aware of Solovay theorem.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; you could see whether there was a subset with an isomorphic pattern  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of logical implications (and thus the same 'causal structure'  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; according to my definition). And even within arithmetic you might  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have two different subsets of propositions (P1, P2, ..., PN) and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (p1, p2, ..., pN) which could be mapped to one another in such a way  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the implications within each set were isomorphic to the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implications within the other, in which case they would be two  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different &quot;instantiations&quot; of the same causal structure within the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Platonic set of all true propositions about arithmetic.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Exactly. The movie graph and/or Olympia just show that if we are  
<br />
machine, we rely only on arithmetic. And physics became a measure  
<br />
problem on or relatively probable arithmetical histories. With the  
<br />
provability logic, or the self-reference logic you can explain why  
<br />
arithmetic divides, for each universal machine into  sharable and  
<br />
doubtable quanta, and non sharable non doubtable qualia. (AUDA)
<br />
UDA, which I have explained often here is an argument showing why it  
<br />
has to be so, and AUDA is the math exploiting UDA in the case of  
<br />
ideally monotonic machine observers.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maybe you could even make a TOE based on the idea that all that  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; really &quot;exists&quot; is this infinite set of propositions about  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arithmetic, and that this infinite set defines a unique measure on  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all finite causal structures, based on how easy it is to find  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multiple &quot;instantiations&quot; of each finite causal structure within the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; infinite set of true propositions. I don't suppose this has any  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; resemblance to your approach?
</em><br />
<br /><br />UDA is an argument that if we (human) are machine it has to be that  
<br />
approach.  It is the reversal physics/number theory. Physics is  
<br />
eventually the projection or limit of what the number can see when  
<br />
they look at themselves.
<br />
<br />(AUDA is the about the same, but I use the opportunity of Gödel, Löb,  
<br />
Kleene, Feferman, Grzegorczyk, Boolos, Goldblatt, Visser,  ... and the  
<br />
key Solovay works in self-reference (in arithmetic, first order,  
<br />
second order, in set theory and beyond) to exploit the many nuances  
<br />
(between truth, provability, knowability, observability, ...), due to  
<br />
internal incompleteness, and to show we don't have to leave  
<br />
arithmetic, yet get a sufficiently precise theology including physics  
<br />
so as to compare it with the empirical world). One of lmy main point  
<br />
is that comp, is a &quot;scientific&quot; theory in the sense of Popper. It  
<br />
leads to observable conclusions, and most (alas not yet all) quantum  
<br />
weirdness confirm comp.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I suppose the answer is probably &quot;no&quot;
</em><br />
<br /><br />The answer is &quot;yes&quot;!
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; since I'm suggesting some kind of absolute measure on all causal  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structures, and if you identify particular causal structures with  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OMs that would correspond to the ASSA, but you have said that your  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; approach only uses the RSSA.
</em><br />
<br /><br />There is no absolute measure on all &quot;causal structures&quot; , still less  
<br />
on OM, right! I would ba an ants or a bacteria in two seconds!
<br />
But for all &quot;causal structure&quot; rich enough to develop a &quot;personal  
<br />
first person&quot; there is a more relatively probable computational stories.
<br />
<br />Your two sets above  (p1, p2, ..., pn) and (P1, P2, P3, ... PN), if  
<br />
isomorphic (in your vague (theory dependent) sense, but ok) will give  
<br />
rize, in Platonia, to the same first person experience (same  
<br />
consciousness), but with different measure in case they can bifurcate  
<br />
or differentiate, into something like
<br />
<br />(p1, p2, ..., pn, pn+1, pn+2, ...)
<br />
(P1, P2, P3, ... PN, PN+1, PN+2, ...)
<br />
<br />where (pn+1, pn+2, ...) and (PN, PN+1, PN+2, ...) are both consistent  
<br />
extension of the preceding propositions, and are no more isomorphic  
<br />
above the level of substitution (different and distinguishable  
<br />
experiences like feeling to be in Seattle and feeling to be in  
<br />
Melbourne after a self-duplication experiment).
<br />
<br /><br />There is an absolute conditionalisation, or relativisation. Physics  
<br />
became superglobal in search of the invariant for the recursive  
<br />
permutations. If you want I am using ARSSA. The probability of being  
<br />
Jesse Mazer does not make sense in the absolute, only the (absolute)  
<br />
probability of being Jesse Mazer in an instant, from the point of view  
<br />
of Jesse Mazer, here and now.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Anyway I have no idea how you'd actually &quot;count&quot; the number of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appearances of a given causal structure in the infinite set of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; propositions about arithmetic, so the idea of getting a measure on  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; causal structures this way is very vague...
</em><br />
<br /><br />Vague? I don't think so. Church thesis makes this purely mathematical.  
<br />
Difficult? Sure. That is why UDA is followed by AUDA where the case of  
<br />
&quot;probability or credibility (whatever) ONE, is made entirely clear and  
<br />
formal. It is already proved that the physical local observations  
<br />
cannot be boolean, and there is already a well defined notion of  
<br />
quantization.
<br />
UDA is also completely clear, even if it take some time for some  
<br />
people to grasp some steps. It is normal given that is new and  
<br />
counterintuitive.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; but if there's one thing this list is good for it's vague  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; speculations! ;)
</em><br />
<br /><br />Given that we address a very difficult problem in the list it is all  
<br />
normal that some posts can be more vague than others. That is the  
<br />
reason why we discuss: to clarify, and clarify, and clarify up to  
<br />
crystal clarity.
<br />
If you have trouble in UDA, please say so. I think most people on the  
<br />
list understand the seven first steps.
<br />
For AUDA you need to invest more deeply in computer science,  
<br />
mathematical logic, quantum logic, and (the harder and not very well  
<br />
known by the average scientist) cognitive science.
<br />
<br />And frankly, mechanism seems to me less speculative than any form non  
<br />
mechanism in the cognitive science, given our current working  
<br />
theories, be it physical or neurophysiological.
