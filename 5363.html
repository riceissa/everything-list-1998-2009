<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; But even this goes way out in front of what we can possibly know.  You
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; say we have no idea what these feelings are like to experience--but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; should we assume we even are entitled to ask this question?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; And why assume that we are not? I prefer not to have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; my right to ask waived. If I cannot ask it, then I should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; understand why not, and that would be an answer in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; At first it seems like a normal question to ask, because we have a way 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of talking about our experiences that takes them to be simple entities, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and why not ask &quot;what it is like&quot; for other beings?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But you're asking the question in the same manner (using the same 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logical form) as when one asks what's inside a box, and expecting the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; same kind of answer.  But the two cases are conceptually distinct.  We 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are well acquainted with boxes and their contents, and thus have every 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; right to ask what's inside when we see a box.  But we have no such 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; acquaintance with minds.
</em><br />
<br />I have only followed the analogy. But of course I am aware
<br />
that the analogy is loose and that we cannot ask about qualia
<br />
in the same manner as about the contents of a box.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I may have overstated a bit -- of course anyone has the right to ask 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any question they want!  =) But when we explore the consequences of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness in a multiverse, as this list often does, we shouldn't 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; overlook the fact that there are many views of consciousness and some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; may lead to fewer problems than others.  Earlier there were posts about 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whether SAS-like patterns in a cellular automaton would really be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious or not.  It seems like this question is asking, &quot;I can see 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; how the thing behaves, but what I want to know is, are the lights 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'turned on inside' or not?&quot;.  But we already know that there are no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lights -- so what is the question really asking?  Maybe we can get away 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with ignoring questions like this, and have a better universe model as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a result.
</em><br />
<br />I don't agree that &quot;we already know that there are no lights&quot;.
<br />
The thing is that we know what it feels like to be conscious.
<br />
We know what is the difference between red and blue, and
<br />
we know we cannot communicate that to someone who cannot
<br />
see.
<br />
It is not as if we were unconscious beings asking if there was
<br />
something like 'qualia' (which we would have no idea about)
<br />
in the cellular automata. We are not merely inventing concepts
<br />
which have no correspondence in the real world. Each of us
<br />
knows exactly what it means, and talk about these
<br />
things using the assumption that other similar beings have
<br />
experiences similar to our own.
<br />
The fact that we try to ask this question in the first place
<br />
implies that there is something there to be explained, at least.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;snip&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; know what is inside it.   Now what is the logical conclusion here:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; a)  There may or may not be something in the box.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; b)  There's definitely something in the box, and I have absolutely no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; idea what it is.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; What on earth could possibly make someone conclude (b) here?  It's not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; logical at all.  Yet this is what people conclude when they bend over
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; backwards talking about &quot;qualia&quot; and how ineffable they are.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; And you seem to conclude a (c) hypothesis: &quot;there is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; definitely nothing inside the box&quot;. I stay with (a). And
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to try to find out if there is something there or not, we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; need to talk about it, and &quot;qualia&quot; is the word for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; hypothetical contents of the box.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That would be correct if the analogy between boxes and minds were 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sound, but I don't think it is, and that's the point of bringing it up. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   About the only thing you can conclude is that something strange is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; going on because these people insist you can't know what's inside a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; box.  You're right, though, I don't exactly embrace (a), I question the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entire setup.
</em><br />
<br />Neither do I think the analogy is sound, as I said above.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Suppose a blind man did understand all the chain of events
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that lead from the light reaching the eyes to the retina, then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to the brain and finally to the qualia of red. Would he see the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; red? Why not?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Where is the path from the brain to the &quot;qualia of red&quot;?  You're saying 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the blind man is aware of trillions of neural changes occurring 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; over time, and that at some point he can say, &quot;Now, here's where things 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; leave the brain and start to become qualia.&quot;..  Is this before or after 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the neural changes that modify behavior, i.e., to cause someone to say, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;I'm seeing red now&quot;?
</em><br />
<br />I have no idea. I don't claim to understand how qualia arises.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In any case, I grant that the blind man's experience would be quite 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different from someone who's actually looking at the color red.  This 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is just because the functional states of someone who is seeing red are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different than those of someone who just understands what it's like-- 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you can't stimulate your optic nerve just by will alone.  It isn't 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; clear that someone could drive their brain into the state of someone 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; who had seen red merely by understanding everything about the process 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of seeing red.  This is also how I respond to Frank Jackson's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; colorblind Mary experiment..
</em><br />
<br />So you agree that you cannot &quot;drive someone's brain into the state of
<br />
someone who had seen red merely by understanding everything about
<br />
the process of seeing red.&quot;. That is, you agree that you cannot &quot;see red&quot;
<br />
unless you do physically &quot;see red&quot;. Isn't that somehow in contradiction
<br />
with your claim below, i.e., that there is nothing else to know beyond the
<br />
explanation of the physiological response? One thing you seem to agree:
<br />
you cannot know how red looks like unless you see red. A blind man
<br />
cannot possibly know that.
<br />
Now I am aware that &quot;know&quot; may not be the correct term. Maybe
<br />
experience would be better.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I suppose there will still be some who insist that if you know all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; about the physiology etc. behind the alien response to gamma rays,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; then you know all there is to know. I think this response is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; analogous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; to the &quot;shut up and calculate&quot; attitude to the interpretation of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; quantum mechanics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Yes, I am one of these people.  You say &quot;if you know all about&quot;, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; you must be taken seriously here:  you would really have to know &gt;all&lt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; about it.  But if you did, you would be able to entirely trace the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; causal pathway from the receipt of the gamma rays, to whatever 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; internal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; responses go on inside the alien's body, to the subsequent report of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; feel that pleasant, odd-multiple feeling&quot;.  Let's say you had that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; entire explanation written out.  And &quot;subjective experience&quot; doesn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; appear anywhere on this list.  So what reason on earth do you have to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; assert that it exists?
</em><br />
<br />The reason is that you are yourself (I suppose) a conscious being
<br />
who has those experiences, and once you come to the conclusion
<br />
that you cannot possibly communicate the difference between red
<br />
and blue, you must accept that there is something beyond the
<br />
causal chain of events.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; When the alien says &quot;I feel that pleasant feeling&quot;, he is just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; saying that he knows that chain of events is happening
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in his body right now. Suppose you are watching him with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; equipments that let you know that same thing. Could you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; also say &quot;I feel that pleasant feeling&quot; too? Why not, if there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is nothing beyond the chain of events? What could make the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; alien's knowledge different from yours? One obvious answer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is that &quot;he is the organism where those events are happening&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But this means that each organism is entitled to &quot;feel
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; something&quot; about himself , an experience that is inaccesible to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; others, no matter how comprehensive their knowledge is. But
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that is something that you are claiming that does not exist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; How can we explain this without something as &quot;qualia&quot;?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Can you please explain how that situation is relevantly different from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this one:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A snack vending machine has a sensor that can tell when a dollar bill 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has been placed inside it.  If it's a genuine dollar, a sign lights up 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that says &quot;Accepted&quot;.  If it's fake, another sign lights up that says 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Not accepted&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Which sign lights up is just a report of the chain of events that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happens.  Let's say you built the machine, and you know exactly how it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; works, and you are monitoring the machine and are aware of all its 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; states.   Could you say, &quot;I also do not accept the dollar.&quot;?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What could make the machine's knowledge different from yours?  What 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reason would I have to posit some special knowledge the machine has 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that I can't access?
</em><br />
<br />You cannot say that you do not accept the dollar in the same way
<br />
that the machine does, because for the machine the verb &quot;accept&quot;
<br />
has a different meaning than for you. Actually, the machine cannot
<br />
say that it does not accept the dollar, it can only light some sign, but
<br />
it does not interpret what is written there. It doesn't know what a 
<br />
dollar is and what it is good for. It doesn't know what it means 'to
<br />
accept' nor any other verb. I am not even sure if we can say it 'knows'
<br />
anything at all. You just used the verb loosely here
<br />
making an impression that the machine goes through the same states
<br />
than a human when trying to figure out if the dollar is acceptable.
<br />
<br />Besides, you are talking about thoughts (accept), or in the case of
<br />
the machine, behaviour. But not experiences, which is what qualia
<br />
is about. This makes this situation totally different. We don't talk
<br />
about &quot;the qualia of accepting&quot;. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And why would I posit that an alien or another person has special 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; knowledge that I can't access?  All I can say is that the events are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; too complicated for me to understand .. this doesn't mean there's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anything metaphysically interesting going on.
</em><br />
<br />Then try to explain what is the difference between red and blue.
<br />
<br />-Eric.
