<br />Do you think it's possible *not* to start with this assumption? The
<br />
problem with natural language is that it implicitly assumes the AIV is
<br />
'out there' as the primary reality, and it can be tough to work
<br />
back from this point of departure. I was trying to develop a language
<br />
that started from the APV and worked outwards, as it were, so that it
<br />
was easier to see how emergent information boundaries were shaping and
<br />
structuring the APV and the AIV while at the same time contingently
<br />
creating the 'not-X', without fundamentally creating novel ontic
<br />
(as opposed to epistemic) categories. Unfortunately, the terminology
<br />
tended to become impenetrable and in the end a barrier to
<br />
communication.  I don't have a solution to this.
<br />
<br />Somehow it's like:
<br />
<br />a) we mentally step outside of the APV to see what it's like in the
<br />
'external world'
<br />
b) we make models of what we see out there (the AIV), including our
<br />
'brains'
<br />
c) then we forget about step a), get stranded outside, and take the AIV
<br />
for 'reality'
<br />
d) leaving us in a panic about how to get back inside our 'brains'
<br />
<br />Somebody once asked &quot;what is the external world 'external' to?&quot;
<br />
Do you know?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; some people here think the APV is '3-person'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some people here think the AIV is '3-person'
</em><br />
<br />My view is that the *fact of * the APV is 1-person, and everything else
<br />
is 3-person. That is, the 1-person is the unmediated intuitive grasp of
<br />
3-person information by the 'underlying reality'. What lies within
<br />
the APV, the AIV, or the 'external world' to which they refer, then
<br />
depends solely on contingent boundaries emerging from 3-person
<br />
information gradients and horizons.  Essentially this is categorising
<br />
the ontology as 1-person, and the epistemology as 3-person. However, I
<br />
realise that this is a minority approach, and has caused much
<br />
confusion, so I've more or less given up trying to promote it.
<br />
<br />I think the general view is that the APV is 1-person, and the AIV is
<br />
3-person. But then, the AIV *model* of the APV is 3-person, and the
<br />
distinction between this and the 1-person APV is confusing (the 'hard
<br />
problem').
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The easiest way to think of it is to regard X as a finger puppet. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'fingers' are behaving atomly in that the fingers are painted (appear -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; APV) to deliver the appearance of 'atom-ly (AIV) behaviour'. The AIV says
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nothing about FINGERS. Then note that whatever the fingers are - you, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer - are made of the SAME FINGERS and those fingers are painting the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; APV in your head. The reason no-one ever gets a physics of qualia is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nobody EVER gets scientific about _fingers_ - the underling physics -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Everyone thinks the AIV generalisations ARE the fingers.
</em><br />
<br />Conventional physics, I think, denies that the fingers exist - all
<br />
that can be said is what QM / string theory / model of the month
<br />
describes, and this is equivalent to saying that that's all there is
<br />
folks. Comp, however, would say that the fingers are something like
<br />
mathematical ontic / epistemic categories (see some of Marc Geddes'
<br />
posts), and that these support the emergence of 3-person relata. Sets
<br />
of these 1-person / 3-person relationships can be nested recursively,
<br />
the whole resting on the 'turtle' of a tightly constrained
<br />
'number reality' (e.g. AR+CT+UDA). The 'modest' assumption here
<br />
is that not to force 'faith' in comp, but rather study and test it
<br />
for its interesting and surprising results and generative power. The
<br />
most powerful result would be to pin down the 'emergence direction'
<br />
of 1-person &lt;--&gt; 3-person once and for all.

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &lt;snip&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Indeed I would hold that our subjective experience (subjectivity)is our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one and only intimate and complete connection to the underlying reality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and it is the existence of it (subjectivity) 'at all' which is most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; telling/instructive  of the true nature/structure of the underlying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality, not the appearances thus delivered by subjectivity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [DAVID]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Yes, and as I've said, I was trying to convey the essence of this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thought with what became (unfortunately) confused with 1-person primacy on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this list. I'd be grateful for help on reformulating this more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; coherently if possible. The heart of it is the primary intension of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'exists', whose fons et origo I take to be: 'exists in the sense that I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exist subjectively'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [COLIN]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes. The subtlety is extreme. My way of unpacking it is to  think of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concept of 'perspective view':
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a) assume that there is an 'objective reality in the Bruno sense: a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality exists. _any_ sort of reality will do.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; b) draw a purely notional boundary around any portion  of it at any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; spatiotemporal scale.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now realise that innate to the situation is that 'being' the notionally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; segregated portion of the reality innately, automatically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prescribes/defines a perspective view of the rest of the universe.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is not automatically anything that has 'visibility'!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; All it means is that if the reality expresses X (ontological identity of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some sort) then the rest of the universe must be an absolutely perfect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; un-X.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No matter how weird the reality is, in the un-X is a form of latent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perspective 'view' from the position of being X. For example , an atom
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exists, ergo the 'un-atom' exists (everything in the universe that isn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the atom). There is no reality that doesn't do this. It can't be helped -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it's intrinsic to the act of any existence at all.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; _This does not mean it is actually 'like anything' to 'be' the notionally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; segregated portion_.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Back to the example of an X. To 'be' X is to inherit a latent un-X
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perspective. Nothing has to do anything. This idea applies to all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; spatiotemporal scales. From quark/un-quark to planet/un-planet. Also note
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the word 'spatiotemporal' is a loaded word. Any level of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multi-dimensional weirdness can still be part of the reality. The same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concept applies no matter how fleeting an X may be.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is the idea of 'existence' or 'being' which I think has to be adopted
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to make sense of perception. Once you realise it the whole job of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perception changes to one merely of 'visibility' that makes use of this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; latent potential. To see this:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Consider your own left kneecap. From the perspective of being your left
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; kneecap the rest of the universe is expressing a perfect un-kneecap. This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is what the universe's innate perspective looks like. Yet we do not see
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the universe from that perspective. Or from the perspective of any cell in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the kneecap. Or any molecule or any atom and so on. Also, from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perspective of being the 'space' inhabited by the atoms in your kneecap
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (call it knee_gap) the rest of the universe is expressing a perfect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; un-knee_gap. Space is just as ontologically real in this. It's all the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; same. Whatever space is, it only has to be something we can pass through
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and it'll look like space. It's just as much 'stuff' as anything in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; periodic table - just that the atoms/particles in it (expressed by it) can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; move around easily when in it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; All the visibility we humans have is centred on our brain material.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Something about brain material actually makes use of the intrinsic latent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; potential perspective view to implement an actual view from that location.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That view is called phenomenal consciousness (discussed in all manner of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ways previously). Notions of 'self' and indexicality flow but are merely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; secondary to the actual 1-person view and the innate circumstance that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; delivers the view.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The whole problem changes to one of visibility.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think this concept covers what you call 1-person.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; When 'YOU' (your brain material) makes use of the latent perspective view
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to implement an ACTUAL perspective view of everything call this the APV.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The appearance of reality thus acquired can be used to make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generalisations (the holy grain of the empirical scientist is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exceptionless generalisation). The depiction of the universe in the form
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of these generalisations is NOT the APV. This is an 'as-if' view. That is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - the universe is behaving 'as-if' the ontology in the generalisations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; actually existed. That universe does not exist. It is methodologically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'deemed' for the purposes of predicting how the universe will appear
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; _within_ the APV. Call this 'as-if' view AIV.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here is where I get confused:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some people here think the APV is '3-person'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some people here think the AIV is '3-person'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm pretty sure each of us has their own label for the concepts. What I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sure of is that we confuse each other a lot by not fully
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; realising/describing the distinction in a discussion context.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The final note:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in terms of the definition of 'being' explained above I must point out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the same underlying reality that 'is you' is generating the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perspective view (making use of the innate latent potential for it). To
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; illustrate - Imagine you are looking at (have an APV of) thing X where X =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an atom. In our APV something is behaving atom-ly. We can formulate a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generalisation that defines how an atom behaves within our APV. That
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generalisation is an AIV. That AIV does NOT define what it is that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behaving atom-ly. It merely describes expected appearances to be found if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you happen to get an atom presented to you in an APV.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The easiest way to think of it is to regard X as a finger puppet. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'fingers' are behaving atomly in that the fingers are painted (appear -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; APV) to deliver the appearance of 'atom-ly (AIV) behaviour'. The AIV says
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nothing about FINGERS. Then note that whatever the fingers are - you, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer - are made of the SAME FINGERS and those fingers are painting the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; APV in your head. The reason no-one ever gets a physics of qualia is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nobody EVER gets scientific about _fingers_ - the underling physics -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Everyone thinks the AIV generalisations ARE the fingers. Totally wrong.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There are 2 set of equally valid scientific descriptions - descriptions:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (a) The underlying reality that generates the APV
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (b) the generalisations acquired using the APV (= the AIV)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In the reality of provision of the APV 'observation' of BOTH descriptions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happens. One is explicit (b) = &quot;that which is seen&quot; and one is implicit =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;seeing&quot; (at all). That is the distinction I wanted to make in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; previous post. I think somewhere in the above you may find an answer to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your questions. Or maybe just ideas that lead to one. I'd be interested in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seeing how your ideas relate to it. Note that all underlying realities of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any type can have the same logic applied - not just the one that is ours.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This does not mean that sorting out our underlying reality is impossible!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [DAVID]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The problem is that as soon as one formulates it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in this way, all sorts of unlooked for windmills spring up for the Don
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Quixotes of the logical mind to struggle with. Somehow one must avoid
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being distracted into grappling with pseudo-problems of pansychism,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; idealism, solipsism etc. - in their timeworn academic clothing - and focus
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on the embeddedness, or 'here-ness' that is central to this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; primary sense of 'exists', and see that everything else is somehow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; derivative of, or emergent from, this primary intension. And, as you say,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by this token we are of course ourselves directly rooted in this reality,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whatever it is.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [COLIN]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yep. The demands of our language as assumed generator of truth rather then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; depictor of it... I can see the words as having something to say about the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality, but not the other way around....eg...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; PANPSYCHISM. I can sort of (if I squint) equate a form of panpsychism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; within the innate_but_unrealised_latent_potential perspective view idea at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all scales. I think Alfred North Whitehead might like it. But this is NOT
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some sort of magical universal consciousness!  EEEK! to that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; IDEALISM. I can see the APV using the properties of ideal objects. I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cannot see that the production of the APV 'creates' the underling reality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That's just silly. Magical intervention again. Much more parsimony in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; accepting a reality as existent (as a hypothesis currently scientifically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unrefuted).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; SOLIPSISM. I can see that the APV, being private, could be used to justify
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the entire reality as being only yours... &quot;there can be only one&quot; :-) But
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to me the existence of an APV is literal proof there is an underlying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality - if there wasn;t one then there couldn't be any APV. It all boils
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; down to a chicken/egg argument. I vote we delete the word to eliminate the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You can go through a whole library of terms and do the same thing. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; words paint a picture an aspect of the actuality. None of the actuality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; directly corresponds with (in the sense of is demanded by) the words. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; delusion that just because the terminology arguments are possible that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality shall therefore play along - NUTS to that!
</em><br />

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; The belief that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; 'underlying reality is actually made of quantum mechanics (as opposed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; being merely described by it) to me looks like a mass delusion of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; bizarre kind.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; One implication of this (which I think is also implied by comp) is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1-person experience derives from a more complex instantiation than the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3-person narrative that emerges from it. That is, there is a global
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instantiation level of sufficient complexity to express 1-person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence 'qualitatively'. At this level, qualitative modalities -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'qualia' - also function as stripped-down 'relata', encoding '3-person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; worlds' of structure, relation, transaction, and locality. We may
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; speculate, for example, that our experientially dynamic discrimination
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (A-series) of relation and structure (B-series) emerges from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'unmediated intuitive grasp' of such relational locality within
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; qualitative globality. All this strongly entails that we will never find
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the 1-person within the 3-person. The evidence of course is perhaps
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; already staring us in the face, were we to accept it as such. There is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nothing at all in the 3-person that looks like, or that we have any notion
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could possibly look like, the 1-person. Maybe this is why.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [COLIN]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes. Yes. Yes. This is all the Humean view of causality. &quot;correlation is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not causation&quot;. Hume was dead right in being an absolute sceptic. As are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; POPPER and his student MILLER (recent book 'out of error' is a MUST read).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The Popper/Miller pragmatics on science map the reality of perception and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cognition into the act of scientific behaviour perfectly. We get perfectly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; good 'as-if' causality from within 1-person appearances. But none of is is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; actually driving the universe. Associative memory is literally an 'as-if'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'apparent causality' generation machine. Traditional empirical scientific
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; laws are just metaphors.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What is actually driving the universe is the 'underlying reality' - and it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is that underlying reality which is generating the 1-person appearances.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's just that the clinching evidence which gives us permission to play
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with possible underlying realities is not within 1-person appearances, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the very existence of any 1-person view at all. The sort of underlying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality that makes what we see as brain material deliver a 1-person view
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is the sort of universe we inhabit. No 3-person AIV/generalisation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; delivered by the 1-person will ever do that! Which is where my comment
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about (QM DOES NOT EQUAL underlying reality) came from.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yet another metaphor:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If an alien studied city traffic from orbit (using some sort of wiz_bang
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; long distance speed-radar) you'd pretty quickly come up with a rule about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the probablity distribution T(V) of finding 'traffic', T running at a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certain speed V (enforced by signs on the side of the road). Call this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; TRAFFIC_MECHANICS.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Saying that QM literally IS the underlying reality is like saying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; TRAFFIC is made of P(V)! Meaningless drivel. To talk about the underlying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality is to talk about CARS that behave TRAFFIC_MECHANICALLY.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Physics seems to be completely mesmerised by the 'unreasonable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; effectiveness' of mathematics to the point of thinking that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematics somehow 'is' the underlying reality - instead of more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reasonably concluding that the underlying reality is merely behaving
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'as-if' it were being driven mathematically. The latter proposition would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; win any critical argument in a model of reality simply through empirical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; parsimony. The mathematics-bliss state of cosmologists is a kind of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; religion - a belief in the magical intervention of a mathematics god -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that can only be maintained if you structurally/culturally eschew 1-person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as evidence of anything whilst at the same time demanding it deliver all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the 3-person evidence you use to maintain your belief in the mathematics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; god!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; E) The descriptive mathematics of appearance is NOT the underlying reality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; F) The descriptive mathematics of an underlying reality is NOT the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; underlying reality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; E &amp; F are merely ABOUT the underlying reality and joined at the hip
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by(mutually constrained to be compatible with) demands of provision
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; phenomenal consciousness to humans.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Which leads me to another implication:  E &amp; F are not even unique!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Zork the alph-centaurian smake-trouf scientist who looks like a hologram
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of orange smoke-rings has a completely different set of phenomenal fields
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (say perceiving gravitons and neutrinos directly) and would have a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; completely different E' and F' say, respectively. But both E, E', F and F'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would be equally predictive of the natural world (and produce identical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; technology). When mapped through the respective physics of phenomenality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the practical effect is identical prediction and identical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understanding/knowledge. Uniqueness in laws of nature is gone.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We humans seriously need to 'get over ourselves' as scientists.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Do you see how screwed up the system is?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Cheers
