<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thanks, Colin,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I feel we also agree in your last sentence statement, however I could
</em><br />
not
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; decide whether &quot;abstraction&quot; is reductionist model forming or a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generalization into wider horizons? Patterns - I feel - are  IMO
</em><br />
definitely reductive.
<br />
<br />Abstraction I would characterise as a mapping into a representational
<br />
domain. As to the level of reduction, that would depend on the domain of
<br />
symbols and their mapping to the mapped domain. The questions to ask
<br />
yourself are:
<br />
a) Who decides what the lowest level domain is to be?
<br />
b) What do you lose when you choose?
<br />
<br />Let's look at abstracting a whole human:
<br />
<br />a-1) Say we 100% abstract a human down to a representation of cells. Cells
<br />
would be the base level descriptive domain. Organs would be data patterns
<br />
that the cells express under the rules of the abstraction. And so on. You
<br />
are not letting the natural rules run. You are merely moving symbols
<br />
around. No matter how powerful the computer and how detailed (lowest level
<br />
domain) the abstraction is just the computer's representation of the
<br />
symbols being moved around.
<br />
<br />a) If you build a squillion little computers, each to act 'as-if' they
<br />
were the, say, the cell level of the abstraction with a little physical
<br />
interface that meant it was just like a cell from the outside, then you
<br />
have reinstated some level of the natural world's involvement...the
<br />
resulting human may be indistinguiishable from a human. Organs are an
<br />
emergent property of these collaborating 'Turing Cells'.
<br />
<br />b) Then again, if you reduced the abstraction level to build tiny
<br />
computers that become substitute molecules, so to all intents they looked
<br />
like molecules...the human would look the same. Cells are an emergent
<br />
property of collaborations of these 'Turing Molecules'. (please ignore the
<br />
need for fluids and food etc in this body for the moment!)
<br />
<br />If you inspected the human a-1) at the molecular level all you see is a
<br />
computer playing with patterns depending on the chosen abstraction domain.
<br />
<br />If you inspected human a) at the molecular level you would see only the
<br />
computer that runs cells, but the cells would look normal. There are no
<br />
human molecules here, only the molecules of the computers inside the
<br />
cells.
<br />
<br />If you inspected human b) at the molecular level you would see what
<br />
appears to be real molecules. The cells would look normal. However, look
<br />
for atoms and you won't find any.
<br />
<br />Q. What is it like to be human a-1) cf a) cf  b) and how well does each
<br />
human operate cognitively?
<br />
<br />You could extend the argument to simulated Turing-quarks and
<br />
Turing-leptons... and so on... at some point the human would acquire
<br />
consciousness. What level of Turing-granularity is that?
<br />
<br />My answer to this would be probably waaaaaay down deep below where the
<br />
matter and the space differentiate their behaviour. We have no
<br />
justification that any one level of organisation is an end-point.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that scale-game (40-50 orders of m. down) seems to me valid within the
</em><br />
physical explanatory equationalized circumstances - so I scrutinize it
<br />
(accept it within physics-thinking). It does not refer to 'time'
<br />
(whichever
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you prefer). I had the notion that there 'is' only &quot;change&quot; ie. movement
</em><br />
and
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; space is a time-coordinate of it, while time is a space-coordinate of
</em><br />
it,
<br />
<br />Change as a structural primitive is quite workable. Imagine being human
<br />
shaped water in one place in a waterfall... i.e. regular structure within
<br />
change. At any instant there is a human, but the water is flowing, so the
<br />
componentry of the human is dynamically refreshed. Think of &quot;humanity&quot;.
<br />
Humanity survives where all the humans in it don't. Same thing at all
<br />
scales.
<br />
<br />An infinity of potential collaborations of that one tiny change primitive
<br />
that have a net value of &quot;1 change primitive&quot; can be substituted for any
<br />
other change primitive. This recursiveness is the basis of a
<br />
calculus/logic.
<br />
<br />In this system time results merely from the state of the collaboration
<br />
undergoing a transition as the change primitive does what it does (eg
<br />
changes from state A to B then back to A). There's not such thing as time
<br />
in this structure. If the state changes happen at a regular enough rate
<br />
then equations with a &quot;t&quot; in it are possible as descriptors. The universe
<br />
acts 'as-if' there was time. If you are made of a pile of these changes
<br />
then, if there was an
<br />
observation faculty, all you would see is the collaboration evolving
<br />
according to the rules of the structural primitives. You would need to
<br />
&quot;see&quot; only the structural regularity, not the change primitives.
<br />
<br />In the waterfall metaphor, two humans as regularity in this waterfall
<br />
would not see any water. They would see only each other and the space in
<br />
between. This is nature of
<br />
<br />In this structural domain these things are really simple.
<br />
<br />Also: If you take a slice _across_ this structure around the level of
<br />
atoms, photons etc and devise mathematical descriptions for the behaviour
<br />
of identified structures you get quantum mechanics. QM says absolutely
<br />
nothing about 'what it is that is behaving quantum mechanically.
<br />
<br />There is nothing there but the one single change primitive. Call it X.
<br />
Everything is merely organisations of X. Stare at a human and all you are
<br />
staring at is X. There are no 'things' atoms. The atoms are all X behaving
<br />
like atoms.
<br />
<br />That is where I would take you idea of change.
<br />
<br />You can relate this directly to the 'Turing-granulation' discussion above
<br />
easily enough.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; long as we think in terrestrially (not even of THIS universe) formed
</em><br />
explanations of those figments we conclude upon the latestly primitive
<br />
instrumental observations in our reductionist science domain.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Matter and its 'behavior' is similarly 'concluded' to reflect the
</em><br />
'personal'
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiencing of the unknown effects.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am deterred by the semantic direction of 'computing'. If it is Bruno's
</em><br />
manipulation of ordinary numbers, I feel OK, but then I feel domains of
<br />
incompetence. Your &quot;as-if&quot;  changes that and I felt lost. Why use a word
<br />
with 'other' meaning 'as - if'? It is a cheap excuse that we have no
<br />
better
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one &lt;G&gt;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sorry for just &quot;multiplying the words&quot; in this exchange.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  John M
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />I'm having trouble following your issue. My background is one of a huge
<br />
involvement in software and computers from the very highest to the very
<br />
lowest levels. There's nothing like building basic aritmetic out of logic
<br />
gates to get you understanding what is going on!
<br />
<br />I find it easy to see that none of the mathematical domains we define,
<br />
including the natural numbers, are ever actually reified in computing.
<br />
Take a variable X that is supposed to represent a quanity. There is a
<br />
memory location where some electrons are thrown in pattern of electron
<br />
buckets that by our agreed convention encodes the quantity as a binary
<br />
representation. We then have another pointer called X that says where the
<br />
buckets are.
<br />
<br />We write progams to manipulate the electron buckets. The pattern in the
<br />
electron buckets acts 'as-if' or stands for a real platonic 'thing' that
<br />
is intrinscally a quanitiy X. I find it impossible to imagine this
<br />
platonic object that is intrinsically &quot;X_quantityness&quot;. What I do know for
<br />
sure is that nowhere in the computer is this platonic &quot;thing&quot;. All there
<br />
is are electron buckets going through a pattern contrived to behave in the
<br />
same way as the platonic object would if it existed.
<br />
<br />Not sure if that helps... but the idea of abstractions being 'as-if'
<br />
representations seems a useful way of grounding ourselves.. to beware that
<br />
the so-called reality we are part of is implemented in a domain unlike any
<br />
we currently explore, and that it is validly considered to be computation,
<br />
it's just that the computation is very different.
<br />
<br />Not sure if that helps... but... well it was fun to write!
<br />
<br />cheers
