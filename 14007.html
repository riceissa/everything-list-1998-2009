<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What remains unclear in this definition is the term &quot;reference class&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which is also the source of the ASSA/RSSA debate. When we want to know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which observer moment to expect &quot;next&quot;, we look at the class of all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer moments provided with a measure. The ASSA applies a uniform
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure over all observer moments, whereas supporters of the RSSA may
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for example apply the Born rule to the class of observer moments given
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by quantum theory. That's an outline of how I understand it.
</em><br />
<br />One of the main issues of contention where the ASSA/RSSA distinction
<br />
has come up on this list is quantum immortality. In the situation
<br />
where your measure in the multiverse will plummet in the next moment
<br />
as the result of some disaster which will from a third person
<br />
perspective almost certainly kill you, ASSA proponents say that from a
<br />
first person perspective too you will almost certainly die, while RSSA
<br />
proponents say that from a first person perspective you will certainly
<br />
survive. The way the problem is stated - what will I experience in the
<br />
next moment? - sets the reference class: those moments of conscious
<br />
experience which could qualify as my &quot;next moment&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have serious problems with this kind of reasoning. It suggests the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; misleading idea of some entity (let's call it the &quot;self&quot;) jumping from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one observer moment to the next. In general, this is a very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; questionable concept, of course. I feel satisfied with the idea that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the observer moments don't come up with a measure by themselves and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that nothing at all is jumping.
</em><br />
<br />Nothing at all is jumping, but it feels as if something is jumping.
<br />
Continuity of consciousness may be an illusion, but it's an illusion
<br />
that people generally wish to continue.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; We will introduce measures for practical reasons depending on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem we are concerned with. The same holds for the study of chains
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of observer moments. In each case, I will find it useful to introduce
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different concepts that will show resemblance to the ASSA or RSSA.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1st problem: &quot;What will I experience next?&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I refused the idea of the 'self' being an entity jumping between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer moments. So the word &quot;I&quot; does not refer to something fixed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is a vague perception of self-identification (e.g. to be Youness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ayaita) that is part of the current observer moment. If we consider
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the evolution of the observer from a third person perspective (within
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our world and its usual dynamics), then we will see how the observer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; changes with time. Though, as far as his capacity for remembering did
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not disappear, the observer will still find within himself the old
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-identification. This self-identification makes the observer have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the feeling that his identity is something constant which is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; preserved. This feeling gives a meaningful understanding of the word
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;I&quot; in the question of interest. By the word &quot;I&quot; the question
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; restricts the class of observer moments to those who share the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mentioned self-identification, e.g. to be Youness Ayaita. This class
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probably consists for the most part of observers that other observers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would identify as Youness Ayaita, too.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The word &quot;next&quot; (despite of the fact that it makes only sense in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; worlds with time) leads to a further restriction to the class of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer moments: The observer moment to choose must include the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; memory that the last experience was to ask the question: &quot;What will I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience next?&quot; The small subclass we have now typically corresponds
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to what we would expect from quantum theory. The measure that comes up
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with it corresponds to the Born rule.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Nonetheless, the Born rule is not of general applicability here. For
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; example, if the observer falls into coma and wakes up some years later
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or if he is frozen for some time in some futuristic machine, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer moments waking up at a later time must have a nonzero measure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as well. On the contrary, if the observer experiences a dangerous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; accident losing his capacity for remembering, the observer moment
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; after the accident has a zero measure for the question of interest.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To summarize, we see that a specific question leads to a specific
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure. In this case, we get a result usually assigned to the RSSA.
</em><br />
<br />Right!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2nd problem: Having had an accident that led to the loss of his
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; capacity for remembering, an observer asks himself (before noticing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; his environment): &quot;Who am I?&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In this case, the self-identification process failed. Thus, the word
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;I&quot; cannot be refered to a self-identification but rather to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; identification by other observers. The class of observer moments of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interest is restricted: We are only interested in conscious observers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that don't have a self-identification process. Thus, in worlds similar
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to ours we would assign a non-zero measure to all observer moments
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; waking up after such an accident or having lost their capability of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-identification due to some kind of mental illness. This measure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has nothing in common with the quantum mechanical Born rule.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ----
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So, I don't see any need for some kind of fundamental measure for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer moments. Whenever we have a restriction defining a subclass
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of observer moments that are of interest, we are naturally driven to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the RSSA and to a specific measure. If we have no restriction, then we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assign equal measure to all observer moments leading to the ASSA. I do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not see the categorical difference between the two concepts. Can you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; make clear where the difference lies?
</em><br />
<br />I think this puts you in the RSSA camp. ASSA proponents (as I
<br />
understand them) would consider all observer moments even where the
<br />
problem at issue would seem to restrict the reference class.
