Hi Godfrey,
<br />
<br />Le 10-août-05, à 21:27, kurtleegod.domain.name.hidden a écrit :
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hi Everythingers,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Though I am new to the list I have been reading your fascinating posts 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on this troubling issue of &quot;reality&quot; and subjectivity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so please pardon if I skip the protocol and delve into the discussion 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; right away.  I have a background in computer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and  cognitive science if you want to know,  but little chance to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; engage in exchanges on philosophical matters
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such as the ones in which you guys are involved in.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I don't think there is a clear-cut frontier between Science and 
<br />
Philosophy, except those artificial frontiers introduced by academic 
<br />
for &quot;financial purposes&quot; (to be short).
<br />
Actually I don't believe there are scientific field and non scientific 
<br />
field. I believe in scientific attitudes, which is a mixture of modesty 
<br />
and willingness to share questions with other.
<br />
Scientists who pretends not doing philosophy are just taking some 
<br />
philosophy for granted, like the naturalist assumptions of Aristotle.
<br />
And in ALL fields, passion and emotion *can* mislead our scientific 
<br />
attitude. This is human, and even *machine*.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Forgive me if I misunderstand some of the finer details (yes I know,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the devil is there...) Bruno says:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  But I am not using the word &quot;reality&quot; to *describe* one's subjective 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; impression, it seems to me I am just acknowledging the existence of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; those subjective impression in many persons.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  To acknowledge something is to admit that something has some kind of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;reality&quot;, it seems to me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  And it seems you did acknowledge those experiences too). To describe 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them, in the limit, I can only point you to great poets and artists, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and they will hardly mention the word &quot;reality&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [GK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, astists will probably argue that they are quite concerned with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality in their own way. You don't want to confuse your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subjective impressions (qualia) with the fact that you have them or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; report them. The later are the subject of scientific inquiry while the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; former may not qualify. Scientific Reality is definitely more specific 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than reality in general.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />But scientific &quot;reality&quot; is not bounded. The shape of earth was a 
<br />
matter of philosophy and theology at some time. My personal qualia and 
<br />
first person views cannot be used in a scientific paper, of course. But 
<br />
qualia and first person view can be addressed in third person way. For 
<br />
this we build theories, which are just hypothetical world view 
<br />
constructions.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  There is also much that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one can aknowledge without admiting to its reality. I have heard of, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; say, alien abductions but would not swear to their reality,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; though others may differ.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />This is just ignorance. Science is *the* most efficacious way to accept 
<br />
that we are ignorant.
<br />
It is the motor of science. If you have a scientific interest in alien 
<br />
abduction you can always search for a piece of unknown metal, or for 
<br />
tackling the plausibility problem of the account. Etc. As I mentionned 
<br />
before one of my favorite text to illustrate what is the scientific 
<br />
attitude is given in a book of parapsychology (the &quot;In search of the 
<br />
light' by S. Blackmore). Of course the whishfull thinkers in 
<br />
parapsychology doesn't like it because it is negative (She shows the 
<br />
protocol errors in most parapsychologists experiments).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [BM]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  You just seems to want those experiences are just an unnecessary 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; epiphenomenon, and you would like that science never adresses what 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they really are and where they came from.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  For you it looks like &quot;consciousness&quot; is just a sort of subjective 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mirror partially reflecting an objective third person describable 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality in which we are embedded. And science should never leave the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; third person discourse. All right?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Now, please understand that I agree (100%) with the last sentences: 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; science should never leave the third person discourse.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  But this does not prohibit science of looking to herself, and to try 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theories (hypotheses) about third person discourses, and even to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *discover* sort of first person discourse canonically associated to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some mathematical object.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  By taking the comp hyp enough seriously it just happens that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;consciousness&quot;, or just the &quot;ability to guess the existence of one 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (at least) world&quot; is not a little detail. Or it is a little detail but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then remember that the devil is hidden in the little details. Why? 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Because if I am correct in my derivation it makes the physical law 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emerging from number theory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [GK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would argue that numbers are rather objective, perhaps even more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than physical laws and surely so if you are right, no?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Yes. I find personally that the fact that 17 is prime is less doubtful 
<br />
than any third person materialist ontological commitment. But I am 
<br />
perhaps wrong and I don't really care. As a logician I am mainly 
<br />
interested in the consistency of sets of beliefs, and validity of 
<br />
arguments. My point is that materialism and digital mechanism (comp) 
<br />
are just incompatible.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If that derivation is just a piece of your subjectivity that may dash 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your hopes to convey it to others...
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />By derivation I really mean &quot;demonstration&quot;. It is valid for anyone 
<br />
(accepting classical logic applies on the elementary arithmetical 
<br />
truth). Sorry if this looks contemptuous.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is also an &quot;animal&quot; called *self-delusion* that inhabits this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; realm between the subjective and the objective and amounts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to taking for real what isn't quite so.  But why bring it into this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; already confusing and confused exchanged.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [LC]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; So you say. And I confess I haven't the energy (and probably not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the preparation) to study your thesis. So I'll wait for the experts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to acclaim you. No one will cheer louder: &quot;I knew him *before*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the world saw the truth to COMP! He even knows who I am!&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [BM]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  My heart appreciates very much. My poor brain, or some reasoner who 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appears to succeed to manifest himself through it, relatively to you, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is a little bit astonished: you are amazingly honest and confess you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could give a weight to authoritative argument. Ah la la.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I think it would be better to get the understanding by yourself, then 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you could say &quot; I thought it&quot;, but perhaps you do get some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understanding, I think :-)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Actually my work is &quot;the work&quot; which people should understand by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; themselves, if only to understand the second part where they must 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand that machine can understand it by themselves, in some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; precise sense.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  You could also be disappointed. Although the conclusion is startling, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; technically my contribution is modest and leads quickly to soluble but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intractable questions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  A paper entitled &quot;Theoretical Computer Science and the Natural 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sciences&quot; should appear soon, though.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [GK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Oh, it seems you agree than!  &quot;The Work&quot; goes well with your 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theological inclinations,  seems to me though I am as hopeless
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about understandiing it as Lee is...
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />OK. This means you are serious like Lee. I certainly don't expect 
<br />
people to understand it quickly!  The people in this list does not know 
<br />
(I think) that they are one century in advance!
<br />
(and then they doesn't know I'm two centuries in advance ;-)
<br />
(Don't infer I'm some sort of genius: it is just years and years and 
<br />
years of work + open mindedness).
<br />
Anyway, the matter subject is not so easy. It crosses many hard fields, 
<br />
and leads to many hard to swallow conclusions. Bohr said that if you 
<br />
understand quantum mechanics, it means you are missing something. The 
<br />
comp hyp is like that. The more you understand the more you realize 
<br />
truth is beyond fiction. Now, feel free to read my argumentation and 
<br />
ask question if you are interested.
<br />
My point (and I want to be short but some people in the list get 
<br />
similar points, even if when we discuss it between us we insist on the 
<br />
differences of course), so my point is just that if we make the comp 
<br />
hypothesis in the cognitive science (including some amount of 
<br />
mathematical platonism, and Church thesis), then, literally, physics 
<br />
*is* a branch of computer science. And so the comp hyp is testable: 
<br />
derive physics from computer science and compare it to empirical 
<br />
physics. I have done a piece of that, and currently comp passed already 
<br />
non trivial tests.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [LC]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; My friends and I (and probably Daniel Dennett and so on) believe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that people who demand a 1st person &quot;account of the world&quot; (e.g.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Chalmers) will never get anywhere.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [BM]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Actually, this is one of the main point where I differ from George 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Levy (OK George?), although I could make sense of it. The point is, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and Dennett agrees on this, that, in cognitive *science*, we need to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; develop some third person discourse on the first person discourses.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  OK, strictly speaking the quantum and physical discourses appears at 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some first person (plural) level.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Chalmers is not getting anywhere(*), ok. Perhaps we agree on this.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [GK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dennett might have evolved in his position but the whole effort behind 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cognitive science has long been that of &quot;unpacking&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the notion of &quot;qualia&quot; out of the philosophical discourse. But that is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hardly the same as explaining the 1st person discourse in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3rd person language.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Indeed.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Explaining what elation or sadness correspond to in terms of neural 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; processes does not help me find
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; out why I am elated today and sad tomorrow. Usually those experience 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are much easier to explain and  in objective terms.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I'm not sure I understand. I think no &quot;experiences&quot; can be easily 
<br />
explained in 3-person terms.
<br />
remember that if comp and my derivation is correct, eventually the very 
<br />
brain itself emerges from first person experiences (and here I agree 
<br />
with George Levy).
<br />
Now, (and here George Levy disagrees), first person experiences emerges 
<br />
from third person sharable relation between numbers. Please, take this 
<br />
with some grain of salt until you have your personal evidence for a  
<br />
plausible explanation of what I am saying here.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [BM]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  (*) Using Everett to defend dualism! See the quite good explanation 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; how Everett is deeply monist in the book:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  PRIMAS H., 1981, Chemistry, Quantum Mechanics and Reductionism, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Springer-Verlag, Berlin (second, corrected edition : 1983)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; That the &quot;hard problem&quot; or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; whatever is just a horrible consequence of the way sense impressions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; traveling on neurons give rise to people thinking that their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; own perceptions are a sort of reality independent of the physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; reality. We think that this is a sort of delusion, although the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; very #?!&amp;$-AT_SYMBOL-! structure of our language hideously leads from that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to &quot;who or what is being deluded?&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mmhh....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This might be a good time to ask what is meant by that word you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; just used. Hal explained &quot;computationalist hypothesis&quot; as used
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; by philosophers, e.g., that a robot (that was just CPU driven)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; could be conscious.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Actually this is the strong AI thesis. Logically comp is stronger, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because comp is the thesis that &quot;I&quot; am a machine (I, You, ...). Comp 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is stronger because the fact that machine could think does not entails 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that only machine could think! (despite Occam!).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Now comp is weaker than most functionalism in the philosophy of mind, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because comp asserts only the existence of a level of substitution at 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which we are Turing-emulable. Functionalist reason like if the level 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was known, but that's impossible.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; have believed that since 1966 when I used
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to argue about it with people in high school. *Lots* of people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; believe that. I have taken &quot;COMP&quot; to be Bruno's Thesis, in which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; practically everything can be derived fundamentally from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; integers alone, using Gödel's results, and other rather recently
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; discovered truths.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  No no. That's the theorem. Comp is precisely the conjonction of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Church Thesis, of some amount of belief in arithmetic, + the act of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; faith saying &quot;yes&quot; to *some* digitalist surgeon.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; All what I say, I derive it (hopefully correctly) from comp.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  It is also different from Schmidhuber (and many others) who makes the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thesis that there is a &quot;physical universe&quot; and that it is computable 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (programmable). I think that comp is quasi-incompatible with this.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [GK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Quasi-incompatible, indeed!  Thanks for clearing this out. It is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understandable why you need a 1st person belief statement
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if your hypothesis is that You (Bruno) are a machine. I will grant you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that straight away, as it occurred to me already while
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; noticing that most of your interventions &quot;loop&quot; around that COMP 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thing. You, Bruno Machinal are a machine!
</em><br />
<br /><br />Pun or lapsus? I could have define comp by saying that human are

machine. I prefer say &quot;I&quot;, because comp can justified why, if true, it 
<br />
is not provable (like the consistency statement in Godel's second 
<br />
incompleteness theorem). Need some act of faith.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I will even grant
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you that I am a machine and will say &quot;yes&quot; to your digitalist, if he 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hasn't replaced all my parts yet.  But let me ask you: doesn't 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everybody have to believe you for your hypothesis to be true? And if 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everyone does so, doesn't it automatically cease to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be an hypothesis and become the universal religion of happy machines?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mmmmmh!
</em><br />
<br /><br />All what I say is that if me, you or X says &quot;yes&quot; to the mechanist 
<br />
doctor, then &quot;the universal religion of machine&quot; are given by a 
<br />
mathematical theory which is testable because, as a religious theology, 
<br />
it provided a 100% precise cosmogony. If from comp you deduce that 
<br />
electron have no weight, then comp is refuted. That could be 
<br />
problematical in case you have already say &quot;yes&quot; to the doctor!

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; So I dismiss the 1st person, remarking that it's &quot;existence&quot; is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; but only to be expected. If an ape or a parrot could talk, it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; could yak on about it's impressions. And they'd be of little
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; but therapeutic value.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Thanks for acknowledging the therapy! With comp, this would mean the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appearance of the physical world originates in some intrinsic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universal machine self-therapy. It makes sense...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I must go now. Apology for not having respected the order of your 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; paragraphs, but my computer take some initiative apparently!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Best regards,

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Funny, mine just did the same!!! It erased something about Bip Bip or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some such thing. Oh well...  It  may just need some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; good self-therapy. God knows what will come out of that...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Best wishes with ... &quot;the Work&quot;,
</em><br />
<br /><br />Many thanks. &quot;the works&quot;, as you say, is divided into two parts. An 
<br />
informal, but (hopefully) rigorous and complete, argument showing that 
<br />
physics is derivable from comp. That argument is not constructive. Its 
<br />
easyness comes from the fact that it does not really explained how to 
<br />
make the derivation. The second part is a translation of that argument 
<br />
in the language of  the &quot;universal machine itself&quot;. This, by the 
<br />
constraints of theoretical ccomputer science, makes the proof 
<br />
constructive, so that it gives the complete derivation of physics from 
<br />
computer science. Of course God is a little malicious, apparently, and 
<br />
we are led to hard intractable purely mathematical questions.
<br />
<br />You are welcome,
<br />
<br />Bruno
