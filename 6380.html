<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; At best it allows the possibility that the bit strings could be

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; implemented. You see the problem is that it is impossible to derive 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Change or &quot;Becoming&quot; from Being. Think of this in terms of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; thermodynamics, if we assume a universe that is in perfect equilibrium 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; there will never be any possibility of a deviation from such equilibrium 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; unless we introduce some mechanism to &quot;disturb&quot; it. If we use the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; mechanism of a &quot;quantum fluctuation&quot; then we are forced to introduce some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; kind of &quot;potential to change&quot; into a structure that by definition has 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; none.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;    This has long been a problem for thinkers trying to understand the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; notion of Time. Unless we assume some form of change or Becoming as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; existing a priori to time and that out notion of Time is a &quot;local&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; measure of change, we are forced to construct ideas where we ask 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; questions like how fast is a second. We end up with a Time_ 1 to measure 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the rate of change that is somehow different from the usual time (Time_0) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and this, in turn, would have to have a Time_2 and thus a Time_3, etc.- 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; an infinite number of times, each to measure the rate of change of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; one below it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why do you need to believe that there is any &quot;change&quot; at the ultimate 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; level at all?
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honestly I have not problem at all with the idea that at the &quot;Ultimate&quot; 
<br />
level of existence any notion of a measure of change, i.e., time, vanishes. 
<br />
It is then we consider that there is no differentiation that occurs over the 
<br />
continuum between that Ultimate level and the Physical level that I am 
<br />
trying to speak.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The idea of &quot;block time&quot; has always seemed plausible to me, where events 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the future and past (or various parallel futures and pasts, from a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multiverse point of view) are just as real as events at other spatial 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; locations in a single moment (and relativity suggests that there is no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unique definition of the 'present moment' anyway). This point of view is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discussed in a nice article from Scientific American by physicist Paul 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Davies:

<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problems that I have with the &quot;block time&quot; idea are exactly the same 
<br />
as the problem that I have with COMP, that a pre-specified orchestration or 
<br />
harmony, as Leibniz proposed in his Monadology, exists that is both 
<br />
necessary and sufficient to explain the inescapable &quot;flow&quot; that we 
<br />
experience. Any kind of pre-specification, especially of a world as complex 
<br />
as the one we experience, requires the solution of some problems know to 
<br />
exist in the computational complexity class named NP-Complete. These kinds 
<br />
of problem as such that even if P=NP is true the computations must be run 
<br />
for a polynomial number of steps.  Where does the notion of &quot;running a 
<br />
polynomial number of steps&quot; occur in a realm that is Timeless Being? Well, 
<br />
let's try something...
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.claymath.org/millennium/P_vs_NP/Official_Problem_Description.pdf">http://www.claymath.org/millennium/P_vs_NP/Official_Problem_Description.pdf</a>
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea that &quot;solutions&quot; exists to these problems as Platonic forms in 
<br />
itself does nothing to address how these solutions are communicated. Do you 
<br />
recall that Plato himself had to invent the notion of &quot;noesis&quot; to give a 
<br />
name to the idea that somehow, by some mysterious means, our finite and 
<br />
imperfect minds somehow could connect to the Perfect and Timeless Forms.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://home.uchicago.edu/~wwtx/plato.pdf">http://home.uchicago.edu/~wwtx/plato.pdf</a>
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if it could be shown that there is a coherent and consistent way 
<br />
that &quot;noesis&quot; can occur, much like Sir Roger would have us believe, I would 
<br />
be very happy since I like the idea very much, but I will not pretend that I 
<br />
have some kind of difficult to explain &quot;logic system&quot; that &quot;proves&quot; that it 
<br />
exists. I find this idea equivalent to some the notion of &quot;action at a 
<br />
distance&quot; ... I will stop ranting now. ;-)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have tried to explain the problem of &quot;block time&quot; in several posts, 
<br />
here on the Everything-list and on the F.o.R. list, the idea of block-time 
<br />
simply ignores the fact that a &quot;block space-time&quot; - the notion from which 
<br />
&quot;block time&quot; is derived - required that at least the initial or the final 
<br />
boundary of such a &quot;block&quot; have associated with it definite physical 
<br />
quantities, such as the positions, momenta, spin, charge, color, etc. We 
<br />
know from QM that this idea simple does not stand up to empirical evidence. 
<br />
It is, at best, a fantasy and as such we should not ever find our selves 
<br />
having to use it to justify reasonings when even a casual reader of a 
<br />
laymen's book on physics knows better.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am familiar with Davies' ideas, I have read every one of his books and 
<br />
found them self-aggrandizing and lacking in original content. For one thing, 
<br />
his statement &quot;Nothing in known physics corresponds to the passage of time.&quot; 
<br />
really bothers me; who among us believe that the &quot;known physics&quot; is complete 
<br />
and omniscient? We still do not have a good and predictively falsifiable 
<br />
quantum gravity theory published!
<br />
<br />Kindest regards,
<br />
<br />Stephen
