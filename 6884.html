<br />
Russell Standish recently mentioned his paper &quot;Why Occam's Razor&quot; which
<br />
can be found at <a href="http://parallel.hpc.unsw.edu.au/rks/docs/occam/">http://parallel.hpc.unsw.edu.au/rks/docs/occam/</a> .  Among
<br />
other things he aims to derive quantum mechanics from a Schmidhuber type
<br />
ensemble.  I have tried to read this paper but never really understood it.
<br />
Here I will try to ask some questions, taking it slowly.
<br />
<br />On this page, <a href="http://parallel.hpc.unsw.edu.au/rks/docs/occam/node2.html">http://parallel.hpc.unsw.edu.au/rks/docs/occam/node2.html</a> ,
<br />
things get started.  Russell describes a set of infinite bit strings he
<br />
calls &quot;descriptions&quot;.  He writes:
<br />
<br />&quot;By contrast to Schmidhuber, I assume a uniform measure over these
<br />
descriptions -- no particular string is more likely than any other.&quot;
<br />
<br />This surprises me.  I thought that Schmidhuber assumed a uniform measure
<br />
over bit strings considered as programs for his universal computer.  So
<br />
what is the &quot;contrast&quot; to his work?
<br />
<br />It seems that the greater contrast is that while Schmidhuber assumed that
<br />
the bit strings would be fed into a computer that would produce outputs,
<br />
Russell is taking the bit strings directly as raw data.
<br />
<br />But I am confused about their role.
<br />
<br />&quot;Since some of these descriptions describe self aware substructures...&quot;
<br />
<br />Whoa!  This is a big leap for me.  First, I am not too happy that mere bit
<br />
strings have been elevated with the title &quot;descriptions&quot;.  A bit string on
<br />
its own doesn't seem to have the inherent meaning necessary for it to be
<br />
considered a description.  And now we find not only that the bit string is
<br />
a description, but it is a complex enough description to describe SAS's?
<br />
How does that work?
<br />
<br />It's especially confusing to read the introductory word &quot;since&quot; as though
<br />
this is all quite obvious and need not be explained.  To me it is very
<br />
confusing.
<br />
<br />The page goes on to identify these SAS's as observers.  Now they are mappings,
<br />
or equivalently Turing Machines, which map finite bit strings to integers.
<br />
These integers are the &quot;meanings&quot; of the bit strings.
<br />
<br />I believe the idea here is that the bit strings are taken as prefixes
<br />
of the &quot;description&quot; bit strings in the ensemble.  It is as though the
<br />
&quot;observers&quot; are observing the &quot;descriptions&quot; a bit at a time, and mapping
<br />
them to a sequence of integer &quot;meanings&quot;.  Is that correct?
<br />
<br />So here is another confusion about the role of the &quot;description&quot; bit
<br />
strings in the model.  Are they things that &quot;observer&quot; TM's observe and
<br />
map to integers?  Or are they places where observers live, as suggested
<br />
by the &quot;Since&quot; line quoted above?  Or both?
<br />
<br />Now it gets a little more complicated: &quot;Under the mapping O(x), some
<br />
descriptions encode for identical meanings as other descriptions, so
<br />
one should equivalence class the descriptions.&quot;
<br />
<br />The problem I have is, O takes only finite bit strings.  So technically
<br />
a &quot;description&quot;, which is an infinite bit string, does not encode a
<br />
meaning.  What I think is meant here, though, is that two &quot;descriptions&quot;
<br />
(i.e. infinite bit strings) will be considered equivalent if for every
<br />
finite prefix of the strings, the O() mapping is the same.  So if we
<br />
think of O as &quot;observing&quot; the &quot;description&quot; bit strings one by one,
<br />
it will go through precisely the same sequence of integer &quot;meanings&quot;
<br />
in each case.  Is that right?
<br />
<br />&quot;In particular, strings where the bits after some bit number n are
<br />
``don't care'' bits, are in fact equivalence classes of all strings that
<br />
share the first n bits in common.&quot;
<br />
<br />I think what this considers is a special O() and a special string prefix
<br />
such that if O sees that particular n-bit prefix, all extensions of
<br />
that prefix get mapped to the same &quot;meaning&quot; integer.  In that case the
<br />
condition described in my previous paragraph would be met, and all
<br />
strings with this n-bit prefix would be equivalent.
<br />
<br />&quot;One can see that the size of the equivalence class drops off
<br />
exponentially with the amount of information encoded by the string.&quot;
<br />
<br />That seems a little questionable because the size of the equivalence class
<br />
is infinite in all cases.  However I think Russell means to use a uniform
<br />
measure where the collection of all strings with a particular n-bit
<br />
prefix have a measure of 1/2^n.  It's not clear how well this measure
<br />
really works or whether it applies to all sets of infinite strings.
<br />
<br />&quot;Under O(x), the amount of information is not necessarily equal to the
<br />
length of the string, as some of the bits may be redundant.&quot;
<br />
<br />Now we have this new concept of &quot;the amount of information&quot; which has
<br />
not previously been defined.  This sentence is really hard for me.
<br />
What does it mean for bits to be redundant?  We just discussed strings
<br />
where all those after bit n are &quot;don't care&quot;, but this sentence seems
<br />
to be envisioning other kinds of redundancies.
<br />
<br />&quot;The sum P_O(s) = [sum over p such that O(p)=s of] 2^(-|p|)
<br />
where |p| means the number of bits of p consumed by O in returning s,
<br />
gives the size of the equivalence class of all descriptions having
<br />
meaning s.&quot;
<br />
<br />Boy, that's a tough one now.  We consider all bit strings p such that O(p)
<br />
= s.  Now, is this supposed to just be those cases described earlier where
<br />
the bits after |p| are &quot;don't care&quot; bits?  Or is it all strings p such
<br />
that O(p) = s, including all extensions of a string where we &quot;don't care&quot;
<br />
after some point?  If the latter, it seems problematical because there
<br />
would be an uncountably infinite number of such p's.  Also I think the sum
<br />
would not converge in that case.  So I think it is probably the former.
<br />
<br />But then, what if there is a string p such that O(p)=s, but if we append
<br />
anything to p, either p+0 or p+1, then O of those strings is not s?
<br />
Does that p add to the equivalence class or not?
<br />
<br />And is it the case that for all O and for every &quot;description&quot; bit string,
<br />
there will be some prefix beyond which all the bits are &quot;don't care&quot;?
<br />
Would that follow from the finiteness of O?  If not, how do these
<br />
&quot;descriptions&quot; feed into the measure?
<br />
<br />And I'm a little concerned about the appearance of 2^(-|p|) here without
<br />
much motivation.
<br />
<br />&quot;The quantity C_O(x) = - log2( P_O( O(x) ) )
<br />
is a measure of the information content, or complexity of a description x.&quot;
<br />
<br />Now I am becoming confused about whether O() is supposed to apply
<br />
to the infinite bit strings that are &quot;descriptions&quot; or only to their
<br />
finite prefixes.  I thought it was the latter.  I don't see how a TM
<br />
can come up with a meaningful value on an infinite bit string.  It can
<br />
never read in the whole input if it is infinite in size.
<br />
<br />&quot;If only the first n bits of the string are significant, with no
<br />
redundancy, then it is easy to see C_O(x)=n.&quot;
<br />
<br />That part does make sense, if in fact the definition of P_O(s) was
<br />
only with reference to &quot;description&quot; strings which were &quot;don't care&quot;
<br />
after some number of bits.  And I think the part about &quot;no redundancy&quot;
<br />
means there are no other bit string prefixes which O maps to the same
<br />
value as it maps the n-bit prefix of x.
<br />
<br />The page then goes on to make some comments about measure applied to
<br />
universes.  Here again I am confused about how to relate it to all that
<br />
has been descibed.  What are the analogs of universes, in this model?
<br />
Is it &quot;descriptions&quot;, the infinite bit strings?  From what has been
<br />
presented so far, I don't understand how to relate our experience of
<br />
reality to this model.
<br />
<br />That's it for the first page.  Hopefully these questions will help to
<br />
show where I am getting confused.
