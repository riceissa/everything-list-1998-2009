<br /><br /><br />--------BRUNO's &quot;COMP&quot; INCLUDES ARITHMETICAL REALISM-------------
<br />
<br />BM:
<br />
<br />'The precise comp version is given by
<br />
<br />a) the &quot;yes doctor&quot; act of faith  YD
<br />
b) Church (Hypo) Thesis   CT
<br />
c) Arithmetical Realism hypothesis   AR '
<br />
<br /><br />BM:'Now, it is a fact, the failure of logicism, that you cannot define
<br />
integers
<br />
without implicitely postulating them. So Arithmetical existence is a
<br />
quasi necessary departure reality. It is big and not unifiable by any
<br />
axiomatisable theory (by Godel).
<br />
(axiomatizable theory = theory such that you can verify algorithmically
<br />
the proofs of the theorems)
<br />
I refer often to Arithmetical Realism AR; and it constitutes 1/3 of
<br />
the computationalist hypothesis, alias the comp. hyp., alias COMP:
<br />
<br />COMP = AR + CT + YD (Yes, more acronyms, sorry!)
<br />
<br />AR = Arithmetical Realism (cf also the &quot;Hardy post&quot;)
<br />
CT = Church Thesis
<br />
YD = (I propose) the &quot;Yes Doctor&quot;, It is the belief that you can be
<br />
decomposed into part such that you don't experience anything when
<br />
those parts are substituted by functionnaly equivalent digital parts.
<br />
It makes possible to give sense saying yes to a surgeon who propose
<br />
you some artificial substitution of your body. With COMP you can
<br />
justify
<br />
why this needs an irreductible act of faith (the consistency of
<br />
COMP entails the consistency of the negation of COMP, this is akin
<br />
to Godel's second incompleteness theorem.
<br />
It has nothing to do with the hypothesis that there is a physical
<br />
universe
<br />
which would be either the running or the output of a computer program.
<br />
Hal, with COMP the &quot;identity problem&quot; is tackled by the venerable old
<br />
computer science/logic approach to self-reference (with the result by
<br />
Godel,
<br />
Lob, Solovay, build on Kleene, Turing, Post etc...)'
<br />
<br /><br /><br />REALISM AND PLATONONISM
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br /><br />BM: 'Arithmetical Realism (AR). This is the assumption that
<br />
arithmetical proposition, like
<br />
''1+1=2,'' or Goldbach conjecture, or the inexistence of a
<br />
bigger prime, or the statement
<br />
that some digital machine will stop, or any Boolean formula bearing on
<br />
numbers, are
<br />
true independently of me, you, humanity, the physical universe (if that
<br />
exists), etc. '
<br />
<br />PJ: That's an epistemological claim then....
<br />
<br />BM: 'It is
<br />
a version of Platonism limited at least to arithmetical truth'.
<br />
<br />PJ: Is it ? But Platonism is an ontoligcal thesis. As a standard
<br />
reference work has it: &quot;The philosophy of Plato, or an
<br />
approach to philosophy resembling his. For  example, someone who
<br />
asserts that numbers exist  independently of the
<br />
things they number could be called a Platonist.&quot;
<br />
<br />BM: 'It should not be confused
<br />
with the much stronger Pythagorean form of AR, AR+, which asserts that
<br />
only natural
<br />
numbers exist together with their nameable relations: all the rest
<br />
being derivative from
<br />
those relations.
<br />
<br />If Pythagoreanism is stronger than Platonism in insisting that
<br />
everything is
<br />
derivable from (existing) natural numbers, is Platonism weaker than
<br />
Pythagoreanism
<br />
in insisting that everything is derivable from existing numbers of all
<br />
kinds,
<br />
natural or not? Is Platonism not being taken a s alcaim about
<br />
existinence
<br />
here, not just a claim about truth ?
<br />
<br />BM: &quot;A machine will be
<br />
said an Arithmetical Platonist if the machine believes enough
<br />
elementary
<br />
arithmetical truth (including some scheme of induction axiom).&quot;
<br />
<br />PJ: Switching back to an epistemological definition of &quot;platonism&quot;
<br />
<br /><br />BM:'Instead of linking [the pain I feel] at space-time (x,t) to
<br />
[a machine state] at space-time
<br />
(x,t), we are obliged to associate [the pain I feel at space-time
<br />
(x,t)]
<br />
to a type or a sheaf of
<br />
computations (existing forever in the arithmetical Platonia which is
<br />
accepted as existing
<br />
independently of our selves with arithmetical realism).'
<br />
<br />PJ: Another use of Realism as a thesis about existence.
<br />
<br />PJ: And if the pain-feeling &quot;you&quot; exists eternally, how do
<br />
ever *not* feel pain ? There is an ontological gulf
<br />
between tokens and types, between the temporal
<br />
and the eternal, which has been leaped over  at a bound here.
<br />
<br /><br />------------ BRUNO ADMITS TO (ONTOLOGIAL) PLATONISM -----------------
<br />
<br />BM:
<br />
<br />'Numbers are not physically real does not entails
<br />
that numbers don't exist at all, unless you define &quot;real&quot; by &quot;physical
<br />
real&quot;'.
<br />
<br />'I reduce the stable appearance of a &quot;physical universe&quot; to &quot;stable
<br />
belief&quot; by numbers, which are existing mathematically'
<br />
<br />'That is why I explicitly assume the existence of numbers, through RA
<br />
or
<br />
PA axioms when I interview the machine, or by accepting the independent
<br />
truth of arithmetical statements, like in UDA.'
<br />
<br />------------ BRUNO ADMITS TO (ONTOLOGIAL) PLATONISM (2)
<br />
-----------------
<br />
<br />PJ: But you *also* think that numbers do have some sort
<br />
of existence (even if you want to call that &quot;realism&quot; or
<br />
Plotinism, or something other than Platonism).
<br />
<br />BM: Yes. Mathematical existence.
<br />
<br />PJ: Where are these machines?
<br />
<br />BM: Where you could be, assuming comp, and no fatal
<br />
error in the UDA argumentation. I was used to call it arithmetical
<br />
platonia. Logician call it the standard model (logician sense) of PA. I
<br />
use a generalisation of that for lobian machine. Incompleteness prevent
<br />
any complete theory describing that.
<br />
BM: Where the numbers are.
<br />
<br />------------ BRUNO DENYING PLATONISM ----------------------
<br />
BM: 'I don't need to have that  &quot;2&quot; exists.
<br />
<br />In that sense I am an anti-platonist, if you want.
<br />
<br />I only need &quot;2 exists&quot;, and then it is a simple exercise to derive it
<br />
<br />from &quot;2+2 = 4&quot;:
<br />
<br />2+2 = 4
<br />
Ex(x+2 = 4 &amp; x = 2)
<br />
Ex(x=2)
<br />
<br />Or perhaps you are telling me that an anti-platonist does not accept
<br />
the quantifier introduction inference rule (from A(t) infer Ex(Ax))???
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;After all this would be coherent given that I have defined an
<br />
(arithmetical)  platonist to be just someone accepting classical logic
<br />
(in arithmetic). Lobian machine, like PA or ZF, are platonist, for
<br />
example. You can see this, in the AUDA part, as a kind of &quot;formalism&quot;
<br />
if you want. Judson Web, see the ref in my thesis&quot; makes such a case.'
<br />
<br /><br />-------------BRUNO AGNOSTIC BUT TENDING TOWARDS PLATONISM
<br />
----------------------------
<br />
<br />BM: Now, many people does take as axiom the unprovable assertion that
<br />
there
<br />
is a physical universe. I don't. I am not &quot;atheist&quot; about the universe,
<br />
but I am agnostic. I believe less in a primitive physical universe
<br />
(especially as an explanation of physics) than in more general
<br />
&quot;god-like&quot; or &quot;mathematical-like&quot; reality.
