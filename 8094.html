Johnathan writes
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; When considering possible continuations of &quot;observer-moments&quot;, one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; speaks of dividing one's measure among them such that any succeeding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer-moment has a relative proportion consistent with the quantum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; amplitude of its wave function. (Or something like that.)
</em><br />
<br />Actually, the picture you present invites one to assume that at
<br />
time t one has a definite measure (so far so good), and that this
<br />
measure must remain constant or go down for a succeeding instant
<br />
t + delta(t).  This is not the usual interpretation.  The usual
<br />
interpretation is that the runtime you get in any spacetime that
<br />
supports time t + delta(t) for you, that is, which supports &quot;you&quot;
<br />
at some time other than t, is dependent only on the structure of
<br />
that 3D universe at that time.
<br />
<br />For example, it may happen that someone's homework assignment in
<br />
the year 20,398 A.D. is to emulate a few days in the year 2005
<br />
on old Earth. The entity who completes this assignment may have
<br />
access to vastly greater compute resources than anyone who ever
<br />
before emulated days in 2005.  In this case, supposing that the
<br />
assignment is to run days September 9-11 of 2005, then your
<br />
measure may really pick up on Friday!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; My first question is: Can this go on indefinitely?  Based on my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understanding of MWI, the answer is yes, but I haven't seen this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; addressed before.
</em><br />
<br />So the answer to this is &quot;yes&quot;.  Now it may turn out, of course,
<br />
that there are constraints, hidden or otherwise.  It may be in the
<br />
cards that in almost all 3D universes, Earth gets replaced by a
<br />
Vogon bypass in 2006, and no human being (except in extremely
<br />
small measure) gets any runtime whatsoever past 2006.
<br />
<br />Another constraint may be almost all universes experience the
<br />
kind of heat death that forbids thought of any kind at some
<br />
point billions of years in the future.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Secondly, there are value-judgment arguments made here on the list about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the desirability of taking certain actions based on the anticipated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer-measure that would result from them [?]
</em><br />
<br />Yes, but they're just like the ones you take every day to stay
<br />
out of trouble!  It could be argued, for example, that by never
<br />
using a freeway exit ramp for an on-ramp, you are (i) making a
<br />
value judgment that it is better for you to stay out of fatal
<br />
car crashes altogether, and (ii) making a difference in the
<br />
amount of runtime you get (in comparison to those few worlds
<br />
in which you fail to drive safely).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But here is where my first question has implications--if &quot;measure&quot; has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some finite lower bound, then eventually, all roads lead to zero at some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point.  An observer would have a strong motivation to take actions which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; maximize one's future measure &quot;integral&quot;, to stave off this impending
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non-existence as long as possible.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, that's just how many of us look at it!  It's even a way of
<br />
explaining to folks why they should sign up for cryonics.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If, on the other hand, measure is infinitely divisible, then there will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; always be a branch that will continue.
</em><br />
<br />Oh, well, I guess I misunderstood what you meant by &quot;finite lower
<br />
bound&quot;.  It does seem that measure is infinitely divisible, because,
<br />
as David Deutsch says on p. 211 of &quot;The Fabric of Reality&quot;, the 
<br />
multiverse is a *continuum*, which is to say, technically that it
<br />
has the cardinality of the continuum, which is aleph-one. By this
<br />
it is meant that one for every real number epsilon greater than zero,
<br />
one could have that fraction of the multiverse occupied in a specific
<br />
way. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Finally, here's my second question: Does being in a &quot;low&quot; measure branch
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; somehow &quot;feel different&quot; from being in a &quot;high&quot; measure branch?  To take
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the canonical example, let's say one is next to that 20 megaton H-Bomb
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; when it detonates.  In one branch, with a very very tiny fraction of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one's current measure, one will find himself magically tunneled and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reformed somewhere away from the danger.  The expectation value of this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happening, of course is tiny, but is non-zero, so it does happen
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; somewhere in the multiverse.
</em><br />
<br />No, it doesn't &quot;feel&quot; any different having small measure than it does
<br />
having large measure, unless you happen to know that your measure has
<br />
just gone up or down, and have psychological reactions to the supposed
<br />
fact. Say that the Earth is suddenly annihilated by the Vogons, or by
<br />
a gamma-burst from some nearby star in a huge fraction of worlds. Then
<br />
as the survivors, we aren't any the wiser (at least at the present
<br />
state of astronomical knowledge).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, finding oneself, after the fact, having survived the blast by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quantum tunneling, one realizes one is in a low measure branch of his
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wave function.  But does it really matter?  If measure is infinitely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; divisible, I don't think it does.
</em><br />
<br />Well, it &quot;should&quot; matter.  I use the word both in the sense that we
<br />
ought to expect that it will matter to you, and in the sense that it
<br />
is (probably) best for you that it matter.
<br />
<br />I expect it to matter to you because that would be a smooth extension
<br />
of your normal behavior.  Evolution has crafted you to be leery of
<br />
the usual measure-reducing hazards like unsafe driving and hungry
<br />
tigers.  You tend also to feel some regret for those not so nimble
<br />
as you in running from tigers, and don't want the same fate. So if
<br />
we spruce up your usual thinking by employing evolutionary and
<br />
theoretical physics ways of speaking, then we would say that you
<br />
wish to avoid measure-reducing incidents.
<br />
<br />Also, if your life is going well (i.e. is worth living), then I contend
<br />
that for you, being alive is better than being dead. So in this way too,
<br />
you *ought* to try to keep on living.
<br />
