<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the apex of causation may be neither infinite regression

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;or&quot; termination but rather both [an &quot;and&quot;].
</em><br />
<br />I'm saying that the &quot;All&quot; is on equal ontological footing with the  
<br />
&quot;Nothing&quot;.  Pulling something out of Nothing is just as believable as  pulling 
<br />
something out of All.  I think Quentin touches on the total mystery  of both:
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as I said before I don't think/feel that single universe is on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the same level as multiverse... Just by using &quot;absurd&quot;  feeling
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I was talking about. If there is a single reality, you have  to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anwser why this one ? why like this ? what is the ultimate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reason for the reality to be limited to this subset ? If you  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; take the multiverse(everything) theory this is easily explained.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; On the other hand, multiverse theory by now could not  answer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; why you're experiencing this precise reality among all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible that are in the multiverse.
</em><br />
<br />The question &quot;Why this particular something?&quot; is just as  mysterious in the 
<br />
context of All as in the context of Nothing. The  problem is that we really 
<br />
don't realize how totally All All is.  We are  used to being able to compute 
<br />
probabilities in the context of an &quot;all&quot; that is  quantifiable.  So then it is 
<br />
tempting to extend that notion to  the All and say like Quentin's first half, &quot;If 
<br />
you take the  multiverse(everything) theory this is easily explained.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
But when we realize the total indeterminacy and contingency of this  
<br />
universe, extending down to even our first person point of view, and apparently  to 
<br />
the quantum level, then Quentin's second question is just as unanswerable in  
<br />
the context of All as in the context of Nothing.  When we realize how All  All 
<br />
is, and how complex and contingent this something is, we start eating our  own 
<br />
tail like in Hal Ruhl's argument.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Throughout the history of science, the perpetual message from the universe  
<br />
is that the sky is wider than the brain.  I'm convinced that if we all,  
<br />
including Bruno and his Lobian machine, somehow took a tour of the whole  universe 
<br />
(whatever that is), including all of it's intricacies from the smallest  to the 
<br />
largest, and the mathematical rules behind it, we would find it so  complex 
<br />
and contingent that we would be converted over to the idea that the  universe 
<br />
is far greater than anything the ANTHROpic principle dictates.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Even if you do not hold my above conviction, how can you escape the  
<br />
possibility that it is true?
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
To look at this from a different perspective, suppose there was a worm that  
<br />
lived in an apple, and the worm was super-intelligent to the point of being 
<br />
able  to grasp all of our mathematical concepts that Tegmark claims are  
<br />
sufficient to describe all of reality.  Then the worm asks, &quot;Why is it that  I'm in 
<br />
this apple?&quot;  Actually the apple is the whole of observed reality  for the 
<br />
worm, so it is equivalent to our observed universe.  However the  observABLE 
<br />
universe for the worm is the same as our observable universe.   Then the worm comes 
<br />
up with a multiverse theory along with a Wormopic  Principle, saying that the 
<br />
whole observable universe is just complex enough to  sustain the inside of an 
<br />
apple.  Surely this must be true, since the worm  can grasp all of 
<br />
mathematics?
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&quot;Explanatory power&quot; is in the eye of the beholder, and this is infinitely  
<br />
true when applied to Everything.
<br />
