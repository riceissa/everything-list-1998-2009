<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;; you might even be able to &quot;read&quot; the brain, scanning for neuronal

activity and deducing correctly that the subject sees a red flash. However, 
<br />
it is impossible to know what it feels like to see a red flash unless you 
<br />
have the actual experience yourself.
<br />
<br />So I maintain that there is this extra bit of information -subjective 
<br />
experience or qualia - that you do not automatically have even if you know 
<br />
everything about the brain to an arbitrary level of precision. Moreover, it 
<br />
cannot be derived even in theory from the laws of physics - even though, of 
<br />
course, it is totally dependent on the laws of physics, like everything else 
<br />
in the Universe.
<br />
<br /><br />I'll grant you that the subjective experience of &quot;red&quot; etc cannot be derived 
<br />
from a theory of physics.
<br />
However, by Occam's Razor we can say that the qualia that other people 
<br />
experience are the same as those that we experience.
<br />
The reasoning is as follows:
<br />
<br />The theorem that the qualia are the same is justifiable on the simple theory 
<br />
that near-identical physical brain structure and function
<br />
(amongst humans) leads to near-identical perception of the qualia of 
<br />
consciousness.
<br />
<br />What simple theory which is consistent with the rest of our scientific 
<br />
knowledge would justify that the qualia are significantly
<br />
different? Right now, in the absence of such a qualia-difference-explaining 
<br />
theory, and with a plausible and simple and
<br />
non-revolutionary and reasonable theory of qualia-sameness, a 
<br />
scientific-thinking default assumption should be qualia-sameness.
<br />
&lt;endquote&gt;
<br />
<br />I never meant to suggest that other people's subjective experiences are 
<br />
different to our own (although it is certainly logically possible, in the 
<br />
same way that solipsism is logically possible). What I am saying is that 
<br />
there is this extra piece of information needed - the nature of the 
<br />
subjective experience - if we are to claim complete understanding of the 
<br />
brain and mind. Furthermore, this extra piece of information differs from 
<br />
all the other kinds of empirical data scientists collect and analyse in that 
<br />
it cannot be understood unless the person trying to understand it has 
<br />
experienced something like it himself. Thus, a man blind from birth may be a 
<br />
world expert on the neurophysiology of human vision but know nothing about 
<br />
what it feels like to see. If you are correct and there is nothing to know 
<br />
beyond the neurophysiology, you would have to say that there is either no 
<br />
such thing as &quot;what it feels like to see&quot;, or that he doesn't understand it 
<br />
yet because he doesn't yet know enough neurophysiology!
