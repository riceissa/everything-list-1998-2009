<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (if I've understood) you are concerned to see how much can be explained

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that you are claiming they are 'true' in an exclusive sense, rather
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that they are enlightening. Is this a correct interpretation of your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; position, or is there further nuance?
</em><br />
<br /><br />As a scientist, or if you prefer as a &quot;willing to be a consistent 
<br />
scientist&quot; (you never know), I would say that *all* theories are third 
<br />
person discourses which have to be taken with an  &quot;as if&quot; proviso. Even 
<br />
the grandmother physics (with propositions like 'objects  fall', or 
<br />
'the sun rise in the morning', etc.) is like that. Even our unconscious 
<br />
theories that we have probably inherited from our ancestors are like 
<br />
that.
<br />
<br />Of course, given a theory, we can harbor doubts about it, and we can 
<br />
harbor those doubts differentially, that is more or less doubts on some 
<br />
part of it.
<br />
<br />&quot;My&quot; theory is a digital version of the very old mechanist theory, 
<br />
saying that we are sort of natural machine. It is already explained by 
<br />
Nagarjuna in the &quot;Milinda's Questions&quot; for example, or by Plato in some 
<br />
place, and it has been developed by Descartes concerning animals (and 
<br />
perhaps concerning humans too in some hidden way, if you take the 
<br />
context of Descartes epoch).
<br />
<br />I make that digital version more precise so as to be able to drive 
<br />
precise conclusions. I have called in this list that more precise 
<br />
version: COMP (but I called it digital mechanism in some places). Note 
<br />
that what you call &quot;number theology&quot;  belongs to the conclusion of comp 
<br />
(I don't assume it).
<br />
The precise comp version is given by
<br />
<br />a) the &quot;yes doctor&quot; act of faith  YD
<br />
b) Church (Hypo) Thesis   CT
<br />
c) Arithmetical Realism hypothesis   AR
<br />
<br />Now I can imagine &quot;a)&quot; to be false. In three ways actually: For example 
<br />
I say yes to the doctor but the digital reconstitution of me remains 
<br />
inanimate, or, I say yes to the doctor, and the digital reconstitution 
<br />
is a zombie, or I say yes to the doctor, and the reconstitution is 
<br />
alive but is not me. This I can logically conceived, and that would 
<br />
make &quot;a)&quot; wrong.
<br />
Note that in the lobian interview we do not need anymore the &quot;yes 
<br />
doctor&quot;, except for giving a general sense to the *goal* of the 
<br />
interview.
<br />
<br />It is much harder for me to conceive that Church thesis could be false, 
<br />
but this is due to more than many years of reflection on it. I am not 
<br />
so much impress by the empirical evidence (all attempt to define 
<br />
computable function lead to the same class of function, despite 
<br />
completely different definitions and motivations), but I am infinitely 
<br />
impressed by the closure for the diagonalization of the class of 
<br />
partial computable functions. This is a quite convincing argument for 
<br />
CT, as I try to explain periodically on this list. Still I can 
<br />
&quot;logically&quot; doubt about CT. It is enough that someone comes up with a 
<br />
function and a way to explain me how to compute and a proof that the 
<br />
function cannot be programmed in Java (say), and CT would be refuted. I 
<br />
would say that this is unlikely.
<br />
<br />Now, it is still much more harder for me to doubt about AR. It is about 
<br />
AR that I often say that I would have the feeling to lie to myself in 
<br />
case I would pretend harboring doubt about it. AR just says that 
<br />
elementary number theoretical statements (including existential one) 
<br />
are true or false in a way which does not depend on me. Actually I am 
<br />
even using a weaker version of AR, in the sense that for the ontic part 
<br />
of the theory, I need only the independent truth of the formula with 
<br />
the shape ExP(x), i.e. &quot;it exist a number verifying the property P&quot;, 
<br />
where P is an easily verifiable statement (like being prime, being odd, 
<br />
etc.). I don't need universal (with the &quot;for all&quot; quantifier) 
<br />
independent truth, only the simpler formula among the existential one.
<br />
<br />(of course I don't believe at all in Peter Jones heavy form of magical 
<br />
platonism).
<br />
<br />I have also never met someone doubting about AR, although I met 
<br />
regularly people who pretend to doubt AR, but like Peter, they put in 
<br />
it things which I don't put in it at all.
<br />
<br />Somehow, to believe in NON-AR you have to believe in the possibility 
<br />
that there is a proposition of arithmetic, stating the existence of a 
<br />
number having some verifiable property, which truth value is capable of 
<br />
changing according to the fact that you are alive or not. You need to 
<br />
make a stronger and much weirder ontological commitment to get it.
<br />
<br />Some people ask me: but if AR is so obvious, why do you postulate it?
<br />
I postulate it for reason of completeness, but also because I am aware 
<br />
of contradicting 1500 years of implicit theological aristotelian 
<br />
belief, and so I need to be quite explicit about what I assume.
<br />
Although very simple to believe, AR does play a key role, if not *the* 
<br />
key role in the UDA proof.
<br />
AR eventually provides the whole comp ontology, although it has nothing 
<br />
to do with any commitment with a substantial reality.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps,
<br />
<br />Bruno
