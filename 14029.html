Thank you for your opinions and conceptual clarifications. I'll answer
<br />
separately.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Once you have this requirement, the probabilities of sucessive OMs are

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to distinguish realism and idealism, as the emergent reality in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; idealism also &quot;kicks back&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />I really enjoyed reading your paper &quot;Why Occam's Razor?&quot; and I'd never
<br />
pretend to understand your derivation of quantum mechanics better than
<br />
you do. But maybe, I have another perspective on it (or even an
<br />
addition). Explaining this will reveal why I think that the Born rule
<br />
supports materialism/realism against idealism.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From a physicist's point of view, your derivation is complete and
</em><br />
doesn't require any addition. We get the postulates as they can be
<br />
found in every introductory textbook on quantum mechanics. But someone
<br />
starting from the idea of the Everything ensemble won't be completely
<br />
satisfied. You introduce an unspecified probability distribution P_psi
<br />
which is essential in the definition of the inner product. In physics,
<br />
the Hilbert space of physical states can be different for every
<br />
system; a physical theory must specify the inner product of each
<br />
Hilbert space from which we can reconstruct the distribution P_psi by
<br />
applying the Born rule. Though, if we start from a theory of
<br />
everything, we want a fundamental explanation for the specific
<br />
distribution.
<br />
<br />The materialist approach (of the Everything ensemble) would say that
<br />
P_psi(psi_a) is given by the measure of psi_a divided by the measure
<br />
of psi. Here, the measure of psi(_a) is meant to be proportional to
<br />
the 'number' of 'worlds' forming psi(_a). More precisely, I would not
<br />
speak of a 'number' but merely of the measure in the case when equal
<br />
weight is assigned to every single world. So, with the help of the
<br />
theory of the Everything ensemble and materialism, we are able in
<br />
principle to precisely define the probability distribution P_psi.
<br />
<br />The idealist approach may lead to a similar idea for calculating the
<br />
distribution P_psi: An idealist would not count (or measure) worlds
<br />
but observer moments. The problem that I see here is the following:
<br />
Let's suppose a system is in the state I introduced in my first
<br />
message...
<br />
<br />|B&gt; = |0&gt;/sqrt(3) + |1&gt;/sqrt(1.5)
<br />
<br />Then, if an observer performs a measurement in the (|0&gt;,|1&gt;) basis,
<br />
only two observer moments will follow. One OM that sees the outcome 0
<br />
and another OM that sees the outcome 1. If we apply equal measure to
<br />
each of these OMs, we will conclude that both cases are equally
<br />
probable. But they are not. I guess that the idealist approach leads
<br />
to a probability distribution incompatible with the experiment.
<br />
<br />Marc:
<br />
<br />I do recognize the difference between weak and strong materialism but
<br />
it's not essential in this case. When I wrote of mapping &quot;physical
<br />
states of the brain to states of the mind or observer moments&quot;, I did
<br />
not exclude the possibility that the map is only a concept invented by
<br />
humans.
<br />
<br />COMP surely provides a true alternative. It is good that you mention
<br />
it. Nonetheless, it's still a little strange for me. My own thinking
<br />
has always been rather similar to Russell's concepts.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Reflectivity (how to think about thought itself)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is an unsolved problem in probability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory, the solution for which is known only to me.   I have no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intention of revealing that solution here however, since it's the key
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to AI and my opponents are undoubtably reading my postings on this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; messagelist.
</em><br />
<br />Damn! I was convinced that my message would make you blab out your
<br />
important ideas :)
