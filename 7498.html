<br />
I think Natural numbers suffice here, but I may be wrong (my  
<br />
background is molecular biology, not math).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; SPK:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    Time, from what I have studied so far, involves two distinct  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; notions: a &quot;measure of change&quot; and an &quot;order of succession&quot;. The  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; idea that it is merely a dimension and related to the dimensions of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;space&quot;, as considered and promulgated by Minkowski, requires the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumption of classical physics and strict local realism. We know  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (I would hope!) that the former assumption is flawed, but the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; second is still being debated.
</em><br />
<br />I recognize that time is different than space.  But it strikes me as  
<br />
at least problematic that time must be assumed to have properties  
<br />
which space does not in order for consciousness to exist.  To me,  
<br />
consciousness is nothing special - just one kind of pattern (one that  
<br />
supports robust predictions from the intentional stance) among many.   
<br />
I think that pattern can exist in a natural number.  The intentional  
<br />
stance (a philosophical view of Daniel Dennett) is key to my views  
<br />
here, so I'll have to expound on it later.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    Please notice in your example that the automata had to be  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implemented by some process in order to render the results. The  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; resulting &quot;checker board&quot; like picture is a result of the process,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it can not be said to have one pattern or some other prior to and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; absent the computational process.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    Where would a SAS &quot;fit&quot; into the automata? What would its  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Observer Moments include?
</em><br />
<br />You have a good point here; in the example as I gave it, a temporal  
<br />
process comes first, the result of which is then instantiated in a 3d- 
<br />
structure at a single time.  But I think it would be possible to  
<br />
surmount this objection with the use of a lookup table.  You could  
<br />
have a lookup table large enough to calculate the next N steps all at  
<br />
once, for any N - and then it's a matter of setting N large enough to  
<br />
calculate a block of the automaton that *would have* sufficed to  
<br />
produce a noticeable length of experience by the SAS, had the process  
<br />
been calculated for one step at a time.  Of course, now you can ask  
<br />
where the the lookup table came from -- and it looks like it must  
<br />
have been generated by a temporal process...
<br />
<br />Well at any rate, I am trying to glean some conclusions from the  
<br />
existence of the stack &gt;after&lt; it has been created by whatever  
<br />
process - after all, if a simple algorithmic process is capable of  
<br />
generating it, it already exists in Platonia, at very high measure.   
<br />
This example assumes a strong Platonism for its conclusions - but I  
<br />
think it does go some way toward approaching the problem of how the  
<br />
real numbers (or in this case, I think, even the natural numbers) can  
<br />
give rise to observers, time, consciousness, etc.  Some of those  
<br />
numbers can be interpreted as a Game of Life containing one or more  
<br />
SASs (and I'll assume the question of where the SAS fits into it  
<br />
answered already, by the fact that UTMs can be impemented in the Game  
<br />
of Life, and these UTMs must include ones that can pass the Turing  
<br />
Test.  Many references exist for this claim which you will find if  
<br />
you google [&quot;game of life&quot; &quot;turing machine&quot;]).
<br />
<br />Best regards
<br />
Pete
