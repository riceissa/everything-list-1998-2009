<br />
Some thoughts on the MWI for your comments. I am sending this to a few
<br />
mailing lists with overlapping memberships, so you may have received this
<br />
twice or more. I apologise if this is the case and also for the very
<br />
imprecise language and gross simplifications and analogies that I am using
<br />
to make my point. This is really a sketch of a sketch.
<br />
I think that, while Everett's Relative State formulation of quantum
<br />
mechanics makes a lot of sense, its popular interpretation as &quot;Many Worlds&quot;
<br />
(MWI) should be taken only as a pictorial device useful for a first
<br />
understanding of the theory.
<br />
I propose thinking of perceived realities as shadows of a more complex
<br />
reality. I suspect this is what some authors, perhaps including Everett
<br />
himself, are trying to say, and that others have said it explicitly, so I
<br />
would appreciate any pointer to relevant works.
<br />
I will use poor Schroedinger's cat as an example. Following Everett, the cat
<br />
is in a superposition of [dead cat] and [alive cat] states before the box
<br />
has been opened, and stays so after. Once opened the box an observer is in a
<br />
superposition of [observer who remembers having seen a dead cat] and
<br />
[observer who remembers having seen an alive cat]. The MWI says that the
<br />
universe is now split in two branches where the first has [dead cat] and
<br />
[observer who remembers having seen a dead cat], and the second has [alive
<br />
cat] and [observer who remembers having seen an alive cat].
<br />
The difficulty that I have is: on the one hand we are saying that there is
<br />
no such a thing as a dead cat or an alive cat, but on the other hand we are
<br />
describing the world(s) with dead cats and alive cats.
<br />
To clarify the first part of the statement: as we can choose any two
<br />
directions to form a basis to use in describing a particle's spin, all
<br />
choices generating equally valid descriptions, besides [dead cat] and [alive
<br />
cat] we should be free to use another basis to describe the cat. Any pair of
<br />
independent superpositions of [dead cat] and [alive cat] will do, of course
<br />
I have no idea of what one would &quot;look like&quot;.
<br />
Since I cannot remember having ever seen one, I do not know what a
<br />
superposition of [dead cat] and [alive cat] would look like, so probably I
<br />
would not recognise one if I saw it. Perhaps this is the reason why I cannot
<br />
remember having ever seen one.
<br />
In other words, perhaps since reality is One Big World too complex for our
<br />
minds to process efficiently, we use a simplified representation as Many
<br />
(small) Worlds for our processing. This is not so surprising since our best
<br />
computer programs use data compression and segmentation techniques, throwing
<br />
most of the information away, to perform complex tasks such as face
<br />
recognition efficiently.
<br />
I believe thinking of shadows may be a better mental device than thinking of
<br />
parallel worlds. Using this model the realities that I, and my doubles in
<br />
the MWI model, perceive can be thought of as shadows of a more complex
<br />
reality. Observing a shadow permits saying certain things about is source,
<br />
but not other things like what the source is saying. The shadow does not
<br />
contain such information. Also, much of what we can say about shadows has
<br />
more to do with illumination and the surface where the shadow is cast than
<br />
with the actual source.
<br />
Thinking of multiple worlds as shadows brings us back to Plato's cave, but
<br />
there are two important differences: First, each of us observes shadows of
<br />
the outside world in a very large number of caves in parallel. Second, we
<br />
are shadows ourselves, our conscious computational processes being shadows
<br />
of other possibly much more complex computational processes.
