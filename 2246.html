</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  Are you saying that it is not possible in your model to define the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  class of all points in time on all branches of the universal wave
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  function which are  at a temporal distance of, say, 10 years from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  the start of the world  (assuming there was a point when the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  world (i.e. the whole tree of  branching possibilities) started?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  (This is not a rhetorical question but a  clarificationary one. And
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  I'm not asking whether we could identify those  points, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  whether the class of such points is defined.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Yes, I am saying that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;First of all, I would be unhappy with the requirement to specify a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;unique hyperplane of simultaneity.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;More generally, many problems arise when we try to understand the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;nature of time in modern physical theories.  Prior to relativity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;theory, it seemed that there was a natual succession of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;universally-valid ``nows'' apparent simultaneously to everyone alive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;at the time.  Times other than the present now had happened or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would happen but were not currently in existence.   Special
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;relativity, however, taught us that simultaneity is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;frame-dependent and introduced the idea of reality as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;four-dimensional spacetime.  According to general relativity, time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is path-dependent.  In the quasi-classical cosmology of the world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;we seem to live in, time appears on all inextendible paths to have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;begun with a big bang, but on some of those paths it may come to an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;end in a black hole, while on others it may continue for ever. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;What will the right picture be if we ever manage to quantize
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;general relativity?  I suspect that we should allow for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;possibility of black holes being formed as a result of uncertain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;``quantum events'' -- it may be harder to choose to construct a black
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;hole than to kill a cat but it is not unimaginable.  This suggests that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;time is not just frame dependent and path dependent, but even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observer dependent.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now, partly in order to deal with the problem of time in special
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;relativity, I have developed a many-minds interpretation of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;quantum theory which involves information being definite only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;separately for each individual observer.  The information observed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;by an observer is specified by sequences of local quantum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;states associated with the life history of that observer.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Applied to the EPR-Bell situation, for example, this means that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;when Alice measures a spin, her current state expresses
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a possible observed spin direction.  (This is a local process.)  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;When Bob measures a spin, his current state expresses a possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observed spin direction.  (And this too is a local process.)  Finally,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;another local process occurs when Alice and Bob compare their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observations (or rather, when each separately observes the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;appearance of the other).  The observed correlations which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;result are determined by the initial singlet state which was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;effectively previously observed separately by both.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I believe that, in many ways, this provides a very satisfactory and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;explicit solution to the problem of what it might mean for time to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be observer-dependent.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But if time is observer-dependent, then it is hard in general to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;compare times between different observers.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I agree. With the hypothesis of computationalism, we must distinguish
<br />
first person subjective time, not sharable at all, first person plural
<br />
time sharable with clocks and relatively communicable, and then,
<br />
thanks to the Universal Dovetailer (complete by Church thesis) we can
<br />
describe an objective 'observer moment birth rank' as the minimum 
<br />
number of steps of a typical UD to get the corresponding 
<br />
computational state.
<br />
And that is the best notion of birth rank we get, and it is a trivial
<br />
one because time (and space) has nothing to do with it. The probabilities
<br />
are taken on the first person plural time which must be defined on all
<br />
relative computational histories going through that computational state.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;This means that I do not view the ``birth rank'' problem as being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;well-posed for my theory. 
</em><br />
<br />So do I, except for the trivial case mentionned below.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Nevertheless, the broader problem of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;extent to which we should expect to see ourselves as being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;``typical'' observers is one which I think is both absolutely crucial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and very hard to deal with.  I appreciate Bostrom's work because I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;think that he is helping to clarify some of the issues involved in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that problem.
</em><br />
<br />So do I. Bostrom's work helps me to realise I am doing 
<br />
arithmetical SSA, and that I am generalising the anthropic
<br />
principle into an UTM-tropic principle.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I also think that whether we are typical observers and whether
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;time is observer-dependent are questions which are relevant for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;any ``theory of everything''.
</em><br />
<br />Sure.
<br />
<br />Then Matthew Donald quote himself
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I believe that there is no conceivable algorithm which could take
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  elements of the set of observers as I define it (well-defined and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  countable although that is) and attach unambiguous birth ranks to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  each one of them.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I believe there is one! I have even got the patience to write 
<br />
one in LISP and to execute it for four hours ! I mean a UD.
<br />
But any apparently physical birth rank superne on an infinite number
<br />
of birth in UD*. Physical time emerges slowly in UD-standart &quot;time&quot;
<br />
but we don't care, and we shouldn't. We care only on 
<br />
*all* our 'observer moment birth' in UD*.
<br />
All this should be clear for those who have followed the UDA
<br />
argument. Cf. <a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m1726.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m1726.html</a>
<br />
<br /><br />Bostrom replied
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Do you mean effectively computable algorithm?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I don't see why it would make a difference if the reference could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  not be  exactly computed in a finite time.
</em><br />
<br />and Matthew Donald replied
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;No.  I just referred to an algorithm to stress that I really am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;serious when I use words like ``unambiguous'' and ``well-defined''.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Well, but this is ambiguous. Of course with UD we accept infinite
<br />
non stopping computational histories, even with random oracles and 
<br />
perhaps other one.
<br />
<br />Bostrom replied (to Matthew Donald)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I'm not sure whether we are really disagreeing on this point,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  although I  would insist that one sort of question we may
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  meaningfully ask is not just  what my own future will be but also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  what the world is like (and was like in  the past) in general.
</em><br />
<br />and Matthew Donald replied
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I am afraid that we are disagreeing here, because I do not agree that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;``the world'' exists in anything like the way that Bostrom implies.
</em><br />
<br />Me too, and probably for similar reasons(*). My thesis (see the URL below)
<br />
can really be seen as a many mind interpretation of ... arithmetics.
<br />
Where mind is defined by sharable (formalise by G) and not sharable
<br />
(formalize by G* - G) first person experiences.
<br />
<br />(G is a sound complete decidable modal propositional formalisation of 
<br />
arithmetical (or set theoretical, it is the same!) godelian 
<br />
provability logic. And G* is its extended truth theory, which
<br />
curiously enough is also complete, sound and decidable.
<br />
(See the book by Boolos 1993)).
<br />
<br />(*) Your text, Matthew, is not quite easy (IMLMO).
<br />
IMLMO = In my logician-minded opinion :-)
