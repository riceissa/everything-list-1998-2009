<br />
Some of these questions may be profound, and some silly. (In fact, they
<br />
may be sorted in order of profound to silly.) My education is spotty
<br />
in these areas. I'm most interested in specific references that help 
<br />
answer (or destroy)
<br />
these questions.
<br />
<br />1. What test could determine if a computational hypothesis holds?
<br />
<br />2. Is it enough that a theory be elegant and explain all the known 
<br />
physics observations,
<br />
or does the test of the theory also have to rule out all competing 
<br />
theories, or at least force
<br />
all known competing theories to add ugly complex terms to themselves to 
<br />
continue to work?
<br />
<br />3. Is it not true that the kind of computation that computes the 
<br />
universe or multiverse
<br />
must be an energy-free computation, because energy itself is INSIDE the 
<br />
computed
<br />
universe, and it would be paradoxical if it also had to be OUTSIDE.
<br />
<br />4. What range of energy regimes and physical laws are required to 
<br />
produce spontaneous
<br />
order where the order retains the dynamism required for life. (e.g. as 
<br />
opposed to producing
<br />
one big, boring crystal.)
<br />
<br />5. Do these &quot;special&quot; energy regimes and physical law sets NECESSARILY 
<br />
produce
<br />
spontaneous order with the required dynamism?
<br />
<br />6. Why does spontaneous order emerge in these energy/law regimes?
<br />
<br />7. If we were in a &quot;possible world&quot; where thermodynamics ran backwards 
<br />
(entropy decreased),
<br />
would the time-perception of observers within that world also run 
<br />
backwards? Would these
<br />
backwards worlds (as far as classical physical observations go, anyway) 
<br />
thus be equivalent
<br />
to and theoretically equatable with the corresponding possible world 
<br />
which was the same except
<br />
that thermodynamics runs forwards as we are used to?
<br />
<br />8. What is the significance of the fact that observers like ourselves 
<br />
(possibly with some notion of
<br />
free will) are separated in space and can only communicate / cooperate 
<br />
with each other at the
<br />
speed of light. They cannot interfere with some decisions that the other 
<br />
makes, because the other
<br />
has already made the decision before a lightspeed communication can tell 
<br />
them or force them
<br />
to stop. Imagine Jane on Venus and Joe on Mars getting into an argument. 
<br />
Immediately after
<br />
receiving Joe's last communication (which he sent an hour ago), Jane 
<br />
decides to detonate her
<br />
solar-system bomb in frustration and spite. Nothing Joe can say or do 
<br />
can stop her, because
<br />
it will take two hours for him to know she's about to push the button, 
<br />
and communicate his
<br />
desperate and well-crafted plea for forgiveness. The idea of 
<br />
FUNDAMENTALLY independent
<br />
decision makers &quot;co-existing&quot; seems interesting. Open ended question. 
<br />
It's just as if Joe and
<br />
Jane lived at different times. (And yet they CAN communicate with each 
<br />
other, just slowly. Hmmm)
