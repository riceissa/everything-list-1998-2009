<br />Hmm.... Well, if you 'postulate' that something gives rise to

something RITSIAR, then I guess you're postulating that it partakes in
<br />
that reality to some ineliminable degree.  Perhaps you'd rather not
<br />
use the term.  Sometimes in your dialogues with Peter you referred to
<br />
the 'truth' of 1+1=2, rather than its 'reality'. But then again you
<br />
call your scheme arithmetical realism, not just arithmetical truth.
<br />
What precisely is at stake here?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; AR is just the common idea that the elementary arithmetic taught in

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; high school is not crackpot.
</em><br />
<br />OK, but if it culminates in my being RITSIAR, isn't it just a little
<br />
bit real in that sense?  But I'm not sure I want to die on this
<br />
battlefield!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Note that (with comp) there is no need to postulate any form of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; primitive causality (beyond the material implication and the modus
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ponens deduction rule). All notion of causality, from the physical laws
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the human responsibility, are captured by higher order logical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; modalities.
</em><br />
<br />Isn't this because you begin by arguing from necessity (i.e.
<br />
arithmetical necessity)?  I've often felt that this was the nub of
<br />
Peter's difference with you, in that he was putting the contingentist
<br />
position.  And that position assumes some sort of self-caused, or
<br />
given situation as primitive.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Again I think you have a right intuition, although that &quot;symmetry
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; breaking&quot; is or should be a fourth hypostase phenomenon (not a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; zeroth-one).
</em><br />
<br />In the sense that the primary existence of the One is
<br />
non-differentiated, it could be said to be symmetrical.  Thereafter,
<br />
any differentiation breaks that symmetry, no?  Actually, ISTM that the
<br />
primary reflexive existence of the One, and its spontaneous breaking
<br />
of symmetry, are equally 'primitive' or given.  IOW neither admits of
<br />
'explanation', but together they drive all subsequent
<br />
conceptualisation of 'one', 'many', and their relations.  ISTM that AR
<br />
approaches such issues from the direction of the 'necessary truth' of
<br />
arithmetical reasoning.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The One differentiates ? I can be ok with the image or analogy, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; strictly speaking the One is static, even more static, in some sense,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than the Second (the &quot;Divine Intellect&quot; (G*). The One is just above or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; beside time or space categories.
</em><br />
<br />I must be more precise.  AFAICS, the dynamic notion of differentiation
<br />
can't be justified until the reflexive emergence of the 1-person.
<br />
I've modified my position on Torgny's game in my last reply to him
<br />
because of this.  So my reference to 'differentiation' above is a
<br />
structural or static sense of the term.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; as the basis for all subsequent categorisation whatsoever, except the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; original - and unique - ontic category of self-relative existence.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I hope you make yourself precise enough because you enjoy to be made
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even more precise! There is no notion of self at the zero person point
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of view. Self appears with self-referential machines. Those belongs to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the &quot;Nous&quot;, the Intellect, the second hypostase.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (This could be seen as a detail ...)
</em><br />
<br />Here I don't mean *a self* in the sense of a person, but 'self-' in
<br />
the sense of reflexive.  I'm stressing independent 'self-relative' or
<br />
reflexive existence, especially in my points to Torgny, as distinct
<br />
from 'dependent' existence relative to 'something else'.  &quot;I&quot;, or my
<br />
chair, exist relative to the One: our RITSIAR depends on the
<br />
self-differentiation of One into many.  But the One exists
<br />
reflexively, or independently, relative only to itself.
<br />
<br />Actually, this is the main point I've been trying to make in various
<br />
ways since I first posted to the list.  It doesn't equate to an
<br />
Aristotelian notion of the 'material'; rather it tries to avoid the
<br />
many confusions that arise from *not* understanding 'existence' - in
<br />
any sense other than the metaphorical - as ultimately a reflexive
<br />
notion.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; All right. But I would say that the differentiated One is already the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Intellect. I can keep your nomenclature for a while.
</em><br />
<br />It may indeed be the Intellect, in the sense of a superposition of all
<br />
knowledge. But it takes ignorance to crystallise out all the little
<br />
'knowers' and their tiny scraps of 'knowledge'.  To be all knowledge
<br />
is not yet to be a knower.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well the passage from a &quot;intellect self&quot; to a knower is the (subtle)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; passage from the intellect to the soul (from the second hypostase (or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; third person!) to the third hypostase (the unameable first person, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Brouwer-Post-Bergsonian &quot;builder&quot; of time).
</em><br />
<br />Yes indeed.  And I'm interested to know if there is any move in the
<br />
comp frame that *necessitates* the 'builder' of time, or whether this
<br />
must simply be assumed in the face of its manifest contingency in our
<br />
own case.  ISTM - and this is what I've conceded to Torgny - that the
<br />
soul or 1-person is characterised precisely by such temporal
<br />
discrimination, and that consciousness must be dynamically 'enacted',
<br />
not merely some passive or static structure that one would merely 'be
<br />
like'.  So it may seem possible to conceive of a zombie-universe which
<br />
is, in all non-1-personal aspects, 'exactly like ours', but whose
<br />
reflexivity is merely 'static'.  To equate such stasis with 1-personal
<br />
consciousness would seem paradoxical to me.  So it's not that zombies
<br />
aren't 'like' anything, it's rather that they don't *do* anything.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is an absolute common part, even if they are appreciated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; differently according to the hypostasis/point-of-view. I would say.
</em><br />
<br />Then the absolute common part would be the shared 'absolute reality'?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hmmm.... The fact is that any sound universal machine which introspects
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; itself/herself(?) enough will discover eventually that this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-ignorance is productive, creative in some sense. It can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; considered as bright, white, flashing. It is big, and looking twice it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is soon even much bigger ... and structured ...
</em><br />
<br />Yes, because without darkness as well as light there is no contrast.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You're right, we must distinguish zombies.  The kind I have in mind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; are the kind that Torgny proposes, where 'everything is the same' as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; for a human, except that 'there's nothing it is like' to be such a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; person.  My key point is that this must become incoherent in the face
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of self-relativity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am afraid that IF you were right here, this would mean that you are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; either an unsound machine, or that you are not a machine at all.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The assertion of inexistence of absolute zombie à-la Torgny belongs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (most probably) to G* minus G, I mean to the true but unprovable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sentences of the machine. I don't see how we could contradict
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; effectively Torgny's self-zombie proposition. It does not mean that it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is not interesting to try or search for consequence of such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; propositions, and Torgny's game(?) is fun (in our context).
</em><br />
<br />Yes, I've shifted my position, as I've said above, because of the
<br />
apparent lack of an alternative to simply assuming dynamic
<br />
discrimination as characteristic of the 1-personal.  So a
<br />
Torgny-zombie would be merely structurally self-reflexive, and hence
<br />
not *enact* any conscious states 1-personally.  In the comp frame,
<br />
would such 'personal stasis' nullify any 'justification' for zombie
<br />
'beliefs' etc?
<br />
<br />AFAICS there is no possibility of accessing such a zombie from our
<br />
situation in the 'A-Universe'.  Ex hypothesi it is characteristic of a
<br />
'B-Universe': i.e. one in which, despite its 'structural' similarity,
<br />
1-personal temporal discrimination - 'for some reason' - doesn't
<br />
occur.  Consequently, 'conversations' between zombies would be a
<br />
matter of records in the zombie universe, inaccessible to us.  Could
<br />
inter-zombie 'justification' or 'belief' make any sense merely in
<br />
terms of such static descriptions?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you accept, with Torgny, the idea that the &quot;1+1=2&quot; statement (and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all consequence of Robinson arithmetic ,sorry John Mikes!) has a truth
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; value not depending on you, then the many Gols follows at once.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, in the sense of 'all possible universes', but the question is:
<br />
what states is GoL capable of generating?  If it evolves to be
<br />
'exactly like' the A-Universe, then its equivalent denizens will be
<br />
conscious, surely.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I leave it for you to judge whether - if a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; machine can report just as we do on what it's like to be itself, with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; exactly the same self-relative justification - it can then remain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; coherent to claim that 'it's not like anything' to be that machine.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I miss the line (sorry).
</em><br />
<br />Sorry, too confusing.  I meant only the Occamish imputation of the
<br />
same conscious states in the presence of the same conditions.
<br />
However, as I've said, if we're imagining 'another One' (in the sense
<br />
that no such state of affairs is Occamishly believable with respect to
<br />
'this One'), it could perhaps be that the 'same conditions' in that
<br />
case do not hold and the 1-person somehow does not emerge actively and
<br />
hence consciously.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; How we would judge its 'justification' and 'honesty' is an interesting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; question.  For example, if a machine was a Huge Lookup Table, it might
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; be able to pass the test, but neither honestly nor justifiably, in my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; terms.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is unfortunately a difficult point. Except for &quot;relative
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probabilistic matter&quot; it does not really matter which algorithm is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; used, or even if an algorithm is used. What matter, in UD* for example,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is the set of possible execution of possible algorithms.
</em><br />
<br />May we then have no prejudices with respect to the means of production
<br />
of the machines's statements about itself?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hmmm.... Dangerous move. I would not say that &quot;I&quot; am acting when my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain operates. This could lead to 1-3 person confusion, imo.
</em><br />
<br />I didn't intend that.  You asked me if neural processing was
<br />
'behaviour'.  We seem to agree that 'behaviour' is a 1-personal notion
<br />
(i.e. dynamism emerges 1-personally).  So, seen in that light, neural
<br />
processing is dynamic or behavioural. That's all.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than the Second (the &quot;Divine Intellect&quot; (G*). The One is just above or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; beside time or space categories.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; as the basis for all subsequent categorisation whatsoever, except the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; original - and unique - ontic category of self-relative existence.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I hope you make yourself precise enough because you enjoy to be made
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even more precise! There is no notion of self at the zero person point
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of view. Self appears with self-referential machines. Those belongs to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the &quot;Nous&quot;, the Intellect, the second hypostase.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (This could be seen as a detail ...)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This entails that all such subsequent categorisation is in some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; fundamental sense epistemic: i.e. how the One 'gets to know' itself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Exact (assuming comp, etc.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; So I agree with Plotinus that the One can't be said to 'know' anything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; without such differentiation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; All right. But I would say that the differentiated One is already the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Intellect. I can keep your nomenclature for a while.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; I am not sure how could grandma have a feeling about that, except if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; grandma get Church Thesis and the UDA.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Well, I'm working on the technicalities.  But the 'feeling' comes from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; what I've said above.  If all categories of 'process' or 'structure'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; are epistemic - i.e. forms of self-relative 'coming to know' -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well the passage from a &quot;intellect self&quot; to a knower is the (subtle)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; passage from the intellect to the soul (from the second hypostase (or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; third person!) to the third hypostase (the unameable first person, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Brouwer-Post-Bergsonian &quot;builder&quot; of time).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; entails that everything arises as an interpretation from a 'point of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; view'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You are quick but OK.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; So what is revealed in any given context and - at least as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; importantly - what is obscured, must then be characteristic of that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; specific point of view, in no sense 'absolute reality' (whatever that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; could mean).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is an absolute common part, even if they are appreciated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; differently according to the hypostasis/point-of-view. I would say.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; The point is just that physics appears as a sort of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; sum on your lobian ignorance.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I think this is what I mean by 'obscured'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hmmm.... The fact is that any sound universal machine which introspects
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; itself/herself(?) enough will discover eventually that this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-ignorance is productive, creative in some sense. It can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; considered as bright, white, flashing. It is big, and looking twice it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is soon even much bigger ... and structured ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; As I said this is a point where I would like to disagree with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; lobian machine. The fact is that even the lobian machine warns us on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; the possibility of zombie. Certainly the current artificial cops on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; road are zombie. Tomorrow we will be able to build artificial skin for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; androids capable of making us believe they are normal humans citizens,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; ... We should distinguish &quot;local zombie&quot; which are capable to fail you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; during some finite time, and &quot;theoretical global zombie&quot; which are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; capable to fail you, in principle, for ever (like Torgny try to make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; us
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; believe he belongs too: nobody can prove him wrong).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You're right, we must distinguish zombies.  The kind I have in mind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; are the kind that Torgny proposes, where 'everything is the same' as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; for a human, except that 'there's nothing it is like' to be such a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; person.  My key point is that this must become incoherent in the face
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of self-relativity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am afraid that IF you were right here, this would mean that you are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; either an unsound machine, or that you are not a machine at all.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The assertion of inexistence of absolute zombie à-la Torgny belongs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (most probably) to G* minus G, I mean to the true but unprovable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sentences of the machine. I don't see how we could contradict
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; effectively Torgny's self-zombie proposition. It does not mean that it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is not interesting to try or search for consequence of such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; propositions, and Torgny's game(?) is fun (in our context).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; My reasoning is that a claim for the 'existence'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of something like Torgny's B-Universe is implicitly a claim for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; self-relative existence: i.e. independent of other causality, like the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; One.  When Torgny proposed the Game of Life as an example of 'another
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; universe', I pointed out that GoL clearly doesn't possess independent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; existence: it's just a part of the A-Universe.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you accept, with Torgny, the idea that the &quot;1+1=2&quot; statement (and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all consequence of Robinson arithmetic ,sorry John Mikes!) has a truth
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; value not depending on you, then the many Gols follows at once.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  If one is to postulate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a universe suitable for the thought experiment, one must in effect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; propose 'another One' - i.e. an independently self-relative
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'B-Universe'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course, &quot;another One&quot; is by itself contradictory, for a machine. In
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a sense, there are as many Ones than there is machine, but they share
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; almost all relevant structure, once the machine is &quot;rich enough&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It follows that, given the other assumptions of 'sameness',
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; conversations with machines in such a B-Universe must then proceed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; exactly as they do in the A-Universe, because they depend on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; self-relation in the same ways.  Now, it may seem that - beyond all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; relativity - the question still remains of the 'absolute' quality of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'what it's like' to be 'One' in the context of such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; self-individuation.  I leave it for you to judge whether - if a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; machine can report just as we do on what it's like to be itself, with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; exactly the same self-relative justification - it can then remain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; coherent to claim that 'it's not like anything' to be that machine.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I miss the line (sorry).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Before a long time (despite Kurzweyl) we just can do it, even at a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; high
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; level. A brain is *very* complex, for any theory. In the future people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; will just bet on the available theory through some Pascal wag.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; It is possible that there is some &quot;zombie&quot; gap, and that the first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; person having an artificial brain will not be conscious ... (I doubt
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; this, but apparently the lobian machine say so .... according to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; definition I gave).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Yes, I agree.  And if the machine can justifiably and honestly pass
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; all examinations of 'what it's like' to be itself, I would be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; reluctant to accuse it of zombiehood, based on my own criteria above.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; How we would judge its 'justification' and 'honesty' is an interesting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; question.  For example, if a machine was a Huge Lookup Table, it might
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; be able to pass the test, but neither honestly nor justifiably, in my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; terms.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is unfortunately a difficult point. Except for &quot;relative
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probabilistic matter&quot; it does not really matter which algorithm is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; used, or even if an algorithm is used. What matter, in UD* for example,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is the set of possible execution of possible algorithms.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Are you considering neural processing as a behavior?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Are you considering that some platonic and static relations between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; numbers can be seen as behavior?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I'm saying essentially that 1-personal self-relation is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'characteristically' temporal.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I have no other justification than an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; inability to imagine how else it could be differentiated: 'dynamic'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; self-relation seems to be the defining characteristic of 'qualitative'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; existence.  This seems to be at the heart of 'what it's like' to exist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 1-personally: we 'sense' self-relation as 'action'.  So 'neural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; processing' - i.e. as an aspect of the 'physical brain' perceived
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 1-personally - can be behaviour in this sense.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hmmm.... Dangerous move. I would not say that &quot;I&quot; am acting when my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain operates. This could lead to 1-3 person confusion, imo.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Platonic and static
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; relations between numbers are 0-personal, and - self-relative to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; One - this is perhaps structural or eternal.  This is why I (and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; perhaps Plotinus) don't believe that the One 'knows' anything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; distinctly from the knowers and knowledge created by its own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; self-differentiation: there has to be emergence at the 1-personal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; level for an 'act of knowing' to unfold 'in time'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Recall that the nameable lobian master always insist on  &quot;I will say a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; stupidity or I could say a stupidity&quot;       (is that english?)

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
