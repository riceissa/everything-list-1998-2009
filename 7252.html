</em><br />
<br />I think the practical differences are large, as you say, but I  
<br />
disagree that it points to a fundamental metaphysical difference.  I  
<br />
think what appears to be a metaphysical difference is just the  
<br />
breakdown of our folk concept of &quot;I&quot;.  Imagine a primitive person who  
<br />
didn't understand the physics of fire, seeing two candles lit from a  
<br />
single one, then the first one extinguished - they may be tempted to  
<br />
conclude that the first flame has now become two flames.  Well, this  
<br />
is no problem because flames never say things like &quot;I would like to  
<br />
keep burning&quot; or &quot;I wonder what my next experience would be&quot;.  We,  
<br />
however, do say these things.  But does this bit of behavior  
<br />
(including the neural activity that causes it) make us different in a  
<br />
relevant way? And if so, how?
<br />
<br />This breakdown of &quot;I&quot; is very interesting.  Since there's lots of  
<br />
talk about torture here, let's take this extremely simple example:  
<br />
Smith is going to torture someone, one hour from now.  You may try to  
<br />
take steps to prevent it.  How much effort you are willing to put in  
<br />
depends, among other things, on the identity of the person Smith is  
<br />
going to torture.  In particular, you will be very highly motivated  
<br />
if that person is you; or rather, the person you will be one hour  
<br />
from now.  The reason for the high motivation is that you have strong  
<br />
desires for that person to continue their life unabated, and those  
<br />
desires hinge on the outcome of the torture.  But my point is that  
<br />
your strong desires for your own survival are just a special case of  
<br />
desires for a given person's survival - in other words, you are  
<br />
already taking a third-person point of view to your (future) self.   
<br />
You know that if the person is killed during torture, they will not  
<br />
continue their life; if they survive it, their life will still be  
<br />
negatively impacted, and your desires for the person's future are  
<br />
thwarted.
<br />
<br />Now, if you introduce copies to this scenario, it does not seem to me  
<br />
that anything changes fundamentally.  Your choice on what kind of  
<br />
scenario to accept will still hinge on your desires for the future of  
<br />
any persons involved.  The desires themselves may be very  
<br />
complicated, and in fact will depend on lots of hitherto unspecified  
<br />
details such as the legal status, ownership rights, etc., of copies.   
<br />
Of course one copy will say &quot;I pushed the button and then I got  
<br />
tortured&quot;, and the other copy will say &quot;I pushed the button and woke  
<br />
up on the beach&quot; - which is exactly what we would expect these two  
<br />
people to say.  And they're both right, insofar as they're giving an  
<br />
accurate report of their memories.  What is the metaphysical issue here?
