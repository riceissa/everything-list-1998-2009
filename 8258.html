<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The questions I have regard the replacement of the Coincidence Counter (from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; here on: CC) in the  above experiment with a more complicated apparatus.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What if we replace the CC with one of the following:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) a carefully sealed, exquisitely well insulated box with a printer inside
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it.  The printer is  hooked up so that it prints, on paper, an exact record
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of everything that comes into the CC.  Then,  to &quot;erase&quot; the printed record,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the whole box is melted, or annihilated using nuclear explosives, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whatever.
</em><br />
<br />The CC is not what is &quot;erased&quot;.  Rather, the so-called erasure happens
<br />
to the photons while they are flying through the apparatus.  Nothing in
<br />
the experiment proposes erasing data in the CC.  So I don't really see
<br />
what you are getting at.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What will the outcome be in these experiments?
</em><br />
<br />It won't make any difference, because the CC is not used in the way you
<br />
imagine.  It doesn't have to produce a record and it doesn't have to erase
<br />
any records.
<br />
<br />Let me tell you what really happens in the experiment above.  It is
<br />
actually not so mystical as people try to make it sound.
<br />
<br />We start off with the s photon going through a 2 slit experiment and
<br />
getting interference.  That is standard.
<br />
<br />Now we put two different polarization rotations in front of the two slits
<br />
and interference goes away.  The web page author professes amazement,
<br />
but it is not really that surprising.  After all, interference between two
<br />
photons would typically be affected by messing with their polarizations.
<br />
It is not all that surprising that putting polarizers into the paths
<br />
could mess up the interference.
<br />
<br />But now comes the impressive part.  He puts a polarizer in front of the
<br />
other photon, the p photon, and suddenly the interference comes back!
<br />
Surely something amazing and non-local has happened now, right?
<br />
<br />Not really.  This new polarizer will eliminate some of the p photons.
<br />
They won't get through.  The result is that we will throw out some
<br />
of the measurements of s photons, because if the p photon got eaten
<br />
by its polarizer, the CC doesn't trigger as there is no coincidence.
<br />
(This is the real reason for the CC in this experiment.)
<br />
<br />So now we are discarding some of the s photon measurements, and keeping
<br />
some.  It turns out that the ones we keep do show an interference pattern.
<br />
If we had added back in the ones we discarded, it would blur out the
<br />
interference fringes and there would be no pattern.
<br />
<br />The point is, there is no change to the s photon when we put the polarizer
<br />
over by p.  Its results do not visibly change from non-interference
<br />
to interference, as the web page might imply.  (If that did happen,
<br />
we'd have the basis for a faster than light communicator.)  No, all
<br />
that is happening is that we are choosing to throw out half the data,
<br />
and the half we keep does show interference.
<br />
<br />The only point of the CC, then, is to tell us which half of the data
<br />
to throw out of the s photon measurements.  Destroying the CC and all
<br />
of the other crazy things you suggest have nothing to do with the
<br />
experiment.  The CC is not what is &quot;erased&quot; and it does not create a
<br />
permanent record.  It is only there to tell us whether a p photon got
<br />
through its polarizer or not, so that we know whether to throw away
<br />
the s photon measurement.
