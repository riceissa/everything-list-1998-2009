<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Juergen Schmidhuber, juergen.domain.name.hidden, writes, quoting Hal:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; I do think that this argument has some problems, but it is appealing and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; if the holes can be filled it seems to offer an answer to the question.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; What do you think?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Where exactly are the holes?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One is what I mentioned earlier, that a trivial program which enumerates
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and executes (in dovetailing, interleaved form) all possible programs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will create every mind in every possible situation.  This is a very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; short program and hence is the most likely universe for us to live in.
</em><br />
<br />I don't see this as a hole at all.  Maybe I'm missing something, but I
<br />
thought the whole point of postulating a universal dovetailer was that
<br />
it creates &quot;everything&quot; from zero information (or as near as dammit).
<br />
<br />This, combined with Bruno's computational indeterminism (thanks for 
<br />
quoting your previous post Bruno -- I hadn't read that) provides the
<br />
basis for predictions of our future observations.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You can try to say that this program doesn't count because it creates more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than one universe, but as I suggested earlier this requires an objective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; formulation.  Which programs count and which ones don't?  How can we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; know whether a program creates a single universe or more than one?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We need something more in the theory to solve this problem.
</em><br />
<br />I would be inclined to reject any theory that threw ad hoc rationalizations
<br />
for rejecting some universes and accepting others.  The whole appeal of
<br />
&quot;everything exists&quot; is its zero information.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Another problem is that the Kolmogorov measure is defined only up to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an additive constant.  Given a specific, large, program which runs on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universal TM &quot;T&quot;, we can construct a different UTM T' on which that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; program is very small.  (In essence we hard-wire the program into the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; T' definition.)  This means that I can create a UTM where a magical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; flying-rabbit universe is more probable than the one we live in.
</em><br />
<br />I agree that this is a hole, and it has bothered me (sort of in the
<br />
back of my mind) for some time.  In Juergen's paper, he says
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under different universal priors (based on different universal 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;machines), probabilities of a given string differ by no more 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than a constant factor independent of the string size, due to the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;compiler theorem (the constant factor corresponds to the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;probability of guessing a compiler). This justifies the name 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;``universal prior,'' also known as Solomonoff-Levin distribution. 
<br />
<br />I don't know what this means exactly.  It worries me that the 
<br />
probabilities are not completely well defined.  It seems to me that
<br />
Hal is correct that certain UTM's can be contrived to make certain
<br />
bit strings very likely.
<br />
<br />We could borrow the section from Tegmark's paper on making 
<br />
predicitions, and apply it to this discussion.  
<br />
I'll assume Bruno's computational indeterminism, and restrict the
<br />
discussion to just two consecutive time steps in the computation.
<br />
We want to predict the probability of our seeing Y at time t1, 
<br />
given that we now see X at time t0.  As Bruno often points out, we
<br />
have no way of knowing exactly who we are or what bit strings we
<br />
are represented by, but we do know that at time t0, we see X.
<br />
<br />Let Si be a bit string within a single time snapshot of a universe
<br />
history.  Let's also assume that it's possible, in principle, to
<br />
evaluate Si to see if it qualifies as an observer, and if it observes 
<br />
X or Y.
<br />
<br />Then, 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;P(Y,t1|X,t0) = 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sum j { Sum i {  P(Y|Sj) P(Sj,t1|Si,t0) P(X|Si) } }
<br />
<br />In words, the probability that I'll see Y at t1, given that I see X
<br />
at t0, equals the sum of all probabilities that Sj sees Y, that Sj is
<br />
a computational continuation of Si, and that Si sees X.
<br />
<br />Now, being able to determine what a &quot;bit string observes&quot; depends,
<br />
of course, on the TM.  The TM &quot;breathes life&quot; into the bit strings.
<br />
Also, the determination of the middle term depends on the TM.
<br />
I'm just thinking out loud, here, really, but it seems to me that 
<br />
even a &quot;constant&quot; factor will throw this equation out of whack.  We
<br />
should be able to show that this probability is independent of the
<br />
TM.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; A related problem is the uncomputability of the Kolmogorov measure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is no way in general to know what is the shortest program to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; construct a given string or a given universe.  Yet probabilities are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; real and so apparently someone/something is in effect computing them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In other words, our observations of probability imply that uncomputable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; values are being computed.  This is at least a bit paradoxical.
</em><br />
<br />I don't see this as a problem, on the other hand.  Just because 
<br />
probabilities exist doesn't mean that anyone or anything is computing 
<br />
them.
