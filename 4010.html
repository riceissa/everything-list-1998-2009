<br />Sorry, Hal - my mistake.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I have always had two problems with the MWI. Initially it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; was measurements that caused the splitting into different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; universes, and that's apparently still the view of people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; who propose tests like Plaga, but later it was realized
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that there was no prinicpled way to distinguish
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; measurements from other interactions. But then it seems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that the universe must split everytime a photon is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; emitted by an atom anywhere in the visible universe.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Since that atom could have interacted with some atom near
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; us - all the visible universe was in interaction before
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; inflation - then that split implies a split here &amp; now.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But to what effect?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; MWI seems to commit us to an essentially infinite rate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of splitting; yet nobody uses it except in a QM
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; measurement analysis. To take it seriously I would need
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to see why all this infinite splitting can be ignored and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; whay I need only pay attention to certain cases. This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; seems very much like Bohr's division into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; classical/quantum realms.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would make two comments about this. The first, following
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the lines of my earlier message, is that the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consideration applies to the multiverse models we have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discussed on the everything list. We have all possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universes existing, which means that all possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; alternatives are explored. Whether you think of it as one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe &quot;splitting&quot; or multiple formerly-identical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universes becoming distinct, the process is the same. And
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you have the same problem, that conceptually the smallest
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; change anywhere in the universe now makes there be two
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different universes where formerly there were one. So if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you don't like the MWI, you ought to object to more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; general multiverse models (and maybe you do!).
</em><br />
<br />Yes, I think I understand this similarity between
<br />
all-universes-are-computed and the MWI of QM.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But second, I don't think this objection is as bad as it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sounds. As is perhaps made more clear in the multiverse
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; example, this &quot;splitting&quot; is a somewhat figurative or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subjective phenomon. It's not so much that the universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; splits; there is only one universe, in the largest sense.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We use the word multiverse to describe this grand
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ensemble, but in its traditional meaning of &quot;everything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is&quot; it is fair to call it the universe. In the MWI,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is only one universe, which evolves
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deterministically by following the Schrodinger equation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That's all there is to the physics.
</em><br />
<br />OK, except don't the universes interfere to produce
<br />
(approximate) diagonalization of the density matrix?  So
<br />
that is why we observe classical physics at the macroscopic
<br />
level.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The splitting comes in when we study the wave function of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the universe and find that it can be decomposed into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pieces which add together to form the whole, and where the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time evolution of each separate piece is essentially
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; independent of the others. And then, each of these pieces
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can further be interpreted as being themselves made of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; separate pieces which become causally independent as time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moves forward. So it's not that the universe splits, it's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the global wave function can be interpreted as having
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; causally independent parts.
</em><br />
<br />The decomposition though is only an approximation holding
<br />
for macroscopic observables that average over many
<br />
&quot;universes&quot; or in other words, projects out onto a subspace
<br />
of the universes Hilbert space. So the separation and
<br />
independence have to do with our macroscopic perspective
<br />
and the fact that our knowledge (or all knowledge) must be
<br />
encoded at a macroscopic (irreversible) level.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The second problem has to do with time and casuality. At
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; a microscopic level QM is time symmetric. If we say there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is no real collapse of the wave function - all evolution
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is unitary (and therefore reversible) - then it seems we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; should from each datum or measurement result, compute the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; past as well as the future. All that can be known of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; past, what happened within our past light cone, is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; determined by the present. So does the universe split as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; we go back in time? If not, why not? Are we stepping
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; outside physics and assuming that the experimenter, as an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; agent, sets up initial, but not final, conditions and so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; defines the arrow-of-time by his causal action as an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; agent outside of physics?
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; That's a good question and one I don't really know the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; answer to. It's possible that you're right, it has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something to do with initial conditions. Or it's possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that universes are merging at the micro-scale even as they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are splitting at the macro-scale, which would also be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fundamentally due to initial conditions. For example,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dual-slit diffraction can be seen as worlds where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particles go through the slits separately merging to show
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the interference.
</em><br />
<br />My concern goes deeper than that. I think that a TOE should
<br />
explain time, not assume it.  But MWI universe splitting or
<br />
evolution of the wave equation of the universe seems to
<br />
assume time.

There is a theory which states that if ever anybody
<br />
discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is
<br />
here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by
<br />
something even more bizarre and inexplicable. There is
<br />
another theory which states that this has already happened.
