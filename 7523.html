<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But it is *precisely* that I cannot imagine how this stack of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Life gels could possibly be thinking or be conscious that forces
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; me to admit that something like time must play a role.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Here is why: let's suppose that your stack of Life boards does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; represent each generation of Conway's Life as it emulates a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; person.... If a stack of gels like this amounts to the conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; experience of an entity, then it certainly wouldn't hurt to move
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; them farther apart... Next, we alter the orientations of the gels...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; So, for me, since it is absurd to think that either vibrating
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; bits of matter (an example Hal Finney quotes) or random patches
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of dust (Greg Egan's theory of Dust) can actually give runtime
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to entities, then I have to draw the line somewhere. Where I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; have always chosen is this: if states, no matter now represented,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; are not causally connected with each other, consciousness does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; not obtain.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you remember Egan's &quot;dust&quot; theory in Permutation City, you probably also 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; remember that he did the same manipulations of a computation running in time 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as you suggest doing with the Life board stacks in space. Do you not think a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computation would work if chopped up in this way?
</em><br />
<br />If you are speaking of the earlier part of the Greg Egan novel
<br />
(which I claim to entirely understand) then no, he did not isolate
<br />
a person's experiences down to *instants*.  He would run a minute's
<br />
worth now, a minute's worth then, and mix them up in order. 
<br />
<br />But!  The only causal discontinuities were *between* the successive
<br />
sessions (each session at least a minute long---but I'd be happy
<br />
with a millisecond long).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The idea that any computation can be implemented by any random process, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; given an appropriate programming language (which might be a giant lookup 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; table, mapping [anything] -&gt; [line of code]) is generally taken as being 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-evidently absurd.
</em><br />
<br />Not sure I understand. Since you are talking about a *process*,
<br />
then for my money we're already half-way there! (I.e., the 
<br />
Time Deniers have not struck.)  Suppose that we have a trillion
<br />
by trillion Life Board and the program randomly assigns pixels
<br />
for each generation. Then, yes, I guess I agree with you: we
<br />
have achieved nothing: the random states are admittedly connected
<br />
by causal processes (your machine is an ordinary causal process
<br />
operating in *time*), but nothing intelligent is being implemented.
<br />
It's not even implementing a wild rain-storm. 
<br />
<br />(Of course, the Time Deniers, as I understand them, would be
<br />
perfectly happy to let this machine run for 10^10^200 years,
<br />
and then identify (pick out) a sequence of apparently related
<br />
states, in fact, a sequence that seemed to be you or me having
<br />
a conscious experience. They'd be quite happy (many of them
<br />
at least) to say that once again Stathis or Lee had been 
<br />
implemented in the universe and had had some conscious
<br />
experience (i.e. OMs).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The argument goes that that the information content 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the &quot;programming language&quot; must contain all the information the random 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; system is supposed to be producing, so this system is actually superfluous. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This means we have won no computational benefit by setting up this odd 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine.
</em><br />
<br />I'm following so far.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, the programming language is only there so that the machine 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can interact with the environment. If there is no programming language
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and no I/O, the machine can be a complete solipsist.
</em><br />
<br />You've lost me, sorry. Could you explain what you mean and
<br />
where you are going here? 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This might occur also if 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some future archaeologist finds an ancient computer running an AI, but there 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is no manual, no terminal, no keyboard, and nobody knows how it is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; programmed any more. If the archaeologist could figure out how to power up 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this computer, wouldn't the AI be implemented as per usual?
</em><br />
<br />In the first sentence here, the archaeologist finds the machine 
<br />
running. Now, for me, if it's truly implementing an AI, then the
<br />
AI may still be having a great time working on the Riemann
<br />
Hypothesis, and I don't see why it's important if it's a 
<br />
solipsist or a hermit.
<br />
<br />In the second sentence, I infer that the machine is not powered up.
<br />
Yes, then, if the archaeologist finds the right AC input voltage
<br />
and gets it going, then we have the first case (i.e. sentence one),
<br />
and the AI would be implemented as usual.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You might say that in the last example the states were &quot;causally connected&quot;, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; while in the first they were not. But why should that make any difference, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; especially to a solipsist?
</em><br />
<br />By &quot;matters to a solipsist&quot;, you are referring to the AI himself
<br />
or to an outsider?  As for me, the states of a running process
<br />
are by definition causally connected (this is what &quot;process&quot;)
<br />
means to me, but then, yes, the states reached could be a sort
<br />
of random hash as you were speaking of earlier. In that case,
<br />
then it might as well be a succession of frozen states, or dust
<br />
between the galaxies, or whatever, in terms of (not) being able
<br />
to emulate a conscious entity.
<br />
<br />I'm driven by this continuum I see: on one extreme are people
<br />
that I care about (me, you, etc.), and on the other extreme
<br />
are vibrations of a crystal or patterns of dust between the
<br />
galaxies that I don't care about. I draw the line between them
<br />
as follows: 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A necessary condition for the states to be evidence of a
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conscious computation is that they be causally connected.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sufficient condition is (almost always) that they pass
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Turing test, or are an example of a process that would
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have passed during an interval (the interval in question)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provided that someone had conducted the test.
