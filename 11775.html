<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; An excellent essay.  I agree with almost everything you wrote; and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you put it very well.  Would you mind if I cross posted it to Vic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Stenger's AVOID-L mailing list.  You can check out the list here: 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/">http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Although Victor Stenger doesn't use the word &quot;anti-natural&quot;, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; following equation is what he is assuming in his atheistic arguments:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; supernatural = anti-natural.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Therefore he thinks that a proof of theism would amount to finding a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; violation of natural law.  Since he finds no such violation (which I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; would argue is a circular argument based on the definition of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; natural)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; he claim this proves atheism beyond a reasonable doubt (what is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; measure of certainty/uncertainty?).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; In terms of Bruno's provability, this is akin to saying that a proof 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; the existence of a non-trivial G*/G can be obtained by finding an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; inconsistency in G.  This does not make sense.  This is like saying 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; only god that can exist is an inconsistent god.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; A theist God (as opposed to a deist God) is one who intervenes in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; natural order, i.e. does miracles.  Stenger will readily admit that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; his argument does not apply to a deist God.
</em><br />

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Brent Meeker
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The problem (or challenge :) is that the meaning of &quot;natural order&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is open to much debate, especially here on the Everything List.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Everything is up for grabs, so much so that it can be a challenge to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; figure out where any order comes from, resulting in problems such as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; white rabbits.  When we start with Everything, the problem is not just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;How can anything interesting happen (like life, not to mention our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stereotypical 'miracles'?&quot; (the something-from-nothing question),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but also &quot;How can any order be birthed out of the plenitudinous sea
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of disorder?&quot;  So in this Everything context, not having the whole
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; picture of what the &quot;natural order&quot; is implies a lack of knowledge
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of what it would be to &quot;intervene&quot; on the natural order.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course if we're talking about theism, then the nature of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;intervention&quot; is limited by certain parameters related to whatever
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; god is supposedly intervening.  These parameters are a function of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contingent aspects, such as, in the case of the biblical God's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe, the presence of evil and sacrificial love.  But such facts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are probably considered too contingent for a List like this, where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Everything is supposed to be impersonal.  (Is it?)


</em><br />
0-personal, yes.  I can argue we got that idea from Plotinus and his 
<br />
followers (the neoplatonist christians and non christians). The &quot;one&quot; 
<br />
is not a thinker, nor even a person. That was clear earlier for many 
<br />
among the Chinese &quot;philosophers&quot;.




<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Unfortunately, as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Blaise Pascal noted, if the solution to the problem of evil is based on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contingent facts, then staying at a general metaphysical (Everything)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; level is not going to get us in contact with the solution.    One
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible insight that we can get from Everything-level discussion, if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the thinker is willing to accept it, is to realize that a solution
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; based on contingent facts in history is not ruled out by general
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; philosophical thought about Everything.  Another insight is to realize
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that there is no solution to the problem of evil (or the mind-body
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem...) at the (non-contingent) Everything level.

</em><br />
Of course I disagree. With the comp hyp, the mind-body problem is 
<br />
partially reduced into a measure problem with respect to n-person 
<br />
points of view. The evil problem, by many aspects is simpler, and 
<br />
related to incompleteness. It would be long to develop this here, but a 
<br />
remark by André Weyl, the french mathematician, could be relevant here: 
<br />
&quot;God exists because Mathematics is consistent, and the devil exists 
<br />
because we cannot prove it&quot;. (Quoted in Benacerraf paper &quot;God, the 
<br />
Devil and Gödel&quot; ref in my thesis).



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And if there's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no solution to a problem that is part of the universe, then perhaps the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (impersonal) Everything approach is not sufficient for dealing with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everything.

</em><br />
The &quot;impersonal&quot; feature is not related with &quot;our everything&quot; approach. 
<br />
It is related with any scientific approach. Science *is* third 
<br />
personal. But this does not mean that science cannot study &quot;first 
<br />
person&quot; matter. It is enough to provide a third person approach to 
<br />
first person notion.



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Getting back to the more impersonal question, as has been observed on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this List multiple times, there is a problem with discerning the source
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of order in the universe.


</em><br />
In which &quot;universe&quot;? (physical, mathematical, computer-theoretical, 
<br />
arithmetical ...).
<br />
The word universe is worst than the word &quot;god&quot; in the sense that many 
<br />
people, since about 1500 years, take for granted that there is a 
<br />
primitively physical universe. But such an assumption is no more an 
<br />
explanation than the dishonest use of &quot;God&quot; during centuries.




<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Where does this natural order come from that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we can make laws about it, and predict nature's actions fairly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; accurately, at least for our purposes?  Why is it that we aren't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; destroyed by savage white rabbits out of nowhere?

</em><br />
yes that's the question we talk about since a long time.



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Proposed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explanations include the use of ideas such as the Anthropic Principle,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Occam's Razor, some kind of &quot;measure&quot;, numbers, local order at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the expense of disorder somewhere else far away, etc.  So again, in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; light of this lack of understanding, it seems pretty presumptuous for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; us to say that there must not be interventions in the natural order
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simply because we don't see any as we've defined them.


</em><br />
I agree with you. But the word &quot;god&quot; and &quot;natural order&quot; are very 
<br />
fuzzy, and rather dangerous to use out of an axiomatic or scientific 
<br />
context, and, as I said, such notion have been out of the realm of 
<br />
ratio since the closure of Plato Academy.



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Then we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; trap ourselves even more when we attach the label &quot;natural order&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to Everything we observe, whether we can explain it &quot;naturally&quot; or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not.)  Perhaps the following analogy will help to open up the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possibilities (not probabilities!) in our brains.  This is from C.S.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Lewis as he put it in his book &quot;Miracles&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Tom
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Let us suppose a race of people whose peculiar mental limitation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; compels them to regard a painting as something made up of little
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; coloured dots which have been put together like a mosaic.  Studying the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brushwork of a great painting through their magnifying glasses, they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discover more and more complicated relations between the dots, and sort
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; these relations out, with great toil, into certain regularities.  Their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; labour will not be in vain.  These regularities will in fact
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;work&quot;; they will cover most of the facts.  But if they go on to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conclude that any departure from them would be unworthy of the painter,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and an arbitrary breaking of his own rules, they will be far astray.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For the regularities they have observed never were the rule the painter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was following.  What they painfully reconstruct from a million dots,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arranged in an agonizing complexity, he really produced with a single
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lightning-quick turn of the wrist, his eye meanwhile taking in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; canvass as a whole and his mind obeying laws of composition which the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observers, counting their dots, have not yet come within sight of, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perhaps never will.  I do not say that the normalities of Nature are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unreal.  The living fountain of divine energy, solidified for purposes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of this spatio-temporal Nature into bodies moving in space and time,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and thence, by our abstract thought, turned into mathematical formula,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does in fact, for us, commonly fall into such and such patterns. But to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think that a disturbance of them would constitute a breach of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; living rule and organic unity whereby God, from his own point of view,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; works, is a mistake. If miracles do occur then we may be sure that not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to have wrought them would be the real inconsistency.&quot;



</em><br />
Nice but unconvincing, because the word &quot;miracle&quot; has no clear meaning, 
<br />
or perhaps a too much clear meaning in our civilization.
<br />
It cannot be an inconsistency, so in the everything-like theories (like 
<br />
comp and QM), a miracle can only be a rare event. But even this could 
<br />
be used in a non scientific way for explaining too much away. Is the 
<br />
origin of life a rare quantum possibility? I doubt it, and I think that 
<br />
such a  move should not be taken too quickly. Is the origin of numbers 
<br />
a miracle? I cannot conceive it like that, but then I know numbers are 
<br />
*the* most unexplained mystery, something going beyond the human mind 
<br />
and apparently even beyond the lobian mind (of machine or angels). But 
<br />
a mystery is not a miracle.
<br />
Number theory is full of mysteries, and incredible &quot;coincidences&quot;, but 
<br />
only a man, or a (lobian) entity can &quot;feel&quot; such lack of understanding 
<br />
...
