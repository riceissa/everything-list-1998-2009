Yes indeed! You've just rediscovered the &quot;quantum theory of immortality&quot;, 
<br />
and this was one of the central ideas that gave rise to this list. Look up 
<br />
&quot;Max Tegmark quantum suicide experiment&quot; in the list archives or using a web 
<br />
search engine.
<br />
<br />Actually, a basic version of this idea also occurred to me years ago, but 
<br />
everyone I mentioned it to at the time thought I was mad, so I shut up about 
<br />
it. It is only in the last few years that I have learned others have had the 
<br />
same thought, often also arrived at independently. The earliest reference to 
<br />
such an idea I could find was from Ludwig Boltzmann, although I have lost 
<br />
the reference.  My theory was simply that, if time and/or space are infinite 
<br />
and non-repetetive, then everything that can happen, does happen. This means 
<br />
that purely by chance, a very long time in the future and probably far, far 
<br />
away, a replica of your mind at the point just before the apparently fatal 
<br />
crash will come into being, and you will find yourself alive in probably 
<br />
very different surroundings. Later, I learned that the Universe was either 
<br />
going to collapse in a &quot;big crunch&quot; or else expand and cool forever, and 
<br />
that even such apparently stable particles as protons will eventually all 
<br />
decay - thus robbing us of the time spans needed for my fanciful 
<br />
resurrection. The Everett &quot;many worlds&quot; interpretation of quantum mechanics 
<br />
offers one way around this. Frank Tipler's Omega Point theory offers another 
<br />
way of resurrection out of the big crunch, although his book &quot;The Physics of 
<br />
Immortality&quot; is marred by its reliance on sometimes dubious physics and on 
<br />
bizarre religious mythology. Thinking about my old idea again recently, it 
<br />
occurred to me that even &quot;conventional&quot; (non-MWI, non-pilot wave, 
<br />
shut-up-and-calculate) quantum theory may offer the required incredibly 
<br />
improbable resurrection, given enough time. Quantum mechanics allows the 
<br />
popping into existence, and subsequent rapid annihilation, of 
<br />
particles/antiparticles out of literally nothing - sometimes called &quot;vacuum 
<br />
fluctuations&quot;. This would seem to violate laws of conservation of 
<br />
mass/energy and the theory that entropy always increases with time; the 
<br />
usual explanation given for this anomaly is that these laws still apply *on 
<br />
average*, over time, as the fluctuations are transient and usually brief. My 
<br />
understanding of the matter, however, is that in principle, an entire 
<br />
universe could arise out of this process as a sort of bubble of negative 
<br />
entropy in a cold and lifeless eternity. It is extremely unlikely to happen, 
<br />
and perhaps becomes less and less likely as the unverse continuously runs 
<br />
down (not sure about this, however), but when you have eternity to play 
<br />
with, it even becomes certain that you will beat the casino!
<br />
<br />I'd be interested to hear of any other versions of this 
<br />
everything/immortality theory that people you about, and also of how you 
<br />
came up with similar ideas and the responses you had from people you told.

<br />
<br /><br />Another quickie:
<br />
<br />Assume I survive a car/plane crash which we assume could have many
<br />
different quantum outcomes including me (dead || alive)
<br />
<br />Since I was the same person (entire life history) up until the
<br />
crash/quantum 'branch' - then can't I assume that since there was at
<br />
least one outcome where I survived, that TO ME I will always survive
<br />
other such life/death branches?
<br />
<br />Furthermore if I witness a crash where someone dies can I assume that
<br />
the victim will survive in their own &quot;world&quot; so far as at least one
<br />
quantum branch of survivability seems possible?
