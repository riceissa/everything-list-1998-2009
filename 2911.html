<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;why the world is understandable and this is why there are no white rabbits.

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;White rabbits are not consistent.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;BM: Unfortunately I don't think this is true. The problem with the white
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; rabbits is that there are consistent! For exemple we can dream of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; white rabbits.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This is too simplistic.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It could be that we differ because of semantics or maybe because of confusion
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with regard the frame of reference. Let's explore the issue with some thought
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;experiments.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;1) Let's consider dreams that I've had. I have dreamt many times of flying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(white rabbits? to be determined). In those dreams, I strongly believe that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;flying is a natural ability that I have and I wonder why sometimes in the so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;call real world I cannot fly. Everything in the dream world seems to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consistent and I can fly. Flying, from the dream world perspective is not a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;white rabbit. In fact the so called real world seems to be false and not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;having
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the ability to fly IS a white rabbit!
</em><br />
<br />I'm afraid I don't think dreams are thought experiment (unless you take TE
<br />
in the trivial sense of any mind experience). I think dreams are definitely
<br />
real experiences. Funny, bizare, delightfull or frightening, ....
<br />
I write my nocturnal dreams since 1976 and the first application of G and G*
<br />
(and Z and Z*) was on the dream state (including the relation with Descartes'
<br />
Cogito).
<br />
It is true that in some dreams you can do experiment, though.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;In the dream world,  the rule of physics seem to be different and allow 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;flying.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;My belief system appears to conform to those physical laws and I do not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;find any contradiction. Flying is OK in the dream world!
</em><br />
<br /><br />Indeed.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The resolution of the paradox is simple. The frames of reference are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;different.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;What appears to be a white rabbit in one frame  is not in another! 
</em><br />
<br /><br />Do you think the dream and awake state are symmetrical?
<br />
I am not sure. It seems to me that in the dream state you can realise 
<br />
you are dreaming, but that in the &quot;awake&quot; state you can never realise 
<br />
you are awake. &quot;awakenings&quot; go from more relative inconsistencies to
<br />
less relative inconsistencies. 
<br />
<br />(To be awake is akin to &lt;&gt;t, to be
<br />
dreaming is akin to []f, at least in a first approximation.)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now, is the dream world frame of reference consistent? As far as I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;tested it it was. I did not do much testing.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You do what is called &quot;lucid dreams&quot;. Dreams in which you are aware you 
<br />
are dreaming (or dream with narration including sentences like &quot;I dream&quot;
<br />
for a more positivistic definition).
<br />
With training you can test more and more. The ninethteen century is full
<br />
of big dreamers who test consistencies of their dreams. Their works, 
<br />
although quite systematic, has been a little hidden by Freud attempt
<br />
to interpret dreams.
<br />
(Frederic van Eeden, La marquis Hervey de St. Denys) etc.
<br />
<br />Oh OK, I see on your more recent post that you practice and know about
<br />
lucid dream. 
<br />
<br />I have coined the term &quot;contralucid dreams&quot; for the dream in which you
<br />
assert yourself &quot;I am NOT dreaming&quot;. They are the royal road toward
<br />
metaphysical doubts.
<br />
<br />Do you know the experimental verification of lucide dreams by Hearne 
<br />
and those by Laberge. During the dream your muscle are disconnected
<br />
in some way, except the ocular muscles, so during a lucid dream you can
<br />
communicate with people in the sleep laboratory.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;2) Here is an example in which a kind of dream state Uncertainty Principle 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;seems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to preserve consistency. 
</em><br />
<br />Latter (I am super-buzy) I will tell you my dream n° 423 (23 february 1983)
<br />
which illustrates very well that &quot;consistency preservation&quot; point.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I dream sometimes of seeing shapes and color ( these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are a form of phospenes produced by the brain in the dream state.) These
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;phospenes begin as relatively simple geometric patterns but then, as I enter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;deeper into the dream state, they evolve into wonderful geometrical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;shapes, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;animals or people etc... They are so beautiful that I try to stop them form
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;changing, to be able to analyze them in detail. A soon as I attempt to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;focus on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;them, they disappear. I can't perform any kind of consistency analysis on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;them.
</em><br />
<br />Mmhh...Those images are probably hypnagogical images. Tibetan Buddist 
<br />
have studied them quite in deep. A tibetan test for knowing if you are 
<br />
dreaming or in a hypnagogical state is trying looking at your hands. 
<br />
Normally during hypnagogical imagery you should not be able to see your
<br />
hands.
<br />
EEG are different too.
<br />
Unfortunately I get hypnagogical images only one time until now, so I have
<br />
not been able to test my hands.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;3) Here is another dream which illustrates how the discovery of an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;inconsistency
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;brings the dream to an end. 
</em><br />
<br />It is not necessary to wake up at this moment, but OK you know that.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I sometimes dream of out of body experiences Are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;they real or not? Being a amateur physicist -even in my dreams - I want to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;if these experiences are &quot;real&quot;. So I give myself a test: to find out what is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the arrangement of certain objects in another room.  When I tried that I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;came up
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;blank. I just couldn't do it. So, in the dream, I realized that these out of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;body experiences were not real and that I was dreaming. This realization,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;effectively, put an end to the dream - even though I continued dreaming, I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;knew
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it was a fake.
</em><br />
<br />It is a lucid OBE. You know you were dreaming. It is a kind of lucid dreams.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;To summarize:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;White rabbits are inconsistent by definition. The issue is &quot;inconsistent with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;respect which frame of reference?&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If we dream of a real world white rabbit (inconsistency as seen from the real
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;world point of view) then it may be perfectly consistent in the dream 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;world. If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it is consistent in the dream world, no problem. No paradox in the dream 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;world.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;No paradox in the real world..
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If we dream of a dream world white rabbit (inconsistency as seen from the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;dream
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;world point of view), then we realize the dream world is a fake and we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;wake up.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;No more dream world. No more paradox.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;We can resolve the white rabbit paradox if we take relativity seriously.
</em><br />
<br />But not too much. In the sense: you cannot relativise everything.
<br />
If you do that you will relativise your relativisation, and that produces the
<br />
smell of the absolute, isn't it? 
<br />
<br />Violation of Bell's inequality are evidence that the &quot;physical&quot; is a product of
<br />
dream sharing. (BTW I agree with you contra Schmidhuber: I don't think that we
<br />
can emulate random quantum correlations with pseudorandom generators, unless
<br />
P = NP or something similar!).
