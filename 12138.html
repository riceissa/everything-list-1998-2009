Hi Stathis,
<br />
<br />RE: Zombie Room
<br />
The zombie room is now in a paper on solipsism and is in review and I
<br />
expect will be rejected in due course! :-) Over XMAS I hope to catch up on
<br />
all my mail. It's proven to be a really useful cross-modal thought
<br />
experiment because it renders a human 'methodologically zombied' without
<br />
having to assume physiological alteration (just life-long entrapment!).
<br />
<br />The room, including its inhabitant Marvin, is a zombie from the outside.
<br />
If the 'room' was actually inside a giant lifelike robot human. It's
<br />
animation by the zombir room would be pathetic. It would have no clue
<br />
where it was and learn nothing looking remotely normal. Meanwhile Marvin
<br />
inside can do perfectly good 'zombie room' science.
<br />
<br /><br />RE: Computer Pain
<br />
There's a whole axis of modelling orthogonal to the soma membrane which
<br />
gets statistically abstracted out by traditional Hodkin/Huxley models. The
<br />
neuron becomes geometry-less (except for when the HH model is made into
<br />
'cable'/compartmental equivalents for longitudinal transmission). The new
<br />
modelling I am doing undoes what HH did. There's nothing wrong with it -
<br />
it just throws away all the experience components, which are physics
<br />
occurring at right angles to the HH propogation.
<br />
<br />The electric field, which is massive and intricately choreographed, cannot
<br />
be eliminated. It must be fully expressed in space just as a neuron does.
<br />
All the chemical complexities don't matter except insofar as they serve to
<br />
manipulate the electric field in space. My EC calculus says 'why it's like
<br />
something' to be these fields (again I am still working on this!).
<br />
<br />In my model, for very specific reasons of physics, computationalism,
<br />
functionalism, representationalism, eliminativism are all false. This does
<br />
not mean that there is no 'abstract computation', no 'functional
<br />
structure', no 'representation'.... it just means that these things are
<br />
not _causal_ of phenomenal consciosuness - they merely serve to manipulate
<br />
it appropriately for the purposes of cognition.
<br />
<br />So - 'action potentials' will be an emergent feature of the physics, not
<br />
modelled. All the chemistry manipulating the membrane conductance (and
<br />
therefore its effectiveness as a dielectric) are eliminatable in favour of
<br />
simpler gating mechanisms. You do not have to have a cytoskeleton - merely
<br />
a dielectric. Synapses are all irrelevant. They are constructed so as not
<br />
to interfere with the overall soma fiald expression (by the way -
<br />
astrocytes are more important in this than neurons!)...... except that in
<br />
some heavy mass-synaptic firing conditions - maybe in the cerebellum there
<br />
may be field effects in the dendritic trees that are 'like something'....
<br />
not sure yet.... but my bet is no.
<br />
<br />Also, by implementing 'virtual circuits' orthogonal to the membrane
<br />
dependent on synchrony/asynchrony in 3D space, the soma fialds have a role
<br />
in learning in that they maintain channels down which (along with other
<br />
sources of chemistry)  chemistry flows to modify synapses and build new
<br />
neural hardware/shape changes.
<br />
<br />So overall: unless the computational substrate has this stuff built into
<br />
it there will be no experiences. End of story. My PhD will eventually
<br />
contribute to an experiment to prove this. I have to build new chips tho.
<br />
<br />Nature has made a wonderful, amazing piece of kit in the neuron/astrocyte.
<br />
We have barely begun to get it what it is really doing. Unjustified
<br />
computationalist/functionalist hubris and assumption based on simplistic
<br />
models from &gt;50 years ago will not do.
<br />
<br />Which is why I find the idea of computer pain so odd.
<br />
<br />Cheers,
<br />
<br />Colin Hales

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hi Colin,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I thought you'd react in this way. It is a prediction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of computationalism that running certain lines of code
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should generate pain (and every other type of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience). I realise it seems absurd when put like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this, but there you have it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I very much doubt that a superficial or top-down
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; copy of an organism in pain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (which would be very easy to build) would actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience pain, but a bottom-up copy, an emulation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the individual neurons which resulted in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behaviour similar to the original organism...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I find it as difficult to imagine such a being not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being conscious as a fellow organic human not being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious. But I certainly don't expect the &quot;pain code&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for such a being to be anything like what you have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indicated below.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you believe that computer emulation of neural tissue
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behaviour will fail, at which step do you think it will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fail? The action potential, the cytoskeleton,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the effect of the neurotransmitters at the synapses, or where?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Also, you never explained if Marvin + machine is a zombie or not a
</em><br />
zombie.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Stathis Papaioannou
