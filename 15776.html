<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cannot attribute a measure to my 1-pov in either step because the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; outcome is truly random.
</em><br />
<br /><br />It is because an event can be random or probabilistic that we have to  
<br />
put a measure on it (like a distribution of probabilities, or of  
<br />
credibilities).
<br />
<br />Example: the perfect throwing of the perfect coin gives an random  
<br />
experience with a probability &quot;measure&quot; HEAD = 1/2, TAIL = 1/2.
<br />
<br />I will ask you questions, if you don't mind. I prefer to ask question  
<br />
and illustrate the use of the word in place of teaching you the  
<br />
probability theory.
<br />
<br />- Do you agree that if you throw a coin, you have a probability of 1/2  
<br />
to get HEAD?
<br />
- Do you agree that if you throw a dice, you have a probability of 1/6  
<br />
to get &quot;six&quot;?
<br />
- Do you agree that if you play lottery, you will win the biggest  
<br />
price with a probability like 1/&lt;big number&gt;
<br />
<br />In most discrete case, we can infer equivalence of the elementary  
<br />
events on the base of symmetry (like in the old Pascal probability  
<br />
calculus).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here I would merely like to ask, random to whom?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Fair enough. In all situation which will interest us: it means &quot;random  
<br />
for the subject who performs the (first person) experience&quot;.
<br />
You are the one throwing the dice? Then it will be random for you  
<br />
(despite it will be random for your friend too, but perhaps not for  
<br />
God).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Doesn't random mean
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that no conscious mind (mine or yours) can see the determinism behind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I could agree, although it is not necessary to dig on such detailed  
<br />
analysis, imo.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; We are tempted to say &quot;probability 1/2&quot; but that is only a comp-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; style &quot;bet&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I am not sure I understand. There is just one comp bet: the &quot;yes  
<br />
doctor&quot;, which we can be paraphrased in step 1by &quot;I survive (or I go  
<br />
to Mars) with probability 1&quot;. (and idem in step 2)
<br />
But in step 3, ASSUMING comp, it is hard for me to see any difference  
<br />
with the throwing of a coin, *for the subject of the experience*.
<br />
<br />Suppose I propose the following two type of experiences/experiments.  
<br />
The ROOM ZERO and the ROOM ONE are NOT distinguishable from inside  
<br />
(but are of course distinguishable from outside). In particular, to  
<br />
make things 100% clear later, i add in both room a close box with a  
<br />
bottle of whisky inside. And you know this fact about the rooms.
<br />
<br />Type 1 experience: I make you asleep, then I throw a coin, if the  
<br />
outcome is HEAD I put you in the ROOM ZERO, if I get TAIL, I put you  
<br />
in the ROOM ONE. In the room, I wake you up, and I ask you to evaluate  
<br />
the chance of finding whisky in the box, and then the chance  
<br />
(probability) of being in room ZERO.
<br />
<br />Type 2 experience: I make you asleep, then I scan you and annihilate  
<br />
you, and I reconstitute you in both rooms ZERO and ONE.  I wake you up  
<br />
in both room. In both rooms, you have to evaluate the chance  
<br />
(probability) of being in room ZERO or ONE,  and the chance of
<br />
finding whisky in the box.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;From the first person points of view, sequences of such experience  
<br />
will seem equivalent, except for the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; or &quot;white rabbit&quot;  
<br />
youS, which will believe in special computable sequences. OK?
<br />
<br />Now the question can be asked BEFORE you undergo the experience. You  
<br />
can predict you will have whisky with probability 1. So you can  
<br />
predict that you will NOT know in which room you are with probability  
<br />
one. So you can predict with certainty that you *will be* uncertain of  
<br />
which room you are. So you are now not knowing in which room you will  
<br />
be. So the 1/2 can be lifted in your past. You could not have known!  
<br />
(This I sum up by the drawing: Y = II, bifurcation of &quot;futures&quot;  
<br />
differentiates the &quot;pasts&quot;)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You explained on this in Step 2:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;We see that the MEC hypothesis, generally considered as imposing a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; strong determinacy in nature, introduces on the contrary a form of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; strong indeterminacy. Even a God, or whatever possible Omniscient
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Being, cannot predict to you, before a duplication (of you)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiment, where you will feel to be after. If he told you &quot;you will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; feel to be the one in room A&quot;, the &quot;Kim&quot; in room A will say that such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; God was right, but the one in room B will know or believe that that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; God was wrong, and the point of MEC is that we have no reason to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; listen more to one Kim than to the other Kim. In particular the Kim of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; room A will not convince the Kim of room B, that &quot;God&quot; was right. No
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Kim will ever be able to convince its counterpart about any possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; method of prediction for the particular future.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I want to grok this more. At this stage I can only believe you.
</em><br />
<br /><br />No, please, you should'nt. Hope the explanation above has clarified.  
<br />
Take your time, ask any question.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; always felt (with Einstein) that reality is fundamentally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deterministic, even if we have to point to stochastic features along
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the way.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I follow Einstein. Like the Everettian. Everett provide an  
<br />
interpretation of QM where reality is fundamentally deterministic,  
<br />
yet, shows that the deterministic main equation of QM, SWE, explains  
<br />
why observers, from their point of view, met indeterminacies, and how  
<br />
they can put measure on them and do the usual quantum probability  
<br />
calculus. In a nutshell: the observation of a quantum superposition is  
<br />
seen as a self-duplication experience, or a differentiation of a  
<br />
history.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I know you will be able to debunk this easily and to my (and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Einstein's) satisfaction.
</em><br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;From what Einstein said in the EPR paper, and from the extreme  
<br />
confirmation of QM which has continued, I would think that Einstein  
<br />
would have adopted Everett, and then eventually comp. It is the same  
<br />
philosophy. Einstein missed comp by its &quot;conventionalist math&quot;  
<br />
blindness perhaps, togethet with the fact that he was not interested  
<br />
in computer science.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maybe dwell a little on this
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK. Tell me if you get the point of above. Throwing a coin, and self- 
<br />
duplication are identical first person experiences.
<br />
You have to really do the thought experiences.
<br />
If I duplicate you in room 1 and 2, with repetition (iteratively), you  
<br />
could predict that you will be the one with the diary 111111111...,
<br />
But all your doppelganger (the 1011100010..., the 0000000...) will  
<br />
know they were wrong. The &quot;111111111...&quot; *is* the first person white  
<br />
rabbit experience, that we should not, in this protocol, take into  
<br />
account.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and then move
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on to Step 5 where you manage to email me to me.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Hmmm... It is just a teleportation without annihilation of the  
<br />
original. I scan you on earth, and then I send the info on Mars where  
<br />
you are reconstituted. the question is what is the probability that  
<br />
you will find yourself on Mars, what is the probability you stay on  
<br />
Earth. from you first person point of view you will not live both. OK?  
<br />
It is really a duplication, with a zero delay on one of its branch.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is truly scary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because here I meet &quot;myself&quot;. I recall with horror what Angier did
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about his double in &quot;The Prestige&quot;...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Actually, I believe I have already met my double.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Well, yes, you should already in step 3 ! In all duplication you can  
<br />
meet your doppelganger. It is the main relationship between the  
<br />
prestige and comp: self-duplication. It is the key basic construction  
<br />
of the UDA and AUDA. I got all this by looking at amoeba, paramecium,  
<br />
Euglena, and even Bacteria. I am inspired by &quot;real&quot; biology at the  
<br />
start. I have discovered computer science in the jacob and Monod paper  
<br />
on the Operon Lactose (a genetic sugar regulation system in the  
<br />
bacteria Escherichia Coli). My first models of self-replication where  
<br />
carbon based until i discover Gödel's proof which makes me suspect  
<br />
that carbon has nothing to do with the key life principles.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Once, a man stopped
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; outside my house and stroked my cat, which was on the verandah. I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; greeted him and he told me that he had a cat that looked exactly like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my cat and that it was his dearest and most cherished friend (I feel
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; much the same way about my cat). I then asked him what name he had
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; given his cat. He told me &quot;Cindy Bingy&quot;. I think my mouth must have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fallen open in shock because that is the name of my cat too. From
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; memory, the man looked rather like me as well. He then walked off
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; while I stood there wondering about the improbability of all this (I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cannot remember whether cannabis was in my system at the time)
</em><br />
<br /><br />So I will not try to interpret this :)
<br />
<br />Tell me if you agree that self-duplication entails, from the first  
<br />
point of view of the person(s) a feeling of uncertainty on their first  
<br />
person future, and, when knowing the protocol, some means to evaluate  
<br />
their chance. I can use other thought experiences, like with the movie  
<br />
which I can explain in more details (perhaps the number  
<br />
2^(16180*10000)*(60*90)*24 of KIM 2.3 is not easy for you(*).
<br />
<br />Best,
<br />
<br />Bruno
<br />
<br /><br />(*) I repeat there (quote from my post to Abram and you: KIM 2.3:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;don't want to give a definition of what is a normal machine, just
<br />
that you feel the point.
<br />
<br />Let me give you another illustration which exploits the freedom of
<br />
thought a bit more. Indeed, let me duplicate you, or better,
<br />
polyplicate you into 2^(16180*10000)*(60*90)*24.
<br />
<br />I explain. I multiply you by 2^(16180*10000) in front of a
<br />
(16180*10000) pixels screen, with each possible images (black and
<br />
white) on it.
<br />
And I reiterate every 1/24 of a second that multiplication, and this
<br />
during 90 minutes, that is 90*60 seconds.
<br />
<br />What do you predict you will feel, as personal, subjective, first
<br />
person experience. What do you think is more probable, among:
<br />
<br />I will feel seeing a white screen
<br />
I will feel seeing a black screen
<br />
I will feel seeing a movie
<br />
I will feel seeing a good movie
<br />
I will feel seeing &quot;2001 Space Odyssey&quot;
<br />
I will feel seeing &quot;2001 Space Odyssey&quot; with the subtitle of Caligula
<br />
I will feel seeing a random-noise-movie (what you see on TV when there
<br />
is no emission).
<br />
<br />Of course there is a sense to say: I will see all possible movies, but
<br />
this means you are talking about yourself at the third person point of
<br />
view, and here what is asked, is what do you expect to experience or
<br />
live in your future if you are invited to practice it. By MEC, you
<br />
survive, and any of your first person experience is unique, on which
<br />
of the above you would bet? What bet will you do if I tell you that I
<br />
will accompany you in the multiplication. And send you to hell if your
<br />
bet is wrong. What bet you will do if you want to optimize the chance
<br />
of not going to hell?
<br />
<br />The rest of the UDA reasoning shows that &quot;this&quot; thought experience
<br />
happens all the time in arithmetic, but the &quot;probabilities&quot;, which
<br />
eventually could be credibilities or other uncertainty measure, are
<br />
constrained by computer science/number theory. It extends the notion
<br />
of normality from the protocol above to the whole Universal Deployment
<br />
(which I will (re)define in KIM 3).
<br />
<br />Exercise: define the notion of &quot;normal first person experience&quot; for
<br />
machine in the protocol above. With the UD protocol, things are so
<br />
much complex that I will interview the Universal Machine directly to
<br />
provide hints ...
