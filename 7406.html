Hi Bruno;
<br />
<br />'intuition is always like believing that the earth is flat.'
<br />
<br />I disagree. People believed the earth was flat because it looked flat, they 
<br />
didnt intuit this idea. Intuition is not just the absence of any doubt about 
<br />
a proposition, intuition is active not passive. I intuitively dismiss the 
<br />
DH, I intuitively sense someone is angry with me etc. Not raising questions 
<br />
about whether the earth is flat is experiential naivity,  not intuition 
<br />
leading us astray.
<br />
<br />In the case of deductive reasoning, Euclid's fifth postulate is intuitively 
<br />
troublesome, intuition begs us to examine it futher, Intuition is what 
<br />
reminds us that there is a problem in it somewhere. Intuition is not the 
<br />
thing that prevents us from examining the definition of 'point'.
<br />
<br /><br />But even if Im wrong on that, even if intuition is responsible for such 
<br />
errors, I think there is a danger of over emphesising examples like 'flat 
<br />
earth theory' as if it is common for intuition to lead to error, or that 
<br />
intuition is naive. For many reasons I think that is wrong. Intuition is 
<br />
experience in action, it is functioning wisdom. It is refined and precise, 
<br />
and almost always right.
<br />
<br /><br />'my intuition is that I should not follow my intuition :) But analytically, 
<br />
I tend to believe that the doomsday argument is a definite quite convincing 
<br />
argument that the doomsday is for soon'
<br />
<br />Im troubled by the extent to which counter intuitive ideas are embraced 
<br />
seemingly /because/ they are counter intuitive. It almost becomes the case 
<br />
that the more counter intuitive a hypothesis is, the more we trust it. 
<br />
Theoretical physics is testament to that surely?
<br />
<br />What is counter intuitive about the DH is that it offers no understandable 
<br />
mechanism for its conclusion. This is what immediately strikes one when you 
<br />
read the DH for the first time, there is an air of supernatural about it. 
<br />
How can the eventual population of the universe - however reference classes 
<br />
are defined - ever have a  backwardly causal relationship with a cataclysm 
<br />
today? Johnathon touched upon this in one of his latest posts. Very really 
<br />
the DH supposes that unrealised futures effect the present. This is 
<br />
different from the supposedly 'counter intuitive' conclusion that the earth 
<br />
is an orb rather than flat. There is nothing illogical or conceptually 
<br />
difficult about the earth being spherical rather than flat, I can picture 
<br />
either, however, i cant picture how a possible population count in the 
<br />
future could effect  what happens now.
<br />
<br />Then when examining other baysean thought experiments, it begins to become 
<br />
clear that there is nothing unique about the DH and its superstitious 
<br />
conclusions. The supernatural infects many thought experiments like it, and 
<br />
again this just gets my intuition buzzing. The problem is with the logic, 
<br />
not the world.
<br />
<br />Furthermore, im sure that your expressed belief in the truth of the DH 
<br />
doesnt /actually/ interfere with your day to day routine. You argue with 
<br />
folk like me, rather than build bunkers in preparation for the apocalypse. 
<br />
Why? If not because basically you dont agree with it. The DH is a conclusion 
<br />
we endevour to refute, not embrace. But, lets say the end of the world is 
<br />
next saturday. My point is really that of the many reasons that the world 
<br />
might end, there are no references to any of them in the DH that should lead 
<br />
us to trust it. We can perhaps talk about foxes and rabbits, of populations 
<br />
increasing and competition for food and it looks like the DH maybe has a 
<br />
point, but really the DH makes no reference to these things.
<br />
<br />Its lack of explanatory mechanism is obvious. Intuitively then it collapses 
<br />
into superstition. Its an untempered bell curve being badly interpreted. 
<br />
This is quite obvious from the ease with which counter intuitive conclusions 
<br />
can be derived from baysean reasoning in conjunction with 1rst person 
<br />
perspectives generally.
<br />
<br />Anyway Im arguing more than I wanted to about all this. I ought to go and 
<br />
download one of your papers.
<br />
<br /><br />Chris. :)

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Hi Chris,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Le 29-juin-05, à 17:49, chris peck a écrit :
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I'ld suggest its a matter of how intuition is used. My intuition can only 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;guide me in my enquiries, your intuition only you in yours. I cant 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;persuade you of the truth of a statement by appealing to my intuitive 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;feelings about it, obviously. Nevertheless, I think it is the light that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;guides enquiry. I hope it is for everyone, though clearly with Leslie and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;others seem more attracted to the counter intuitive, I have no idea why.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I agree there is a sense where only intuition is really the root of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;conclusiveness&quot;, but  intuition is always like believing that the earth is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;flat. It is rooted in locality. So globally &quot;the other of myself&quot; is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;always, at first counterintuitive: the earth is not flat! The root of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;conviction are local but when you try to see the border of what the light 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;can enlighten it is not so astonishing to be astonished, surprised, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;eventually to develop some intuition on some counter-intuitive feature of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reality (whatever it could be).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Sometime I say that common sense is the unique tool to go beyond common 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sense, I could say that for intuition. I am attracted by intuition and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;counter-intuition. I am fond of both Cantor and Brouwer. (and I add for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;later: I love both S4Grz and G which are two systems of modal logic which 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;go, arguably with the comp hyp) at the heart of intuition and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;conter-intuition.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Take the Doomsday Hypothesis, its wrong. Even if the world ended tommorow, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;it would still be the case that the Doomsday Hypothesis did not predict it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;to any satisfactory meaning of the word 'predict'. Intuitively, I'ld just 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;say it was luck that someone considered the DH on the day before. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Intuitively, I think that is obvious. But intuition doesnt explain WHY the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Doomsday Hypothesis is wrong, just that it is. Intuition is not analytical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;and really it is this that prevents it from having much persuasive power. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;But looking at Bostrum and others, its clear how they rely on intuition. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Unless the DH can be tempered in some manner, then they tend to agree that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;its conclusion is reason enough to dismiss it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;You illustrate a difficult idea (intuition) with a difficult problem (the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Doomsday argument).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Here, my intuition is that I should not follow my intuition :)  But 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;analytically, I tend to believe that the doomsday argument is a definite 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;quite convincing argument that the doomsday is for soon, once we accept 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Newton (on matter) and Aristotle (on mind). I am agnostic about that, but I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;do think that the comp hypothesis makes quickly Newton wrong on matter and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Aristotle wrong on mind, so comp is immune against the doomsday argument 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(confirming perhaps your intuition if comp is true).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;'The best one, in my opinion are those theories which justifies the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;ultimate unnameableness of the first person.'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Do you mean private by 'unnameable'?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But I cannot even be sure it is private. I think I see what you mean, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the unameability of the first person by the first person will *appear* most 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probably private. But I'm open to the ide that we share the deepest 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;intuition and I am neutral on the question how many persons exists really. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;At least with comp it is possible to explain why those questions are hard, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;even with (apparant) oversimplifications.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Are you talking about something akin to Nagel's characterisation of mind? 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;That it is subjective and consequently indescribable by a 3rd person 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;account?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I think it is related.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;'as I show in my PhD thesis (see my url). comp can explain (meta-justify) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;why the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;ultimate evidence is &quot;conclusive&quot; but ineffable.'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I'll give it a go, sounds interesting.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The game consists in taking the computationalist hypothesis, in some rather 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;precise form, totally seriously. In the literature those who does that in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;general present it as an argument ad absurdo of the falsity of mechanism. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;They &quot;prove&quot; comp -&gt; false. But actually if you look at the details they 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;just prove &quot;comp -&gt; (Newton/Aristotle is false). Actually comp proves 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;something &quot;near false&quot;. We can expect that comp leads to counterintuitive 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;propositions, but that is relative: Pythagoras, Plato, Plotinus, and some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;other were open for the kind of reality which I suspect is made necessary 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;by comp. In actual physics the closer conception to what comp makes 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;inescapable is Quantum Mechanics without Collapse, that is Everett, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Deutch...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But neither Everett nor Deutsch takes the comp hypothesis &quot;sufficiently&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;seriously. Deutsch is forced to a revisionist view on Church thesis to make 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it fitting with his physicalist conception of the multiverse for example.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;'I have use the modal logics of self-reference (Solovay's G and G'). Have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;you heard about them?'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Nope, im new to a lot of this - thus my joining. Is self reference the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;same as self perception? you know as well as refering to myself, i can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;introspect to a degree too. Mind may well be inscrutable beyond 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;introspection. I kind of think it is, though self reference is second 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;nature.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I think so. Actually here I point on Godel's incompleteness theorem; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;including its statellite theorems in computer science. If you are open to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;logic there is a gallery of surprises.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The best book is, imo, the apparently recreative Forever Undecided by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Smullyan.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;'Also, do you know the paper by Hardegree which shows that quantum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;logic can be seen as a Lewis-Stalnaker logic of the counterfactuals?'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;hmmm. I thought Stalnaker and Lewis were opposed to one another when it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;came to counterfactuals.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;They disagree like all reseachers who discover that they tackle the same 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;domain. It is an &quot;expert&quot; disagreement. Relatively to the shape of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;disagreement in this list, to decide between Lewis and Stalnaker at this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;stage of the discussion would be falling in the 1004 fallacy. Well perhaps 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not because we are making progress I think.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Lewis believes they are in some sense real, sort of like Deutsche's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;multiverse, or  infinate number of m-branes and so on, in which anything 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;logically possible has been actualised at least in one universe or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;another.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I think you point on a recent paper by Lewis which I keep for july ;)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  I think Stalnaker would disagree with that, possible worlds are just 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;convenient ways of considering possibility, rather than actuality. im sure 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;this is all obvious to you, I'll read your PHD and see if I agree with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;that. I hope there isnt too much math.:)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Perhaps. Stalnaker is physicalist. He told us in &quot;Inquiry&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I am (mind-body)-problem driven. I take the best of Stalnaker and Lewis 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(and others). &quot;Best&quot; relatively to my inquiry.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I think comp makes physicalism wrong.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Have you read the posts of this list? I have made a very bad and unfair 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(but short and concise) summary recently:
