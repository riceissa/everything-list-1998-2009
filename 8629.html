Stathis,
<br />
<br />Yes, it is frightening, especially since (I think) I am an &quot;engineer, 
<br />
married with adult children, own the house you are living in and the car in 
<br />
the driveway, and so on.&quot;
<br />
<br />That is a vivid description.
<br />
<br />But even as I am being hauled away to the psychiatric ward, can I not 
<br />
logically cling to at least one belief?  According to Wikipedia, Rene 
<br />
Descartes said, &quot;But I have convinced myself that there is absolutely 
<br />
nothing in the world, no sky, no earth, no minds, no bodies. Does it now 
<br />
follow that I too do not exist? No: if I convinced myself of something [or 
<br />
thought anything at all] then I certainly existed. But there is a deceiver 
<br />
of supreme power and cunning who is deliberately and constantly deceiving 
<br />
me. In that case I too undoubtedly exist, if he is deceiving me; and let him 
<br />
deceive me as much as he can, he will never bring it about that I am nothing 
<br />
so long as I think that I am something.  So, after considering everything 
<br />
very thoroughly, I must finally conclude that the proposition, I am, I 
<br />
exist, is necessarily true whenever it is put forward by me or conceived in 
<br />
my mind.&quot; (AT VII 25; CSM II 16–17)
<br />

<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<br />
<br />&quot;If I am sane, it is impossible to know for sure that I am sane.&quot;
<br />
<br />Everybody believes he is sane, whether he is sane or not, and nobody can 
<br />
prove he is sane.  In psychiatry, this is the key problem with delusions. If 
<br />
it were possible in general to prove one's own sanity, then deluded 
<br />
patients, who more often than not retain their ability to think logically, 
<br />
would be able to demonstrate to themselves that they were deluded. But by 
<br />
definition of a delusion, this is impossible.
<br />
<br />If you want to know what it is like for a psychotic patient to have forced 
<br />
treatment, imagine that people from the local psychiatric facility knock on 
<br />
your door tonight and, after interviewing you, politely explain that your 
<br />
belief that you are an engineer, married with adult children, own the house 
<br />
you are living in and the car in the driveway, and so on, is actually all a 
<br />
systematised delusion. All the evidence you present to show you are sane is 
<br />
dismissed as part of the delusion, and all the people you thought you could 
<br />
trust explain that they agree with the psychiatric team. You are then 
<br />
invited to start taking an antipsychotic drug which, over time, will rectify 
<br />
your deranged brain chemistry so that you come to understand that your 
<br />
current beliefs are delusional. If you refuse the medication, you will be 
<br />
taken to the psychiatric ward with the help of police, if necessary, where 
<br />
you will again be offered medication, perhaps in injection form if you 
<br />
continue to refuse tablets.
<br />
<br />Frightening, isn't it?
<br />
<br />Stathis Papaioannou
