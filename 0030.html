Wei's question reminded me that I never responded to this.  I was not
<br />
able to find the reference that I was looking for so my answer will be
<br />
a bit sketchy.
<br />
<br />Mitchell Porter, &lt;mitch.domain.name.hidden&gt;, writes:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Okay, can we agree on the following:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I. The universal wavefunction (UWF) will have some representation 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the form
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sum(i) c_i |i&gt;,				(1)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where the |i&gt;s are a set of basis states.
</em><br />
<br />One thing to keep in mind is that this may be an integral over an infinite
<br />
number of base states.  That is actually how Everett wrote it.  This is
<br />
useful especially when analyzing the question of why the probabilities
<br />
work as they do.  In your web article you mention that some people have
<br />
considered the discrete case (like when there are only two basis states)
<br />
and thought that the solution is that there should be multiple copies
<br />
of some of the basis states (&quot;worlds&quot;).
<br />
<br />I don't like this solution because it does not generalize well if there
<br />
are an infinite number of basis states.  Instead in that case what you
<br />
need is to have a weighting function or norm over the infinite number
<br />
of states, where the function represents the probability of falling
<br />
into that state.  This function is in fact the square of the amplitude,
<br />
but there is no simple (and misleading, IMO) interpretation in terms of
<br />
multiple instances of some &quot;worlds&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; II. A complete description of each of the many worlds must be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; found somewhere in (1), for the many-world interpretation 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to live up to its name.
</em><br />
<br />You need more than (1), presumably; at a minimum you need the Schrodinger
<br />
equation which controls how the state function evolves based on the
<br />
physical situation.  It is controversial whether you also need to invoke
<br />
a norm like I mentioned earlier, or whether that can be deduced from the
<br />
other parts of the theory.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; III. For the concept of 'relative state' to make sense, we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; must be able to attach at least two labels to the basis
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; states, so that the UWF is written as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sum(i,j) c_ij |i;j&gt;			(2)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then we can say that the relative state of subsystem j,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; given that subsystem i is in state X, is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sum(j) c_Xj |j&gt;
</em><br />
<br />This seems like a good description for what we have in a typical
<br />
measurement interaction such as Everett is discussing.
<br />
<br />Let me skip ahead a bit to the main point:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think what *is* true is that you can start with a pure-state
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; density matrix for a coupled system, and the density matrix
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of a subsystem will evolve from a pure state into a mixture.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Back at the level of wavefunctions, decoherence does not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explain how observables come to have definite values. All
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; decoherence does is reduce the correlation between subsystems;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a decoherent state is still a superposition, it's just a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; superposition with very little entanglement.
</em><br />
<br />But, do you agree that in practice, systems such as the kind we see
<br />
around us will decohere and evolve into a state composed of multiple
<br />
relative states which have little entanglement?  I'm confused by your
<br />
phrase &quot;reduce the correlation between subsystems&quot;.  Above in III you
<br />
used the term &quot;subsystems&quot; to refer to physically separate systems which
<br />
are interacting, like a quantum particle and a macroscopic device which
<br />
measures its state.  But I don't think you are using it to mean the same
<br />
thing here.
<br />
<br />What I hope, because then I would both understand you and agree, is that
<br />
&quot;subsystems&quot; here means separate branches of the wave function, separate
<br />
relative states.  Decoherence reduces the correlation between that branch
<br />
of the wave function where the particle is spin up and that branch where
<br />
it is spin down.  The wave function is still a superposition of the two,
<br />
but there is little entanglement between the two states.
<br />
<br />If this is what you mean, then the next step is pretty straightforward.
<br />
You look at the state of the universe relative to each of these decoherent
<br />
base states, and consider that these relative states are effectivelly
<br />
independent, hence they are different worlds in the MWI.
<br />
<br />Therefore the recipe for knowing when and how worlds split is to look
<br />
at when a new set of basis vectors can be found which are mutually
<br />
decoherent.  This can in principle be derived solely from the Schrodinger
<br />
equation.  Therefore the &quot;topology&quot; of the universe, the manner in which
<br />
it can be said to split into many worlds, does in fact follow from this
<br />
basic equation which is at the core of QM.
<br />
<br />The issue of probablity is another matter, but if we restrict ourselves
<br />
solely to the question of when and how worlds split, I believe the MWI
<br />
does answer this question pretty clearly.
<br />
<br />You earlier asked about a simple harmonic oscillator and asked when it
<br />
would split.  The answer, based on this reasoning, is that it does not
<br />
split, because in such a simple system there is no decoherence which
<br />
occurs.  If you had a large number of oscillators, though, coupled in
<br />
some complicated way, then you might well see decoherence and therefore
<br />
splitting.
<br />
<br />How much of this do you agree with?
<br />
