<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;	Bruno, perhaps I'm just unusally dense today; but I dont' grasp the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;uncertainity to you write of the the Washington-Moscow thought experiment.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It seems obvious to me that when I am reconstituted in Washington and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reconstituted in Moscow then I am in both places.  
</em><br />
<br /><br />Remember that my question was (accepting comp, if only just for 
<br />
the sake of the argument)  &quot;Where will you *feel* after the duplication?&quot;
<br />
<br />You *can* indeed say &quot;I will *be* in Washington and I will *be* in 
<br />
Moscow&quot;, 
<br />
or &quot;I will *be* in both places&quot;.
<br />
In that case I say you are talking about you at the third person.
<br />
<br />But here I ask you: &quot;Where will you *feel* being after the experiment?&quot;.
<br />
The fact is that if comp is true and if the level has been correctly
<br />
chosen, you will not feel being at both place simultaneously.
<br />
The one in Moscow will say &quot;oh I am in Moscow&quot; and the one in Washington
<br />
will say &quot;oh I am in Washington&quot;. Those one which gives different
<br />
answers are what I use to call &quot;the first person&quot;.
<br />
Unless they have some telepathic power, each of them feel distinct.
<br />
(and with comp if they displays such telepathic power, it can be show
<br />
it means the level has not been rightly chosen).
<br />
<br />You can make it more precise by defining (in first approximation) the 
<br />
first person by his diary-book. The diary-book is put in a pocket, so
<br />
that it is duplicated in the experience. It has been asked to the one who 
<br />
does the experience, to write in the diary the result of 
<br />
self-localisation.
<br />
<br />With comp it is obvious (isn'it?) that no diaries will appear
<br />
with the writing of &quot;oh I feel myself being both in W or M&quot;.
<br />
<br />OK ? If you agree with the 1-3 distinction we can proceed.
<br />
The uncertainty comes when the person in Moscow asks him/herself
<br />
&quot;why am I the one in Moscow, why not the one Washington?&quot;
<br />
The experiencer realises that she/he has no means to be sure 
<br />
where he/she will feel him/herself to be in the iteration of 
<br />
that experience. The undeterminacy comes from there. OK ?
<br />
If after the experience they have no means to localise 
<br />
themselves, they just don't know where they are.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;This of course assumes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that there is no mystical, indivisble &quot;soul&quot; that is &quot;really&quot; me.  It
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;follows from the idea that my internal pyschological states derive from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physical processes of my body - and if the body is reproduced then so are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;those processes.
</em><br />
<br />Gosh this I cannot comment now. I accept it, with the proviso that
<br />
I don't take at all the expression &quot;physical processes&quot; as granted.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Perhaps you don't accept this last because you propose to derived
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physics from psychology.
</em><br />
<br />No, no. I accept (essentially) 'this last'. 
<br />
It is all the other way round. I say that
<br />
if we are machine (in the sense above) then physics *derives* from
<br />
psychology. Matter emerges from consciousnes. 
<br />
It is not a proposition. It is the quasi-logical
<br />
conclusion of the whole thought experiment.
<br />
<br />It would just be prematured to explain exactly what that
<br />
means. Of course the very meaning of physics and psychology change
<br />
a little bit. In a sense comp explains why matter emerges from 
<br />
consciousness, and even partially how. I guess I anticipate. Sorry.
<br />
<br />I will go because colleagues are waiting for my car !
