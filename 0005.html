<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) There's a certain elegant simplicity to the claim &quot;all possible universes 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exist&quot;, at least if &quot;possible&quot; is interpreted as broadly as possible, i.e.,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;not logically inconsistent&quot;.  But if you start substituting other meanings 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for &quot;possible&quot;, I think the elegance quickly disappears.  You'd then still
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have to explain why other non-logically-inconsistent universes don't exist,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and you'd have a bunch more weird universes to explain why we don't easily 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observe them.   
</em><br />
<br />Is logical consistency well defined?  For example, one possible universe is
<br />
Conway's Life game.  What would be the equivalent of logical consistency
<br />
in that universe?
<br />
<br />Is the idea that we find a mapping between symbolic logic and structures
<br />
in the universe, and that a universe for which such a mapping does not
<br />
exist is not logically consistent?
<br />
<br />Maybe logical consistency is not a necessary prerequisite for a universe
<br />
to exist.  One of the points of the Schmidhuber paper was that physical
<br />
laws would not necessarily be followed in the future, because there
<br />
would exist universes like ours in the past but unlawful in the future.
<br />
Colloquially we might say that a universe which suddenly abandons
<br />
following natural laws is not logically consistent.  But we should not
<br />
require this kind of consistency if we can avoid it (i.e. come up with
<br />
some reason why the universe does appear to be lawful).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I find the many worlds theory of quantum mechanics elegant, but not because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it can be thought of as equally the above claim with a certain odd quantum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definition of &quot;possible&quot;.  I find it elegant because it seems simpler than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the known alternatives which account for the empirical data.
</em><br />
<br />I find them elegant for the same reason, though: MW avoids the need for
<br />
the constant creation of new information.  Without MW, each time the
<br />
wave function collapses we have to come up with new random bits to set
<br />
the physical values.  With MW, the program to run the universe is much
<br />
shorter and doesn't need to come up with all these values all the time.
<br />
<br />Likewise if all universes exist we don't even have to hardwire the physical
<br />
laws of our universe, we can just iterate over all possible physical laws.
<br />
Again, the program to run the universe(s) is much smaller.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3) My basic problem with the &quot;all possible universes exist&quot; claim is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I find it hard to figure out whether my actions have any consequences.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If all possible universes exist, then for any me in one universe choosing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one action, there is another me in another universe choosing another action.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In a global sense I can't choose actions anymore.  All possible actions get
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; chosen.  
</em><br />
<br />Of course this would not go to the truth or falsity of the claim, simply
<br />
a hard problem if it turns out to be true.
<br />
<br />I think a necessary ingredient is that we have to assume that there is a
<br />
probability distribution over the universes.  Even if all universes exist,
<br />
our chances of experiencing any conceivable universes is not equal.
<br />
We pretty much are forced to believe this anyway by the fact that the
<br />
universe keeps on being lawful.
<br />
<br />Given that, even if you do make all choices, the probability distribution
<br />
over them is not even.  Some choices are more probable than others.
<br />
Without trying to get too far into the difficulties of free will in
<br />
what is now a deterministic multiverse, you could consider that your
<br />
deliberations and decisions influence this probability distribution.
<br />
Hence you have control over the fraction of the multiverse in which you
<br />
take one action vs another.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What is the set of all possible universes? Max Tegmark says its the set of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all mathematical structures, and Juergen Schmidhuber says its the set of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all Turing machines, but neither gives much justification. I tend to agree
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with Schmidhuber, if only because Tegmark's definition does not seem to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lead to an effective theory. For example, what does a uniform distribution
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on all mathematical structures mean? However it would be nice to have some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stronger justifications for assuming that only computable universes exist.
</em><br />
<br />I think there would be a mapping between mathematical structures and TM
<br />
programs.  Starting with a mathematical structure, described as a formal
<br />
system, we could have a TM start writing out theorems in that system.
<br />
In the other direction, we could create a mathematical description of
<br />
any given TM.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If we agree that all Turing machines exist, it's still not clear how they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should be interpreted as physical universes. Schmidhuber suggests that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; output of a Turing machine should be interpreted as the evolution of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe. However this is problematic because it does not lead to an easy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way to think about the complexities and probabilities of structures within
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a universe. For example, consider a simple Turing machine that enumerates
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the natural numbers. The output of this TM includes every possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; configuration of every other universe. What is the probability that I'm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; living in this TM? I don't see a straightforward way to answer this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; question under Schmidhuber's interpretation. The problem is that even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; though this universe is very simple, it would take a lot of extra
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information to find anything in it, so the simplicity of the universe as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whole is deceptive.
</em><br />
<br />Using Schmidhuber's mapping, the universe states would be 0, 1, 10, 11,
<br />
100, 101, 110, 111, ....  I don't see any simple mapping which would make
<br />
this look at all like the universe we live in.  For example, one of the
<br />
characteristics of this kind of counting is that there is a lot of change
<br />
at the right hand side and very little at the left, and we don't really
<br />
see that kind of behavior in our universe, which is somewhat homogeneous.
<br />
<br />Now, maybe there could be some more complex mapping, where bits in this
<br />
counting string get mapped sparsely throughout the universe in some
<br />
complicated way.  This mapping problem is one which AI philosophers face
<br />
as well: there is a mapping between the thermal motions of the atoms of
<br />
a stone and the neuron firing patterns of a brain.  I think the solution
<br />
is that in some sense the mapping has to be simple, or else the mapping
<br />
is doing all the work.
<br />
<br />Consider a more plausible candidate for the states of our universe.
<br />
Each short substring represents the physical presence or absence of an
<br />
elementary particle at a particular location of spacetime.  The time
<br />
slices are at the Planck scale and are with respect to some arbitrary
<br />
but realistic reference frame.
<br />
<br />Suppose this interpretation does lead to a universe which looks just
<br />
like ours.  Now, there would be a mapping from the simple counting
<br />
string to this one, but the mapping would be as large as the program
<br />
which created this realistic universe.  So that shouldn't count.
<br />
<br />The mapping from strings to universe states should be simple and obvious,
<br />
and if it's not, change the TM program until you get output strings which
<br />
do have a simple and obvious mapping.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; As an alternative, I suggest that each Turing machine should be thought of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as taking the coodinates of a region of a universe as input and producing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the content of that region as output. Here region should be broadly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interpreted. It not only refers to volumes of space-time, but may also for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; example specify a branch of a quantum superposition.
</em><br />
<br />I think you have a mapping problem here as well.  With enough creativity
<br />
in defining my coordinate system I could map our universe to your counting
<br />
TM.  Basically I think your definition will be equivalent to the other
<br />
one in terms of program size.

<br />
<br />In Schmidhuber's model, the Turing machine creates strings composed of
<br />
zeros, ones, and commas.  We then interpret the commas as separators and
<br />
get a series of numbers.  We then further interpret the series of numbers
<br />
as universe states indexed by time.
<br />
<br />(This interpretation has some obvious limitations; all universes must
<br />
have discrete time steps, and the amount of information at each time
<br />
index must be finite.  Probably a more elaborate mapping could address
<br />
these, although it's not clear that a universe with general relativity
<br />
and quantum mechanics fits very well into this scheme.)
<br />
<br />Given this kind of interpretation, the TM is superfluous at this level.
<br />
We could simply say, &quot;all strings exist&quot;, and interpret certain strings
<br />
as corresponding to certain universes.
<br />
<br />The TM comes into play when we want to get a probability distribution.
<br />
This is done based on the length of the shortest program which emits a
<br />
given string; universes with shorter programs are assumed to be more
<br />
probable, if we are so inclined.
<br />
<br />An equivalent formulation would be to go back to the strings and say that
<br />
the probability of a given string is based on its algorithmic complexity.
<br />
<br />A question here is whether the strings actually have to be written down or
<br />
otherwise instantiated in some universe in order to allow our perceptions
<br />
to exist.  Likewise does the TM in Schmidhuber's model actually have to
<br />
run somewhere?
<br />
<br />Tegmark takes a Platonic view, the idea being that a sufficiently complex
<br />
mathematical system inherently leads to what feels like a real universe.
<br />
Nobody actually has to write down the equation, or run the simulation.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From the inside, we can't tell whether that is being done or not.  This
</em><br />
viewpoint could apply to the string or TM models as well.
<br />
<br />A Platonic model make it harder to see why a probability distribution
<br />
should exist.  But even one where the TM has to exist doesn't really
<br />
explain what the a priori probablities should be very well, IMO.
