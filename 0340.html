<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	A computation involves a set of states, labeled by one or more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indices, with state transition rules between them.  A trace of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computation occurs when it starts out in one state, transits to the next
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; state indicated by the rules, and so on.  A physical system implements
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such a trace when there is a legitimate mapping from the physical states
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the formal states, such that the states mapped to perform the trace.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The unsolved problem is which mappings are legitimate and reflect the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information in the physical system, and which are illegitimate and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; artificially introduce too much information.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	What a string lacks is the state transition laws.  There is no way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that what the concept of 'if ... then' refers to can be a property of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; string.  A string just is what it is; counterfactuals have no meaning for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it.  A physical system has not only functions like x(t) and y(x), it has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; laws of nature such as x(t+1) = y(x(t)), and computations reflect that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very important aspect of nature, dynamics.  Note that a law must be a true
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; equation, but a true equation is just a coincidence, a mere fact (even if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it holds for all x,y,t) unless it is a law.  Laws are prescriptive, not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; descriptive, unlike information; they make decisions.
</em><br />
<br />It's not at all clear to me what counterfactuals have to do with
<br />
consciousness. So what if counterfactuals have no meaning for strings?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	I doubt that.  Remember, they are printed out at the end, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; having that criterion would confer no evolutionary advantage in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meantime.  Intelligence would.  I think it would be very likely that some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; criterion could be selected that would be both easy to recognize and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unlikely to occur before the evolution of intelligence.
</em><br />
<br />Ok, I didn't realize that you wanted to evolve the neural nets in a
<br />
(simulated) natural environment. Presumably it would be the same
<br />
environment as we and our ancestors faced. If you're right and this really
<br />
is the shortest program to output the state of an intelligent being, then
<br />
I have no objection to the possibility that my consciousness is actually
<br />
produced by such a program.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	I think that would have to be a huge program.  Huge.  Each step -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Plank scale to low energy, wave functional to particles, types of atoms,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; molecules, neurons and their connections, etc. - huge.  I mean, you try
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; writing that algorithm.  How long would it take you?  If not long, then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; show me the money.
</em><br />
<br />Well it would take me a long time to write the program, but the result
<br />
shouldn't be too long. (Of course you do know that finding the shortest
<br />
program to output a string is a noncomputable problem?)  Of course I don't
<br />
have time to do it (unless someone wants to give me a research grant?) so
<br />
I can't show it to you. But your own proposal is even less complete. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	Structure labeled how?  By connections and interaction strengths
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; among the neurons?  For the AI, the pattern of spatial locations of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; momory elements would be much of the needed info.  Not so the human.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, what's wrong with by connection and interaction strengths?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	That's just one choice of model among the many possibilities.  And
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what about the computations that never terminate?
</em><br />
<br />What other models do you have in mind? As for the computations that don't
<br />
halt, first of all we don't have to worry about the ones that don't
<br />
repeat, since they contribute zero measure. For the ones that do repeat,
<br />
we can count their contribution, but I think it would be negligible.
