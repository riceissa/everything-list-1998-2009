<br />
Believing in Divine Destiny is one of the pillars of faith, and, in
<br />
accordance with this belief, everything in the universe is determined
<br />
by God, the All-Mighty. While there are countless absolute evidences
<br />
of Destiny, it may be sufficient to make some introductory remarks to
<br />
demonstrate how important a place this pillar of faith has for the
<br />
whole of creation.
<br />
<br />The Qur'an specifically explains that everything is predetermined, and
<br />
then recorded after its coming into existence, as indicated in many
<br />
verses like,
<br />
<br />Nor anything green or withered except it is all in a Manifest Book.
<br />
<br />This Quranic statement is confirmed by the universe, this macro-Qur'an
<br />
of the Divine Power, through its creational and operational signs like
<br />
order, harmony, balance, forming and shaping, adornment and
<br />
distinguishing. All seeds, fruit stones, measured proportions and
<br />
forms demonstrate that everything is pre-determined before its earthly
<br />
existence. Each seed or fruit stone has a protective case formed in
<br />
the factory of Kaf Nun[*], into which the Divine Destiny has in-built
<br />
the life-story of a tree or plant. The Divine Power employs the
<br />
particles according to the measure established by Divine Destiny so as
<br />
to cause the particular stone to grow miraculously into the particular
<br />
tree. This means that the future life-history of that tree is as
<br />
though written in its seed.
<br />
<br />While there is variety between individuals and between species, the
<br />
basic materials from which these plants and animals are formed are
<br />
identical. The plants and animals that grow from the same constituent
<br />
basic elements display, amid abundant diversity, such harmony and
<br />
proportion that man cannot help but conclude that each of them has
<br />
been individually given its particular form and measure. It is the
<br />
Divine Power which gives to each its particular form according to the
<br />
measure established for it by Divine Destiny. For example, consider
<br />
how vast and innumerable a mass of inanimate particles shift, cohere,
<br />
separate so that this seed grows into this tree or that drop of semen
<br />
grows into that animal.
<br />
<br />Since there are the manifestations of Divine Destiny to this extent in
<br />
visible material things, for certain, the forms with which things are
<br />
clothed with the passing of time and the states they acquire through
<br />
their motions are also dependent on the ordering of Divine Destiny.
<br />
Indeed, a single seed displays Destiny in two ways, one by
<br />
demonstrating the Manifest Book (Kitabun Mubin) which is but another
<br />
title for Divine Will and God's creational and operational laws of the
<br />
universe; the other is by displaying the Manifest Record (Imamun
<br />
Mubin), another title for Divine Knowledge and Command. If we regard
<br />
these two as different manifestations of Divine Destiny, the former
<br />
can be understood and referred to as 'Destiny Actual' and the latter
<br />
as 'Destiny For-mal or Theoretical'. The future full-grown form of the
<br />
tree can be understood as its Destiny Actual, whilst Destiny Formal
<br />
refers to all the stages together through which the tree has to pass
<br />
in its life, and comprehends the entire history of its life. Such
<br />
manifestations of the Divine Destiny, so easily observed in a life
<br />
such as that of a tree, are illustrative of how everything has been
<br />
pre-determined in a Record before its worldly existence. On the other
<br />
hand, all the fruits and seeds which are signs of the Manifest Book
<br />
(Kitabun Mubin) and the Manifest Record (Imamun Mubin), together with
<br />
all human memories which indicate the Preserved Tablet (Lawhun
<br />
Mahfuz), prove that, as everything has been pre-recorded, its life-
<br />
history is also recorded. The life-history of every tree, for example,
<br />
is recorded in each of its fruits, which is the outcome of its entire
<br />
life. The life-history of man including events occurring in the
<br />
external world is likewise recorded in his memory. Thus, the Divine
<br />
Power registers a man's deeds with the Pen of Destiny by lodging it in
<br />
his memory so that he will be able to remember them on the Day of
<br />
Reckoning.
<br />
<br />Man should also be assured that in this world of transience and
<br />
upheavals there are numerous 'mirrors' pertaining to eternity in which
<br />
the All-Powerful and Wise One depicts and makes permanent the
<br />
identities of mortals. There are also many tablets upon which the All-
<br />
Knowing Preserver writes down the meanings of transient beings.
<br />
<br />In short: While plants, which are the simplest and lowest level of
<br />
life, are completely de-pendent upon Divine Destiny, it is also
<br />
evident that the life of man, which is the highest level, has also
<br />
been minutely determined by that Destiny. Just as drops of rain are
<br />
indicative of a cloud, and trickles of water disclose a spring, and
<br />
receipts and vouchers suggest the existence of a ledger, so fruits,
<br />
sperms, seeds, and forms are indicators of the Manifest Book and the
<br />
Manifest Record.
<br />
<br />The expression Manifest Book symbolizes the Destiny Actual, which is a
<br />
title for Divine Will and God's creational and operational laws of the
<br />
universe and the physical order displayed by living creatures. The
<br />
Manifest Record means the Preserved Tablet which is the book of Divine
<br />
Knowledge and symbolizes the Destiny Formal or Theoretical determining
<br />
the immaterial order and the life of the universe.
<br />
<br />To conclude: We witness that particles are in continuous movement
<br />
during the formation of a living creature and travel to their
<br />
destinations by complicated routes and remain there. Their movement
<br />
results in many benefits, uses, and instances of wisdom. Evidently, an
<br />
apparent measure is appointed for each thing by Divine Destiny. If
<br />
this is so, it is also observable that even the immaterial states of
<br />
living beings result in certain fruits. Thus, Divine Power is the
<br />
agent, and Divine Destiny is the pattern. Divine Power writes the book
<br />
of the meanings on that pattern. We see that every movement a creature
<br />
makes in the course of its existence, and all the stages through which
<br />
it passes, are pre-determined by Divine Destiny and its whole life
<br />
forms a harmonious unity.
<br />
<br />Since we understand that a destination and a certain purposeful result
<br />
has been appointed for everything by Divine Destiny, and accordingly
<br />
all the stages it will undergo during its life-time have also been pre-
<br />
determined by the same Destiny, surely, the life-history of man, the
<br />
most perfect fruit of the tree of creation, God's vicegerent on earth,
<br />
and the bearer of His greatest trust, is more than anything subject to
<br />
the law of Divine Destiny.
