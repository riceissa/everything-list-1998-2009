</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the way I worded things.  You are of course quite right that: 'it's

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; enough to predict their behaviour to a useful degree and yet not care

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; at all about what happens to them'.  But this is only pattern
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; recognition and symbolic intelligence, *not* fully reflective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; intelligence.  Reflective intelligence involves additional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; representations enabling a system to *integrate* the aforementioned
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; abstract knowledge (and experience it directly as qualia).    Without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; this ability an AI would be unable to maintain a stable goal structure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; under recursive self improvement and therefore would remain limited.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Are you saying that a system which has reflective intelligence would be able
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to in a sense emulate the system it is studying, and thus experience a very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; strong form of empathy?
</em><br />
<br />Yes
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;That's an interesting idea, and it could be that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very advanced AI would have this ability; after all, humans have the ability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for abstract reasoning which other animals almost completely lack, so why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; couldn't there be a qualitative (or nearly so) rather than just a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quantitative difference between us and super-intelligent beings?
</em><br />
<br />But I don't think this is qualitatively different to what humans do
<br />
already.  It does seem that our ability to feel does in part involve
<br />
emulating other people's inner motivational states.  See the research
<br />
on 'Mirror Neurons' .  Or again, Daniel Goleman's 'Social
<br />
Intelligence' talks about this.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_neurons">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_neurons</a>
<br />
<br />It seems that we humans are already pretty good at reflection on
<br />
motivation already.  Certainly reflection on motivation gives rise to
<br />
feelings.  Emotions are the human strength.  Our 'cutting edge' so to
<br />
speak.
<br />
<br />But remember that 'reflection on motivation' is only one kind of
<br />
reflection.  There are other kinds of reflection that we humans are
<br />
not nearly so good at.  I listed three general classes of reflection
<br />
above - one type of reflection we humans seem to be very poor at is
<br />
'reflection on abstract reasoning' (or reflection on logic/
<br />
mathematics).  With regard to  this type of reflection we rather in an
<br />
analogous position to the emotional retard.  We have symbolic/abstract
<br />
knowlege of mathematics (symbolic and pattern recognition
<br />
intelligence), but this is not directly reflected in our conscious
<br />
experience (or at least it is only in our conscious awareness very
<br />
weeakly).  For example, you may know (intellectually) that 2+2=4 but
<br />
you do not *consciously experience* this information.  You are
<br />
suffering from 'mathematical blind sight'.  Now giving a super-human a
<br />
strong ability to reflect on math/logic *would* definitely be a
<br />
qualitative difference between us and super-intellects.
<br />
<br />But here is something really cool: By intensely forcing yourself and
<br />
training yourself to think constantly about math/logic, it may be
<br />
possible for a human to partially draw math/logic into actual
<br />
conscious awareness!  I can tell you here that in fact I claim to have
<br />
done just that.... and the result is.... very interesting ;)  Suffice
<br />
it to say that I believe that math/logic knowledge appears in
<br />
consciousness as a sort of 'Ontology-Scape'.  Just as the ability to
<br />
reflect on motivation gives rise to emotional experience, so I believe
<br />
that the ability to reflect on math/logic gives rise to a new kind of
<br />
conscious experience... what I call 'the ontology scape'.  As I said,
<br />
I am of the opinion that if you really force yourself and train
<br />
yourself, it's possible to partially draw this 'Ontology scape' into
<br />
your own conscious awareness.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, what would be wrong with a super AI that just had large amounts of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pattern recognition and symbolic reasoning intelligence, but no emotions at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all? It could work as the ideal disinterested scientist, doing theoretical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics without regard for its own or anyone else's feelings. You would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; still have to say that it was super-intelligent, even though it it is an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; idiot from the reflective intelligence perspective. It also would pose no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; threat to anyone because all it wants to do and all it is able to do is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; solve abstract problems, and in fact I would feel much safer around this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sort of AI than one that has real power and thinks it has my best interests
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at heart.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;As I said Intelligence has three parts: Pattern Recognition, Symbolic
<br />
Reasoning and Reflective.    You can't cut out 1/3rd of real
<br />
intelligence and still expect your system to still function
<br />
effectively!  ;)  A system mssing reflective intelligence would have
<br />
serious cognitive deficits.  (in fact , for the reasons I explain
<br />
below, I believe such a system would be unable to improve itself).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Secondly, I don't see how the ability to fully empathise would help the AI
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; improve itself or maintain a stable goal structure. Adding memory and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; processing power would bring about self-improvement, perhaps even recursive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-improvement if it can figure out how to do this more effectively with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; every cycle, and yet it doesn't seem that this would require the presence of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any other sentient beings in the universe at all, let alone the ability to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; empathise with them.
</em><br />
<br />Self-improvement requires more than just extra hardware.  It also
<br />
requires the ability to integrate new knowledge with an existing
<br />
knowledge base in order to create truly orginal (novel) knowledge.
<br />
But this appears to be precisely the definition of reflective
<br />
intelligence!  Thus, it seems that a system missing reflective
<br />
intelligence simply cannot improve itself in an ordered way.  To
<br />
improve, a current goal structure has to be 'extrapolated' into a new
<br />
novel goal structure which none-the-less does not conflict with the
<br />
spirit of the old goal structure.  But nothing but a *reflective*
<br />
intelligence can possibly make an accurate assessment of whether a new
<br />
goal structure is compatible with the old version!  This stems from
<br />
the fact that comparison of goal structures requires a *subjective*
<br />
value judgement and it appears that only a *sentient* system can make
<br />
this judgement (since as far as we know, ethics/morality is not
<br />
objective).  This proves that only a *sentient* system (a *reflective
<br />
intelligence*) can possibly maintain a stable goal structure under
<br />
recursive self-improvement.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Finally, the majority of evil in the world is not done by psychopaths, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by &quot;normal&quot; people who are aware that they are causing hurt, may feel guilty
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about causing hurt, but do it anyway because there is a competing interest
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that outweighs the negative emotions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; --
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Stathis Papaioannou
</em><br />
<br />Yes true.  But see what I said about there being more than one kind of
<br />
reflection.  Strong empathy and feelings alone (caused by reflection
<br />
on motivation) is not enough.  The human brain is not functioning as a
<br />
fully reflective intelligence, since as I pointed out, we don't have
<br />
much ability to reflect on math/logic.
<br />
<br />Incidentally, as regards our debate yesterday on psychopaths, there
<br />
appears to be a some basis for thinking that the psychopath  *does*
<br />
have a general inability to feel emotions.  On the wiki:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopath">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopath</a>
<br />
<br />&quot;Their emotions are thought to be superficial and shallow, if they
<br />
exist at all.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;It is thought that any emotions which the primary psychopath exhibits
<br />
are the fruits of watching and mimicking other people's emotions.&quot;
<br />
<br />So the supposed emotional displays could be faked.  Thus it could well
<br />
be the case that there is a lack inability to 'reflect on
<br />
motivation' (to feel).
