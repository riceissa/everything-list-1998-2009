<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The Qur'an specifically explains that everything is predetermined, and

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Nor anything green or withered except it is all in a Manifest Book.
</em><br />
<br />I guess the Koran's author hadn't heard about quantum randomness.
<br />
<br />Anyway that's not an explanation, it's just an assertion - and why should anyone credit assertions written without supporting evidence by a man who didn't even know that the Earth orbits the Sun. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This Quranic statement is confirmed by the universe, 
</em><br />
<br />It's not only not confirmed, it would be impossible to confirm even if it were true.
