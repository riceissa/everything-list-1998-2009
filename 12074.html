<br />
Hello everybody,
<br />
<br />My name is William Vandenberghe, I'm 21 years old, and currently a last
<br />
year student electrical engineering at the university of Leuven
<br />
(Belgium).
<br />
<br />All of my life, I have been wondering about why we exist, and why we
<br />
exist in the way we do... I think I finally found the explanation and
<br />
after some searching on the internet, I came to the theory of Max
<br />
Tegmark <a href="http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/multiverse.html">http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/multiverse.html</a> which was
<br />
pretty close to what I was thinking.
<br />
<br />Although, I do disagree or put the emphasis differently at some points.
<br />
<br />My theory (I mailed a copy to professor Tegmark yesterday) :
<br />
The main disagreement in philosophy with the theory of Tegmark is that
<br />
I do believe that SASs are possible in universes that have higher
<br />
dimensions, or for instance SASs in a universe that did not just start
<br />
with 1 big bang ...
<br />
<br />Take a universe completely the same to our universe up to this moment,
<br />
obviously it would contain an SAS (us humans); but the difference with
<br />
our universe is that from tomorrow on, it will stop obeying the rules
<br />
of physics (it has respected rules of physics up to today for those
<br />
humans, but no longer does from tomorrow on). I am sure you will agree
<br />
that this universe exists (given that I can describe it to you and it
<br />
is not inconsistent).
<br />
<br />Now, if all universes are equally probable, we can not be living in a
<br />
universe with rules of physics.
<br />
<br />My solution:
<br />
In short, I think the option 1a
<br />
&quot;Everything that exists mathematically exists physically.&quot;
<br />
must be true ... for reasons of symmetry, simulated reality, etc ...
<br />
<br />Now, I have a 2nd &quot;postulate&quot;:
<br />
&quot;Nothing that exists mathematically exists physically with finite
<br />
probability.&quot;
<br />
<br />So the main point in my theory is, that all mathematical things exist,
<br />
but some with a different probability than others. And the way I
<br />
develloped my theory, the probability of a universe (or a formal system
<br />
in the paper of prof. Tegmark) to exist; is proporional to the amount
<br />
of information that universe contains ( Probability ~ 1/(amount of
<br />
information) )
<br />
<br />A simple example would be:
<br />
A (normalized &amp; continious) 3D universe with 1 particle in it is
<br />
infinitely less probable than a (norm. &amp; cont.) 2D universe with 1
<br />
particle in it.
<br />
This is very intuitive, it just means that a 2D universe is equally
<br />
probable as the sum of the probability of all 3D universes for 2
<br />
coordinates fixed, and a 3rd varied.
<br />
Or P( U2(a,b) ) = int( P( U3(a,b,x) ) , x=-inf..inf  )
<br />
<br />So of all universes that allow SAS, we live in the one with the lowest
<br />
possible amount of information.
<br />
Now let us look at some predictions for now:
<br />
- Our universe has rules and keeps to them at all times unless it is
<br />
essential for the existence of a SAS (violating rules = information)
<br />
- Either our universe started with a small number of particles, or many
<br />
particles in our universe started with the same initial conditions; if
<br />
every particle currently in existence, had its own initial conditions,
<br />
this would contain a huge amount of information. A nice Big Bang
<br />
directly coming out of the TOE.
<br />
- No universe containing fewer information than our own, contains a
<br />
SAS.
<br />
<br />Another amusing result is that we can answer the simulated reality
<br />
question with a simple &quot;no, we are not living in a simulation&quot;, since
<br />
it takes a universe of more information to simulate our universe and
<br />
that universe is at least infinitely (probably some powers of infinity)
<br />
less probable than ours.
<br />
<br />Bring on the comments please :)
