<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hello Russell,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Congratulations on your latest publication.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Today on my way home I begin to question whether or not I still
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; believe self-sampling assumptions are valid tools for drawing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conclusions.  I decided that though self-sampling assumptions may lead
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to conclusions that are true for the greatest number of observers,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correct conclusions are entirely coincidental.  In the same way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correlation is no indication of causation, likelihood of truth for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; majority of observers is not caused by something being true for one's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; By definition every OM with a non-zero measure has a 100% guaranteed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; chance of being experienced, even if its measure is 10^(-20) that of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; another more prolific OM.  The only thing that can be reasoned from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; current experience is that one's current OM has a non-zero measure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Attempting to use properties of one's vantage point to draw
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conclusions about other OMs can be disastrously wrong, for example
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; take the Doomsday Argument:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The doomsday argument allows the largest number of observers to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correctly predict the doom of their civilization, but it achieves this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by having every observer who has ever lived believe that doom is just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; around the corner. 
</em><br />
<br />This is not true. See the appendix &quot;How soon until doom&quot; in my book
<br />
Theory of Nothing. For most of humanity's history, doom is a long way off.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If a nuclear holocaust occurs tomorrow, the 6.66
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; billion alive today would have been correct, but the people alive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; today represent just 10% of the total number of humans who have ever
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lived, leading 90% to be wrong.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />The DA just predicts that population will drop in the near future -
<br />
perhaps catastrophically, but more gentle drops are also compatible
<br />
with it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The main objection I have to anthropic reasoning in this case, is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it leads to the conclusion that life forms which are reactive to their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; environments and capable of thought / decision making are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; philosophical zombies.  Though it is easier to imagine that ants are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not conscious, what about other animals far more numerous than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; humans?  Are chickens, mice, and sheep zombies?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />I don't think these animals are that much more  numerous than humans,
<br />
but it is also true that it is far from clear these animals are
<br />
conscious either. None of the species you mention pass the mirror test
<br />
of self-awareness.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I also do not see how the leap from &quot;Russell Standish&quot; is conscious,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to &quot;All other humans are conscious&quot; can be made yet stop short of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Bonobos are conscious&quot;, &quot;Chimps are conscious&quot;, and perhaps even
</em><br />
<br />I don't. I rather suspect these animals are conscious.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; lemurs and squirrels are conscious.  
</em><br />
<br />These ones possibly aren't. There is a test called the Gallup mirror
<br />
test, which is strongly indicative of self-awareness. Most apes pass
<br />
this test, bottlenose dolphins and also elephants have found to pass
<br />
the test. Virtually no other species does, although it wouldn't
<br />
suprise me if some other species were found to pass it. It may also be
<br />
that certain species will pass a suitably modified version of the
<br />
test, that do not pass the current version of it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; How does the ability to produce
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; viable offspring with another relate to whether or not that other can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be conscious?  Drawing the line between species seems arbitrary to me,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; especially considering how small of steps evolution takes.  If you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conclude other humans are conscious because we have similar brains,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could you not likewise conclude all mammals are conscious because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mammals too have similar brains and share a common ancestor? 
</em><br />
<br />Human brains are far more similar to each other than to other
<br />
mammalian brains. In the absence of an adequate theory of
<br />
consciousness, we can't really draw the line anywhere, however there are
<br />
bound to be some species that are conscious, and others that aren't,
<br />
just as there are some species pass the mirror self-awareness test and others
<br />
that don't.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Where in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the evolutionary tree did the first human ancestor's consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appear?  The term consciousness was not clearly defined in your paper,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do you consider it to be a binary property, or something that can have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; varying levels of sophistication?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />It is defined operationally as being a member of the reference class
<br />
used in anthropic reasoning. It is therefore a binary property (you
<br />
are either in the reference class, or you aren't).
<br />
<br />Consciousness is sometimes used to refer to something that is
<br />
graduated: ie the term &quot;level of consciousness&quot; used in
<br />
anaethsiology. This is not how I would use the term, and would prefer
<br />
to use &quot;awareness&quot; or &quot;alertness&quot; to describe the differing states
<br />
before and after having a strong cup of coffee (for instance).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I look forward to your response,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Jason
