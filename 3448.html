Quick, but not so quick, comment on Wei Dai, Juergen Schmidhuber 
<br />
and Charles Goodwin. (I'm busy). 
<br />
Apologises in advance for some length, though, I
<br />
guess you are busy too.
<br />
Apology also to those EverythingFOR-listers who get this
<br />
message twice. That's the effect of interference
<br />
of parallel lists, it doubles the intensity at some point :)

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;summary?
</em><br />
<br /><br />What about telling me if it is the UDA or the Arithmetical UDA (AUDA) you
<br />
have problem with.
<br />
<br />In case it is the UDA (that is the proof that comp entails a necessary
<br />
reversal between physics and machine/psychologycomputer-science/number
<br />
theory) it would be helpful if you tell me which step you don't understand
<br />
in the UDA in 11 steps. 
<br />
(cf   <a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m3044.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m3044.html</a>  ). Frankly.
<br />
<br />In case it is the AUDA, (the translation of UDA in arithmetic or in any
<br />
language of a sound UM) the difficulty of understanding is more normal,
<br />
because the AUDA needs some familiarity with Logic (Goedel Loeb ...).
<br />
The importance of provability comes from the fact that like Judson
<br />
Webb or John Myhill (ref in my thesis) I consider Godel's 2th theorem as 
<br />
(the first) theorem in exact psychology, in particular machine 
<br />
psychology: 
<br />
a consistent machine cannot prove its own consistency, or a machine 
<br />
cannot prove she has (even just one) consistent extension(s). 
<br />
Hume is right, and provable with comp, indeed.
<br />
Now the UDA proves that our &quot;physics&quot; is defined by a measure
<br />
on those consistent extensions. So the concept of consistency is very
<br />
important, and it is defined from the concept of provability: p is
<br />
consistent iff -p is not provable (-[]-p, = &lt;&gt;p).
<br />
<br />Modal logic makes works on self-referential machine &quot;easy&quot;, at least
<br />
with some familiarity in logic. Have you follow my &quot;little course&quot; to 
<br />
George Levy on modal logic?
<br />
<br />But in case you have not understand UDA, perhaps AUDA is premature, I
<br />
don't know, logicians understand more easily AUDA, at least formally.
<br />
<br /><br />I know a lot of people here developpe similar ideas. I bet a lot of
<br />
children, especially the dreamer one, brush against the idea.
<br />
And indeed many ScFi writers, like Daniel Galouye in SIMULACRON III, makes
<br />
quasi rigorously the point. Still I'm sorry/happy for what
<br />
is perhaps some advance from my part :-) I )-: 
<br />
Simplifying a little bit I made
<br />
public the &quot;UDA&quot; including &quot;amoeba-immortality&quot; the ancestor
<br />
of &quot;comp-immortality&quot; in 1963. (ok I was young!). I was interested in
<br />
amoeba life-time. After that my brain became a battle field between
<br />
biology (which will give comp) and chemistry (making me doubt about
<br />
comp and becoming eventually the very shape of the comp-doubt).
<br />
James Watson says &quot;cells obeys to the laws of chemistry&quot;. 
<br />
To obvious to be true. 
<br />
<br />I got and proposed the idea of translating such UDA-like
<br />
question, in the Godel way, in arithmetic, in 1971, including the 
<br />
conjecture 
<br />
that QM or chemistry should be justified in that way, and (admittedly a
<br />
subtil point) that chemistry was a product of the necessity of the
<br />
doubt about comp so that matter is defined by a measure on our
<br />
ignorance about our possible extensions. 
<br />
<br />That has given
<br />
a project of a thesis I made precise in 1976. The project (and other 
<br />
projects more &quot;serious&quot; in pure math) have been 
<br />
rejected, and things of life slowed me down a little bit, let us
<br />
say, untill I will publish, under the pression of sympathic belgium
<br />
logicians but also engineers, the whole thing in the Toulouse 
<br />
(France) 1988 paper, and  more concisely in 1991.
<br />
<br />I will get the proof of LASE (Little Schroedinger Abstract
<br />
Equation) only in 1994. This is the first confirmation that not only
<br />
comp and its reversal are consistent, but that it is going in the
<br />
quantum/chemistry direction as I expected (it is empirically consistent).
<br />
<br />You can see that, although I believe the empiry should be explain
<br />
by the logical and arithmetical, I really come from the empirical
<br />
science. My childhood was contemplation of amoeba, planaria, hydra,
<br />
all the animals, vegetals and minerals.
<br />
<br />Until 1995 I was sure that someone would find a fatal error either
<br />
in UDA or in the arithmetical UDA. In the beginning nineties Brussels
<br />
University encourages me to make a Phd Thesis which (for administrative 
<br />
reason!) I have been asked to propose first as project (again) in 1995.
<br />
The project-thesis has been judge non receivable without me being heard
<br />
even one second,
<br />
(again) pretexting the lack of enough original results (sic).
<br />
Although this made very bad publicity for both me and the work, 
<br />
honest mathematicians and computer scientist in France verified it
<br />
thoroughly, so that
<br />
I did eventually defend the thesis in France in 1998.
<br />
I still have some strong support from paradoxal Brussel's university.
<br />
I dream some student in logic will progress in the math part of my work
<br />
even if that shows LASE being a mirage (which I doubt). According
<br />
to Albert Visser (great Deutsch logician) Russians should be able to
<br />
solve the simpler math problems. So it is not *so* easy. 
<br />
Thanks to quantum computing a shy bridge begins to developpe between
<br />
physician and logicians.
<br />
<br />Have you see the &quot;mathematical&quot; problems?
<br />
Sure, I must still publish an international paper, I am on it. 
<br />
But still it would help me if you tell me what is that you 
<br />
don't understand! 
<br />
If someone found some fatal error please tell me, it is never
<br />
to late:)
<br />
<br /><br />The fact is that *I* don't understand how Juergen Schmidhuber
<br />
associates first person experiences and memories to single (third
<br />
person) computations. UDA shows at least that with comp we must take
<br />
that problem seriously, so that Schmidhuber proposal is at least
<br />
incomplete. Nor do Schmidhuber clearly states its ontology.
<br />
<br />In some sense David Deutsch's FOR tackle both matter and mind
<br />
more rigorously, but, by still presupposing physicalness at the start
<br />
(which is apparent when he considers the Church-Turing &quot;physical&quot;
<br />
principle as an attempt to make Church-Turing &quot;mathematical&quot; thesis
<br />
more &quot;precise&quot;) he fails to appreciate the possibility and still less
<br />
the necessity of the reversal, isn't it?
<br />
<br />In fact I expect that the Church mathematical
<br />
thesis entails the negation of the physical Church principle.
<br />
comp entails the apparent universes cannot be entirely
<br />
computable (cf comp = I am a turing emulable, not: there is a 
<br />
universe and it is turing emulable).
<br />
<br />BTW I keep the logician expression Church Thesis, for what Deutsch
<br />
call &quot;Church Turing thesis&quot;, and I am more and more willing
<br />
to call Deutsch's &quot;Church Turing Principle&quot; simply &quot;Deutsch thesis&quot;.
<br />
This would help to prevent confusion between both. 
<br />
So I conjecture:  Church thesis entails the apparent (first person) 
<br />
negation of Deutsch thesis.
<br />
Janusz Cyran send a question about the status of those theses, to the 
<br />
FOR-list and nobody has answered tmk, but it's a key point we have to
<br />
address soon or later.
<br />
<br /><br />Charles Goodwin wrote (in the FOR list):
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;If the multiverse is effectively a huge computation containing all 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;possible information (which as some people have pointed out,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;effectively means that it contains NO information) then it can be regarded 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;as simply an infinite array of numbers. The appearance of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physical reality, time, consciousness etc emerge from the relations 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;between these numbers.
</em><br />
<br /><br />If that is not a nice and short summary of my thesis!  :-)
<br />
(No doubt it could and will summarize other thesis as well, and even 
<br />
some very different one, I guess what is most original in my work is the
<br />
machine &quot;psychological&quot; apparent detour). The math of physical theories
<br />
bears also more and more similarities with pure number theory.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Having re-read that I am starting to wonder what drugs quantum physicists 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are on. However that's the general idea, I believe...
</em><br />
<br /><br />If that were the result of drugs on quantum physicist, that would be 
<br />
wonderful and I would encourage all physicist to take more drugs, 
<br />
but I'm glad it is also the result of more prosaic simple working
<br />
logic :)
<br />
<br /><br />PS for those-FOR interested in QTI, it has been the subject of many
<br />
thread in the everything list. As I mention above QTI is most
<br />
probably a particular case of comp immortality. The exact form
<br />
of such &quot;immortality&quot; (including the range of possible backtracking
<br />
like in the post of Saibal Mitra) is obviously difficult to figure out.
<br />
<br />The transporter with and/or without annihilation of the original,
<br />
with or without delay of reconstitution, play a most important
<br />
role in my work (it's the brick of the UDA). Thanks to Russell
<br />
and Brett for mentionning this. I hope I will find time to make
<br />
some precise comment on the very interesting transporter thread
<br />
in the FOR list but as a matter of fact Charles Goodwin gives
<br />
very comp-adequate answer so that at this stage I have no a lot
<br />
to add. The UDA can be considered as the transporter thought
<br />
experiment pushed at its ultimate limit (and the consequence
<br />
are that physico/psycho reversal).  
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<br />About Tipler:  its main error (I talk like Russell!) is that
<br />
(with comp) there is not one omega-point but a transfinite cloud
<br />
of them ... (Is that not also a consequence of reasonable
<br />
quantisation of gravitational space?).
<br />
Actually with comp you can only prove: that IF there is an omega
<br />
point, THEN there are a transfinity of omega point.
<br />
<br />Still sorry for the personal remarks, but seing a little bit
<br />
where I am coming from (a self duplicating- amoeba fan) could help the
<br />
understanding. I will try to explain the precise relationship
<br />
&nbsp;between  &quot;Godel&quot; and self-replication on the
<br />
everything-list in the post &quot;diagonalisation 2&quot; asap.
