Le 15-déc.-06, à 02:04, Stathis Papaioannou a écrit :

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Who says the Nazis are wrong when they assert they are good?

</em><br />
I was not saying that they were wrong. I was saying that they were bad.

<br />
Who says this?  All self-referentially correct machine sufficnetly rich 
<br />
to prove elementary theorems in arithmetic.

<br />
For showing this it is just enough to accept that the notion of 
<br />
&quot;goodness&quot; is of a type having greater or equal complexity that the 
<br />
notion of consistency or truth (which is intuitively reasonable).

<br />
To sum up: a lobian machine saying &quot;I am true&quot; is false. (note that 
<br />
saying &quot;I am provable&quot; makes it true by ... Lob's theorem itself!).
<br />
A lobian machine asserting &quot;I am consistent&quot; is inconsistent (Godel)
<br />
A lobian machine asserting &quot;I am intelligent&quot; is stupid,
<br />
A lobian machine asserting &quot;I am stupid&quot; is ... stupid too (beginners 
<br />
are often wrong on this).
<br />
A lobian machine asserting &quot;I am good&quot; is bad,
<br />
A lobian machine asserting &quot;I am bad&quot; is bad (too!)
<br />
A lobian machine asserting &quot;I am virtuous&quot; provably lacks virtue. 
<br />
(provably, not probably)

<br />
Apparently self-referentially correct lobian machine are enough wise 
<br />
for never attributing to themselves any &quot;moral&quot; quality. They cannot 
<br />
judge their own defect in the matter.



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We could look at a particular incident where capital punishment was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proposed, let's say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for murder. Everyone might agree on the facts of the crime and the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; effects of executing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the perpetrator, but still strongly disagree about whether it is right 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or wrong. So of course
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the capital punishment debate does involve rational discussion and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; maybe some people will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; switch sides if appropriate evidence is presented, but in the end you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will have a situation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where there is just disagreement on an axiom.

</em><br />
Again this shows that good/bad is not different from true/false, even 
<br />
just in arithmetic.

<br />
Recall the admittedly counterintuitive truth (admitting the consistency 
<br />
of Peano Arithmetic): the new theory obtained by adding to Peano 
<br />
arithmetic the statement that Peano arithmetic is inconsistent, is a 
<br />
consistent theory (albeit probably not &quot;reasonable&quot;, but what does that 
<br />
mean?).

<br />
The elementary atoms of good and bad are related to what we have 
<br />
&quot;learned&quot; since life begun, like drinking water is good, self-burning 
<br />
is bad, or any elementary pleasure/pain qualia in company of some 
<br />
amount of self-referential correctness.




<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  But of course democracy does not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; *necessarily* lead to the good.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Just in that last sentence is the assumption that there is some other 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; basis for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the good than what the majority decides to say it is.


</em><br />
Yes, precisely. But because good/bad cannot be normative or even 
<br />
defined, democracy works well in giving to the majority a way to revise 
<br />
opinions after four years. &quot;majority&quot; by itself has nothing per se 
<br />
related to &quot;good&quot;.
<br />
(BTW I do not favors any form of direct democracy, because by 
<br />
controlling media you can make any majority decide what you want).
<br />
Majority is wrong in general, but through democracy the majority can be 
<br />
less and less wrong (a little bit like science).



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For example, if 51% of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; population decided to kill the other 49% and take all their 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possessions, presumably
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you would not think that was good.

</em><br />
That is a sort  of civil war.


<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This means that your idea of what is good is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; somehow better than the decisision of the majority, and you only 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; favour democracy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because you think it is more likely to come up with laws in accordance 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ethical principles than most other forms of government. Isn't that a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; little arrogant?


</em><br />
Not at all. Democracy has just a better chance to *converge* on 
<br />
solutions acceptable by a majority, notably by making it possible to 
<br />
take into account opinion of minorities, but also to take account 
<br />
people's changes of mind. Democracy per se is not ethical, it is 
<br />
meta-ethical. I am not saying that this or that is good or bad, just 
<br />
that such things are hard to decide and that the advantage of democracy 
<br />
is that, whatever is good or bad, working democratic systems can give a 
<br />
way for changing your mind (after 4 years, say) on difficult social or 
<br />
ethical questions.
<br />
In a tyranny someone thinks at your place, and if you don't belong to 
<br />
the right club, you have not even any hope for a change.  When you feel 
<br />
something is bad for you, it is arguable that the mere possibility of 
<br />
change is a good.


<br />
You say (to Brent):

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But is head-eating a good thing? A group of male mantids might get 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; together to form
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an anti-head-eating movement, arguing that it is barbaric and no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; longer necessary even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; though it has always been the way and is probably genetically 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; programmed. The pro-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; -head-eating majority would probably vehemently disagree. Everyone 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; agrees on the facts,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everyone is able to reason, but there are still two conflincting views 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on what is &quot;good&quot;.


</em><br />
Like they are still many conflicting views on what is &quot;true&quot;, &quot;real&quot; 
<br />
etc.
<br />
This does not mean we cannot progress on such notions. We can can have 
<br />
less and less conflicting view of what is true. I can expect the same 
<br />
for &quot;good&quot;.
<br />
Both with &quot;true&quot; and &quot;good&quot; I don't expect we can converge on a final 
<br />
complete theory capable of deciding all assertions, quite the contrary: 
<br />
theories like bodies are vehicle of thought. Democratic system are more 
<br />
efficient to explore the political landscape and thus more efficient in 
<br />
probability to satisfy &quot;soul's natural attraction&quot; toward the &quot;good&quot;.
