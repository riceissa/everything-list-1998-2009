<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  From a logical point of view it is consistent (possible) that the one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; reconstituted is a zombie (although this would contradict comp or the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; choice of the level).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It depends on what we mean by &quot;all the appropriate mental and physical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attributes&quot;. If the reconstituted person is a zombie then he is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certainly lacking some mental attributes that the original had, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assuming the original was not a zombie.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Indeed: he loss the consciousness!
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course, it is not possible for a third person observer to be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certain about first person mental states, and this would apply to our 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; teleportee: he may feel as if he is the same person as he was prior to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the procedure, but he might be wrong.
</em><br />
<br /><br />If he is a zombie, by definition he feels nothing.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The flaw in this argument is that the same considerations hold if he 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; had travelled by train: he may look and feel like the same person, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have all the appropriate memories, and so on, but how does he know 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the original didn't die during the journey, to be replaced by a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; copy as would have happened had he teleported?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Here I agree and see what you mean. That is why those saying &quot;yes&quot; to 
<br />
the doctor eventually should understand we do die at each instant. Like 
<br />
we do &quot;split&quot; or differentiate at each instant without any means to 
<br />
know that directly.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In a sense, this is just what did happen, since over minutes to hours 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; most of the matter comprising neural synapses is replaced, while over 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; months most of the matter in a human body is replaced.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK. Note that a non-computationalist can invoke some continuity of 
<br />
replacement. Such argument are red herring once we assume comp.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If there is some sense in which a person's identity might be lost 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; despite his physical and mental attributes being apparently preserved 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (and I'm not sure the idea is even coherent), there is no reason for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nature to waste effort evolving and maintaining such an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; identity-conservation system, because it cannot make any difference to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behaviour.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I would agree if I was believing in Nature. As a scientist I am neutral 
<br />
about the existence of nature, but assuming comp &quot;Nature&quot;, like 
<br />
&quot;matter&quot; should not be reified.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Comp itself cannot be proved but what can be proved is that IF comp is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; correct then comp cannot be proved, necessarily. So we have, somehow,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to be open to non-comp beliefs.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Put in another way: if you survive when saying YES to the doctor, you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; have to respect those who say NO to the doctor (unless you have bad
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; intentions of course or are ignorant).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The falseness of comp (or functionalism) does not necessarily mean 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; duplication would be a death sentence.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You are right but the reverse is true: if duplication (at any level) is 
<br />
a death sentence, then comp is wrong.
<br />
But you a right, for example we could survive duplication because God 
<br />
is so good and so clever as being able to duplicate our non-comp-soul 
<br />
and link it to the genuine digital brain copies ....
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  If our consciousness is dependent on the activity of tiny black holes 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the microtubules, or whatever, then we might be able to survive 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; duplication if our new brain had the right sort of tiny black holes in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the microtubules. The test is that the duplicate have subjective 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiences sufficiently close to those of the original: if that is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the case, then I would say by definition the person has survived.
</em><br />
<br /><br />All right, but this is never third person verifiable. To test comp BY 
<br />
saying yes to a doctor and getting an artificial digital brain is akin 
<br />
to &quot;quantum suicide&quot; or &quot;comp suicide&quot;. The first person can get the 
<br />
correct (assuming comp and the rightness of the level choice) *feeling* 
<br />
of having survive, but she will never be able to communicate this 
<br />
feeling to another.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Parfit has not see this, and that is why he dares to qualify (a bit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; provocatively I would say) his identity theory as a reductionist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; theory, or &quot;the reductionist theory&quot;. With comp (when made explicit)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Parfit's theory is mainly correct except on two points:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 1) What I have just said: the theory is not reductionist---It is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; contrary: it provides (by diagonalizations!) many vaccine against many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; form of reductionism. After dinner ;) I could even go as far as to say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; it gives a path toward that Unconceivable Freedom described by some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; mystic like Vimalakirti!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 2) We are type, not token. There is no physical token. (with comp).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Parfit thinks we are token. I have not the Parfit under the hand, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; will give you the pages later. I don't think there are any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; token either. It looks like Parfit makes us token for avoiding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; immortality at the start.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You may be referring to chapter 99 of &quot;Reasons and Persons&quot;. A &quot;token&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is a particular instantiation of a person, while a &quot;type&quot; is the set 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of related instantiations (these terms are actually attributed to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; philosopher Bernard Williams). As I read him, Parfit says that we are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; each token, but the significance we attach to our lives and those of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; others we care about must be attached to a type rather than a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particular token. Thus, in destructive teleportation, a token is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; destroyed, but the type survives.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I think this makes Parfit non coherent. If I am a token, and if only 
<br />
the type survive, I don't survive.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; To sum up, Hal Finney seemed to me coherent, giving that in its recent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; post he admits questioning comp. It is less clear for me how he can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; still use Kolmogorov complexity (a computer science notion), but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; still,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; logically that could make sense, perhaps through some Powerful Oracle
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; resource (actual infinity of highly uncomputable information). I don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; know.  Hal?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hal promised to explain how a person might not survive destructive 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; teleportation despite being apparently subjectively and objectively 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unchanged, and I look forward to this.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Again, if there is no subjective change at all I would say the survival 
<br />
is obvious by definition. But assuming some strong form of 
<br />
non-computationalism, we can *conceive* that the subjectivity belongs 
<br />
to someone else after the reconstitution. My point here is that comp is 
<br />
not positively testable, even for oneself (someone reconstituted person 
<br />
could say: &quot;I have survived, I have survived, I have survived, ...&quot; and 
<br />
then repeat this forever because its hypocampus (which handles the 
<br />
short/long term memory interface) would have been destroyed in the 
<br />
process.  Any possible &quot;agnosology&quot; I mean (brain diseases which entail 
<br />
the lack of consciousness of the disease) illustrates that comp is not 
<br />
even verifiable by oneself (the first person one).
<br />
Of course, for someone who assumes comp at the start, this 
<br />
uncommunicability is the same as the one related to *any* form of 
<br />
survival, including anesthesia, night sleep or just the experience of 
<br />
drinking a cup of coffee.
<br />
But I do argue that comp is *refutable*, because comp does put total 
<br />
constraints of the laws of physics (cf the reversal).
