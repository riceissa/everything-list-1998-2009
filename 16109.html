<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; If that were the case, the Born Rule would fail.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps the probability rule would be more like proportionality to norm^2 exp(entropy) instead of just norm^2.  If that was it, then for example unstable nuclei would be observed to decay a lot faster than the Born Rule predicts.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I do not understand why you say that the Born rule would fail.
</em><br />
<br />High entropy branches would have more probability than low entropy ones compared to the standard Born rule.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes I am linking the entropy to MW branching.
</em><br />
<br />But you should realize that the Born rule is self-consistent in the face of branching.  If there is branching to N states, then on average the squared norm of each will be 1/N of the original.  That much is proven by the math.  Linking squared norm to measure is of course a tougher issue.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You say that the Born Rule would fail if measure *increases*.
</em><br />
<br />Actually, all I said was that it would fail if measure is linked to entropy.  Any significant modification to it would make it fail.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Using your own argument I could say that the Born rule would fail if measure *decreases *according to function f(t). For example it could be norm^2 f(t) .
</em><br />
<br />That would make it fail but if the modification is only a function of time it would be hard to detect.  Making it a function of a branch-dependent observable like entropy leads to a much easier-to-detect deviation.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So using your own argument since the Born rule is only norm^2 therefore measure stays constant?
</em><br />
<br />In ordinary experimental situations, total measure stays constant.
<br />
<br />In life or death situations there is a correction factor but it is well known: the measure in a given world is proportional to the number of people alive in it as well as to the squared norm.  This is taken into account under the Anthropic principle, and explains why our universe seems fine-tuned for life even though worlds like that presumably have a relatively small total squared norm compared to the sum of the others.
