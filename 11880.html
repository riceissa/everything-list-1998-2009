<br />Hi Brent,
<br />
Please see the post/replies to Quentin/LZ.
<br />
I am trying to understand the context in which I can be wrong and how
<br />
other people view the proposition. There can be a mixture of mistakes and
<br />
poor communication and I want to understand all the ways in which these
<br />
things play a role in the discourse.
<br />
<br />So...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; So, I have my zombie scientist and my human scientist and I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ask them to do science on exquisite novelty. What happens?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The novelty is invisible to the zombie, who has the internal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; life of a dreamless sleep.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Scientists don't literally &quot;see&quot; novel theories - they invent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them by combining other ideas.  &quot;Invisible&quot; is just a metaphor.
</em><br />
<br />I am not talking about the creative process. I am talking about the
<br />
perception of a natural world phenomena that has never before been
<br />
encountered. There can be no a-priori scientific knowledge in such
<br />
situations. It is as far from a metaphor as you can get. I mean literal
<br />
invisibility. See the red photon discussion in the LZ posting. If all you
<br />
have is a-priori abstract (non-phenomenal) rules of interpretation of
<br />
sensory signals to go by, then one day you are going to misinterpret
<br />
because the signals came in the same from a completely different source
<br />
and you;d never know it. That is the invisibility I claim at the center of
<br />
the zombie's difficulty.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The reason it is invisible is because there is no phenomenal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; consciousness. The zombie has only sensory data to use to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; do science. There are an infinite number
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of ways that same sensory data could arrive from an infinity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of external natural world situations. The sensory data is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ambiguous - it's all the same - action potential pulse trains
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; traveling from sensors to brain. The zombie cannot possibly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; distinguish the novelty from the sensory data
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why can it not distinguish them as well as the limited human scientist?
</em><br />
<br />Because the human scientist is distinguishing them within the phenomenal
<br />
construct made from the sensory data, not directly from the sensory data -
<br />
which all the zombie has. The zombie has no phenomenal construct of the
<br />
external world. It has an abstraction entirely based on the prior history
<br />
of non-phenonmenal sensory input.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and has no awareness of the external world or even its own boundary.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Even simple robots like the Mars Rovers have awareness of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world, where they are, their internal states, and
</em><br />
<br />No they don't. They have an internal state sufficiently complex to
<br />
navigate according to the rules of the program (a-priori knowledge) given
<br />
to them by humans, who are the only beings that are actually aware where
<br />
the rover is. Look at what happens when the machine gets hung up on
<br />
novelty... like the rock nobody could allow for.... who digs it out of it?
<br />
no the rover... humans do....The rover has no internal life at all. Going
<br />
'over there' is what the human sees. 'actuate this motor until until this
<br />
number equals that number' is what the rover does.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No.  You've simply assumed that you know what &quot;awareness&quot; is and you
</em><br />
have the defined a zombie as not having it.  You might as
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; well have just defined &quot;zombie&quot; as &quot;just like a person, but can't do
</em><br />
science&quot; or &quot;can't whistle&quot;.  Whatever definition you give
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; still leaves the question of whether a being whose internal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; processes (and a fortiori the external processes) are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; functionally identical with a human's is conscious.
</em><br />
<br />This is the nub of it. It's where I struggle to see the logic others see. 
<br />
I don't think I have done what you describe. I'll walk myself through it.
<br />
<br />What I have done is try to figure out a valid test for phenomenal
<br />
consciousness.
<br />
<br />When you take away phenomenal consciousness what can't you do? It seems
<br />
science is a unique/special candidate for a variety of reasons. Its
<br />
success is critically dependent on the existence of a phenomenal
<br />
representation of the external world.
<br />
<br />The creature that is devoid of such constructs is what we typically call a
<br />
zombie. May be a mistake to call it that. No matter.
<br />
<br />OK, so the real sticking point is the 'phenomenal construct'. The zombie
<br />
could have a 'construct' with as much detail in it as the human phenomenal
<br />
construct, but that is phenomenally inert (a numerical abstraction). Upon
<br />
what basis could the zombie acquire such a construct? It can't get it from
<br />
sensory feeds without knowing already what sensory feeds relate to what
<br />
part of the natural world. That a-priori knowledge is not available. It's
<br />
what the zombie is trying to find out. This is the logical loop from my
<br />
perspective.
<br />
<br />So who's in the logical loop here? I am assuming zero a-priori scientific
<br />
knowledge in the human and the zombie. How does each get to a state of
<br />
non-zero scientific knowledge of the external natural world? For this is
<br />
what has actually happened in an evolutionary sense. We have phenomenal
<br />
consciousness for a reason.
<br />
<br />If you zero out all a-priori knowledge in two entities, one with and one
<br />
without phenomenal consciousness the only one that can make any progress
<br />
is the one with phenomenal consciosueness - the One that has experiences
<br />
of the external world generated in their head.
<br />
<br />In a sense the a-priori knowledge that the human has is 'hard-wired' in a
<br />
capability to construct phenomenal scenes from sensory data. That a-priori
<br />
'knowledge' is not scientific knowledge of the type found by using that
<br />
faculty. The phenomenal scenes make some assumptions and they can
<br />
mis-inform. But they do connect the scientist with the world outside the
<br />
scientist in a direct way that means that when something acts in
<br />
contradiction to previous behaviour that novelty is phenomenally visible.
<br />
<br />I have made no assumptions of a-priori scientific knowledge found using
<br />
phenomenal consciousness. I can show technically how the lack of
<br />
phenomenal consciousness prevents the zombie'd scientist from ever
<br />
accurately gettinmg at laws of the external natural world.
<br />
<br />On the other hand if you assume a computation (a numerical abstraction)
<br />
capable of doing it then you are assuming phenomenal consciousness,
<br />
because all of the a-priori knowledge inherent in such a device has to be
<br />
bestowed upon the creature by humans. That model has been created with
<br />
scientific exploration made possible with phenomenal consciousness. That
<br />
such a creature then automatically has access to the external world is
<br />
just an assumption.
<br />
<br />Sensory feeds have no phenomenal content! Sensory feeds poking an
<br />
abstraction have nothing to say about the world external to the zombie.
<br />
<br />So who's really making the assumption here? Frankly my head is spinning..
<br />
more thinking needed on that.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Now, we have the situation where in order that science be done by a
</em><br />
human
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; we must have phenomenal consciousness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That's mere assertion.  But even if it's true it would only imply that a
</em><br />
computational being that was functionally equivalent to a human at some
<br />
low-level would  both be able to do science and be conscious.
<br />

</em><br />
<br />For this last bit... see the paramecium posting to Stathis... maybe
<br />
that'll help.
<br />
<br />I can't see I have assumed anything. Indeed I see everyone else as
<br />
assuming something about the nature of sensory feeds and the availability
<br />
of a-priori knowledge in a situation where there is none.
