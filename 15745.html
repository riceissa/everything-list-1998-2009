<br />
Sometimes we consider here the nature of consciousness, whether observer
<br />
moments need to be linked to one another, the role of causality in
<br />
consciousness, etc. I thought of an interesting puzzle about Boltzmann
<br />
Brains which offers a new twist to these questions.
<br />
<br />As most readers are aware, Boltzmann Brains relate to an idea of Boltzmann
<br />
on how to explain the arrow of time. The laws of physics seem to be time
<br />
symmetric, yet the universe is grossly asymmetric in time.  Boltzmann
<br />
proposed that if you had a universe in a maximum entropy state, say a
<br />
uniform gas, then given enough time, the gas would undergo fluctuations
<br />
to regions of lower entropy.  Sometimes, purely at random, clumps of
<br />
molecules would happen to form. Even more rarely, these clumps might be
<br />
large and ordered. Given infinite time, one could even have an entire
<br />
visible-universe worth of matter clump together in an ordered fashion,
<br />
from which state it would then decay into higher entropy conditions. Life
<br />
could evolve during this decay, observe the universe around it, and find
<br />
itself in conditions much like our own.
<br />
<br />The Boltzmann Brain is a counter-argument, suggesting that the universe
<br />
and everything else is redundant; all you need is a brain to form via
<br />
a spontaneous random fluctuation, and to hold together long enough to
<br />
engage in a few moments of conscious thought. Such a Boltzmann Brain is
<br />
far more likely to form than an entire universe, hence the vast majority
<br />
of conscious thoughts in such a model will be in Boltzmann Brains and not
<br />
in brains in large universes. If we were tempted to explain the arrow of
<br />
time in this way, we must accept that the universe is an illusion and
<br />
that we are actually Boltzmann Brains, a conclusion which most people
<br />
don't like.
<br />
<br />Now this scenario can be criticized in many ways, but I want to emphasize
<br />
a couple of points which aren't always appreciated. The first is that the
<br />
Boltzmann scenario, whether a whole universe or just a Brain is forming,
<br />
is basically time symmetric. That means that if you saw a movie of a
<br />
Boltzmann universe forming and then decaying back to random entropy,
<br />
you would not be able to tell which way the movie was running, if it
<br />
were to be reversed. (This is an unavoidable consequence of the time
<br />
symmetry of the underlying physics.) It follows that while the universe
<br />
is moving into the low-entropy state, it must be evolving backwards. That
<br />
is, an observer from outside would see time appearing to run backwards.
<br />
Eggs would un-scramble themselves, objects would fall upwards from the
<br />
ground, ripples would converge on spots in lakes from which rocks would
<br />
then leap from the water, and so on.
<br />
<br />At some point this time reversal effect would stop, and the universe
<br />
would then proceed to evolve back into a high entropy state, now with time
<br />
going &quot;forwards&quot;. Now, the forward phase will not in general be an exact
<br />
mirror image of the reverse, because of slight random fluctuations and
<br />
the like, but it will be an alternate path that essentially starts with
<br />
the same initial conditions. So we will see one path backwards into the
<br />
minimum-entropy state, and another path forwards from that state. Both
<br />
paths are fully plausible histories and neither is distinguishable from
<br />
the other as far as which was reversed and which was forward, if you
<br />
ran a recording of the whole process backwards.
<br />
<br />One might ask, what causes time to run backwards during the first half of
<br />
the Boltzmann scenario? The answer is, nothing but very, very odd luck.
<br />
Time is no more likely to continue to run backwards, or to run backwards
<br />
the same everywhere in the local fluctuation-area, than it is to start
<br />
running backwards right now in the universe around you. Nothing stops
<br />
eggs from unscrambling themselves except the unlikelihood, and the same
<br />
principle is at work during the Boltzmann time-reversal phase. It is
<br />
merely that we select, out of the infinity of time, those rare occasions
<br />
where time does in fact &quot;happen to happen&quot; like this, that allows us to
<br />
discuss it.
<br />
<br />I want to emphasize that this picture of how Boltzmann fluctuations would
<br />
work is a consquence of the laws of thermodynamics, and time symmetry.
<br />
Sometimes people imagine that the fluctuation into the Boltzmann
<br />
low-entropy state is fundamentally different from the fluctuation out
<br />
of it. They accept that the fluctuation out will be similar to our own
<br />
existence, with complex events happening. But they imagine that the
<br />
fluctuation into low entropy might be much simpler, molecules simply
<br />
aggregating together into some convenient state from which the complex
<br />
fluctuation out and back to chaos can begin. While this is not impossible
<br />
and hence will happen occasionally among the infinity of fluctuations in
<br />
the Boltzmann universe, it will be rare. It will be no more common for a
<br />
&quot;simple&quot; fluctation-in process to occur than for a simple fluctuation-out
<br />
process. In our universe, knowing it will evolve to a chaotic heat
<br />
death, we might imagine that molecules would just fly apart into chaos,
<br />
but we know that is highly unlikely. Instead, by far the most likely
<br />
path is a complex one, full of turbulence and reactions and similar
<br />
activity. By time symmetry, exactly the same arguments apply during
<br />
the fluctation-in phase. The vast majority of Boltzmann fluctuations
<br />
that achieve a particular degree of low entropy will do so via complex,
<br />
turbulent paths which if viewed in reverse will appear to be perfectly
<br />
plausible sequences of events for a universe which is decaying from
<br />
order to disorder, like our own.
<br />
<br />Following on to this, let us consider the nature of consciousness during
<br />
these Boltzmann excursions. Again let us focus on larger scale ones than
<br />
just Boltzmann Brains, although the same principles apply there. During
<br />
the time reversal phase, if conscious entities are present, their brains
<br />
are running backwards. They are talking backwards, walking backwards,
<br />
doing everything in reverse. They remember things that are coming in
<br />
the future, and forget everything as soon as it has happened.
<br />
<br />The question is, is there any difference in consciousness during the
<br />
reverse and forward phases? Consider that during the forward phase, we
<br />
started with a low entropy state, and now the laws of physics are playing
<br />
out just as they do in our own universe. Everything is happening for a
<br />
reason, depending on what has happened before. Events cause memories to
<br />
appear in brains by virtue of the same causal effects which give rise
<br />
to our own memories. Hence I imagine that most would agree that brains
<br />
during the forward phase are conscious.
<br />
<br />However, during the reverse phase, things are quite different. Brains
<br />
have memories of things that haven't happened yet. Again, one might
<br />
ask how this can be. The reason is because we stop paying attention
<br />
to fluctuations where this doesn't happen. We only focus on Boltzmann
<br />
fluctuations which take the universe into a plausible and consistent
<br />
low-entropy state, one from which things can evolve in a way that is
<br />
similar to what we see. When a brain remembers something, if that doesn't
<br />
happen, the fluctuation is inconsistent. We skip over that one and look
<br />
for one that is consistent.
<br />
<br />In the consistent fluctuations, brain memories turn out to be correct,
<br />
purely by luck. Similarly, every internal function of the brain which
<br />
we might attribute to macroscopic-type causality, like neuron A firing
<br />
because neuron B fired, will happen instead by luck, with neuron A firing
<br />
as though neuron B is going to fire, and then neuron B just happening
<br />
to fire in precisely the anticipated way.
<br />
<br />The point is that during the time-reversal phase, causality as we
<br />
normally think of it is absent. Subjectively-past events do not cause
<br />
subjectively-future ones; rather, subjectively-future events take place
<br />
before subjectively-past events, and it is merely through luck that things
<br />
happen in a consistent pattern. Again, if we hadn't gotten lucky so that
<br />
things work out, we wouldn't have called this a Boltzmann fluctuation of
<br />
the kind we are interested in (Boltzmann Brain or Boltzmann Universe).
<br />
By paying selective attention to only those fluctuations where things
<br />
work, we will only observe cases where luck, rather than causality,
<br />
makes things happen.
<br />
<br />But things do happen, in the same pattern they would if causality were
<br />
active.  So the question is, are brains conscious during this time? Do
<br />
the thoughts that occur during the time reversal (which recall is not
<br />
exactly the same as what happens during the forward-time phase) have
<br />
the same level of subjective reality as thoughts which occur when time
<br />
runs forward?
<br />
<br />We can argue it either way. In favor of consciousness, the main
<br />
argument is that time is fundamentally symmetric (we assume). Hence
<br />
there is no fundamental or inherent difference between the forward and
<br />
reverse phases.  The only differences are relative, with the arrow of
<br />
time pointing in opposite directions in the two phases. But within each
<br />
phase, we see events which can both be equally well described as leading
<br />
to consciousness, and therefore conscious experiences will occur in
<br />
both phases.
<br />
<br />On the other side, many people see a role for causality in the creation
<br />
or manifestation of consciousness. And arguably, causality is different
<br />
in the two phases. In the forward phase (the part where we are returning
<br />
from a low-entropy excursion to the high-entropy static state), events
<br />
follow one another for the usual reasons, and it is correct to attribute
<br />
a role for causality just as we do in our own experience. But in the
<br />
reverse phase, it is purely by luck that things happen in a consistent
<br />
way, and only because we have an infinity of time to work with that we
<br />
are able to find sequences of events that look consistent even they arose
<br />
by simple happenstance. There is no true causality in this phase, just a
<br />
random sequence of events where we have selected a sequence that mimics
<br />
causality. And to the extent that consciousness depends on causality,
<br />
we should not say that brains during this reverse phase are conscious.
<br />
<br />I lean towards the first interpretation, for the following reason. If
<br />
consciousness really was able to somehow distinguish the forward from
<br />
reverse phases in a Boltzmann fluctuation, it would be quite remarkable.
<br />
Given that the fundamental laws of physics are time symmetric, nothing
<br />
should be able to do that, to deduce a true &quot;implicit&quot; arrow of time that
<br />
goes beyond the superficial arrow of time caused by entropy differences.
<br />
The whole point of time symmetry, the very definition, is that there
<br />
should be no such implicit arrow of time.  This suggestion would seem
<br />
to give consciousness a power that it should not have, allow it to do
<br />
something that is impossible.
<br />
<br />And if the first interpretation is correct, it seems to call into question
<br />
the very nature of causality, and its posible role in consciousness. If
<br />
we are forced to attribute consciousness to sequences of events which
<br />
occur purely by luck, then causality can't play a significant role. This
<br />
is the rather surprising conclusion which I reached from these musings
<br />
on Boltzmann Brains.
