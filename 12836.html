Stathis:'Would any device that can create a representation of the world, 
<br />
itself and the relationship between the world and itself be conscious?'
<br />
<br />MP: Well that, in a nutshell, is how I understand it; with the proviso 
<br />
that it is dynamic: that all representations of all salient features and 
<br />
relationships are being updated sufficiently often to deal with all 
<br />
salient changes in the environment and self. In the natural world this 
<br />
occurs because all the creatures in the past who/which failed 
<br />
significantly in this respect got eaten by something that stalked its 
<br />
way in between the updates, or the creature in effect did not pay enough 
<br />
attention to its environment and in consequence lost out somehow in ever 
<br />
contributing to the continuation of its specie's gene pool.
<br />
<br />Stathis [in another response to me in this thread]: 'You can't prove 
<br />
that a machine will be conscious in the same way you are.'
<br />
<br />MP: Well, that depends what you mean;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. to what extent does it matter what I can prove anyway?   
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. exactly what or, rather, what range of sufficiently complex
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;systems are you referring to as 'machines';
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. what do you mean by 'conscious in the same way you are'?;
<br />
<br />I'm sure others can think of equally or more interesting questions than 
<br />
these, but I can respond to these.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. I am sure I couldn't prove whether or not a machine was conscious,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it the 'machine' was, and it was smart enough and interested
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enough IT could, by engaging us in conversation about its
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;experiences, what it felt like to be what/who it is, and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;questioning us about what it is like to be us. Furthermore, as
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colin Hales has pointed out, if the machine was doing real science
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it would be pretty much conclusive that it was conscious.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. By the word machine I could refer to many of the biological
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;entities that are significantly less complex than humans. What
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ever one says in this respect, someone somewhere is going to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disagree, but I think maybe insects and the like could be quite
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reasonably be classed as sentient machines with near Zombie status.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. If we accept a rough and ready type of physicalism, and naturalism
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maybe the word I am looking for here, then it is pretty much
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;axiomatic that the consciousness of a creature/machine will differ
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from mine in the same degree that its body, instinctive behaviour,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and environmental niche differ from mine. I think this must be
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;true of all sentient entities. Some of the people I know are
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'colour blind'; about half the people I know are female; many of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the people I know exhibit quite substantial differences in
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;temperament and predispositions. I take it that these differences
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from me are real and entail various real differences in the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quality of what it is like to be them [or rather their brain's
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;updating of the model of them in their worlds].
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am interested in birds [and here is meant the feathered variety]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and often speculate about why they are doing what they do and what
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it may be like to be them. They have very small heads compared to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mine so their brains can update their models of self in the world
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;very much faster than mine can. This must mean that their
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perceptions of time and changes are very different. To them I must
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be a very slow and stupid seeming terrestrial giant. Also many birds
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can see by means of ultra violet light. This means that many things
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;such as flowers and other birds will look very different compared to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what I see. [Aside: I am psyching myself up slowly to start creating
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a flight simulator program that flies birds rather than aircraft.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the challenges - by no mean the hardest though -  will be to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;represent UV reflectance in a meaningful way.]
<br />
<br />Stathis [from the other posting again]: 'There is good reason to believe 
<br />
that the third person observable behaviour of the brain can be emulated, 
<br />
because the brain is just chemical reactions and chemistry is a 
<br />
well-understood field.'
<br />
<br />MP: Once again it depends what you mean. Does 'Third person observable 
<br />
behaviour of the brain' include EEG recordings and the output of MRI 
<br />
imaging? Or do you mean just the movements of muscles which is the main 
<br />
indicator of brain activity? If the former then I think that would be 
<br />
very hard, perhaps impossible; if the latter however, that just might be 
<br />
achievable.
<br />
<br />Stathis: 'I think it is very unlikely that something as elaborate as 
<br />
consciousness could have developed with no evolutionary purpose 
<br />
(evolution cannot distinguish between me and my zombie twin if zombies 
<br />
are possible), but it is a logical possibility.'
<br />
<br />MP: I agree with the first bit, but I do not agree with the last bit. If 
<br />
you adopt what I call UMSITW [the Updating Model of Self In The World], 
<br />
then anything which impinges on consciousness, has a real effect on the 
<br />
brain. In effect the only feasible zombie like persons you will meet 
<br />
will either be sleep walking or otherwise deficient as a consequence of 
<br />
drug use or brain trauma. I think Oliver Sachs's book The Man Who 
<br />
Mistook His Wife For a Hat gives many examples illustrating the point 
<br />
that all deficiencies in consciousness correlate strictly with lesions 
<br />
in the sufferer's brain.
