How does this compare with Einstein´s discovery that there is no moment that
<br />
is the same NOW for everyone?

<br /><br /><br />What do we think about this? Smolin seems to disagree with most of  
<br />
what we are on about on this list. My mind remains open in all  
<br />
directions, particularly as Smolin appears to be enjoying substantial  
<br />
advances in his field of Quantum Gravitation. Does his argument about  
<br />
time have legs?
<br />
<br />Maybe we can get him back on this list to talk to us if we yell loud  
<br />
enough in his direction...

<br />
<br />THE LIBERATION OF TIME
<br />
<br />I would like to describe a change in viewpoint, which I believe will  
<br />
alter how we think about everything from the most abstract questions  
<br />
on the nature of truth to the most concrete questions in our daily  
<br />
lives. This change comes from the deepest and most difficult problems  
<br />
facing contemporary science: those having to do with the nature of time.
<br />
<br />The problem of time confronts us at every key juncture in fundamental  
<br />
physics: What was the big bang and could something have come before  
<br />
it? What is the nature of quantum physics and how does it unify with  
<br />
relativity theory? Why are the laws of physics we observe the true  
<br />
laws, rather than other possible laws? Might the laws have evolved  
<br />
from different laws in the past?
<br />
<br />After a lot of discussion and argument, it is becoming clear to me  
<br />
that these key questions in fundamental physics come down to a very  
<br />
simple choice, having to do with the answers to two simple questions:  
<br />
What is real? And what is true?
<br />
<br />Many philosophies and religions offer answers to these questions, and  
<br />
most give the same answer: reality and truth transcend time. If  
<br />
something is real, it has a reality which continues forever, and if  
<br />
something is true, it is not just true now, it was always true, and  
<br />
will always be. The experience we have of the world existing within a  
<br />
flow of time is, according to some religions and many contemporary  
<br />
physicists and philosophers, an illusion. Behind that illusion is a  
<br />
timeless reality, in modern parlance, the block universe. Another  
<br />
manifestation of this ancient view is the currently popular idea that  
<br />
time is an emergent quality not present in the fundamental formulation  
<br />
of physics.
<br />
<br />The new viewpoint is the direct opposite. It asserts that what is real  
<br />
is only what is real in the moment, which is one of a succession of  
<br />
moments. It is the same for truth: what is true is only what is true  
<br />
in the moment. There are no transcendent, timeless truths.
<br />
<br />There is also no past. The past only lives as part of the present, to  
<br />
the extent that it gives us evidence of past events. And the future is  
<br />
not yet real, which means that it is open and full of possibilities,  
<br />
only a small set of which will be realized. Nor, on this view, is  
<br />
there any possibility of other universes. All that exists must be part  
<br />
of this universe, which we find ourselves in, at this moment.
<br />
<br />This view changes everything, beginning with how we think of  
<br />
mathematics. On this view there can be no timeless, Platonic, realm of  
<br />
mathematical objects. The truths of mathematics, once discovered, are  
<br />
certainly objective. But mathematical systems have to be invented-or  
<br />
evoked- by us. Once brought into being, there are an infinite number  
<br />
of facts which are true about mathematical objects, which further  
<br />
investigation might discover. There are an infinite number of possible  
<br />
axiomatic systems that we might so evoke and explore-but the fact that  
<br />
different people will agree on what has been shown about them does not  
<br />
imply that they existed, before we evoked them.
<br />
<br />I used to think that the goal of physics was the discovery of a  
<br />
timeless mathematical equation that was isomorphic to the history of  
<br />
the universe. But if there is no Platonic realm of timeless  
<br />
mathematical object, this is just a fantasy. Science is then only  
<br />
about what we can discover is true in the one real universe we find  
<br />
ourselves in.
<br />
<br />More specifically, this view challenges how we think about cosmology.  
<br />
It opens up new ways to approach the deepest questions, such as why  
<br />
the laws we observe are true, and not others, and what determined the  
<br />
initial conditions of the universe. The philosopher Charles Sanders  
<br />
Pierce wrote in 1893 that the only way of accounting for which laws  
<br />
were true would be through a mechanics of evolution, and I believe  
<br />
this remains true today. But the evolution of laws requires time to be  
<br />
real. Furthermore, there is, I believe, evidence on technical grounds  
<br />
that the correct formulations of quantum gravity and cosmology will  
<br />
require the postulate that time is real and fundamental.
<br />
<br />But the implications of this view will be far broader. For example, in  
<br />
neoclassical, economic theory, which is anchored in the study of  
<br />
equilibria of markets and games, time is largely abstracted away. The  
<br />
fundamental results on equilibria by Arrow and Debreu assume that  
<br />
there are fixed and specifiable lists of goods, and strategies, and  
<br />
that each consumer’s tastes and preferences are unchanging.
<br />
<br />But can this be completely correct, if growth is driven by  
<br />
opportunities that suddenly appear from unpredictable discoveries of  
<br />
new products, new strategies, and new modes of organization? Getting  
<br />
economic theory right has implications for a wide range of policy  
<br />
decisions, and how time is treated is a key issue. An economics that  
<br />
assumes that we cannot predict key innovations must be very different  
<br />
from one that assumes all is knowable at any time.
<br />
<br />The view that time is real and truth is situated within the moment  
<br />
further implies that there is no timeless arbiter of meaning, and no  
<br />
transcendent or absolute source of values or ethics. Meaning, values  
<br />
and ethics are all things that we humans project into the world.  
<br />
Without us, they don’t exist.
<br />
<br />This means that we have tremendous responsibilities. Both mathematics  
<br />
and society are highly constrained, but within those constraints there  
<br />
are an infinitude of possibilities, only a few of which can be evoked  
<br />
and explored in the finite time we have. Because time is real and the  
<br />
future does not yet exist, the imaginative and social worlds in which  
<br />
we will live are to be brought into being by the choices we will make.
