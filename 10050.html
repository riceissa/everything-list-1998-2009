</em><br />
<br />Well, no offense to Martin or you, but that's pretty ordinary stuff which
<br />
we have been discussing on this list since 1998.  There is an entire
<br />
website devoted to the speculation that Rees describes, the possibility
<br />
that we live in a simulation: simulation-argument.com, by former list
<br />
member Nick Bostrom.
<br />
<br />It's always kind of disconcerting to read popularizations of the kinds
<br />
of ideas we discuss here.  Writers have to approach them so delicately,
<br />
taking such pains to marvel at the amazing and perhaps outlandish
<br />
imagination it takes to consider them seriously.  I always read these
<br />
articles with a sinking feeling, knowing that they aren't going to
<br />
say anything new to me and frustrated that the concepts can't just be
<br />
delivered straight, the way we take them here.
<br />
<br />I've been wanting to write something about the collision between physics
<br />
and the anthropic principle, and maybe this is a good time.  As Rees
<br />
describes, recent developments in string theory, have introduced the idea
<br />
of a &quot;landscape&quot; of possible stable models.  Each point on the landscape
<br />
would correspond to a possible set of particles and physical laws.
<br />
I haven't gotten a clear picture of whether this landscape is actually
<br />
infinite or merely very large; most writers seem to think the distinction
<br />
is unimportant, because the &quot;large&quot; is so &quot;very&quot;.  Rees is typical in
<br />
how he inconsistently says first one and then the other.  (I imagine
<br />
that most of us would see the distinction as rather more important.)
<br />
<br />Anyway, as Rees describes, this is forcing physicists to consider the
<br />
possibility that the fundamental physics of our universe is no more
<br />
meaningful than the distance from the earth to the sun: a mere accident
<br />
of nature, with the anthropic principle explaining why we are here to
<br />
see it and ask about it.  I've seen this same earth-sun analogy used in
<br />
talks by other physicists.
<br />
<br />But what Rees does not say is that many or most physicists are being
<br />
dragged down this path kicking and screaming.  Physics is not going gently
<br />
into the anthropic night.  Most physicists, I think, see this as the
<br />
death of physics.  Rees himself admits that it in effect blurs the line
<br />
between physics and philosophy.  It calls into question the entire program
<br />
of fundamental physics, to explain why the universe is the way it is.
<br />
<br />The real problem is not just that it is a philosophical speculation,
<br />
it is that it does not lead to any testable physical predictions.
<br />
The string theory landscape, even if finite, is far too large for
<br />
systematic exploration.  Our ideas, with an infinite number of possible
<br />
universes, are even worse.  Physicists see acceptance of anthropic
<br />
explanations as the end of physics because there is no way to make
<br />
quantitative predictions when there are so many degrees of freedom.
<br />
<br />Now, granted, predictions may still be possible in principle - given
<br />
that the string theory landscape is finite, you could in theory explore
<br />
every part of it and create probabilistic predictions contingent on what
<br />
has been observed so far.  The problem is that there is no prospect of
<br />
actually being able to do this.  Clearly it can't be done by brute force.
<br />
Maybe someone will come up with some kind of clever sampling approach,
<br />
or perhaps some structure can eventually be found in the landscape.
<br />
But at this point there is no reason to believe that such efforts will
<br />
amount to anything.
<br />
<br />The result is that string theory in particular has reached a dead end.
<br />
This is what physicists have been banking on for twenty years to achieve
<br />
a grand unification, a theory of everything.  And instead, they have
<br />
found within the past couple of years that it is more like a &quot;theory of
<br />
anything&quot;, in the sense that seemingly any hypothetical universe might
<br />
be consistent with string theory.  Such a theory is no theory at all,
<br />
to physicists.
<br />
<br />The situation has gotten so bad that there is a growing backlash
<br />
against string theory.  Proponents of rival theories, who have labored
<br />
in obscurity for decades, are coming out of the woodwork and demanding
<br />
their share of attention (and the substantial research funding of which
<br />
string theory has long received the lion's share).  Two major books
<br />
are coming out this fall which proclaim the death of string theory.
<br />
One is &quot;Not Even Wrong: The Failure of String Theory And the Search for
<br />
Unity in Physical Law&quot; by Peter Woit (his blog of the same name is here,
<br />
<a href="http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/">http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/</a> ).  The other is by Lee
<br />
Smolin: &quot;The Trouble With Physics: The Rise of String Theory, The Fall
<br />
of a Science, and What Comes Next&quot;.  Amazon even pairs the books for
<br />
you so you can get a double dose of anti-string theory.  These books
<br />
have been well reviewed and there seems to be a sense that indeed,
<br />
the general approach of physics needs to be substantially rethought.
<br />
<br />So the bottom line is that Rees leaves us with a highly misleading
<br />
perspective.  While he personally may be happy with anthropic ideas,
<br />
most physicists are not.  Where I live in Santa Barbara, Nobelist David
<br />
Gross, head of the KITP at UCSB, is famous for his active hostility to
<br />
the concept.  So opposed are physicists to adopting all-universe models
<br />
that they are ready to abandon twenty years of work and strike off in
<br />
a new direction rather than face the immensity of the anthropic universe.
<br />
<br />Now, I'm sure that some physicists will continue to work on these ideas,
<br />
just as a minority has continued to work on rivals to string theory
<br />
all these years.  The bottom line is that unless some way is found to
<br />
make specific, testable predictions (and not the kind of hand-waving we
<br />
sometimes get away with around here, explaining why bunnies can't fly),
<br />
the anthropic universe is not physics.  It is philosophy, and physicists
<br />
want nothing to do with it.
