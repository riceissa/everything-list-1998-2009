<br />I agree with Hal. It is not (yet) relevant ...

<br />I agree with George about a possible link between self-reference and

consciousness,
<br />
although I agree also with another old post by Hal saying that 
<br />
consciousness per se
<br />
need not to be self-referential. I propose to postpose these questions 
<br />
for a
<br />
futur thread.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ENVIRONMENT.
</em><br />
<br />I agree a lot, modulo the lack of precision, I mean the success in 
<br />
concision :-) 
<br />
<br />Of course this cannot be a final explanation, we still should explain 
<br />
where our rational expectations comes from. How does the rational link
<br />
emerge from.

<br />I will not insist on that here, but if you are right I'm afraid that

computationalism is false.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Maybe what you are saying is that the perception of

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consciousness is the perception of the self referential logical black hole

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(or blind spot) inferred by Godel, the source of logical uncertainty in the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;decision making process.
</em><br />
<br />I am not sure I understand the expression &quot;perception of consciousness&quot;. 
<br />
Consciousness is what makes perception perception. But I guess there is 
<br />
some
<br />
truth in the rest of your assertion. I believe there is a sense in which 
<br />
there is a godelian blind spot for the consistent machine.
<br />
The very consistency of the machine belongs to her godelian blind spot.

<br />I still agree a lot. This is unfortunately very vague. I think that this

is exactly what we must make precise. More on this below.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;	BTW Chalmers' own proposed solution in that paper is

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;unsatisfactory, and he admits it, hence the need for proposals such as

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mine.
</em><br />
<br />And you admit (if I read correctly your URL) that your proposal (for
<br />
the implementation problem)  is also still unsatisfactory.
<br />
There is indeed an &quot;implementation&quot; problem. My feeling (let us say) is 
<br />
that
<br />
this problem is *fatal* for the physical computationalist (like you ; 
<br />
BTW thanks for this nice expression).
<br />
What I JUST show in my thesis is that IF the mathematical (arithmetical 
<br />
is enough)
<br />
computationalist solve the &quot;implementation problem&quot; (your term) THEN
<br />
she will justify the origin of the appearance of the physical laws and 
<br />
solve the mind body problem.
<br />
<br />I think that what George Levy try to describe us above can be 
<br />
made more precise by 
<br />
taking seriously the classical Church's thesis (and thus classical 
<br />
computer 
<br />
science, self-referential correctness, etc.). The MW are the many states
<br />
accessible by a universal machine (um). (cf also the self-aware 
<br />
substructures).
<br />
Paraphrasing George Levy, I would say that consciousness, rationality and 
<br />
physical laws are different modalities
<br />
of *self-referentially correct um RELATIVELY to her more probable 
<br />
computational continuation*. It is really a *relative state* 
<br />
interpretation of mathematics (arithmetics is enough) where the observer 
<br />
is the um.
<br />
<br />Nevertheless, it is quite possible that a kind of &quot;physical 
<br />
computationalism&quot; remains consistent and may even be necessary  with the 
<br />
mathematical computationalism. I guess that will happen in the case
<br />
our level of substitution (which is such that, by definition, we survive 
<br />
a teletransportation or a functional substitution at that level) is very 
<br />
low.
<br />
In that case the measure will be much more constrained.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
What is a little ironical here (with, explicitely, the mathematical
<br />
platonism), is that by lowering the level of substitution, you will never 
<br />
makes any um mortal. 
<br />
But there are reason to think you will make indeed 
<br />
harder for them to infer it.
<br />
<br />Not to bad for a devil's advocate :-)
