</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of them?
</em><br />
<br />I'll offer some thoughts on this below.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So I have been thinking of possible counter considerations. Here is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one:  Is it possible that the parametric coincidences required for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the existence of advanced (beyond microbial) life are so improbable 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that (i) even in the right kind of universe, advanced life is likely 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to occur only once; and (ii) it requires an infinite number of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universes even to get one occurrence of a me-ish person?
</em><br />
<br />That would require that it is infinitely improbable that you could exist.
<br />
But I don't think that is the case, because there are only a finite
<br />
number of possible arrangements of matter of the size of a human being.
<br />
(Equivalently, humans embody only a finite amount of information.)
<br />
So it would seem that the probability of a human appearing in some
<br />
universe must be finite and greater than zero, hence there would be an
<br />
infinite number of instances across an infinity of universes.
<br />
<br />As far as the issue of human action and free will, here is how I look
<br />
at it.  There are really two issues.  The first is that in some sense
<br />
the multiverse makes our actions deterministic.  That is, there is no
<br />
longer any true unpredictability in what we do, because we do everything
<br />
in one universe or another.  So how can we have free will if there are
<br />
no choices?
<br />
<br />Well, this problem has been considered many times in the philosophical
<br />
literature going back hundreds of years (where it was asked how free will
<br />
was compatible with God's omniscience).  Recent works by Daniel Dennett,
<br />
his books Elbow Room and his new book (which I haven't read) Freedom
<br />
Evolves, discuss how free will can be said to coexist with determinism.
<br />
The basic idea is that the acting out of deterministic processes and the
<br />
considerations involved in making a free choice are two equally valid ways
<br />
of explaining the same phenomenon, at different levels of description.
<br />
These books could be good sources to explore these concepts further.
<br />
<br />The second part of the problem is specific to the multiverse model,
<br />
which is, even assuming that in some sense you have free will, what is
<br />
the practical point of acting, since your decisions will be in effect
<br />
cancelled out by being done differently in other universes?  Larry Niven's
<br />
science fiction short story All the Myriad Ways explores the problems
<br />
which sweep society when a technology is invented to visit parallel
<br />
universes, leading to a widespread surrender to nihilism and social ennui.
<br />
<br />However this perspective ignores the concept of measure, where some
<br />
universes are more prominent than others.  Although you may make
<br />
different choices in different universes, the probabilities are not equal.
<br />
Your decision making processes influence the measure of the universes in
<br />
which your different choices occur.  By giving matters careful thought
<br />
and making wise decisions, you can maximize the measure of the universes
<br />
in which your choices have good outcomes.  This justifies the necessity
<br />
of careful choice and eliminates the descent into nihilistic horror
<br />
and despair.
