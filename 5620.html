millennia: subject to the continually (gradually) evolving (applied) math

formalism. Will be back to that.
<br />
<br /><br />Reply-BM:   We surely differ. I am not sure the word &quot;science&quot; really 
<br />
refers to anything.
<br />
Scientific attitude exists though. About it the words and expressions 
<br />
like  *curiosity*, *modesty*, *clarity*, *willingness to share*, etc.. 
<br />
comes to my mind.
<br />
I agree there has been, in the human story, attempts to build reductionist 
<br />
theories, but they have all failed, and with comp, by Godel II, it is 
<br />
necessarily so.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;JM: (MY!) Simplicity is the 'cut-off' from the wholeness in our models. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Later you mention the causality: it is similarly a cut-off of all possible 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(eo ipso 'active') influencings, pointing to the ONE which is the most 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;obvious within our topical cut. We make 'cause' SIMPLE.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Reply-BM:   I'm afraid I don't understand.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />JM: Exactly. Comp (? I am not sure if I know what it is indeed) has IMO 
<br />
brisk rules and definite qualia to handle by those rules.
<br />
<br /><br />Reply-BM:   I suspect a terrible confusion due to a probably subtle point 
<br />
which has begin to be clear to me only when I begin to understand the 
<br />
abyssal gap between the notion of total computable function and partial 
<br />
computable function. Or Godel's incompleteness theorems. Cf the 
<br />
diagonalisation posts.
<br />
COMP is just the (religious? meta-religious?) belief that there exists a 
<br />
level of description of you such that you are not aware of any difference 
<br />
in your life after a digital substitution has been made at that level. (+ 
<br />
Church thesis, + a minimal amount of arithmetical realism).
<br />
It is the nuance brought by GODEL II which makes COMP not reductionnist.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />JM: (I evaded: 'quantities'). Which means the omission of aspects OUTSIDE 
<br />
such qualia and rules.
<br />
<br /><br />Reply-BM:   Yes, but apparently just because you &quot;evade quantities&quot;, it 
<br />
seems to me.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />JM: The cut-off, ie. limitations, enable comp to become brisk, unequivocal, 
<br />
well defined. Including unidentified and infinite variables, qualia, all 
<br />
sort of influence (quality and strength) - meaning the 
<br />
wholeness-interconnection - makes it more vague than any fuzziness could do 
<br />
(which still stays topical).
<br />
<br /><br />Reply-BM:   Which limitations ?  I am not sure I understand.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;JM: I don't expect this emryonic branch of thinking (30-50years max?) even 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;using the language of the millennia of reductionist development, to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;compete in briskness with the conventional - what you and others may call: 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;- science. An embryo would recite Godel in a very vague way.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Reply-BM:   ? You loose me.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;JM: do we have ANY other knowledge-base? Proof (Popper's no-no) is within 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the belief system. &quot;True&quot; is a 1st pers. judgement. Even an 'accepted' 3rd 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;p. truth is &quot;1st p. accepted&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Reply-BM:   I agree.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;JM: I haven't (yet?) included the universal mchine into my vocabulary. It 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is not 'simple' (see above).
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Reply-BM:   Thanks for your admission. It is the key notion of comp.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;JM: One remark to math vs science: I consider math a human language, a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mental activity (again this term!) on its own, (uninhibitied by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observational models - only by its intrinsic connotations).
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Reply-BM:   I really do not consider math as a language. Math papers are 
<br />
written (mostly) in English (or in German, French, Russian, etc.). 
<br />
Mathematicians uses abreviations, drawings, and are keen to abstract by the 
<br />
very often use of symbolic variables giving the impression it is a language 
<br />
by itself, but it is not. Mathematicians like Pyhtagore .... Cantor, would 
<br />
never have hide results if that was only languages. Godel's theorem is 
<br />
often use to defend platonism at least in computer science and arithmetic, 
<br />
and I find the argument compelling. But any book on number theory is enough 
<br />
to illustrate this. Even many physicists agree there is a mathematical 
<br />
reality. The irrationality of the square root of 2 is neither a piece of 
<br />
language, nor a convention, but a (startling) observation. A discovery.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;JM: Science, however, is a reductionist parcelling of observations - 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;according to the epistemic level of the age, the cognitive inventory and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;its connectional capabilities of the by that time acquireds.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Reply-BM:   I understand why you say that (given the amount of 
<br />
&quot;reductionnist scientist&quot;), but such a reductionnism is the product of a 
<br />
betray of science spirit. We should not confuse the often use 
<br />
&quot;reductionnist parcelling of observations&quot;, which could be a good method of 
<br />
observation, with the attempt to guess the reality beyond. To be short I 
<br />
would say that science for me is just honesty. The confusion between 
<br />
reality and the parcels is produced by sleepy conscience (of course that 
<br />
occurs all the time, and science asks for ever vigilance).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;JM: Science applies math in its formalizing of deductions, but such math 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is  quantitatively distorted - adjusted to the models and the observations 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it pertains to. Which is also subject to the actually achieved level of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;epistemic enrichment.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Reply-BM:   Only logicians formalize, and then use informal mathematics 
<br />
(like any mathematicians), but it just happen they are working  *on* formal 
<br />
systems and machines.
