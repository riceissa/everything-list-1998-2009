<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The independent &quot;out there&quot; feeling is just the self consistency of

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not entailing the existence of something that is out there.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I find this to be a fascinating idea, to relate mutiple possible
<br />
histories to quantum superpositions. How does this notion relate to
<br />
the idea that mutiple possible histories may degenerate to single
<br />
&quot;now&quot;? Information about the past states of the universe being lost is
<br />
equivalent to a gain in entropy, such that the state of the universe
<br />
at time = t may not uniquely identify the state of the universe at
<br />
time &lt; t. Superficially this appears to be symmetrical with the notion
<br />
of many possible worlds at time &gt; t springing from a single state at
<br />
t, another example of time invariance. However, it would be
<br />
impossible, even in principle, to determine which one of these
<br />
possible histories is the real one, since it would be meaningless to
<br />
claim that only one led to the current state. If more than one history
<br />
degenerate in to a particular state, then they are all correct in this
<br />
scenario since irreversible steps make recovering one unique history
<br />
impossible.
<br />
<br />But the meaning of the notion that the outcome an experiment performed
<br />
in the past exists in a superposition of outcomes until the moment of
<br />
an observation probably does depend greatly on whether one considers
<br />
the existence of the world to be observer-dependent or independent. Is
<br />
the ensemble merely the set of all possible observer experiences? Or
<br />
are there ensembles that are at least as valid that take reality to be
<br />
external and observer independent? I intuitively suspect that there is
<br />
nothing special about what we call consciousness, and that an
<br />
observation is any physical measurement, be it a photon impinging on a
<br />
retina or a photodetector or whatever. It does not seem as sensical to
<br />
me to claim that a measurement made with instruments does not
<br />
constitute an observation until looked at by a conscious observer.
<br />
However, I am trying to understand the differences in these two views
<br />
-- not the easiest task to do since I am invested in one of them
<br />
already.
<br />
<br />I hate to tax the patience of those who read this list with yet
<br />
another thought experiment, but I think it may be useful to illustrate
<br />
this with an example.
<br />
<br />Suppose that there is a distant galaxy that has never been observed
<br />
from Earth, but only because no one has yet looked it with a
<br />
sufficiently powered telescope. When we do decide to point the Hubble
<br />
at it, we either will or will not observe the aftermath of a
<br />
particularly dramatic supernova whose light would have been visible
<br />
from earth centuries ago, assuming that it in fact happened, and
<br />
someone had looked at it. If I look at it with the Hubble tomorrow and
<br />
I see the results of a powerful supernova, I can safely assume that
<br />
the version of me observing it exists within the same reality as one
<br />
that experienced that supernova. If I do not see the results of the
<br />
supernova (which would have been evident if it had taken place) then
<br />
that means that the 'I' who sees the galaxy exists in a branch that
<br />
did not experience that supernova. The superposition would be resolved
<br />
into actualities by my observation.
<br />
<br />Here is the problem: the light from that supernova would have first
<br />
reached earth centuries before I made that observation. Hence, I would
<br />
not be the first earthbound entity to observe that event. Perhaps the
<br />
first conscious entity, but inanimate objects on the Earth also &quot;saw&quot;
<br />
the light from that supernova. It would seem that in this case the
<br />
superpostion was not one of genuine quantum superposition but only
<br />
uncertainty about history from our own ignorance. Suppose that I do
<br />
see that a supernova occurred, but unbeknownst to me, an ancient
<br />
astronomer had already observed the supernova. Would my observation
<br />
that a supernova had occurred still constitute a resolution of a
<br />
superposition? or would I simply learn something of which I had
<br />
previously been ignorant?
<br />
<br />It seems that questions such as what consitutes an observer and the
<br />
role of consiousness in observation go directly to the heart of the
<br />
meaning of quantum mechanics and how it may be understood/interpreted.
<br />
In order to make the schrodinger cat experiment work, an unphysical
<br />
object had to be invented, the isolation box in which the cat was
<br />
placed. It has been claimed that in fact such a macroscopic level
<br />
superposition would be impossible to realize in actuality since it is
<br />
impossible to avoid &quot;observations&quot; in the form of the environmental
<br />
interactions causing the system to decohere. Of course, preserving
<br />
such superpositions in QM systems is a problem that is very
<br />
technologically relevant as it is one that must be solved in order to
<br />
develop quantum computers.
