<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's an assumption of computationalism that the discrete 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; steps will lead to continuity of consciousness. Moreover, it's an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; assumption of computationalism that a discontinuity in substrate of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; implementation (i.e. from brain to digital computer) will preserve
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; continuity of consciousness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe that assumption is inconsistent.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; Computational steps have an order in Platonia. In implementing them
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;  &gt; &gt; in the material world, as in a computer, the sequentiallity (is that a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;  &gt; &gt; word?) of the steps is provided by the underlying physics just as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the 1s
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;  &gt; &gt; and 0s are provided by switches. But without the continuity of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;  &gt; &gt; substrate it seems the states need some axiomatic, inherent order 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;  &gt; &gt; Platonia. So then it is not clear that states can be chopped 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arbitrarily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;  &gt; &gt; finely and still function as computations - or a stream of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious states.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; Brent Meeker
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;  &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;  &gt; &gt; I don't see how it is possible to mix up something any more thoroughly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;  &gt; &gt; in the real world than it is already mixed up in Platonia.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; Sure. In the real world I can write 1 2 4 7 6 3... But in arithmtic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Platonia (a small part of the kingdom) there's no spacial or temporal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; order that can conflict with the inherent order.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But &quot;1 2 4 7 6 3...&quot; is a string in Platonia, always &quot;there&quot; even if you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't explicitly state it (as you must do in the real world), and it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doesn't manage to confuse the order of the counting numbers.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;  &gt; &gt;It's not as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;  &gt; &gt; if God has to explicitly put the integers in line one after the other:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;  &gt; &gt; they just naturally form a sequence, and they would no less form a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;  &gt; &gt; sequence if they were written on cards and thrown to the wind. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Explicit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;  &gt; &gt; ordering in the physical world is important from a third person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;  &gt; &gt; perspective. If the putative sequence has a first person 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;  &gt; &gt; the substrate of its implementation is transparent to that first 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;  &gt; &gt; experience (eg. an entity in a virtual reality environment with no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;  &gt; &gt; external input) then the implicit ordering in Platonia is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sufficient to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;  &gt; &gt; create the first person impression of continuity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;  &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;  &gt; &gt; Stathis Papaioannou
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; I don't disagree with that. But that means that a conscious, 1st 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person, pair of experiences, i.e. pair of numbers can have no order 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other than the inherent order of the numbers. And if an experience 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; corresponds to just a number, then experiences are discrete and can't be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; chopped finer than some limit.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The order of a pair of experiences is set by the fact that one is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; considered first and the other second, perhaps because there is a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subjective sense of the passage of time, perhaps because the second 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience contains a memory of the first, perhaps due to some other 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subtle aspect of the content of the experiences. 
</em><br />
<br />But on this view an experience is a complex thing, far from the atomic perception of a red flash, and even includes parts that are not conscious.  This comports with my speculation that a conscious atom is fairly complex and has a significant duration such that it overlaps the conscious atoms before and after. This overlap provides the ordering and the sense of time and continuity.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In the real world, the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subjective content reflects brain activity which in turn reflects 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; environmental input (that's why the sense of order evolved in the first 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; place), but this relationship is only a contingent one. 
</em><br />
<br />Well that's the question isn't it. Comp assumes it, but comp also leads to strange if not absurd conclusions. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If the pair of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiences are experienced in the order AB there is no way for the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiencer to know whether they were actually generated in the order AB 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or BA, unless reversing the order changes the content in some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; significant way.
</em><br />
<br />That assumes the experiences can be discretely separated with not overlap.  Certainly there are instances like that: the experience just before you lose consciousness due to a concussion and the experience just as you regain it are disjoint in this way.  You only recover continuity through accessing memories and there is a gap even in that memory.  But in ordinary circumstances the continuity might be inherent in the overlap of conscious atoms.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This means there is no natural order of physical states (or abstract 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine states): the order can be anything, and the subjective order of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience will be unchanged. It also means there is no natural order of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subjective states: that which seems first, seems first and that which 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seems second, seems second. This is good, because it doesn't depend on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any theory or assumption about consciousness.
</em><br />
<br />No natural order of physical states?  Are you denying causality?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; I guess I need a more explicit idea of how experiences occur in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arithmetic Platonia. Are we to imagine that some large number 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3875835442... is a single, atomic experience and another number 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3876976342... is another single, atomic experience and they have no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other relation than their natural order? In that case, they would be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiences in a certain bundle of streams of consciousness just in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; virtue of having some digits in common or having factors in common or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what? Or are we to imagine another Platonic object, a Turing machine, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that generates both these numbers in a certain sequence (maybe the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reverse of their natural order) - and that's what makes them parts of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the same experience bundle?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; Brent Meeker
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would say that the relationship between abstract machine states does 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not have anything to do with how mental states are ordered or even if 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they belong to the same person, except insofar as related machine states 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; may lead to mental states with related content.
</em><br />
<br />That's the question I was intending to raise.  If comp is true then a computation may instantiate some consciousness, i.e. associates a number and a conscious state in one model anyway.  Are these states ordered by inherent properties of the numbers?  Or are they ordered by their order of generation by the machine?  I think you favor the former; that states of consciousness exist timelessly in Platonia.  But each one is so complex that there is an inherent ordering, as though each one contained pointers to successors and/or predecessors. I can understand that, but seems to me make conscious states much more complex than &quot;observer moments&quot; and to include much that is not conscious.
