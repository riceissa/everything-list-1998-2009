&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now this is where the MWI starts losing its appeal.  This 'unequal 
<br />
reality' is very similar to the Copenhagen 'ghost states' that the MWI was 
<br />
so successful in avoiding.  Is what you say about this unequal reality stuff 
<br />
just speculation, or is it the actual explanation?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only way your unequal reality idea could be the actual explanation is 
<br />
if reality was defined by, as you say, a third party observer, who could 
<br />
observe all worlds at the same time.  This third party observer would be 
<br />
quantum mechanics.  So you are suggesting that there are different degrees 
<br />
of reality, and that how real something is is independent of how real we 
<br />
percieve it to be.  Perhaps it is true, but nevertheless it is a very shaky 
<br />
argument.  At the very least, it is a weakness of MWI because of its vague 
<br />
and confusing statements.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, if you assume that every world is either real or not 
<br />
real, then you either have the Copenhagen view, or you must accept that 
<br />
every possible world is real.  With the latter view, I have already shown 
<br />
that order is impossible:
<br />
<br />&lt;snip&gt;
<br />
for every split in which we are favored to follow a certain world, there 
<br />
exists another world of equally real people who assumed they would they 
<br />
would follow the same path, who instead ended up in the so-called unlikely 
<br />
world.  Because the people in both worlds are equally real, there is no way 
<br />
to say that we are more likely to follow either path; rather, between this 
<br />
single-split example, the chance would be 50/50 as to which world we would 
<br />
end up in.  Considering all possible worlds, we are back to the drawing 
<br />
board - the chance of us actually being in a world that isn't chaotic is 
<br />
pretty much nonexistant.
<br />
&lt;snip&gt;
<br />
<br />So, we have two options: either accept your 'varying degrees of reality' 
<br />
theory, or go back to the Copenhagen view (or, another option is to consider 
<br />
the theory in my post, &quot;Why the Wave Function Theory Doesn't Make Sense&quot;).

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; So if MWI is just a mathematical interpretation of QM, then why, in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;every
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; article I read about MWI, does it say that every world is equally real?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Could they all be wrong?  Also, if every world is not equally real, then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; wouldn't you basically have the Copenhagen view of QM?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This is a good point, I think.  Perhaps &quot;equally real&quot; is misleading.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If the measure of two histories is unequal, perhaps one should say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that they are unequally real -- one is more real than another.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Actually, this is reminiscent of a discussion I had with Jacques
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Mallah a while back about zombies.  I don't believe that such a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;thing as a zombie exists (something that looks and behaves like a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;conscious human, but is not conscious) but I do believe that it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probably valid to talk about some people as having a greater measure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;than others -- that is, that some people are more real than others.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;There's a significant difference, I think, between saying that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;something is &quot;less real&quot; and saying that something is &quot;not real&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Certainly, to those people of low measure, they themselves *feel*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;themselves to be just as real as anyone else.  But the measure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;question comes up from a third person perspective (or &quot;bird&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;perspective, or &quot;Archimedes&quot; perspective):  how likely is it that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a self-aware observer will find him/herself to be that person?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So, to make a long story short, I think confusion can arise from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the use of the word &quot;real&quot;, whether one means it to be a boolean
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;on/off state, or something that can be measured by a continuum.  If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;one is using it as a boolean, then one would say that alternative
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;histories of MWI are all equally real, meaning that they all are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;real, just as ours are.  But they are not all equally probable.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;In this and your previous post, I think you are confusing the MWI with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;a *theory*.  The MWI is not a theory, it is an *Interpretation* of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;theory of Quantum Mechanics.  QM defines the math and therefore the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;measure which is manifested by the MWI.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;On the other hand, your questions about measure certainly do apply to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;the theory discussed on this list, the All-Universes Hypothesis (AUH).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;With the AUH, we need to justify the measure of the alternative worlds,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;in order to make predictions for observations.  The AUH is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;equivalent to the MWI.  It is a sort of super-many-worlds idea, but it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;doesn't presuppose quantum mechanics, as MWI does.  In fact, ideally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;we would be able to derive QM from the AUH.  In fact, Russell Standish
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;purports to have done that in his just pre-released paper, at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;<a href="http://parallel.hpc.unsw.edu.au/rks/docs/occam/">http://parallel.hpc.unsw.edu.au/rks/docs/occam/</a>.
