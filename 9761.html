<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The question is: what does diagonalization prove on those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; following list of functions:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 0) R1 R2 R3 R4 R5 R6 R7 R8 ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This is an arbitrary list of functions from N to N  (not necessarily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; computable one);
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; g(n) = Rn(n) + 1
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; All Rn are well defined function from N to N, so all Rn(n) + 1 are well
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; defined number, and so g is a function from N to N. But g cannot be in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the given (arbitrary) list, and this show that the set of functions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from N to N is not enumerable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Proof by contradiction.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Indeed, if this was the case, there would be a (precise) number k such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that g = Rk. I will say that k is the index of Rk = g. Let us apply g
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on its own index k. In that case g(k) = Rk(k) + 1 = Rk(k). Again Rk(k)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is a precise number, so, by subtraction in the last equality: 1 = 0. So
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; g does not belong to the list R1 R2 R3 R4 R5 R6 R7 ... Now that list
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was arbitrary, so this proved that ALL sequences of functions from N to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; N will miss its corresponding &quot;g&quot;, that is will miss a function from N
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to N.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is the celebrate proof by Cantor of the non enumerability of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; functions from N to N.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Exercise: show that the functions from N to {0,1} are not enumerable,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by a similar proof. Hint: find the appropriate slight change in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definition of g.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />Change g to
<br />
<br />g(n) = (Rn(n) + 1) mod 2
<br />
<br />One way to think about this is to concatenate the output of each Ri and
<br />
put a decimal point (actually binary point) in front of it to make a
<br />
number between 0 and 1, expressed in binary.  Each Ri is arbitrary,
<br />
say,
<br />
<br />output of R1 = 0.101...
<br />
output of R2 = 0.010...
<br />
output of R3 = 0.100...
<br />
...
<br />
<br />but each R1 is infinitely long, since the domain of each Ri is the
<br />
natural numbers N  (i.e. each Ri is total).  If the domain wasn't all
<br />
of N, then the diagonalization wouldn't work.  Right?
<br />
<br />So
<br />
<br />g(1) = (R1(1) + 1) mod 2 = 0
<br />
g(2) = (R2(2) + 1) mod 2 = 0
<br />
g(3) = (R3(3) + 1) mod 2 = 1
<br />
...
<br />
<br />and so concatenating these together into a binary number from 0 to 1
<br />
gives
<br />
<br />output of g = 0.001...
<br />
<br />which is different from any of the Ri's.  So here we see Cantor's
<br />
original diagonal proof of the uncountability of the real numbers
<br />
played out in binary.
<br />
<br />I have to repeat though that I have misgivings about using infinite
<br />
diagonalization to try to conclude things about real-live reality
<br />
(physics, mind/body problem).  We indeed are using the law of the
<br />
excluded middle with an infinite sequence.  We are saying that since g
<br />
cannot be any particular one of the Ri's, then g is not in the whole
<br />
infinite list.  I know that this particular diagonalization is not one
<br />
that is used in your argument, but I think that the same fault is in
<br />
the other diagonalizations.  Not that this can't be used to argue about
<br />
&quot;imaginary&quot; mathematical play things like the set of real numbers, or
<br />
the other creatures that come out of the following diagonalizations,
<br />
but how can we say that these things have anything to do with reality?
<br />
I know you'll probably say that it's testable, but I have yet to see
<br />
it.  Diagonalization is not testing.  Diagonalization just produces
<br />
negative results.  Something doesn't exist.  How can we test that?

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 1) h0 h1 h2 h3 h4 h5 h6 ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This is a list of total computable functions from N to N that we can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; generate mechanically (I mean we can generate their codes). It means
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that we can generate the codes of each hi, written in some language,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and that, for some reason, we are sure that each hi is total
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; computable. Examples: Caylor last funny enumeration; all the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (transfinite collection of) sequences of growing functions we have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; defined in this thread (since &quot;Smullyan Smullyan ...&quot;);
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; g(n) = hn(n) + 1
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; All hn are well defined function from N to N, and now we are told they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are also computable. And then we are also told that we can generate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mechanically their codes, for example: C1 C2 C3 C4 ... where each Ci
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computes the functions hi. (Meaning the program/codes Ci with input n
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will gives the result hi(n). In particular all hn(m) can be computed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, this means in particular that I can compute hn(n). Just apply Cn
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on n. So obviously, for any n, I can compute hn(n)+1. Just generate the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ci up to Cn, apply it to n and add one. But this is g(n), and so g is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computable function from N to N.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But now g cannot belong to the list h1 h2 h3 ....  The hi does not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exhaust the computable functions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Proof by contradiction.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Indeed if g belongs to that list, then it exists a precise number k
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such that g = hk. G would have a program Ck. Let us apply g on its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; index k. g(k) = hk(k) = hk(k)+1. Now hk(k) is the result of appying the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; program Ck, which computes a total, well defined function, so it is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; number which I can subtract  on each side of the last inequality giving
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 0 = 1.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This show that all mechanically generable set of total computable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; functions will miss a total computable functions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Obviously, the set of total computable function *is* enumerable. We
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have just proved that this set cannot be mechanically enumerable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Logicians says such sets are not recursively enumerable; they write
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that they are not RE.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Actually we have show more: such set are constructively not recursively
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; enumerable. This is because the diagonalization is effective. Given any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attempt to enumerate a set of total computable functions can lead
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mechanically to the counterexample. Such sets are called productive.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We have met already three examples of such sets: the set of (code of)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; total functions, the set of formal arithmetical truth, the set of all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computable growing functions, etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Any RE set approximating such a set can be extended into the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constructive transfinite (reread perhaps the posts on the growing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; functions).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />In this post, you don't say that the functions are &quot;effectively
<br />
computable&quot;, just &quot;computable&quot;.  Is effectiveness implied?  I thought
<br />
that computable meant just codable as an algorithm, you can program it,
<br />
and effective means it also takes a finite amount of time to produce
<br />
its output.  I think I've read that computable can mean effectively
<br />
computable.  Is this the case here?
<br />
<br />So does mechanically generable basically mean that you can write a
<br />
finite program that will be able to generate the code for all of the
<br />
functions in the sequence?  In other words, simply having the infinite
<br />
list of programs &quot;hardcoded&quot; into the program wouldn't qualify, because
<br />
then the program (that generates the code for the functions) would be
<br />
infinitely long.  So mechanically generable (same as RE?) means that
<br />
the set of functions is such that it can be ordered so that it follows
<br />
some pattern that can be compressed into a finite set of rules.  Right?
<br />
<br />(By the way, Wikipedia is hard to follow here.  Without re-looking it
<br />
up, I think that the definitions of &quot;computable&quot; and &quot;recursively
<br />
enumerable&quot; seem mutually circular, so I've found it hard to pin them
<br />
down.)
<br />
<br />So in other words we've proved that the whole set of total computable
<br />
functions is *not* such that it can be ordered so that it follows a
<br />
pattern that can be compressed into a finite set of rules (algorithm).
<br />
<br />Again, I'll be interested to find out how this relates to reality in a
<br />
testable way.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 2) f0 f1 f2 f3 f4 f5 f6 f7 ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This is an arbitrary list of *all* total computable functions;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Given that the set of the (code) of the total function is enumerable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (although not *recursively* enumarable), we can use the bijection
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between that set and the set of natural numbers to give to such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; function the indices 0, 1, 2, 3, ... getting f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, ....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The preceding reasoning has already shown that such a bijection cannot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be computable, indeed it would make the set of total functions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recursively enumerable. But you can got the contradiction by direct
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; construction of g, and it is instructive to do so:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; g(n) = fn(n) + 1
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Does that g belongs to the list of the fi ? Put in another way: is g a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; total computable function?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Suppose it is, then it exists a k such that g = fk, and applying g on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; its own indice will give gk(k) = fk(k) = fk(k) + 1. And g has been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumed total so that fk(k) is a number, and so I can subtract it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; getting 0 = 1 as usual.
</em><br />
<br />It seems like it's actually the other way around.  First we assumed
<br />
that all of the fk's are total (and so fk(k) is a number).  Since all
<br />
fk's are total, then g is total.  But the conclusion is the same.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This shows that g is not computable, and given that all fi are, it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; means that it is the bijection i -&gt; fi is itself not computable. We
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; knew that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />So for a bijection to be not computable would mean that you can't write
<br />
a (finite) algorithm that could take each natural number 1,2,3,... and
<br />
output the code for the corresponding f1,f2,f3,...  This sounds like
<br />
saying the set of fi's are not mechanically generable (recursively
<br />
enumberable).  Right?
<br />
<br />Could we alternatively conclude that g is not total, so that some of
<br />
the fk's are not total?  But then I think this would put us down in the
<br />
4th diagonalization below?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 3) F0 F1 F2 F3 F4 F5 F6 F7 F8 ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This is the list of all programmable things in some &quot;universal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; language&quot; like fortran.  CT asserts fortran is universal so that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; total computable function fi will be dispersed *among* those Fi things,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; so that a universal machine can really compute all the fi, among other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; things.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Now the same diagonalization argument proves 4 different propositions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; according to which list we are talking about. Which one?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Before answering, I let people muse a little about what are those 4
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; different consequences,  given that the only way to really grasp those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; propositions consists in rediscovering them by oneself,  ... or at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; least in searching enough so as to be curious listening to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; solutions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I let you think on this one. The most important one. We will get a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; precise definition of universal function and of relative universal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine/code/index/number from the list of the Fi.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Must go now,

<br />My finite digital (equivalently, if comp it true?) brain has worn out
<br />
for now.  It seems that on the 4th diagonalization, Church Thesis is
<br />
trying to say something about reality, finally.  I guess it's your
<br />
bridge between math and reality.  I think I need to get back to reality
<br />
and get some sleep.
