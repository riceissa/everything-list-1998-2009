<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;I don't think it is that good an analogy for the following reason:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;I don't believe that pushing a button to create a copy of me in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;New York will increase my expectation of experiencing New York,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;while I believe that flipping a coin to decide whether I'll take a plane
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;to New York does.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;The latter case you could describe in terms of a splitting of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;muiltiverse in two universes: one in which I go to New York and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;one in which I don't. The former I would represent in terms of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;single universe where I will not experience New York, but only a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;copy of me will.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;I think there is something fundamental about the fact that the copies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;can meet *in principle*. It doesn't matter how hard it is, how far
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;away you put them, or how controlled you do it. All it matters for me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;is that they could, in principle, communicate. In this case I don't believe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;I could have a first person expectation of being in New York.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Eric2 finds himself in New York:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; E2- Wow! It worked after all! I really am in New York!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; E1- You might be in New York, but I haven't gone anywhere, and I'm the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; original.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; E2- How can you demonstrate that you have any more claim to being Eric than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have? I know everything Eric knows, I look like Eric, I certainly feel
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 100% certain that I'm Eric; what else could I possibly do to convince you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than that?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; E1- But you materialised out of thin air [or whatever copies materialise out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of], whereas nothing happened to me, I'm still here where I was. So
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; obviously I'm the original!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; E2- None of that proves that you have any more claim to being Eric than I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; am, even if you could somehow show you were the &quot;original&quot; and I a &quot;copy&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, I have some information that might interest you. The people who set
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; up this duplication procedure have not been entirely honest with you. When
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the &quot;original&quot; Eric pushed that button, a copy was created, but locally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rather than in New York. In fact, the copy was created in a room exactly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like the one you are in now. Then, the original Eric flew to New York in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; normal way. So you see, I'm the original and you are the copy!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; E1- But that's ridiculous! I feel *exactly* the same as I did before
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pressing that button; nothing at all happened to *me*, so I have to be the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; original!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; E2- So how do you think you should have felt if you were the copy? That's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the whole idea of a functionally identical copy: no-one, neither the copy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nor anyone else, can tell that there is any difference. And anyway, it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happens to us all the time even without duplicating machines. Almost all the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; atoms in our body are replaced over the course of months or years. It
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happens gradually, but if it happened quickly, the effect would be that you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would completely disintegrate and be replaced by a near-identical copy who
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thinks he is you, remembers everything you remember, etc. How is that any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different to what has just happened to us?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; E1- For one thing, that would be different because there is only one Eric
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; extant at any one time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; E2- Which would have been the case if we were using destructive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; teleportation, where the original is destroyed in the process of scanning
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it. But you're being a bit inconsistent, aren't you? You're saying that if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the original were destroyed and replaced with a copy, as happens in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; course of life over time, then the copy would have the right to call himself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the &quot;original&quot;; whereas if the original were not destroyed, the copy would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not be the &quot;original&quot;. And yet in both cases the copy would be exactly the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; same.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; E1- I don't know about &quot;the same&quot;; I might feel more at ease if you weren't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; around...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; E2- Oh! So now you admit that you're the copy!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [and we could go on like this for quite a while, with no resolution to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem...]
</em><br />
<br />Yep, it's a hard problem, and I heard that line of argumentation hundreds of
<br />
times. But I am still not convinced that the mere fact that someone scans me
<br />
would increase my expectation of having a discontinuity of experience.
<br />
<br />I agree that the dialogue above would happen (or not exactly, because Eric
<br />
wouldn't believe that &quot;destructive teleportation&quot; is &quot;teleportation&quot; at all. He 
<br />
would say that it is homicide followed by duplication. 
<br />
<br />In fact, I believe that in your example &quot;Eric the copy&quot; would probably agree
<br />
that he is a copy after seing evidence of that, and would live with his life
<br />
without claiming the rights of the original. That would make him very unhappy
<br />
and confused, of course, and then &quot;Eric the original&quot; would pity him and help
<br />
him as he would help a twin brother.
<br />
<br />Furthermore, there is always some way to tell the difference between the
<br />
copy and the original, in principle, even if that infomation is not
<br />
epistemologically
<br />
available to the subjects themselves. If the original flew to New York, then he
<br />
would have interacted with the environment in a completely different way than if
<br />
he stayed in the room, and that interaction deposits information about his
<br />
trajectory in the environment in an irreversible manner.
<br />
<br />I believe that the solution is not 3-rd person communicable. I believe that if
<br />
I press the button 100 times, I'll never experience leaving the room, but
<br />
there will be 100 copies of me claiming otherwise. That is because I believe 
<br />
that my 1-st person probability (in the sense of degree of belief) in this case
<br />
is NOT equal to the fraction of functionally identical copies. I believe
<br />
that my first person expectation is not measurable by 3rd parties.
<br />
<br />The only way I can be convinced otherwise is by doing the test. But then you
<br />
would never know, because empirically (for 3rd parties) the result would be
<br />
the same in either case.
<br />
<br />I know that sounds somewhat solipsist in the end, but I can't believe
<br />
that merely scanning me can affect my future. And I would like to
<br />
be convinced otherwise, because I don't like solipsism.
<br />
<br />Eric.
