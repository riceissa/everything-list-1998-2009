Hi Russell
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Thanks for your lucid comments. Maybe you are a better advocate
<br />
&nbsp;of Bruno's than Bruno himself...

<br />
&nbsp;All I see him saying here is that YD is incompatible with wavefunction

&nbsp;collapse, and also with the Bohm interpretation. His UDA does point to

&nbsp;the necessity of a Everett style Multiverse, which does not have

&nbsp;collapse nor a Bohmian-style preferred branch.

&nbsp;&nbsp;That would be fine if it was really what he is saying! But he insists

that
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;it is not out of the question that he can derive collapse&quot; from the

same
<br />
&nbsp;premises. My point is that you can't have it both ways.

<br />&nbsp;[RS]
<br />
&nbsp;That is indeed true. It is cheaper to look for inconsistencies in a
<br />
&nbsp;theory that to perform experiments. Also, unbelievable founding
<br />
&nbsp;propositions should be eliminated wherever possible.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;However, the &quot;claim&quot; (ontological reversal) I take as a sort of
<br />
&nbsp;metaphysical principle, ultimately unprovable, but a guide as to how
<br />
&nbsp;one thinks about the world. It has the same status as a belief in a
<br />
&nbsp;concrete reality, or in Occam's razor. Its utility must be in its
<br />
&nbsp;ability to form new scientific theories, rather than in its ability to
<br />
&nbsp;predict fact. In my book, I point to a number of specific theoretical
<br />
&nbsp;ideas in the theory of consciousness that are implied by ontological
<br />
&nbsp;reversal that are currently controversial in cognitive science. The
<br />
&nbsp;relationship between self-awareness and consciousness being one of
<br />
&nbsp;them. If these specific ideas prove to be of little worth as our
<br />
&nbsp;understanding of consciousness improves, then &quot;ontological reversal&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;will either be dropped as being of little value, or else appropriately
<br />
&nbsp;morphed to yield better theories.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;What you are here circumscribing with your careful prose is exactly the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;domain of philosophical speculation --- for which I have much regard 
<br />
but
<br />
&nbsp;try not to confuse with that of scientific prediction. One of the most
<br />
&nbsp;intriguing novelties which quantum mechanics has made possible is
<br />
&nbsp;the settling of some specific items of speculation by empirical means,
<br />
&nbsp;and the creation of what some people call &quot;experimental metaphysics&quot;.
<br />
&nbsp;That was the case of the Bell-EPR experiments which showed that a
<br />
&nbsp;good number of speculative departures from QM (local hidden-variable
<br />
&nbsp;theories) are largely inviable. Clearly we do not know what the limits
<br />
&nbsp;are to this type of approach but the parts of it that we already have
<br />
&nbsp;settled should definitely bind our future speculation.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;I have not had a chance to check your book but, from the posts about
<br />
&nbsp;it, I confess I am much intrigued about it. When I manage to go thru it
<br />
&nbsp;I will try and give you some feed back along the same lines as I have
<br />
&nbsp;done with Bruno.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[RS]
<br />
&nbsp;The assumptions of COMP are actually widely supposed to be true, hence
<br />
&nbsp;the importance of Bruno's work. He demonstrates that under COMP,
<br />
&nbsp;ontological reversal is necessary, and a belief in concrete reality
<br />
&nbsp;false.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Curiously, I am in a position where I don't believe COMP to be
<br />
&nbsp;strictly true, but is perhaps an approximation of reality. I would be
<br />
&nbsp;intrigued in generalization of the COMP argument. However, I find
<br />
&nbsp;that the ontological reversal (or perhaps even ontological &quot;cycle&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;with the AP) is metaphysically less extravagant than belief on
<br />
&nbsp;concrete reality. Furthermore, the approach really does deliver most
<br />
&nbsp;of physics as we know it today, as I argue in my book. I am sceptical
<br />
&nbsp;that Bruno's approach of reducing knowledge to various modal logic
<br />
&nbsp;structures will deliver much of substance, but at very least I can
<br />
&nbsp;appreciate that it is a test of the theory.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;Now I am confused! So you do not believe Bruno's COMP=YD+CT+AP
<br />
&nbsp;but you still believe it is a good enough approximation of reality to
<br />
&nbsp;&quot;deliver most of physics as we know it today&quot;. Are you saying that,
<br />
&nbsp;without assuming COMP you derive all of that physics? I guess I
<br />
&nbsp;will have to read your book but a Yes/No answer would help me
<br />
&nbsp;decide whether I want to read it at all...
<br />
<br />&nbsp;I would rather argue out your assumptions because, as you may
<br />
&nbsp;agree, measures of metaphysical extravagance tend to be a bit,
<br />
&nbsp;if I may use the word, subjective. I am much more interested in
<br />
&nbsp;how one can empirically decide whether a metaphysical thesis
<br />
&nbsp;is indeed too extravagant to be true.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Best regards,
<br />
