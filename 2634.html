<br />Basically what you said above. It is also the skeptical inductivism
<br />
Davis Lewis talk about in his &quot;the plurality of worlds&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; but I think it's

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;another version of this problem...isn't white actually a pretty common color

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;for rabbits though?  Is it an Alice in Wonderland reference?)
</em><br />
<br />Sure. It is *the* Wonderland's white rabbit. I'm used to that 
<br />
expression and I have been happily surprised by its success in the list,
<br />
because there is nothing wrong with a &quot;white rabbit&quot; indeed.
<br />
Schmidhuber has talked about &quot;lambs eating wolves&quot; somewhere in relation
<br />
with that problems. 
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;A lot of people have a lot of different ideas about TOE's on this list, so 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;maybe the global measure issue could help clarify where we all stand in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;relation to each other...do people have specific proposals about this?  I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;guess the other relevant question is, what is the set of &quot;everything&quot; that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you're putting the measure on...all computations?  All mathematical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;structures?  All observer-moments?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Let me know what you think...
</em><br />
<br />... Jesse Mazer wrote in the same thread:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Russell Standish's page also mentions another option I hadn't 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;thought of: an observer-relative measure.
</em><br />
<br /><br />The question &quot;if the measure should be absolute or relative&quot;
<br />
has been discussed a lot in the thread around Bostrom
<br />
self-sampling assumption + some remarks by Wei Dai.
<br />
Russell Standish, George Levy and myself 
<br />
and (hopefully) some others
<br />
seems to agree on the
<br />
relative use of that measure, although I argue that both aspect
<br />
could be important, i.e. there could be an interplay between 
<br />
some absolute universal prior and relative conditional information.
<br />
If I remember correctly Jacques Mallah critisizes the nuances about
<br />
relativisation and conditionalisation: you can have an absolute
<br />
measure and consider that its relativisation are produced by 
<br />
classical conditionalisation. (I basically agree if we keep
<br />
in mind the difference of point of view).
<br />
<br />In my thesis there is two parts: one where I show that if we are
<br />
machine then &quot;physics&quot; is reduced to the search of an &quot;absolute
<br />
definition&quot; of an observer-relative (first person plural) measure.
<br />
In the second part I have developed a road toward a purely mathematical
<br />
isolation of that measure based on the incompleteness phenomena.
<br />
I got the logic of the certainty-case P=1, and show it to be closely
<br />
related with quantum logic. And I take *that* as a confirmation
<br />
of both the comp-reversal and the way I have chosen for interviewing
<br />
the universal machine.
<br />
<br />Schmidhuber's solution is based on a belongness relation between
<br />
observer and universes which is impossible to keep once we take
<br />
comp seriously. But even if we make sense to such a relation, it
<br />
would only eliminates third person white rabbits and not the
<br />
first person white rabbits: remember that the great programmer
<br />
emulates all (semi)computable &quot;universe&quot; but also all possible 
<br />
dreams.
<br />
<br />In fact Schmidhuber assume a solution of the mind body problem
<br />
which is just incompatible with comp. Technically that makes 
<br />
his work incomplete (at least).
