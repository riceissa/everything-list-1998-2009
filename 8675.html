<em class="quotelev1">&gt;[Bruno:]&gt; Well thanks. Pistology perhaps? I must say I like to use already

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;negative for the term &quot;theology&quot; ... I do think, perhaps unmodestly, that

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;my approach belongs to the Classical Platonic Theology from Pythagoras to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Proclus. (Of course Pythagoras comes before Plato but can be considered as

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Pistology or some longer word. Actually I'm surprised that a word like this

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;doesn't already exist. Searching on the 'Net, I find that the World

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Congress of Faiths has coined a word &quot;fideology.&quot; (I'm not religious and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I've never heard of them.) <a href="http://www.worldfaiths.org/fideology2004.htm">http://www.worldfaiths.org/fideology2004.htm</a> . 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I'll bet they entertained the coinage &quot;pistology&quot; and rejected it in favor 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of &quot;fideology&quot; even though &quot;fideology&quot; is a Latin-Greek combo. Evidence 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that &quot;pistology&quot; might be better off with some euphonious prefix.
</em><br />
<br />Is &quot;pistis&quot; related to &quot;episteme&quot;, the greek word for knowledge which is the 
<br />
root of &quot;Epistemology&quot;? Epistemology is the philosophical study of beliefs 
<br />
and whether they are justified--see 
<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology</a> . Would &quot;machine epistemology&quot; 
<br />
work for Bruno?
<br />
<br />I found a page which seems to say the difference between &quot;pistis&quot; and 
<br />
&quot;episteme&quot; has something to do with practical vs. theoretical knowledge:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.civsoc.com/reconphil/reconphil2.html">http://www.civsoc.com/reconphil/reconphil2.html</a>
<br />
<br />&quot;Ethics and politics are fields of practical philosophy. A person who 
<br />
possesses knowledge in these fields is not someone who can construct proofs, 
<br />
but rather someone who deliberates well about particular cases -- i.e., 
<br />
someone whose deliberation leads to happy results. What can philosophy 
<br />
contribute to a development of the capacity to deliberate well?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;While philosophy is master in the cognitive realm of pure theory, 
<br />
philosophy has a lesser contribution to make in the fields of ethics and 
<br />
politics. In these fields, experience and skills in deliberation are 
<br />
paramount. Philosophy can provide a vocabulary and a moral grammar that can 
<br />
make deliberation more effective. But knowledge in these fields is 
<br />
ultimately of the particular case and, of the particular case, there can be 
<br />
no certain, final, or complete knowledge.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The field of practical knowledge is a field in which pistis or 
<br />
true belief, as opposed to episteme, constitutes the maximum goal. At the 
<br />
conclusion of deliberation, i.e., at the moment of ethical and political 
<br />
decision, it is impossible to know with certainty whether the particular 
<br />
case has been judged rightly. Only time can tell that and never with 
<br />
finality. The final state reached in deliberation is thus a state of being 
<br />
persuaded. Ethical and political deliberation thus calls into play the 
<br />
cognitive categories proper to rhetoric.
<br />
<br />...
<br />
<br />&quot;Thus, Aristotelian political philosophy, in identifying itself strictly as 
<br />
a form of practical reflection as opposed to theoretical cognition, i.e., as 
<br />
belonging to the cognitive domain of pistis as opposed to episteme, viewed 
<br />
itself more or less self-consciously as a component of what I would call 
<br />
Greek republican civic culture.&quot;
<br />
<br />This page says something similar, that the distinction is about convincing 
<br />
others using rhetoric vs. justifying them in some absolute theoretical 
<br />
sense:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.crvp.org/book/Series01/I-26/chapter_two.htm">http://www.crvp.org/book/Series01/I-26/chapter_two.htm</a>
<br />
<br />&quot;Thus, in 1985, although he himself didn’t describe it in these terms (and, 
<br />
for that matter, no doubt still wouldn’t), Rawls, in effect, reinterpreted 
<br />
his philosophical project as a project belonging to the cognitive realm of 
<br />
rhetoric. Traditionally, rhetorical reason defined its cognitive realm as 
<br />
the realm of pistis or belief, as opposed to the cognitive realm claimed by 
<br />
philosophy, the realm of episteme or science. Belief, or pistis, is the 
<br />
state of being persuaded. To the extent that any discourse aims at producing 
<br />
belief, i.e., the uncoerced adherence of its intended audience, to that 
<br />
extent it belongs to the cognitive domain of rhetoric. This is the way it 
<br />
seems that Rawls, since 1985, has conceived of his inquiry into the 
<br />
principles of justice. His aim is no longer (if it ever was) to arrive at a 
<br />
timelessly true statement of the universal principles of social justice, but 
<br />
rather to offer a statement of the principles of justice that might win the 
<br />
uncoerced adherence of the reasonable citizens of a modern constitutional 
<br />
democracy. The principles of justice produced by Rawls’s inquiry are to be 
<br />
judged cognitively not by the standard traditionally identified with 
<br />
philosophy, i.e., the standard of timeless truth, but rather by the standard 
<br />
traditionally identified with rhetoric, i.e., the standard consisting in the 
<br />
successful establishment of a body of uncoerced shared belief.&quot;
