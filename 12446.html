<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK. Now, if you accept, if only just for the sake of the argument, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mechanist hypothesis, then you will see there could be an explanation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; why you feel necessary to postulate such a personal God. But then I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; must agree this explanation is more coherent with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;theories/philosophies&quot; in which that &quot;God&quot; is so much *personal* that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it looks like the &quot;first person&quot; canonically associated to the machine.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In that case your &quot;personal God&quot; would be the &quot;machine third hypostase&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or &quot;Plotinus universal soul&quot;. It is the unameable self (re)defined by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bp  &amp;  p.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />If we are limiting ourselves to some finite machine or person, say
<br />
myself, and thus the third hypostase is simply my first person
<br />
experience, that is not the same as my personal God.
<br />
<br />However, if we are talking about the &quot;largest&quot; person possible, then
<br />
the third hypostase (Bp &amp; p) is based on the first hypostase (p) where
<br />
p is ALL TRUTH.  Then if we take the first hypostase to be the
<br />
impersonal Arithmetic Truth, or any impersonal truth, then the third
<br />
hypostase based on that (Bp &amp; p) seems to be akin to the World Soul of
<br />
pantheism mentioned my Smullyan in &quot;Who Knows?&quot; p. 20.  I presume this
<br />
is akin to the universal soul that is sometimes referred to in MWI
<br />
discussions about all of us belonging ultimately to the same person,
<br />
since we all eventually have every experience.
<br />
<br />However, this is not the same as the personal God's Soul, or what I
<br />
mapped to the Holy Spirit.  The third hypostase I referred to in my
<br />
Christian interpretation of the hypostases was based on the first
<br />
hypostase corresponding to God the Father, or &quot;I am that I am&quot;, or
<br />
&quot;Yahweh&quot;.  (more on naming below)  This is the personal God, not an
<br />
impersonal god.  Without a personal God at the top (by definition!)
<br />
there is no impetus for downward emanation.  Numbers don't care about
<br />
us and our plight with evil!  With only numbers or other impersonal
<br />
things, we are forever stuck with evil.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; If someone
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; wants to research the historical record sufficiently to convince
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; themselves one way or another about the Bible or Jesus' resurrection,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that's great, and I can give them some sources, but it's probably too
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; contingent for this List.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps. The problem is that I just cannot take an expression like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Jesus is the Son of God&quot; as a scientific proposition. It could be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; true, it could be false without me seeing a way to resolve it. On the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contrary, I can find in the talk by Jesus general pattern which makes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense, and, indeed, 2/3 of Christian theology is probably compatible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with the comp hyp. Somehow, any literal interpretation of *any* text
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (even PA's axioms !) should be considered with systematic suspicion.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />Notice that I used the word &quot;convince themselves&quot; rather than &quot;proof&quot;.
<br />
(I used proof later on, but that was a mistake when talking with you,
<br />
because I wasn't using it in the sense of a mathematical logic proof,
<br />
like an inference from axioms.)  The reality of the personal God in His
<br />
three Persons fulfilling the first four hypostases is obviously greater
<br />
than any truth that is accessible within the realm of mathematical
<br />
provability (G) of finite persons or machines.  You can see that
<br />
through your statement that goodness is based on truth, so in a sense
<br />
the personal God is even &quot;bigger&quot; than all Arithmetical Truth.  This
<br />
makes sense also from my statement that you need more than truth at the
<br />
core, but also love and communication.  So trying to &quot;prove&quot; God in
<br />
some logical inference sense would not only be &quot;harder&quot; than trying to
<br />
prove all Arithmetical Truth, it's even a category error since that
<br />
wouldn't address love and communication.  Trying to &quot;prove&quot; God in this
<br />
step-by-step way is actually equivalent to trying to become God.  Not
<br />
only will we be forever short of seeing God, but we will be missing the
<br />
love and communication aspect.  So in a sense, putting our hope in just
<br />
numerical truth is like hoping in only one dimension when more are
<br />
required.
<br />
<br />The word &quot;convince&quot; is meant to convey something akin to convincing
<br />
ourselves of the truth of Church's Thesis.  It is like a machine at
<br />
level G convincing itself of truth at the G* level.  It is like the
<br />
&quot;circumstantial evidence&quot; that Smullyan refers to (p. 5).  The great
<br />
thing is this:  Say p=(all that the personal God is).  Then Bp is the
<br />
Logos, which has both the divine level, say G*(Logos), and the human
<br />
level, say G(Logos), so that G(Logos) is the Word that &quot;became flesh
<br />
and dwelt among us&quot;, the Son of God.  Now let G(Tom) = all of the truth
<br />
that I can prove.  Now of course this is not as &quot;big&quot; as G(Logos), and
<br />
probably (I'm sure!) isn't even as &quot;big&quot; as G(Bruno).  However, you can
<br />
help me to discover areas of G(Tom) that I'm not aware of.  In fact,
<br />
the G(Tom(half asleep)) or the G(Tom(before Bruno helped me)) may not
<br />
be as big as the G(Tom(awake)) or G(Tom(after Bruno helped me)).  So
<br />
G(Tom(awake)) contains some of G*(Tom(half asleep)) minus G(Tom(half
<br />
asleep)).  (Actually, sometimes it's the inverse where I realize
<br />
something when I'm half asleep, and then when I wake up I have to
<br />
figure out what I realized :) In other words, the fact that the
<br />
personal God took on a form G(Logos) made it possible for us to
<br />
&quot;behold&quot; him and expand our consciousness upward toward Someone who is
<br />
more than just numbers.  And it's more than just being able to expand
<br />
our consciousness, there's the solution to evil too, the solution to
<br />
the separation between us and who we really are meant to be.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But I do have response to your comment on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; universal-ness below.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I agree I was too loose in my use of hypercomputation as an analogy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Actually the direction of the &quot;spanning&quot; was downward, going from G*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (celestial) to G terrestial, described by the Greek work kenosis
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (emptying).  This does not mean that God the Father (the personal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; fulfillment of the first hypostase), or the Holy Spirit (...second
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; hypostase) discontinued to exist, but that the Logos became flesh and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; dwelt among us, so that we could see his grace and truth.  Again, this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; does not mean that we cannot believe and seek truth, and have a feeling
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that we are on the right track, without a relationship with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; personal God.  This means that the ultimate source of all truth made
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; himself known to us on a human level and solved the problem of evil.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Again this can have some symbolic sense. Literaly it is enough I know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just one suffering Dog to feel uneasy with the idea that the concrete
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (not the theological) problem of evil is solved.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />So the solution to the problem of evil *starts* with the theological
<br />
solution, as I said above, the solution to the separation between us
<br />
and who we really are meant to be.  Since we were made in the image of
<br />
the personal God, then with the G(Logos) we can be brought into
<br />
relationship with Him again.  This is the core to the solution of evil.
<br />
&nbsp;Now this does not automatically imply that evil is immediately solved
<br />
down in the 5th through 8th hypostases, i.e. the concrete problem of
<br />
evil.  But the solution to evil must first start at the level of our
<br />
human persons.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Death itself is the ultimate effect of evil: separation/isolation from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; everything and everyone.  Jesus proved his divinity by raising
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; *himself* from the dead.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A very big advance in modern and serious parapsychology is that humans
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are easily fooled by humans. How could you say Jesus has proved
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something? Even if someone appear and can change water in wine and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; makes miracles etc. I would not take this as a proof. Remember I even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think there is just no proofs concerning any reality. Proofs belongs to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theories. Facts does not prove. Facts confirms or refute beliefs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (theories).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />See above.  I know that it's in the category of &quot;circumstancial
<br />
evidence&quot;, or a &quot;sign&quot; as the Bible calls it.  It makes sense to me
<br />
that the personal God would choose a sign that addressed the ultimate
<br />
effect of evil: death.  A mathematical proof just doesn't hack it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I am not saying that God's communication is an exhaustive communication
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of all truth, i.e. all facts (scientific, historic, etc.) that it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; possible for us to know.  It was a message saying, &quot;I am here. I love
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; you. I am your source of meaning. Here is my hand to rescue you from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; darkness/meaninglessness and death/isolation.  Your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; meaning/relationships are actually, ultimately, based on something:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Me.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But how could I know if jesus was not refering to the universal &quot;me&quot;,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in which case I can make sense of what he said both relatively to Plato
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or Plotinus theory and with the comp hyp. If Jesus meant literally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; himself, then, well I wait someone can even address a theory in which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such literal truth can make sense.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />I'm still working on this. Hopefully the other paragraphs in this post
<br />
will help a little.  Reading Romans 8 might help.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is a cute story, but how could we be *sure* it was not a collective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hallucination? I recall that I take already the appearance of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical universe as a sort of collective (all machine) hallucination.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am not saying that Jesus' resurrection was such an hallucination, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are you willing to be scientific on this, meaning are you prepared to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doubt any axiom of your theory?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />While I am still in this finite body I will doubt.  Being told truth
<br />
doesn't mean that we don't doubt.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; In a similar manner as &quot;I don't know about other planets&quot;, I would say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I ultimately don't know about other people (first person pov and all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that), what it means for them to believe in the personal God's love for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; them.  All I know is the way I've heard it (Jesus being the personal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; God's hand to us).  To try to worry and orchestrate how all of that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; works for everyone would be going way above my competence.  But this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; doesn't negate the truth of the personal God.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To be clear, with comp there is a personal God, which is the unnameable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self all enough correct machine have in themselves.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />Isn't this just Bp &amp; p? This is not All Arithmetic Truth, and even more
<br />
it is not the personal God which is bigger than that.
<br />
However, when we believe in Jesus [i.e. the G*(Logos) made flesh into
<br />
G(Logos), or all Bp where p = (all that the personal God is)], then Bp
<br />
&amp; p, i.e. God's Spirit, &quot;Himself bears witness with our spirit that we
<br />
are children of God&quot; (Romans 8:16).  This is the same Spirit that fills
<br />
in the gaps when we pray (Romans 8:26-27) and the same Spirit that will
<br />
fill the gap when our bodies die, and give us life (Romans 8:11).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; To the last question, yes.  However, I think that Godel's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; axiomatization also applies to an impersonal god.  The axioms for a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; personal God would have to include all three persons as I outlined with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the four hypostases.  This is for reasons similar to the reasoning of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the hypostases, with the added axiom that the ultimate One is personal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and that the three persons somehow communicate and love one another.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This is the basis on which there can be communication and love among
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; other persons.  In a way, communication and love are on a par with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; truth on the ontological scale.  This is an important point.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree, but it is even because I agree that I am afraid your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interpretation of Jesus and &quot;witness&quot; interpretation sound too literal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and could help those who want to abandon the theological baby with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; criminogenic human pseudo religious behavior.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Influence by comp I would add that the &quot;personal God&quot; is so much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; personal that the enlightened person will never mention It. Personal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; God are personal. Of course we can talk about such &quot;personal things&quot; in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a list where the very notion of person is addressed. personal stuff are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not scientific, but this does not forbid 3-talk on such &quot;personal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things&quot;, once we agree enough on some axioms etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />I agree.  With Jesus as the fulfillment of the 2nd/3rd hypostases, i.e.
<br />
the third-person pov, then He really is the &quot;3-talk&quot; on the ultimate
<br />
personal God.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This goes back to his death and resurrection, which opened up the way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; again for our relationship with the personal God.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ... as far as &quot;I&quot; am Jesus. If not, I could argue that the message has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not even been delivered to me. Got an atheist education ... I stop
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; believing in Santa Klaus and Jesus the same day in my early childhood.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I was astonished that my cousins stop to believe in Santa Klaus but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; kept they belief is Jesus.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />Santa Claus is just a source of things, which are dispensable.  Jesus
<br />
is a source of the indispensable.  You agree that we have to believe in
<br />
some source of the indispensable.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If this annoy you just put the third hypostase (the first person, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universal soul) &quot;above&quot; the 0-person. This is just a tiny nuance,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unless you are sure by your literal interpretation of Jesus.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />But the first hypostase is all truth, etc. (p), from which the
<br />
second/third (Bp) and fourth (Bp &amp; p) are derived.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If that helps you it is ok. But, as others have illustrated, it seems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such believes are not necessary. Now the main the point is that if you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't allow *possible* (re)interpretation of you theory, it would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prevent progress. Science = Doubt.  Factual things like &quot;Jesus is the

<br />Regarding naming things and believing something literally.  I'm not
<br />
saying that Jesus was saying &quot;What you see here is all there is to
<br />
God&quot;.  As I said above, I agree that we would not be able to see all
<br />
there is to God.  We are finite.  Could you tell me a better way in
<br />
which, if there were a personal God who is absolutely good and infinite
<br />
and loving and the ultimate basis of personal communication and truth,
<br />
that personal God could tell us, &quot;Hello, I am the personal God, and you
<br />
are made in my image and I love you and want to rescue you from your
<br />
separation from me.&quot;  How could he do it?
<br />
<br />So, if the personal God gave us a communication (Logos) that is more
<br />
than just arithmetic truth about who we are, then would it be
<br />
successful to throw it away and try to see if we can build everything
<br />
from the ground up with  just numbers?  Science and Doubt is good for
<br />
building, but you have to build given some kernel, and love and
<br />
personhood is part of the kernel itself.  The only way to know this is
<br />
to be told by the source, the ultimate loving Person, through a
<br />
third-person message (Logos).  Now messages can always be misread,
<br />
there is always some signal-to-noise ratio, but there is a signal, not
<br />
just noise.  But without an ultimate Person, it would be just noise.
