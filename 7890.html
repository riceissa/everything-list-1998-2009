Hi Lee,
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First I would like to thank you for working hard on this question. In 
<br />
doing this you are challenging me to refine my ideas and explanations and 
<br />
thus you are helping me a great deal. That being said, I would like to 
<br />
refute your &quot;common sense Realism&quot; and show that it is missing the most 
<br />
salient point of Realism: that it not have any &quot;cracks&quot; through which 
<br />
anything &quot;unreal&quot; might slip.
<br />

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     Just one point while I have some time and mental clarity. Can a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Realist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; accept that &quot;a wholly independent world &quot;out there&quot; exists and existed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; before he did&quot; and yet can admit that the particular properties of this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;independent world&quot; are not *definite* prior to the specification of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; particular observational context?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [LC]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My opinion is that realists, even those completely up to speed on quantum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics, will assert that many macroscopic properties of the &quot;independent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world&quot; are indeed *definite* before specification of an observational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; context (as you write).
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />[SPK]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are to be consistent with the dictum &quot;all is amplitudes that add&quot; 
<br />
we must admit that such assertions are a posteriori and not a priori, thus 
<br />
the problem of explaining the appearance of *definiteness*.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be unassailably proven that one cannot embed a quantum universe 
<br />
inside a classical universe and that one can embed *at least one* classical 
<br />
universe within a quantum universe. What does this imply? It implies that 
<br />
the *property definiteness* that comes along with classical universes is 
<br />
something that cannot be taken as *existing prior to the specification&quot; of 
<br />
an observational context!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of the claims that &quot;many macroscopic properties of the &quot;independent 
<br />
world&quot; are indeed *definite* before specification...&quot; are ignoring that that 
<br />
entire &quot;independent world&quot; is knowable AFTER the fact of comparing the 
<br />
observations of many observers. When we assume the contrary we are ignoring 
<br />
the fact that &quot;what we know&quot; - the content of our OMs as it where- was 
<br />
specified after the act of having the experience.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can point to the idea that Numbers and their relationships exist as 
<br />
such without any dependence on some mathematician's scribbles on a 
<br />
blackboard, and I would say that that is true, but the notion of the 
<br />
&quot;meaningfulness&quot; of the concept of numbers, here a case of *property 
<br />
definiteness*, requires that at least one mathematician scribble on a 
<br />
blackboard somewhere AND that that scribbling &quot;means&quot; something to some 
<br />
other mathematician.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A skeptic could point out that chickens scratching in the dirt could 
<br />
reproduce exactly the same arrangements of points, lines, etc. that make up 
<br />
&quot;2+2 = 4&quot;, but does it mean anything to the chickens? No! Meaningfulness 
<br />
requires something *to whom it has meaning* and the same applies here to our 
<br />
idea of an &quot;independent world&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [LC]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For example, if today I ascertain certain properties of, oh, say, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relative sizes and populations of a number of North American cities,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then it is best to regard those as entirely fixed. That is, that they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are *completely* unaffected by measurement. (Which is entirely true
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; up to bone-picking.)  Evolution in fact did not at all prepare me to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deal with things whose properties emerge only upon measurement, as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; witnessed by the absolute and dumbfounded astonishment of early 20th
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; century physicists.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />[SPK]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I strip and fall headlong over your use of the phrase &quot;...then it is 
<br />
best to regard those as...&quot;! This is what convinces me that you are arguing 
<br />
for a &quot;common sense realism&quot; and not a realism that can be used without such 
<br />
caveats!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have tried many times to talk to you on the phone about the problem in 
<br />
Einstein's quip, in reaction to Bohr's ideas, that &quot;the Moon does not top 
<br />
existing just because he is not looking at it&quot;, or something along those 
<br />
lines. The problem is that Common Sense Realist, like yourself and Einstein, 
<br />
neglect the simple fact that while they are not looking at the moon 
<br />
directly, the particular world that they are contemplating includes causal 
<br />
relations that include the moon with its particular properties.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that if we are going to be consistent with our claim that 
<br />
the properties of the world or anything in it are *fixed* and &quot;*completely* 
<br />
unaffected by measurement&quot; then one must be sure to remove each and every 
<br />
aspect of their actuality that goes into the act of fixing that 
<br />
definiteness. Here, again, is that &quot;crack&quot; that through which &quot;unreality&quot; is 
<br />
oozing.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not like this unreality one bit and thus am trying to patch up 
<br />
Realism so it does not have this problem.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [LC]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My bottom line: the specification of a particular observational context
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; makes a difference *only* on the microscopic level. Now yes, it's true
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that solid objects---according to our best theories---retain their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; integrity only because of quantum effects, but in this and all normal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; macroscopic effects, stability emerges as a statistical and overwhelmingly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probable phenomenon.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />[SPK]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;*ONLY*&quot;! I'm sorry Lee, but that does not cut it! Your argument is just 
<br />
too positivist for me... If we are going to be consistent then we have to 
<br />
own up to the REAL implications of your last sentence here:
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; solid objects---according to our best theories---retain their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; integrity only because of quantum effects, but in this and all normal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; macroscopic effects, stability emerges as a statistical and overwhelmingly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probable phenomenon.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     I am claiming that we should not conflate *existence* with *property
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; definiteness*.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [LC]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What is the harm for other than microscopic phenomena?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />[SPK]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh my! Are we not expecting our models of the world to be consistent? 
<br />
This is like in the theory superstrings where everything is neatly explained 
<br />
and accounted for except for the pesky little things about not being 
<br />
background independent, no evidence of superpartners, etc.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am, working on an idea as to how the appearance of &quot;property 
<br />
definiteness&quot; comes to be, such that Common Sense Realism works *when we 
<br />
ignore little details*, but that is for another post. First I need to get 
<br />
you to admit that the assumption of a priori property definiteness is an 
<br />
obstacle to the advance of physics.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Onward!
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Stephen
