<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Eric,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;your proposal sounds like: &quot;here I am and here is my mind&quot; .
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;What gave you the idea that &quot;the two&quot; can be thought of as separate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;entities?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;The fact that we differentiate between a bowel movement and a thinking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;process in philosophy ... does not MAKE them separate entities.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Eric's first law of abstraction: (known variously as the trivially
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; profound law or the profoundly trivial law:)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;-- &quot;Every two things are both the same and different.&quot;--
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bowel movements and mental processes. They are both physical processes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the body, it's true.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The difference is that a mental process is in its essence a process of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;representation (&quot;re presentation&quot;) of reality and similarly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structured potential realities. That is, it is a process of using some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aspect in the brain as a stand-in for some aspect of the external world.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;And it is a process of doing so in a way that is flexible and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; general enough to allow the generation of representations (mental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stand-ins) of new hypothetical or counterfactual states of the external
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reality, as well as of actual states. Thus we can think of how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things we have not directly apprehended might be, and how things that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; haven't yet taken place could be, if only this would happen, or, sadly but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;instructively, of how things might have been.
</em><br />
<br />++++Eric, it is an old rule in arguing to use lohg foggy sentences with
<br />
foggy expressions so the opponent does not know what to attack. Do you wish
<br />
a similarly worded translation of your &quot;mental narrative&quot; to the &quot;bowel
<br />
movement&quot;  I mentioned as a punch line? Mutatis mutandis the same phrases
<br />
can be formulated for the latter. (I save it from the list).
<br />
Please forgive me not to re-quote all of your post.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Models of the mind:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; --------------------
</em><br />
++++I skip the interesting historical survey.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And today, we believe that the brain is a computer and the mind is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; software.
</em><br />
++++No, we don't.++++
<br />
SNIP
<br />
In your argument *against* the statement (thank you) you use obsolete
<br />
visions stemming from conventional analyses of the image (you argue
<br />
against).
<br />
Also you plunge into the 'computer' idea, a machine that &quot;thinks&quot; using
<br />
memory.
<br />
Again, in classical reductionism, as a &quot;Ding an Sich&quot; a white elephant on
<br />
its own. A 'computer' hardware is an expensive paperweight, a software some
<br />
dirt on a paper - or configurational patterns in a semiconductor-maze. None
<br />
does anything. It becomes a comnputer, when the complexity functions of the
<br />
total, just as a brain does not think and a skin does not feel, without the
<br />
complexity of the living composition total (so abruptly stopped at death).
<br />
The difference is not so profound as I thought earlier: machines are
<br />
products of complexity beyond the machine-aspect, human complexities
<br />
(ingenuity?) and social possibilities were functioning together in the
<br />
'evolvement' of a (cute) machine that thinks.
<br />
What we observe, is a piece of industrial product, what wwe don't is the
<br />
extended network and (their combined) influence to generate that piece of
<br />
junk.
<br />
What I am referring to is your statement about the computer 'memory' :
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;...? It's not really part of the computer at all. It is the software.&lt;
</em><br />
++++
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The historical thinker who came closest to understanding the nature of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the mind was undoubtedly Plato,....
</em><br />
++++Sorry, he and his contemporaries (up to this time&lt;G&gt;) are obsolete in a
<br />
sense that they used for their (surely ingenius) thinking an epistemic
<br />
cognitive inventory way less complete than developed since their death or
<br />
sources. I risk the statement, that our (scientific etc.) cognitive
<br />
inventory is not complete even today!!!! There are 'hidden variables' in
<br />
Bohm's 'implicate' and unknown connections in the so far undiscovered
<br />
networks of complexities, what we may call 'impredicative' --- all important
<br />
to understand what we THINK we understand, even formalize in the (=) signs
<br />
fixed quantized formalisms.
<br />
So I don't rely on the relics. I rather confess to my scientific agnosticism
<br />
(nothing to do with the religious one). Give me 300 years, we will know
<br />
more.
<br />
<br />I wanted to skip your concluding par. about computer-examples for an
<br />
impredicative complexity looked at by different aspects of select functions
<br />
in reductionistic science as chapters of separate units (ie. the mental
<br />
aspect of the complexity-human) but I find it necessary to show how we can
<br />
confuse a model with the 'total' we formulated in the representation of an
<br />
aspect within.
<br />
A computer 'models' nicely the &quot;model&quot;-functions of human thinking *as cut*
<br />
in certain scientific considerations for detailed study. If somebody does
<br />
not look beyond the (artificially set) boundaries of this model, then the
<br />
computer-example looks like &quot;brain&quot;, (with software: mind). It is the recent
<br />
version of the historical images you mentioned (and I skipped): telephone
<br />
switchboard, steam engine, clockwork, soul-spirit of religion and caveman,
<br />
whatever.
<br />
I dare state that I do not know details, but I know: it is more involved,
<br />
interlaced endogenously in the unlimited impredicative complexity of the
<br />
existence and hopefully we do get closer to learning it. So to your final
<br />
line of questioning I answer:
<br />
&quot;I believe I do think deeper about these things than you suggest (and do).&quot;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The brain-mind duality is solved (and now officially boring). If you can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; say that you truly understand:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    1) the distinction between computing software and computing hardware,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    2) issues such as what makes one piece of software different from or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the same as another
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    versus what makes one piece of hardware different from versus the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; same as another,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    3) What the relationship of computing software to computing hardware
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    4) How the essential particulars of high-level software gain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; independence from particulars of computing hardware through
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the construction of hierarchies of  levels or layers of software process
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with emergent behaviours at each level,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and yet you claim not to know what a mind is with respect to a brain,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then I would say you're just not thinking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hard enough about the issue.
</em><br />
<br />++++++Sorry for the length++++++++
