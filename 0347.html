<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it's not at all clear to me that static strings, without

dynamics or decisions, could have anything to do with consciousness.  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stalemate.  We may never agree on this one.  I think more people
<br />
would support my position than yours, but that's not saying much.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ok, I didn't realize that you wanted to evolve the neural nets in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (simulated) natural environment. Presumably it would be the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; environment as we and our ancestors faced. If you're right and this really
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is the shortest program to output the state of an intelligent being, then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have no objection to the possibility that my consciousness is actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; produced by such a program.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, that's not what I said.  For the shortest program, the
<br />
simulated environment would no doubt be vastly simplified compared to what
<br />
we observe.  But the basic elements of competition for survival and
<br />
the advantages of communication would be there.  It will take many
<br />
generations to evolve intelligence, of course.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well it would take me a long time to write the program, but the result
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shouldn't be too long. (Of course you do know that finding the shortest
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; program to output a string is a noncomputable problem?)  Of course I don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have time to do it (unless someone wants to give me a research grant?) so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I can't show it to you. But your own proposal is even less complete. 
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know as well as I do that an approximate solution is good
<br />
enough for our purposes and much easier to find.  To be fair, the length
<br />
of both the form you proposed (and which I had earlier rejected), and of
<br />
the competitors such as the neural nets in the simple environment, should
<br />
be estimated.  Maybe a good (and neutral) computer scientist could give us
<br />
those estimates without too much work.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My proposal to find a definition of implementation of a
<br />
computation is much more conservative than your approach, since it also
<br />
applies to regular theories of physics, and is in the established
<br />
tradition of computationalism.  I admit it requires more work but I don't
<br />
think it's hopeless; and if it is, that's just as important to know.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 	Structure labeled how?  By connections and interaction strengths
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; among the neurons?  For the AI, the pattern of spatial locations of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; momory elements would be much of the needed info.  Not so the human.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, what's wrong with by connection and interaction strengths?
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just that it would take a big program.  Of course the neurons must
<br />
also be numbered in some sensible way.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 	That's just one choice of model among the many possibilities.  And
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; what about the computations that never terminate?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What other models do you have in mind? As for the computations that don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; halt, first of all we don't have to worry about the ones that don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; repeat, since they contribute zero measure. For the ones that do repeat,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we can count their contribution, but I think it would be negligible.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the contrary.  Some programs will just rewrite the same part of
<br />
the tape, and those we can neglect for now.  But some will keep printing
<br />
out copies of the same string end on end, and the ones that halt will have
<br />
zero measure compared to those, since more copies means more measure.
<br />
This gives a slight advantage to short strings.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is a serious problem for you.  The Turing machines start out
<br />
will all possible programs, that is, with all possible infinite strings on
<br />
the tapes.  At any finite time, no matter how large [and therefore in the
<br />
limit], the fraction of the tape that even the repeat printers have
<br />
covered is equal to zero.  So the printed strings have zero measure
<br />
compared to the infinity of random strings on the as yet untouched part of
<br />
the tape, even though the fraction of those that are conscious is small.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Check.
