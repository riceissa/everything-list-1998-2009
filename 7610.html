<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One day, Earth is contacted by a highly advanced alien civilization, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they tell us that contrary to what most of us think is likely, not all of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the fundamental physical laws of our universe are computable. Furthermore,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they claim to be able to manufacture black boxes that work as oracles for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Halting Problem of Turing machines (one query per hour). They give
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; us one free sample, and want to sell us more at a reasonable price. But
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of course we won't be allowed to open up the boxes and look inside to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; find out how they work.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So our best scientists test the sample black box in every way that they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can think of, but can't find any evidence that it isn't exactly what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the aliens claim it is. At this point many people are ready to believe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the claim and spend their hard earned money to buy these devices for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; their families.
</em><br />
<br />So in terms of induction, the situation is that we do test after test
<br />
to see if this box acts as a halting-problem oracle (HPO, we always
<br />
need more 3 letter acronyms around here).  And it passes all the tests.
<br />
So then we apply induction and say, since it's acted like an HPO in our
<br />
tests, we will go ahead and assume that it really is an HPO.
<br />
<br />The problem is that HPOs are theoretically impossible.  We have a proof
<br />
of it, in fact we have a lot of proofs.  So how do we reconcile this?
<br />
<br />Well, one possibility is that the proof is invalid.  It's a pretty
<br />
simple proof so we look at its assumptions.  Fundamentally it assumes
<br />
that computation is a finitary process.  We can only do a finite amount
<br />
of computation in a finite time.
<br />
<br />To act as a real HPO it would seem to be necessary for the box in some
<br />
way to deal with infinities.  There would have to be an actual infinity
<br />
in there somewhere.
<br />
<br />But again, we generally assume that there are no actual infinities.
<br />
In physics they are called singularities, which means places where the
<br />
laws of physics break down.  In fact even the prospect of an actual
<br />
infinity in a theory is seen as a sign that the theory is wrong or
<br />
incomplete.  Relativity puts singularities at the center of black holes,
<br />
but it is assumed that quantum gravity will fix these, in fact this is
<br />
one of the main motivations for work on quantum gravity.
<br />
<br />Disbelief in actual infinities, like disbelief in HPOs, is not really
<br />
rooted in observation and induction.  We don't disbelieve in them simply
<br />
because our universe seems to be devoid of them.  In fact, on the face
<br />
of things there is evidence that actual infinities may really exist in
<br />
our universe.  Relativity theory has its infinites; there are quantum
<br />
models which hint at the possibility as well, and even old fashioned
<br />
Newtonian gravitation on point particles, like is studied in high school
<br />
physics, implicitly embeds infinities and can construct an HPO.  But still,
<br />
nobody believes that this stuff will work.  It's always assumed to be
<br />
a mistake which future work will correct.  (Google hypercomputers or
<br />
super-Turing computers for some theoretical models of HPOs.)
<br />
<br />So where does our disbelief come from?  Why are we so skeptical?  We don't
<br />
have very good grounds from observation.  The mere fact that we've never
<br />
seen X isn't strong evidence that X doesn't exist.  We discover new things
<br />
all the time, amazing things.  Why should HPOs be any different?
<br />
<br />It seems that our disbelief in HPOs and in other manifestations of
<br />
infinity is somehow rooted in mathematics itself.  We have an instinctive
<br />
aversion to the possibility of an actual infinity existing as something
<br />
we can interact with.  We believe that mathematics is essentially a
<br />
finite endeavor, at least in terms of how it manifests in the real world.
<br />
<br />And yet there are plenty of mathematical models of infinities.
<br />
The study of transfinites is a very active part of set theory, in
<br />
fact it is entirely what makes set theory non-trivial.  Likewise, with
<br />
the super-Turing work people have constructed hierarchies of ever more
<br />
powerful infinity machines.  So there is no dearth of mathematical models
<br />
to deal with infinities.
<br />
<br />In response to early work on transfinites the mathematical school called
<br />
constructivism arose.  Constructivists reject most of mathematics that
<br />
deals with infinities.  I am not too familiar with the history but I
<br />
believe that they were concerned about the many potential paradoxes
<br />
and the possibility that our intuition was a poor guide to truth in the
<br />
treacherous waters of the transfinites.
<br />
<br />Constructionism has not gained much ground among mathematicians; I get the
<br />
impression that it's just not that much fun to do math that way.  But it
<br />
seems to accord well with our instincts about the world.  Perhaps we
<br />
could say that it is all very well for the mathematicians to construct
<br />
their transfinite castles in the air, but when it comes to reality,
<br />
we are constructionists.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Fortunately, the Artificial Intelligence in charge of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; protecting Earth from interstellar fraud refuses to allow this. Having
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; been programmed with UD+ASSA (see Hal Finney's 7/10/2005 post for a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; good explanation of what this means), it proclaims that there is zero
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probability that Halting Problem oracles can exist, so it must be pure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; chance that the sample black box has correctly answered all the queries
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; submitted to it so far.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The moral of this story is that our intuitive notion of induction is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fully captured by the formalization of UD+ASSA. Contrary to UD+ASSA, we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will not actually refuse to believe in the non-existence of uncomputable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; phenomena no matter what evidence we see.
</em><br />
<br />Our theories say that it can't happen.  Yet in this case we have an
<br />
observation where it seems like it does happen.  So what do we do?
<br />
<br />It helps in the analysis to distinguish what people actually do from
<br />
what they &quot;should&quot; ideally do.  People are imperfect reasoning machines
<br />
and there is no fundamental or theoretical interest in explicating every
<br />
detail of what they believe and what they don't.  No doubt it would be
<br />
possible to build up a complete formal theory and model of a given human
<br />
brain that would fully explain how it does induction, full of complicated
<br />
rules and contradictions.  That's not the interesting question.
<br />
<br />The harder question is, what *should* we do, in this situation?  I see
<br />
two possibilities.
<br />
<br />One is to hold to our theories.  No matter how many times we see
<br />
this machine work, we disbelieve it.  We assume it is a trick.
<br />
Others have suggested ways the trickery might be done.  It would be
<br />
extremely difficult and technologically challenging, but not impossible.
<br />
These tricks require effort that would be characterized by extremely
<br />
large numbers, but not infinities.  If we are skeptical that they could
<br />
put such large numbers together, we should be infinitely more skeptical
<br />
that they can manage infinities.
<br />
<br />The other possibility is to change our theories, and apply induction.
<br />
Faced with the evidence of a machine that seems to work, we accept that
<br />
maybe it really does work.  And if so, then our theories are wrong and
<br />
we need new ones.
<br />
<br />This is a hard course because of the peculiar grounding of the theories
<br />
involved.  As described above, they aren't based on observation.  They are
<br />
much more fundamental.  They have to do with our deepest beliefs about the
<br />
nature of reality and perhaps even the nature of logic and mathematics.
<br />
It's questionable to me whether any finite set of observations in the real
<br />
world has the standing, the philosophical strength, to change our beliefs
<br />
about the nature of something as ethereal and unphysical as mathematics.
<br />
<br />But maybe it's the right thing to do.  After all, our imperfections,
<br />
our existence as creatures of a mundane reality, make us prone to error.
<br />
We might be wrong about anything.  Arguably, an optimal induction engine
<br />
stands ready to change any and every one of its pre-existing beliefs,
<br />
when they are strongly enough contradicted by the evidence.  So perhaps
<br />
we really should change our minds about mathematics, forget about that
<br />
constructionism nonsense, and accept that infinities exist and are real,
<br />
and here's one that we can touch and poke at.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What can we do to repair this flaw? Using a variant of UD, based on a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more powerful type of computer (say an oracle TM instead of a plain TM),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; won't help because that just moves the problem up to a higher level of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the computational hierarchy. No matter what type of computer (call it C)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we base UD' on, it will always assign zero probability to the existence of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even more power types of computer (e.g., ones that can solve the halting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem for C). Intuitively, this doesn't seem like a good feature.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Earlier on this mailing list, I had proposed that we skip pass the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entire computational hierarchy and jump to the top of the set theoretic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hierarchy, by using a measure that is based a set theoretic notion of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; complexity instead of a computational one. In this notion, instead of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; defining the complexity of an object by the length of its shortest
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; algorithmic description, we define its complexity by the length of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; its shortest description in the language of a formal set theory. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure would be constructed in a manner analogous to UD, with each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; set theoretic description of an object contributing n^-l to the measure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the object, where n is the size of the alphabet of the set theory,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and l is the length of the description. Lets call this STUM for set
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theoretic universal measure.
</em><br />
<br />Are you confident that this is well defined?  I understand Schmidhuber's
<br />
approach: pick an arbitrary UTM, run a random program through it, and take
<br />
the bit pattern that comes out as the information object.  The fraction
<br />
of programs that produce a given information object is the measure.
<br />
<br />Is there a similarly mechanical way of understanding the concept of
<br />
object description in the language of set theory?  Can you sketch how
<br />
that would work?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; STUM along with ASSA does a much better job of formalizing induction, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I recently realized that it still isn't perfect. The problem is that it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; still assigns zero probability to some objects that we intuitively think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is very unlikely, but not completely impossible. An example would be a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; device that can decide the truth value of any set theoretic statement. A
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe that contains such a device would exist in the set theoretic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hierarchy, but would have no finite description in formal set theory,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and would be assigned a measure of 0 by STUM.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm not sure where this line of thought leads. Is induction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unformalizable? Have we just not found the right formalism yet? Or is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our intuition on the subject flawed?
</em><br />
<br />The mainstream view, I gather, is that induction is indeed unformalizable.
<br />
The contrary claim, that induction can be formalized, would be considered
<br />
controversial.
<br />
<br />Another way to express the problem is to think of trying to build an
<br />
optimal induction machine.  It could use Bayes theorem to update its
<br />
beliefs, but what about the priors?  Same problem.  We could use the
<br />
Universal Prior but it gives probability 0 to HPOs.  Then there are all
<br />
those other priors that implicitly assume infinite computation, so where
<br />
does it stop?  There are no end to infinities, and as Wei's example shows,
<br />
there is apparently no place to stand once you start down that road.
<br />
<br />It would be absurd to suggest, say, that everything up to Aleph-23
<br />
has Platonic existence, while infinities from Aleph-24 on up are mere
<br />
mysticism.  Likewise, building a universe out of a UTM+HPO doesn't make
<br />
sense because as Wei says, there is a 2nd-order HPO, an HPO2, which is
<br />
beyond the scope of UTM+HPO, so what if the aliens show up with one
<br />
of those?  For a multiverse model to make sense it has to be simple,
<br />
distinctive and (ideally) unique.  We don't quite achieve uniqueness
<br />
with the UDist (due to the arbitrary choice of a UTM which creates a
<br />
multiplicative constant difference on measure), which is a major flaw.
<br />
But adding oracles makes the problem infinitely worse.
<br />
<br />Here's what I conclude.  If we really believe in the Universal
<br />
Distribution, then we ascribe probability zero to HPOs.  That means
<br />
that in Wei's story, indeed the aliens are tricking Earth.  If we try to
<br />
imagine a universe where the aliens are legitimate and have real HPOs,
<br />
that is impossible.  We are just confusing ourselves if we think such a
<br />
universe could be real.  There is no point in even considering thought
<br />
experiments based on it, any more than imagining what would happen if
<br />
aliens showed up with a logical formula which was obviously simultaneously
<br />
true and false.  So given that we stand upon the UDist, there is no need
<br />
to pay much attention to these kinds of thought experiments.
<br />
<br />I would suggest that evidence for or against the UDist should come
<br />
more from the fields of mathematics and logic than from any empirical
<br />
experience.  My hope is that further study will lead to a computational
<br />
model which is distinguished by its uniqueness and lack of ambiguity.
<br />
That seems necessary for this kind of explanation of our existence to
<br />
be successful.
<br />
