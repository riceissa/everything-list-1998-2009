<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It seems to me that there is a very strong assupmtion here which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is that there should be some synchronicity between the &quot;time&quot; in &gt;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; postulated computer into which the universe would be simulated &gt;and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the time inside that simulated universe
</em><br />
<br />I have been studying the function of what I refer to as intergalactic time
<br />
in a case I call,
<br />
Where does time come from when I am a rock,
<br />
very akin to the what is it like to be a bat question in philosophy,
<br />
studying the funcitons of actual physical time from a molecular standpoint
<br />
are very different to the nature of time from a human perceptual standpoint.
<br />
<br />when we measure the universe in motion, we tend to do so in orbital cycles
<br />
of days, years and orbital pathways [i.e. comets...]
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;(as this is typically the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;case when an electronic device is simulated).
</em><br />
<br />Also, keeping in mind that the computer itself is not only finite it's own
<br />
containment of self, as the universe, speciafically [imposed] is not. the
<br />
computer is also nothing more than a synthesized state of physio-temporal
<br />
events//effects within motion by theory of time.
<br />
<br />the computer has a common ground, a 60hz, 120v input freq.
<br />
this is translated into +/- 5,12v dc (1,1.5 amp) current,
<br />
which in turn becomes functionally oscillative at a rate of
<br />
20mhz - 2ghz and is thereby functional as a very sensitive
<br />
binary computational [oscillative] device. In this very sense, the
<br />
computer's function is the very operative essence of the coputer timing it's
<br />
own functions, measuring the binary differences of the temporant input
<br />
values, and [based on interal programming sequences] delivers some form of
<br />
variable perceptual output predetermined by the user upon [data] entry.
<br />
<br />the universe itsself recives no common input aside from the relative
<br />
[translational//fluctuational] fields of masses being present in light
<br />
within space time and other such physical frequency noises, the entire
<br />
universe has little to no common relation between all of its billions of
<br />
galaxies and it's infinite sections of space time [mass energy] in motion.
<br />
The inter relative movements of the motions of planets and suns would simply
<br />
be much to complex for calculating some from of common frequency/time ration
<br />
by which time can 'now' be determined instantaneously [by measured
<br />
perceptions] universally.
<br />
<br />whereas the computer itself can predict cross sections of temporal alignment
<br />
within motion, it cannot use these inflections to determine any set ultimate
<br />
beginnings or endings to these patterns to an infinite [temporally chaotic,
<br />
unpredicatable, misaligned] universe without us as humans, actually
<br />
physically understanding what its like, for a rock, to [physically] know
<br />
[its] own 'time'.
<br />
<br />ultimately, the computer would not be able to define an infinite of logical
<br />
matter based temporant rotations in a singular moment.
<br />
The 'base' frequency rate of measure is always provided by some form of
<br />
external course. In the case of the computer, it's a function of translating
<br />
the input source voltage by using an internal power supply.
<br />
<br />How could the computer control the function of realization by which the
<br />
source control input of measurable time is determined. When exploring how
<br />
the computer relates to time universally, it is important to keep in mind
<br />
that this is somewhat akin to sudying the biological process of your own
<br />
body, using your own eyes, brain and feelings in order to 'compute' them
<br />
temporally as biological functions, using those same biological functions as
<br />
the source of that internal 'self' computation{al}// measure

Subject: Is the universe computable?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I start from a part of this post from David Barrett-Lennard (Mon,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3 Nov 2003 19:48:49) but I could probably hev selected several
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; similar other ones:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Given the &quot;source code&quot; for the simulation of our universe, it would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; seem to be possible to add some extra instructions that test for a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; certain condition to be met in order to tamper with the simulation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It would seem likely that there will exist simulations that match our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; own up to a certain point in time, but then diverge.  Eg it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; possible for a simulation to have a rule that an object will suddenly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; manifestitself at a particular time and place.  The simulated conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; beings in such a universe would be surprised to find that induction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; fails at the moment the simulation diverges.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It seems to me that there is a very strong assupmtion here which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is that there should be some synchronicity between the &quot;time&quot; in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; postulated computer into which the universe would be simulated and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the time inside that simulated universe (as this is typically the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; case when an electronic device is simulated).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But such an assumption not only does not seem necessary in any way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but it also does not seem possibly consistent (or it would be very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arbitrary at least) with a universe like ours for what we know of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the implications of general relativity (it does not seem possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to define any global time in any consistent way in our universe).
