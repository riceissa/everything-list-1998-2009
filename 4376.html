I am not convinced that the MWI implies that quantum suicide should work. A
<br />
hidden assumption proponents of quantum suicide make is that once you are in
<br />
a certain branch all the other possible branches are off limits to you. You
<br />
will forever move on in that branch. I reject this. I could also survive
<br />
(with memory loss) in another branch in which I never performed the
<br />
experiment in the first place. Normally this assumption doesn't affect
<br />
probabilities, except in cases were the observer doesn't survive. I would
<br />
say that, in principle, a theory of everything would allow you to compute
<br />
the probability of experiencing a ''personal history'' x, by integrating
<br />
over all possible histories X of the multiverse that are consistent with x.
<br />
Within this framework there is no room for quantum suicide to work.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     MOSCOW (AP) -- At a press conference held minutes ago in a crowded
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hall,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Russian mathematicians announced that a breakthrough had been made
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     nearly a decade ago in the arcane branch of mathematics known as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     &quot;cryptography,&quot; the science of making messages that are unreadable to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     others.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Leonid Vladwylski, Director of the prestigious Moscow Academy of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Sciences, called the press conference yesterday, after rumors began
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     circulating that noted Russian-American reporter John Markoff was in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Russia to interview academicians at the previously secret city of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Soviet cryptographers, Kryptogorodok.  The existence of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Kryptogorodok,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     sister city to Akademogorodok, Magnetogorsk, and to the rocket cities
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     of Kazhakstan, had been shrouded in secrecy since its establishment
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     1954 by Chief of Secret Police L. Beria.  Its first scientific
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     director, A. Kolmogorov, developed in 1960 what is called in the West
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     &quot;public key cryptography.&quot;  The existence of Kryptogorodok was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unknown
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     to the West until 1991, when Stephen Wolfram disclosed its existence.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     American cryptographers initially scoffed at the rumors that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Russians had developed public-key cryptography as early as 1960, some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     15 years prior to the first American discovery.  After interviews
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; last
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     year at Kryptogorodok, noted American cryptographers Professor D.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Denning and D. Bowdark admitted that it did seem to be confirmed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Professor Denning was quoted at the time saying that she did not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     this meant the Russians could actually break the Kolmogorov system,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     known in the West as RSA, because she had spent more than a full
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; weekend
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     trying to do this and had not succeeded.  &quot;Believe me, RSA is still
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     unbreakable,&quot; she said in her evaluation report.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Russia's top mathematicians set out to break Kolmogorov's new coding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     system.  This required them to determine that &quot;P = NP&quot; (see
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; accompanying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     article).  Details are to be published next month in the journal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     &quot;Doklady.Krypto,&quot; but a few details are emerging.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     The Kolmogorov system is broken by computing the prime numbers which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     form what is called the modulus.  This is done by randomly guessing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     constituent primes and then detonating all of the stockpiled nuclear
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     weapons in the former Soviet Union for each &quot;wrong guess.&quot;  In the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Worlds Interpretation of quantum mechanics, invented in 1949 by Lev
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Landau (and later, independently by Everett and Wheeler in the U.S.),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     all possible outcomes of a quantum experiment are realized.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     As Academician Leonid Vladwylski explained, &quot;In all the universes in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     which we guessed the wrong factors, we were destroyed completely.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     since we are obviously here, talking to you at this press
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conference, in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     this universe we have an unbroken record of successfully factoring
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     the largest of imaginable numbers.  Since we are so optimistic about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     this method, we say the computation runs in 'Nondeterministic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Pollyanna
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Time.'  Allow me to demonstrate...&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     [Press Conference will be continued if the experiment is a success.]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     MOSCOW (AP), ITAR-Tass, 1 April 1994
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Appendix
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; --------
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; First, it was Stephen Wolfram's actual suggestion, a couple of years ago
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; after the USSR imploded, that we try to recruit mathematicians and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; programmers from what he surmised must exist: a secret city of Soviet
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cryptographers.  It probably exists.  We did it at Los Alamos, they did
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with their rocket scientists and others (Akademogorodok exists), so why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; put their version of NSA a bit off the beaten track?  Note that our own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; NSA
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is within a stone's throw of the Baltimore-Washington Parkway.  I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wouldn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be surprised to learn that their experts were ensconced somewhere in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Urals.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I tried to acknowledge Steve with my comments.  By the way, so far as I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; know, no word has come out on whether he was right in this speculation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Maybe some of the Russians he does in fact have working at Wolfram are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; these folks?  Naw...)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Second, Kolmogorov did basic work on information theory, probability,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; statistics.  One has to assume he had ties to the Soviet cryptography
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; effort (about which little has been written about, so far).  If anyone
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Russia could have seen public key methods coming, he is a candidate.  No
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evidence that he or any other Russian did, though.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Third, my references to Denning and Sternlight were perhaps not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; riotously
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; funny (though I didn't aim for a riotously funny tone).  Especially in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; light of David Sternlight's excellent follow-up here... never let it be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; said that David lacks a sense of humor.  The Denning reference was to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; her
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; own comments about spending a weekend or so trying (and failing, not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; surprisingly) to crack the Skipjack algorithm.  (Real ciphers often take
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; years to break, as with the knapsack algorithm, recent crunching of DES,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; etc.).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Fourth, the &quot;Many Worlds&quot; interpretation of quantum mechanics does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exist,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and leads to approaches such as I described.  It's also a hypothetical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to ensure one's wealth: simply bet everything you own at 1000-to-1 odds
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then commit suicide in all universes in which you lose.  Not very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; convincing, I agree.  Hans Moravec writes about this in his &quot;Mind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Children,&quot; 1987.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Finally, I used the headers and format of a real article in the ClariNet
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; system, then made modifications.  Given that the Supreme Court has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recently
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ruled in favor of &quot;fair use&quot; for satire, I hope my version of &quot;2 Live
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Crew
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meets RSA&quot; does not get my sued.  (I could just kill myself in all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; realities in which Brad sues me.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
