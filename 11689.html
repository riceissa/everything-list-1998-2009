Why Mathematics Works

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Mathematics is the theoretical exploration of every possible kind
<br />
of abstract structure
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The world has some kind of structure; it is not chaos or
<br />
featureless or void
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Therefore, it is likely that at least some of the structures
<br />
discovered by mathematicians are applicable to the world

<br />
(It would be strange if everything mathematicans came up with was
<br />
empirically applicable, and might tend one towards Platonism or
<br />
Rationalism, but this is not the case. It might be possible for
<br />
mathematicians working completely abstractly and theoretically to fail
<br />
to include any empirically useful structures in the finite list of
<br />
structures so far achieved, but maths is not divorced from empiricism
<br />
and practicallity to that extent -- what I say in (1) is something of
<br />
an idealisation).

<br />
Six Approaches to the Philosophy of Mathematics

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Approach 1: Empiricism: The &quot;maths is physics&quot; theory.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Approach 2: Platonism: Objectivity and objects.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Approach 3: Psychologism.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Approach 4: Formalism: Mathematics as a game.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Approach 5: Constructivism: How Real Are The Real Numbers?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Approach 6: Quasi Empiricism

<br />
Approach 1: Empiricism: The &quot;maths is physics&quot; theory.
<br />
Mathematical empiricism is undermined by developments since the 19th
<br />
century, of forms of mathematics with no obvious physical application,
<br />
such an non-Euclidean geometry. I should probably say no obvious
<br />
application at the time since non-Euclidean geometery -- or curved
<br />
space -- was utilised in Einstein's General Theory of Relativity
<br />
subsequent to its development by mathematicians. So M.E. has two
<br />
problems: the existence of mathematical structures with no (currently)
<br />
obvious physical application, and the fact that the physical
<br />
applicability of different areas of mathematics varies with time,
<br />
depending on discoveries in physics. Todays mathematical game-playing
<br />
may be tomorrow's hard reality. It is also undermined by mathematical
<br />
method, the fact that maths is a chalk-and-blackboard (or just
<br />
thinking) activity, not a laboratory activity.

<br />
Approach 2: Platonism: Objectivity and objects.
<br />
Both Platonism and Empiricism share the assumption that mathematical
<br />
symbols refer to objects. (And some people feel they have to believe in
<br />
Empiricism simply because Platonism is so unacceptable). Platonism gets
<br />
its force from noting the robustness and fixity of mathematical truths,
<br />
which are often described as &quot;eternal&quot;. The reasoning seems to be that
<br />
if the truth of a statement is fixed, it must be fixed by something
<br />
external to itself. In other words, mathematical truths msut be
<br />
discovered, because if they were made they could have be made
<br />
differently, and so would not be fixed and eternal. But there is no
<br />
reason to think that these two metaphors --&quot;discovering&quot; and &quot;making&quot;--
<br />
are the only options. Perhaps the modus operandi of mathematics is
<br />
unique; perhaps it combines the fixed objectivity of discovering a
<br />
physical fact about the external world whilst being nonetheless an
<br />
internal, non-empirical activity. The Platonic thesis seems more
<br />
obvious than it should because of an ambiguity in the word &quot;objective&quot;.
<br />
Objective truths amy be truths about real-world objects. Objective
<br />
truths may also be truths that do not depend on the whims or
<br />
preferences of the speaker (unlike statements about the best movie of
<br />
flavour of ice-cream). Statements that are objective in the first sense
<br />
tend to be objective in the second sense, but that does not mean that
<br />
all statements that are objective in the second sense need be objective
<br />
in the first sense. They may fail to depend on individual whims and
<br />
preferences without depending on anything external to the mind.

<br />
Approach3: Formalism: Mathematics as a game.
<br />
Both Platonism and Empriricism share the assumption that mathematical
<br />
symbols refer to objects. An alternative to both is the theory that
<br />
they do not refer at all: this theory is called formalism. For the
<br />
formalist, mathematical truths are fixed by the rules of mathematics,
<br />
not by external objects. But what fixes the rules of mathematics ?
<br />
Formalism suggests that mathematics is a meaningless game, and the
<br />
rules can be defined any way we like. Yet mathematicians in practice
<br />
are careful about the selection of axioms, not arbitrary. So do the
<br />
rules and axioms of mathematics mean anything or not ?

<br />
The reader may or may not have noticed that I have been talking about
<br />
mathematical symbols &quot;referring&quot; to things rather than &quot;meaning&quot;
<br />
things. This eliptically refers to a distinction between two different
<br />
kinds or shades of meaning made by Frege. &quot;Reference&quot; is the
<br />
external-world object a symbol is &quot;about&quot;. &quot;Sense&quot; is the kind of
<br />
meaning a symbol has even if does not have a reference. Thus statements
<br />
about unicorns or the bald King of France have Sense but not Reference.
<br />
Thus it is possible for mathematical statments to have a sense, and
<br />
therefore a meaning, beyond the formal rules and defintions, but
<br />
stopping short of external objects (referents), whether physical or
<br />
Platonic. This position retains the negative claim of Formalism, that
<br />
mathematical symbols don't refer to objects, and thus avoids the
<br />
pitfalls of both Platonism and Empiricism. Howeverm it allows that
<br />
mathematical symbols can have meanings of an in-the-head kind and thus
<br />
explains the non-arbitrary nature of the choice of axioms; they are not
<br />
arbitrary because they must correspond to the mathematician's intuition
<br />
-- her &quot;sense&quot; -- of what a real number or a set is.

<br />
So far we have been assuming that the same answer must apply uniformly
<br />
to all mathematical statmentents and symbols: they all refer or none
<br />
do. There is a fourth option: divide and conquer -- some refer and
<br />
others don't.

<br />
Approach 4: Psychologism: Nubers are Concepts
<br />
Psychologism is the view that mathematical propositions are &quot;about&quot;
<br />
ideas. (As opposed to physical objects, or Platonic objects) The
<br />
counterargument is that there are inifinities in maths, but we do not
<br />
have infinite numbers of ideas.

<br />
All of these theories assume mathematical statements must refer to
<br />
something, and all can be undercut by the hypothesis that mathematical
<br />
statements can get by purely on &quot;sense&quot; and do not need &quot;reference&quot; at
<br />
all (the sense/reference distinction is Frege's). So the
<br />
Counter-counter argument is: we can have an idea of infinity without
<br />
having an infinite number if ideas.

<br />
&quot;A fourth and final version of the third strategy, developed by
<br />
Balaguer (1995, 1998) (and see Linsky and Zalta (1995) for a related
<br />
view), is based upon the adoption of a particular version of platonism
<br />
that can be called plenitudinous platonism, or as Balaguer calls it,
<br />
full-blooded platonism (FBP). FBP can be intuitively but sloppily
<br />
expressed with the slogan, 'All possible mathematical objects
<br />
exist'; more precisely, the view is that all the mathematical objects
<br />
that possibly could exist actually do exist, or that there exist as
<br />
many mathematical objects as there possibly could. Balaguer argues that
<br />
if platonists endorse FBP, then they can solve the epistemological
<br />
problem with their view without positing any sort of
<br />
information-transferring contact between human beings and abstract
<br />
objects. For since FBP says that all possible mathematical objects
<br />
exist, it follows that if FBP is true, then every purely mathematical
<br />
theory that could possibly be true (i.e., that's internally consistent)
<br />
accurately describes some collection of actually existing mathematical
<br />
objects. Thus, it follows from FBP that in order to attain knowledge of
<br />
abstract mathematical objects, all we have to do is come up with an
<br />
internally consistent purely mathematical theory (and know that it is
<br />
consistent). But it seems clear that (i) we humans are capable of
<br />
formulating internally consistent mathematical theories (and of knowing
<br />
that they're internally consistent), and (ii) being able to do this
<br />
does not require us to have any sort of information-transferring
<br />
contact with the abstract objects that the theories in question are
<br />
about. Thus, if this is right, then the epistemological problem with
<br />
platonism has been solved.&quot;

<br />
<a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/platonism/#2">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/platonism/#2</a>

<br />
Not really, because there is now no role for Platonic objects. They are
<br />
not involved in the actual process of verifying the truth of
<br />
mathematical claims. A daemon could wish Platonia and all its contents
<br />
away, and nothing would change.
<br />
Approach 5: Constructivism: How Real Are The Real Numbers?

<br />
Mathematical Platonism is the view that mathematical objects exist in
<br />
some sense (not necessarily the sense that physical objects exist),
<br />
irrespective of our ability to display or prove them.

<br />
Constructivism is an opposing view, according to which only objects
<br />
which can be explicitly shown or proven exist.

<br />
Some constructivists believe in constructivism as an end in itself.
<br />
Others use it as a means to an end,namely the elimination of
<br />
infinities.

<br />
Real numbers (numbers which cannot be expressed in a finite number of
<br />
digits) are a particular problem for both kinds of constructivist. For
<br />
the first, because most real numbers cannot be shown. Some are well
<br />
known, such as pi and e (the base of natural logarithms). These can be
<br />
generated by an algorithm; a sort of mathematical machine, where if you
<br />
keep turning the handle, it keeps churning out digits. Of course, real
<br />
numbers are not a finite string of digits, so the process never
<br />
finishes. Nonetheless, the fact that the algorithm itself is finite
<br />
gives us a handle on the real number, an ability to grasp it. However,
<br />
the real number line is dense, so between any of these well known real
<br />
numbers are infinities of intransigent real numbers, whose digits form
<br />
no pattern, and which therefore cannot be set out, either as a string
<br />
of digits, or as an algorithm.

<br />
Or, at least, so the Platonists would have it. What alternatives are
<br />
available for the constructuvist ?

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* 1. All numbers are equally (ontologically) real.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* 2. The accessible real numbers (the transcendental numbers) are
<br />
(ontologically) real, and the other (mathematically) &quot;real&quot; numbers are
<br />
not.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* 3. No (mathematically) real number is (ontologically) real.

<br />
1. is the position constructivists are trying to get away from. 3 is
<br />
hardly tenable, since some irrational numbers, such as pi, *can* be
<br />
constructed. And (2) contradicts the idea of density -- it suggests the
<br />
real number line has gaps. Moreover, something like the requirment of
<br />
denstity can be asserted without making any strong ontological
<br />
commitments towards the reality of the real number line.
<br />
Approach 6: Quasi Empiricism
<br />
A number of recent developments in mathematics, such as the increased
<br />
use of computers to assist proof, and doubts about the correct choice
<br />
of basic axioms, have given rise to a view called quasi-empiricism.
<br />
This challenges the traditional idea of mathematical truth as eternal
<br />
and discoverable apriori. According to quasi-empiricists the use of a
<br />
computer to perform a proof is a form of experiment. But it remains the
<br />
case that any mathematical problem that can in principle be solved by
<br />
shutting you eye and thinking. Computers are used because mathematians
<br />
do not have infinite mental resources; they are an aid. Contrast this
<br />
with traditonal sciences like chemistry or biology, where real-world
<br />
objects have to be studied, and would still have to be studied by
<br />
super-scientitists with an IQ of a million. In genuinely emprical
<br />
sciences, experimentation and observation are used to gain information.
<br />
In mathematics the information of the solution to a problem is always
<br />
latent in the starting-point, the basic axioms and the formulation of
<br />
the problem. The process of thinking through a problem simply makes
<br />
this latent information explicit. (I say simply, but of ocurse it is
<br />
often very non-trivial). The use of a computer externalises this
<br />
process. The computer may be outside the mathematician's head but all
<br />
the information that comes out of it is information that went into it.
<br />
Mathematics is in that sense still apriori.

<br />
Having said that, the quasi-empricist still has some points about the
<br />
modern style of mathematics. Axioms look less like eternal truths and
<br />
more like hypotheses which are used for a while but may eventualy be
<br />
discarded if they prove problematical, like the role of scientific
<br />
hypotheses in Popper's philosophy.

<br />
Thus mathematics has some of the look and feel of empirical science
<br />
without being empirical in the most essential sense -- that of needing
<br />
an input of information from outside the head.&quot;Quasi&quot; indeed!

<br />

<br />
More on Platonism
<br />
Penrose on Platonism
<br />
&quot;our individual minds are notoriously imprecise, unreliable and
<br />
inconsistent in their judgements&quot; TBD

<br />
So when we do maths we are not using our minds, but something else? Or
<br />
maybe we are just using our minds in disciplined way -- after all, the
<br />
discipline of maths has to be painfully learnt. TBD

<br />
&quot;Does this not point to something outside ourselves with a reality that
<br />
lies beyond what each individual can achieve?&quot; TBD

<br />
What is achieved by individuals is achieved by individuals. How can
<br />
some transcendent realm speak through the mouth of an individual? TBD

<br />
&quot;Nevertheless, one might take the alternative view that the
<br />
mathematical world has no independent existence, and consists of
<br />
certain ideas which have been distilled from our various minds, and
<br />
which have found to be totally trustworthy, and are 'agreed by all',
<br />
for example, or 'agreed by those in their right mind's, or 'agreed by
<br />
those who have a PhD in mathematics' (not much use in Plato's day), and
<br />
who have a right to venture an authoratiative opinion&quot;.

<br />
Which mathematical world? The world of mathematics so far proven and
<br />
understood, or the world that is waiting to be explored? However few
<br />
mathematicians there are, there is no contradiction that they carry the
<br />
world of known mathematics around in their heads. The fewer there are,
<br />
the less there is to carry round. Perhaps Penrose thinks they must
<br />
carry the whole Platonic world around to act as a &quot;standard&quot;, but
<br />
mathematical proof doesn't work by direct inspection of Platonia, it
<br />
works slowly and painfully by axioms and deductions.

<br />
&quot;There seems to be a danger of circularity here; for to judge whether
<br />
someone is in his or her right mind requires some external standard&quot;

<br />
External to them, yes...but when we make such judgements, we ue finite
<br />
and earthly resources. The idea that Platonia provides a
<br />
once-and-for-all absolute standard is not of much use unless it can be
<br />
explained how the standard is applied. The actual standard against
<br />
which a proposed arguemnt is tested involves the community of
<br />
mathematicians checking it with their flawed and finite minds. Platonia
<br />
might provide a higher standard, but it is not one anyone has ever
<br />
succeeded in employing.

<br />
&quot;What I mean by this existence is really just the objectivity of
<br />
mathematical truth&quot;.

<br />
And what does thatmean? Existence is existence, truth is truth. People
<br />
who disbelieve in Platonism can still believe in the objectivity of
<br />
mathematics.
<br />
Platonism and Causation
<br />
Maths has no causal effect on the mind in the sense of an event in time
<br />
causing a subsequent one. Arguably, there are other forms of causation.
<br />
Arguably the laws of the universe &quot;cause&quot; events in the sense that if
<br />
they were different, events would be different. Can the same argument
<br />
be applied to mathematical truth? The problem is that mathematical
<br />
truth is logically necessary -- it could not have been different!
<br />
More on Formalism
<br />
Formalism and Godel
<br />
'The incompleteness results affect the philosophy of mathematics,
<br />
particularly viewpoints like formalism, which uses formal logic to
<br />
define its principles. One can paraphrase the first theorem as saying
<br />
that &quot;we can never find an all-encompassing axiomatic system which is
<br />
able to prove all mathematical truths, but no falsehoods.&quot;'

<br />
'On the other hand, from a strict formalist perspective this paraphrase
<br />
would be considered meaningless because it presupposes that
<br />
mathematical &quot;truth&quot; and &quot;falsehood&quot; are well-defined in an absolute
<br />
sense, rather than relative to each formal system.'

an artificial construct, then the answer is obviously 'no'. However.
<br />
Searle also thinks the the body is a machine, by which he seems to mean
<br />
that it has been understand in scientific terms, we can explain biology
<br />
by in terms of to chemistry and chemistry in terms of physics. Is the
<br />
brain a machine by this definition ? The problem is that the job of he
<br />
brain is to implement a conscious mind, just as the job of the stomach
<br />
is to digest. The problem is that although our 'mechanical'
<br />
understanding of the stomach does allow us to understand digestion we
<br />
do not, according to Searle himself, understand how the brain produces
<br />
consciousness. He does think that the problem of consciousness is
<br />
scientifically explicable, so yet another definition of 'machine' is
<br />
needed, namely 'scientifically explained or scientifically explicable'
<br />
-- with the brain being explicable rather than explained. The problem
<br />
with this stretch-to-fit approach to the meaning of the word 'machine'
<br />
is that every time the definition of brain is broadened, the claim is
<br />
weakened, made less impactful.

The Chinese Room
<br />
According to the proponents of Artificial Intelligence, a system is
<br />
intelligent if it can convince a human interlocutor that it is. This is
<br />
the famous Turing Test. It focuses on external behaviour and is mute
<br />
about how that behaviour is produced. A rival idea is that of the
<br />
Chinese Room, due to John Searle. Searle places himself in the room,
<br />
manually executing a computer algorithm that implements
<br />
intelligent-seeming behaviour, in this case getting questions written
<br />
in Chinese and mechanically producing answers, without himself
<br />
understanding Chinese. He thereby focuses attention on how the
<br />
supposedly intelligent behaviour is produced. Although Searle's
<br />
original idea was aimed at semantics, my variation is going to focus on
<br />
consciousness. Likewise, although Searle's original specification has
<br />
him implementing complex rules, I am going to take it that the Chinese
<br />
Room is implemented as a conceptually simple system, in line with the
<br />
theorem of CS which has it that any computer can be emulated by a
<br />
Turing Machine.

<br />
If you think a Chinese Room implemented with a simplistic, &quot;dumb&quot;
<br />
algorithm can still be conscious, you are probably a behaviourist; you
<br />
only care about that external stimuli get translated into the
<br />
appropriate responses, not how this happens, let alone what it feels
<br />
like to the system in question.

<br />
If you think this dumb Chinese Room is not conscious, but a smart one
<br />
would be, you need to explain why. Any smart AI can be implemented as a
<br />
dumb TM, so the more complex inner workings which supposedly implement
<br />
consciousness. could be added or subtracted without making any
<br />
detectable difference. This seems to add up to epiphenomenalism, the
<br />
view that consciousness exists but is a bystander that doesn't cause
<br />
anything

<br />
If you think that complexity makes a difference, so dumb AI's are
<br />
definitely not conscious, you are probably a (strong) emergentist: the
<br />
complexity is of such a nature that it cannot be reduced to a dumb
<br />
algorithm such as a Turing machine, and is therefore non-computable.

<br />
(A couple of points: I am talking about strong, Broad-style emergentism
<br />
here, according to which the emerging property cannot be usefully
<br />
reduced to something simpler. There is also a weaker sense of
<br />
'emergence' in which what emerges is a mere pattern of behaviour, like
<br />
the way the waves 'emerge' from the sea. This is not quite black-box
<br />
behaviourism, since some attention is being paid to what goes on inside
<br />
the head, inasmuch as the right high-level pattern needs to be
<br />
produced, but it is closer to behaviourism than to strong, irreducible,
<br />
Broad-style emergentism.

<br />
Also: I casually remarked that mental behaviour 'may not be
<br />
computable'. This will shock some AI proponents, for whom the
<br />
Chuch-Turing thesis proves that everything is computable. More
<br />
precisely, everything that is mathematically computable is computable
<br />
by a relatively dumb computer, a Turing that something can be simulated
<br />
doesn't mean the simulation has all the relevant propeties of the
<br />
original: flight simulators don't take off. Thirdly the mathematical
<br />
sense of 'computable' doesn't fit well with the idea of
<br />
computer-simulating fundamental physics. A real number is said to be
<br />
mathematically computable if the algorithm that churns it out keeps on
<br />
churning out extra digits of accuracy..indefinitely. Since such a
<br />
algorithm will never finish churning out a single real number physical
<br />
value, it is difficult to see how it could simulate an entire universe.
<br />
Yes, I am assuming the universe is fundamentally made of real numbers.
<br />
If it is, for instance finite, fundamental physics might be more
<br />
readily computable, but the computability of physics still depends very
<br />
much on physics and not just on computer science). Peter D Jones 8/6/05
<br />
The Chinese Room and Semantics

<br />
The CR concludes that an abstract set of rules is insufficient for
<br />
semantics.

<br />
The objection goes: &quot;But there must be some kind of information
<br />
processing structure that implements meaning in our heads. Surely that
<br />
could be turned into rules for the operator of the Chinese Room&quot;.

<br />
The Circularity Objection: an abstract structure must be circular and
<br />
therefore must fail to have any real semantics. (It is plausible that
<br />
any given term can be given an abstract definition that doesn't depend
<br />
on direct experience. It is much less plausible that every *term* can
<br />
be defined that way. Such a system would be circular in the same way
<br />
as: &quot;present: gift&quot; &quot;gift: present&quot; but on a larger scale. If this
<br />
argument, the Circularity Objection is correct, the practice of giving
<br />
abstract definitions, like &quot;equine quadruped&quot; only works because
<br />
somewhere in the chain of definitions are words that have been defined
<br />
directly; direct reference has been merely deferred, not avoided
<br />
altogether.)

<br />
The objection continues: &quot;But the information processing structure in
<br />
our heads has a concrete connection to the real world: so do AI's
<br />
(although the CR's are minimal) (This is the Portability Assumption)&quot;.

<br />
But they are not the *same* concrete connections. The portability of
<br />
abstract rules is guaranteed by the fact that they are abstract. But
<br />
concrete causal connections are non-abstract, and are prima-facie
<br />
unlikely to be portable -- how can you explain colour to an alien whose
<br />
senses do not include anything like vision.

<br />
If the Circularity Objection is correct, an AI (particularly a robotic
<br />
one) could be expected to have *some* semantics, but there is no reason
<br />
it should have *human* semantics. As wittgenstein said: &quot;if a lion
<br />
could talk, we could not understand it&quot;.

<br />
Peter D Jones 13/11/05
<br />
Artificial Intelligence and Computers

<br />
An AI is not necessarily a computer. Not everything is a computer or
<br />
computer-emulable. It just needs to be artificial and intelligent! The
<br />
extra ingredient a conscious system has need not be anything other than
<br />
the physics (chemistry, biology) of its hardware -- there is no forced
<br />
choice between ghosts and machines.

<br />
A physical system can never be exactly emulated with different hardware
<br />
-- the difference has to show up somewhere. It can be hidden by only
<br />
dealing with a subset of a systems abilities relevant to the job in
<br />
hand; a brass key can open a door as well as an iron key, but brass
<br />
cannot be substituted for iron where magnetism is relevant. Physical
<br />
differences can also be evaded by taking an abstract view of their
<br />
functioning; two digital circuits might be considered equivalent at the
<br />
&quot;ones and zeros&quot; level of description even though they physically work
<br />
at different voltages.

<br />
Thus computer-emulability is not a property of physical systems as
<br />
such. Even if all physical laws are computable, that does not mean that
<br />
any physical systems can be fully simulated. The reason is that the
<br />
level of simulation matters. A simulated plane does not actually fly; a
<br />
simulated game of chess really is chess. There seems to be a
<br />
distinction between things like chess, which can survive being
<br />
simulated at a higher level of abstraction, and planes, which can't.
<br />
Moreover, it seems that chess-like things are in minority, and that
<br />
they can be turned into an abstract programme and adequately simulated
<br />
because they are already abstract.

<br />
Consciousness. might depend on specific properties of hardware, of
<br />
matter. This does not imply parochialism, the attitude that denies
<br />
consciousness to poor Mr Data just because he is made out of silicon,
<br />
not protoplasm. We know our own brains are conscious; most of us intuit
<br />
that rocks and dumb Chinese Rooms are not; all other cases are
<br />
debatable.

<br />
Of course all current research in AI is based on computation in one way
<br />
or another. If the Searlian idea that consciousness is rooted in
<br />
physics, strongly emergent, and non-computable is correct, then current
<br />
AI can only achieve consciousness accidentally. A Searlian research
<br />
project would understand how brains generate consciousness in the first
<br />
place -- the aptly-named Hard Problem -- before moving onto possible
<br />
artificial reproductions, which would have to have the right kind of
<br />
physics and internal causal activity -- although not necessarily the
<br />
same kind as humans.

<br />
Computationalism
<br />
Computationalism is the claim that the human mind is essentially a
<br />
computer. It can be picturesquely expressed in the &quot;yes, doctor&quot;
<br />
hypothesis -- the idea that, faced with a terminal disease, you would
<br />
consent to having your consciousness downloaded to a computer.

<br />
There are two ambiguities in &quot;computationalism&quot; -- consciousness vs.
<br />
cognition, process vs programme -- leading to a total of four possible
<br />
meanings.

<br />
Most people would not say &quot;yes doctor&quot; to a process that recorded their
<br />
brain on a tape a left it in a filing cabinet. Yet, that is all you can
<br />
get out of the timeless world of Plato's heaven (programme vs process).

<br />
That intuition is, I think, rather stronge than the intuition that
<br />
Maudlin's argument relies on: that consciousness supervenes only on
<br />
brain activity, not on counterfactuals.

<br />
But the other ambiguity in computationalism offers another way out. If
<br />
only cognition supervenes on computational (and hence counterfactual)
<br />
activity, then consciousness could supervene on non-counterfactual
<br />
activity -- i.e they could both supervene on physical processes, but in
<br />
different ways.
<br />
Platonic computationalism -- are computers numbers?
<br />
Any computer programme (in a particular computer) is a long sequence of
<br />
1's and 0's, and therefore, a long number. According to Platonism,
<br />
numbers exist immaterially in &quot;Plato's Heaven&quot;. If programmes are
<br />
numbers, does that mean Plato's heaven is populated with computer
<br />
programmes?

<br />
The problem, as we shall see is the &quot;in a a particular computer&quot;
<br />
clause.

<br />
As Bruno Marchal states the claim in a more formal language:

<br />
&quot;Of course I can [identify programmes with numbers ]. This is a key
<br />
point, and it is not obvious. But I can, and the main reason is Church
<br />
Thesis (CT). Fix any universal machine, then, by CT, all partial
<br />
computable function can be arranged in a recursively enumerable list
<br />
F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, etc. &quot;

<br />
Of course you can count or enumerate machines or algorithms, i.e.
<br />
attach unique numerical labels to them. The problem is in your &quot;Fix any
<br />
universal machine&quot;. Given a string of 1's and 0s wihouta universal
<br />
machine, and you have no idea of which algorithm (non-universal
<br />
machine) it is. Two things are only identical if they have all*their
<br />
properties in common (Leibniz's law). But none of the propeties of the
<br />
&quot;machine&quot; are detectable in the number itself.

<br />
(You can also count the even numbers off against the odd numbers , but
<br />
that hardly means that even numbers are identical to odd numbers!)

<br />
&quot;In computer science, a fixed universal machine plays the role of a
<br />
coordinate system in geometry. That's all. With Church Thesis, we don't
<br />
even have to name the particular universal machine, it could be a
<br />
universal cellular automaton (like the game of life), or Python,
<br />
Robinson Aritmetic, Matiyasevich Diophantine universal polynomial,
<br />
Java, ... rational complex unitary matrices, universal recursive group
<br />
or ring, billiard ball, whatever.&quot;

<br />
Ye-e-es. But if all this is taking place in Platonia, the only thing it
<br />
can be is a number. But that number can't be associated with a
<br />
computaiton by another machine, or you get infinite regress.
<br />
Is the computationalist claim trivial -- are all systems computers?
<br />
TBD
<br />
Computational counterfactuals, and the Computational-Platonic Argument
<br />
for Immaterial Minds
<br />
For one, there is the argument that: A computer programme is just a
<br />
long number, a string of 1's and 0's.
<br />
(All) numbers exist Platonically (according to Platonism)
<br />
Therefore, all programmes exist Platonically.

<br />
A mind is special kind of programme (According to computaionalism)
<br />
All programmes exist Platonically (previous argument)
<br />
Therefore, all possible minds exist Platonically
<br />
Therefore, a physical universe is unnecessary -- our minds exist
<br />
already in the Platonic realm

<br />
The argument has a number of problems even allowing the assumptions of
<br />
Platonism, and computationalism.

<br />
A programme is not the same thing as a process.

<br />
Computationalism refers to real, physical processes running on material
<br />
computers. Proponents of the argument need to show that the causality
<br />
and dynamism are inessential (that there is no relevant difference
<br />
between process and programme) before you can have consciousness
<br />
implemented Platonically.

<br />
To exist Platonically is to exist eternally and necessarily. There is
<br />
no time or change in Plato's heave. Therefore, to &quot;gain entry&quot;, a
<br />
computational mind will have to be translated from a running process
<br />
into something static and acausal.

<br />
One route is to replace the process with a programme. let's call this
<br />
the Programme approach.. After all, the programme does specify all the
<br />
possible counterfactual behaviour, and it is basically a string of 1's
<br />
and 0's, and therefore a suitable occupant of Plato's heaven. But a
<br />
specification of counterfactual behaviour is not actual counterfactual
<br />
behaviour. The information is the same, but they are not the same
<br />
thing.

<br />
No-one would believe that a brain-scan, however detailed, is conscious,
<br />
so not computationalist, however ardent, is required to believe that a
<br />
progamme on a disk, gathering dust on a shelf, is sentient, however
<br />
good a piece of AI code it may be!

<br />
Another route is &quot;record&quot; the actual behaviour, under some
<br />
circumstances of a process, into a stream of data (ultimately, a string
<br />
of numbers, and therefore something already in Plato's heaven). Let's
<br />
call this the Movie approach. This route loses the conditional
<br />
structure, the counterfactuals that are vital to computer programmes
<br />
and therefore to computationalism.

<br />
Computer programmes contain conditional (if-then) statements. A given
<br />
run of the programme will in general not explore every branch. yet the
<br />
unexplored branches are part of the programme. A branch of an if-then
<br />
statement that is not executed on a particular run of a programme will
<br />
constitute a counterfactual, a situation that could have happened but
<br />
didn't. Without counterfactuals you cannot tell which programme
<br />
(algorithm) a process is implementing because two algorithms could have
<br />
the same execution path but different unexecuted branches.

<br />
Since a &quot;recording&quot; is not computation as such, the computationalist
<br />
need not attribute mentality to it -- it need not have a mind of its
<br />
own, any more than the characters in a movie.

<br />
(Another way of looking at this is via the Turing Test; a mere
<br />
recording would never pass a TT since it has no
<br />
condiitonal/counterfactual behaviour and therfore cannot answer
<br />
unexpected questions).

<br />
A third approach is make a movie of all possible computational
<br />
histories, and not just one. Let's call thsi the Many-Movie approach.

<br />
In this case a computation would have to be associated with all related
<br />
branches in order to bring all the counterfactuals (or rather
<br />
conditionals) into a single computation.

<br />
(IOW treating branches individually would fall back into the problems
<br />
of the Movie approach)

<br />
If a computation is associated with all branches, consciousness will
<br />
also be according to computationalism. That will bring on a White
<br />
Rabbit problem with a vengeance.

<br />
However, it is not that computation cannot be associated with
<br />
counterfactuals in single-universe theories -- in the form of
<br />
unrealised possibilities, dispositions and so on. If consciousness
<br />
supervenes on computation , then it supervenes on such counterfactuals
<br />
too; this amounts to the response to Maudlin's argument in wihch the
<br />
physicalist abandons the claim that consciousness supervenes on
<br />
activity.

<br />
Of ocurse, unactualised possibilities in a single universe are never
<br />
going to lead to any White Rabbits!
<br />
Turing and Other Machines
<br />
Turing machines are the classical model of computation, but it is
<br />
doubtful whether they are the best model for human (or other organic)
<br />
intelligence. Turing machines take a fixed input, take as much time as
<br />
necessary to calculate a result, and produce a perfect result (in some
<br />
cases, they will carry on refining a result forever). Biological
<br />
survival is all about coming up with good-enough answers to a tight
<br />
timescale. Mistaking a shadow for a sabre-tooth tiger is a msitake, but
<br />
it is more accpetable than standing stock still calculating the perfect
<br />
interpretation of your visual information, only to ge eaten. This
<br />
doesn't put natural cognition beyone the bounds of computation, but it
<br />
does mean that the Turing Machine is not the ideal model. Biological
<br />
systems are more like real time systems, which have to &quot;keep up&quot; with
<br />
external events, at the expense of doing some things imprefectly.
<br />
Time and Causality in Physics and Computation
<br />
The sum total of all the positions of particles of matter specififies a
<br />
(classical) physical state, but not how the state evolves. Thus it
<br />
seems that the universe cannot be built out of 0-width (in temporal
<br />
terms) slices alone. Physics needs to appeal to something else.

<br />
There is one dualistic and two monistic solutions to this.

<br />
The dualistic solution is that the universe consists (separately) of
<br />
states+the laws of universe. It is like a computer, where the data
<br />
(state) evolves according to the programme (laws).

<br />
One of the monistic solutions is to put more information into states.
<br />
Physics has an age old &quot;cheat&quot; of &quot;instantaneous velocities&quot;. This
<br />
gives more information about how the state will evolve. But the state
<br />
is no longer 0-width, it is infinitessimal.

<br />
Another example of states-without-laws is Julian Barbour's Platonia.
<br />
Full Newtonian mechanics cannot be recovered from his &quot;Machian&quot;
<br />
approach, but he thinks that what is lost (universes with overall
<br />
rotation and movement) is no loss.

<br />
The other dualistic solution is the opposite of the second:
<br />
laws-without-states. For instance, Stephen Hawking's No Boundary
<br />
Conditions proposal

<br />
Maudlin's Argument and Counterfactuals
<br />
We have already mentioned a parallel with computation. There is also
<br />
relevance to Tim Maudlin's claim that computationalism is incompatible
<br />
with physicalism. His argument hinges on serparating the activity of a
<br />
comptuaitonal system from its causal dispositions. Consciousness, says
<br />
Maudlin supervened on activity alone. Parts of an AI mechansim that are
<br />
not triggered into activity can be disabled without changing
<br />
consciousness. However, such disabling changes the comutation being
<br />
performed, because programmes containt if-then statements only one
<br />
branch of which can be executed at a time. The other branch is a
<br />
&quot;counterfactual&quot;, as situationthat could have happened but didn't.
<br />
Nonetheless, these counterfactuals are part of the algorithm. If
<br />
changing the algorithm doesn't change the conscious state (because it
<br />
only supervenes on the active parts of the process, not the unrealised
<br />
counterfactuals), consciousness does not supervene on computation.

<br />
However, If causal dispositions are inextricably part of a physical
<br />
state, you can't separate activity from counterfactuals. Maudlin's
<br />
argument would then have to rely on disabling counterfactuals of a
<br />
specifically computational sort.

<br />
We earlier stated that the dualistic solution is like the separation
<br />
between programme and data in a (conventional) computer programme.
<br />
However, AI-type programmes are typified by the fact that there is not
<br />
a barrier between code and programme -- AI software is self-modifying,
<br />
so it is its own data. Just as it is not physically necessary that
<br />
there is a clear distinction between states and laws (and thus a
<br />
separability of phsycial counterfactuals), so it isn't necessarily the
<br />
case that there is a clear distinciton between programme and data, and
<br />
thus a separability of computational counterfactuals. PDJ 19/8/06

<br />
Mysticism: Is Anything Knowable?
<br />
(Based on a Dialogue with Bill Snyder)
<br />
&quot;Thinking about existence is quite other than existence itself. There
<br />
is no such thing as &quot;concrete&quot; thinking; thinking always deals in
<br />
abstractions and, hence, cannot contain existence itself&quot;.

<br />
Well, when you think about rocks, you don't have rocks in the head. But
<br />
does that put you at a disadvantage?

<br />
&quot;Thinking of rocks and being a rock are very different activities, or
<br />
more broadly thinking about existence and existence itself are very
<br />
different activities&quot;.

<br />
That is true, but it does not show there is anything missing from our
<br />
thinking. If there is nothing it is like to be a rock. there is nothing
<br />
to stop us grasping all there is to know about rock-ness from our
<br />
non-rock persepective.

<br />
Of course, we feel that we ourselves have inner thoughts and
<br />
(especially) feelings that cannot be understood by others, and we
<br />
assume others do, even bats, as in the famous paper by Thomas Nagel.
<br />
(More here). But the claim that is being examined language and thought
<br />
are necessarily limited when it comes to grasping the world -- not that
<br />
they are possibly limited depending on the nature of the world.

<br />
It is logically possible, if coutnerintuitive, that there something it
<br />
is like to be a rock, or anything else , and if so, there is something
<br />
we will never know about anything. This is the conclusion being sought,
<br />
but it is far from a necessary truth, only a possibility.

<br />
But if there is something it is like to be a rock,. that is a
<br />
metaphysical fact: the point being that we cannot discover the limits
<br />
of thought from the nature of thought alone.

<br />
&quot;As for being able to describe something (event or thing or whatever),
<br />
being able to refer to it is irrelevant. Referring to the keyboard on
<br />
which I am typing (I just did it) is not to describe it. Describing it
<br />
would be to state its colors, shape, and things like that. But to do
<br />
that we must use words which have no precise meaning&quot;.

<br />
Words only need to be precise enough to pick one thing out form
<br />
another. It is probably overkill to describe every last atom.(But
<br />
again, that is as much about what the world is like as the limitations
<br />
of langauge).

<br />
&quot;To put my point broadly, describing perceptual objects is never
<br />
completely possible, but only approximative because we use abstract
<br />
concepts in the making of our description (like words which refer to
<br />
shape and color). When one comes to the objects of wholly abstract
<br />
thought such as the &quot;objects&quot; referred to in advanced scientific
<br />
theories, then one is living in a dream world if one thinks that one
<br />
can describe them or that the theory in question describes them&quot;.

<br />
That's a rather different issue. The objects of fundamental science
<br />
tend to be quite simple. The problem is not one of information
<br />
overload, is the lack of familir reference-points. (Reference *does*
<br />
matter).

<br />
&quot;The language used to refer to the objects MAY invite or suggest a
<br />
certain descriptive content, but it is more MISleading than helpful in
<br />
doing so. Calling an electron a particle may suggest that it is a very
<br />
tiny hard little grain of sand like thing. But as we have come to know
<br />
that is a very misleading way of thinking about it&quot;.

<br />
Yes, the real description is mathematical.

<br />
&quot;It can just as well be thought of as a field or a wave; when thought
<br />
of as a field, it is a field which at times generates particle like
<br />
behavior and at other times wavelike behavior and at other times
<br />
neither&quot;.

<br />
The verbal descriptions are unified mathematically.

<br />
&quot;If QM is correct, its maths describes electrons completely. There is
<br />
no hinterlan of additonal detail -- electrons have no 'hair'&quot;.

<br />
&quot;Language necessarily uses abstractions even in the description of
<br />
perceptual objects. When one is dealing with scientific language
<br />
(certainly in the advanced physical sciences) one is dealing with only
<br />
abstractions&quot;

<br />
In what sense of &quot;abstraction&quot;?

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* The sense that fails to capture what-it-is to-be-like a thing?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* The sense of omitted detail?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Or the sense of abstruse mathematics?

<br />
The salient point is whether the thing described has any kind of
<br />
hinterland which is left undescribed by the language employed. That is
<br />
almost always the case with ordinary-langauge descriptions of everyday
<br />
objects containing billions and billions of atoms -- but we only know
<br />
that to be the case because of the success of scientific descriptions!
<br />
It could be argued by analogy that just as the atom-by-atom picture is
<br />
left undescribed by the ordinarys term &quot;rock&quot; or &quot;tree&quot;, so there might
<br />
be a further hinterland behind the scientific explanation. But that is
<br />
only a &quot;maybe&quot;, not necessity, and as usual, metaphysics, the nature of
<br />
the world, is involved.

<br />
&quot;when one attempts to connect those abstractions with features drawn
<br />
from the perceptual world and thereby to &quot;describe&quot; the objects, one
<br />
only bamboozles any possibility of undertanding what is being referred
<br />
to&quot;.

<br />
There a various kinds of potential problem depending on the language
<br />
being used, and on what it is being used to describe. Lack of
<br />
understanding or communication is certainly possible, but is not a
<br />
foregone conclusion.

<br />
&quot;Therefore, as long as one operates wholly within the conceptual
<br />
structure one has no chance in hell of getting hold of existence
<br />
itself.

<br />
I think this is case of being bewitched by language -- specifically
<br />
being misled by a very unforced choice of metaphor. One is not
<br />
literally encased by ones own beliefs. The whole point of a concept is
<br />
to refer to things other than itself.

<br />
What does &quot;getting hold&quot; mean? As we have seen, knowing things from a
<br />
third-personse, second-hand, arm-length perspective does not by itself
<br />
imply that one is at a cognitve disadvantage. It depends on the thing
<br />
being understood.

<br />
&quot;There are people who appear to me to operate wholly within one
<br />
conceptual structure or another and live caged within their own
<br />
thoughts, confusing what they think the world to be with existence
<br />
itself&quot;.

<br />
They may, as individuals be representing things incorrectly (insofars
<br />
as they can be represented correctly). Or they may suffer from a more
<br />
genreral problem of being out of contact with reality. Of course, if
<br />
the general problem obtains in a strong way -- if philosophical
<br />
scepticism is true -- there is probably not much difference between
<br />
individuals. Everybody is equally wrong and right. (This is the classic
<br />
&quot;error&quot; argument against solipsism).

<br />
&quot;But existence itself is necessarily beyond any thinking or conceiving&quot;

<br />
There is no necessity to it at all. How knowable a thing is depends on
<br />
what it is and how you intend to know it.

Mysticism II: the Unreality of Real Things, and the 3-Level View of
<br />
Reality
<br />
Some forms of mysticism claim that everything is a mystery to us, that
<br />
we do not really know anything. Others claim that the problem lies in
<br />
things themselves, that they lack reality rather than knowability.
<br />
There is presumably some sense in which horses exist and unicorns do
<br />
not. Thus the claim about the unreality of &quot;conventional objects&quot; seems
<br />
to imply that they fall short of some higher standard. Is it a purely
<br />
theoretical standard, or does it imply that there is some higher,
<br />
transcedent reality , beyond conventional or empirical objects?

<br />
A commmon-sense thinker might well claim that in the absence of any
<br />
demonstrable higher reality, conventional existence is existence
<br />
simpliciter, and the objects we conventionally take to be real are
<br />
real.

<br />
A famous proponent of this view was the Buddhist philosopher Nagarjuna.
<br />
His philosophy was critical in nature, enabling him to establish the
<br />
&quot;nothing exists&quot; claim using their ready-made criteria for existence of
<br />
the philosophers he was criticising.
<br />
Mechanism, Organism and Knowability
<br />
Sceptical arguments often confuse being unable to know anything with
<br />
being unable to know everything. But is that really a confusion? It's
<br />
(logically) possible that things could be so constituted that the
<br />
nature of every thing is intintimately dependent on the nature of every
<br />
other thing. This is illustrated by an old parable called the &quot;net of
<br />
indra&quot;.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FAR AWAY IN THE HEAVENLY ABODE OF THE GREAT GOD INDRA, THERE IS A
<br />
WONDERFUL NET WHICH HAS BEEN HUNG BY SOME CUNNING ARTIFICER IN SUCH A
<br />
MANNER THAT IT STRETCHES OUT INDEFINITELY IN ALL DIRECTIONS. IN
<br />
ACCORDANCE WITH THE EXTRAVAGANT TASTES OF DEITIES, THE ARTIFICER HAS
<br />
HUNG A SINGLE GLITTERING JEWEL AT THE NET'S EVERY NODE, AND SINCE THE
<br />
NET ITSELF IS INFINITE IN DIMENSION, THE JEWELS ARE INFINITE IN NUMBER.
<br />
THERE HANG THE JEWELS, GLITTERING LIKE STARS OF THE FIRST MAGNITUDE, A
<br />
WONDERFUL SIGHT TO BEHOLD. IF WE NOW ARBITRARILY SELECT ONE OF THESE
<br />
JEWELS FOR INSPECTION AND LOOK CLOSELY AT IT, WE WILL DISCOVER THAT IN
<br />
ITS POLISHED SURFACE THERE ARE REFLECTED ALL THE OTHER JEWELS IN THE
<br />
NET, INFINITE IN NUMBER. NOT ONLY THAT, BUT EACH OF THE JEWELS
<br />
REFLECTED IN THIS ONE JEWEL IS ALSO REFLECTING ALL THE OTHER JEWELS, SO
<br />
THAT THE PROCESS OF REFLECTION IS INFINITE

<br />
This metaphysic does validate what otherwise be a non-sequitur; we
<br />
cannot know anything because we cannot know everything. Any finite
<br />
belief-system must be fall short of ultimate truth because it is
<br />
finite. But without the holistic metaphysics of the Net Of Indra, the
<br />
inference is simply a mistake. This is another mystical belief that
<br />
requires a metaphysical posit, not simply a consideration of the
<br />
limitations of knowledge.

<br />
Science uses a methodology or reductionism, of divide and conquer, of
<br />
breaking things down into their simplest components. A universe that
<br />
plays ball with this is a mechanical, rather than organic universe. For
<br />
our purposes, the most pertinent aspect of mechanism is the fact that
<br />
it involves linear chains of causation. A causes B , and B causes C. C
<br />
is not directly related to A and does not carry traces of A within it.
<br />
This is an advantage, because it reduces the number of things one has
<br />
to understand in order to understand C. (In the Organic universe, that
<br />
is of course everyhting). It is also the source of pretty well every
<br />
variety of scepticism, since A could have been replaced by A' without
<br />
changing C. If C is some effect worked on my sense-organs by an
<br />
external cause, then C could be the same in a scenario where it was
<br />
caused by A' rather than A. I could be a brain in a vat, I could be the
<br />
dupe of a Descartes Evil Spirit, I could be in a computer simulation.
<br />
All these scenarios are variations on the theme of my percepts, my
<br />
sense-data, being causes mechanically by something other that I think
<br />
is causing them. In the organic universe, they are impossible because I
<br />
already contain the whole world within myself, so substitions are
<br />
impossible without changing everything else.

<br />
Both Mechanism and Organism, then, lead to paradoxes. Mechanism makes
<br />
the world simple enough to understand (structurally, from a 3rd-person
<br />
perspective) at the expense of making its &quot;in itself&quot; nature uncertain.
<br />
Organism means that every being contains the nature of the whol eof
<br />
reality within itself -- but at the expense of making the Whole
<br />
incomprehensible to linear, 3rd-person, structural knowing.
<br />
Is Reality real ? the Simulation Argument
<br />
The Simulation Argument seeks to show that it is not just possible that
<br />
we are living inside a simulation, but likely.

<br />
1 You cannot simulate a world of X complexity inside a world of X
<br />
complexity.(quart-into-a-pint-pot-problem).

<br />
2 Therefore, if we are in a simulation the 'real' world outside the
<br />
simulation is much more complex and quite possibly completely different
<br />
to the simulated world.

<br />
3 In which case, we cannot make sound inferences from the world we are
<br />
appear to be in to alleged real world in which the simulation is
<br />
running

<br />
4 Therefore we cannot appeal to an argumentative apparatus of advanced
<br />
races, simulations etc, since all those concepts are derived from the
<br />
world as we see it -- which, by hypothesis is a mere simulation.

<br />
5 Therefore, the simulation argument pulls the metaphysical rug from
<br />
under its epistemological feet.

<br />
The counterargument does not show that we are not living in a
<br />
simulation, but if we are , we have no way of knowing whether it is
<br />
likely or not. Even if it seems likely that we will go on to create
<br />
(sub) simulations, that does not mean we are living in a simulation
<br />
that is likely for the same reasons, since our simulation might be rare
<br />
and peculiar. In particular, it might have the peculiarity that
<br />
sub-simulations are easy to create in it. For all we know our
<br />
simulators had extreme difficulty in creating our universe. In this
<br />
case, the fact that it is easy to create sub simulations within our
<br />
(supposed) simulation, does not mean it is easy to creae simulations
<br />
per se.

Why Mathematics Works

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Mathematics is the theoretical exploration of every possible kind
<br />
of abstract structure
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The world has some kind of structure; it is not chaos or
<br />
featureless or void
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Therefore, it is likely that at least some of the structures
<br />
discovered by mathematicians are applicable to the world

<br />
(It would be strange if everything mathematicans came up with was
<br />
empirically applicable, and might tend one towards Platonism or
<br />
Rationalism, but this is not the case. It might be possible for
<br />
mathematicians working completely abstractly and theoretically to fail
<br />
to include any empirically useful structures in the finite list of
<br />
structures so far achieved, but maths is not divorced from empiricism
<br />
and practicallity to that extent -- what I say in (1) is something of
<br />
an idealisation).

abstract. &gt;

The Mathematical Monistic Many-World Model Introduced

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Single (physical) universe theories
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Physical Multiverse theories.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Mathematical Multiverse Theories

<br />
Platonism is the idea that mathematical objects have an independent
<br />
existence of their own, in addition to the physical world. The
<br />
Mathematical Monistic Many-World Model idea keeps the Platonic realm of
<br />
numbers, but drops the physical world, claiming we are somehow &quot;inside&quot;
<br />
the world of numbers. One alleged benefit of this view is that it
<br />
removes the contingency, the &quot;just so&quot; quality of a universe consiting
<br />
of specific physical laws. Another is the claim that the success of
<br />
physics shows everything is mathematical, or at least has a
<br />
mathematical description. Another is the claim that matter adds nothing
<br />
explanatorily to maths.

<br />
For and Against Mathematical Platonism
<br />
The case for Mathematical Platonism needs to be made in the first
<br />
place; if numbers do not exist at all, the universe, as an existing
<br />
thing, cannot be a mathematical structure. (solipsists read: if numbers
<br />
are not real, I cannot be mathematical structure).

<br />
The claim that nothing exists but numbers is not just the claim that
<br />
the world is the kind of mathematical structure described by physics,
<br />
because that is only one of a multitude of mathematically possible
<br />
structures. The nothing-but-numbers claim entails the claim that a
<br />
multitude of mathematically consistent worlds exist which do not
<br />
correspond to anything that is observed. To put it another way, physics
<br />
is based on picking the mathematical structure that corresponds to
<br />
observation, so that only a subsection of physics is mathematically
<br />
useful. Thus the success of physics as a mathematical science does not
<br />
prove the nothing-but-numbers claim.

<br />
Theories of Everything (TOEs) seek to avoid explain away the apparent
<br />
(contingency) of the world. They are exercises in armchair rationalism,
<br />
and as such contingent facts that can only be derived from observation
<br />
cannot be permitted. Having said that, the armchair rationalist is
<br />
allowed to appeal to some very broad facts, such as his own existence,
<br />
and the *appearance* of contingency -- the fact that he sees some
<br />
things in the world around him, and others just are not there. Without
<br />
his own existence, the simplest non-contingent theory of reality is
<br />
that nothing exists! Apparent contingency, the finiteness, of the
<br />
experienced world is a trickier issue.

<br />
The Case Against Mathematical Platonism
<br />
The epistemic case for mathematical Platonism is be argued on the basis
<br />
of the objective nature of mathematical truth. Superficially, it seems
<br />
persuasive that objectivity requires objects. However, the basic case
<br />
for the objectivity of mathematics is the tendency of mathematicians to
<br />
agree about the answers to mathematical problems; this can be explained
<br />
by noting that mathematical logic is based on axioms and rules of
<br />
inference, and different mathematicians following the same rules will
<br />
tend to get the same answers , like different computers running the
<br />
same problem.

<br />
The semantic case for mathematical Platonism is based on the idea that
<br />
the terms in a mathematical sentence must mean something, and therefore
<br />
must refer to objects. It can be argued on general linguistic grounds
<br />
that not all meaning is reference to some kind of object outside the
<br />
head. Some meaning is sense, some is reference. That establishes the
<br />
possibility that mathematical terms do not have references. What
<br />
establishes it is as likely and not merely possible is the obeservation
<br />
that nothing like empirical investigation is needed to establish the
<br />
truth of mathematical statements. Mathematical truth is arrived at by a
<br />
purely conceptual process, which is what would be expected if
<br />
mathematical meaning were restricted to the Sense, the &quot;in the head&quot;
<br />
component of meaning.

<br />
The logical case for mathematical Platonism is based on the idea that
<br />
mathematical statements are true, and make existence claims. That they
<br />
are true is not disputed by the anti-Platonist, who must therefore
<br />
claim that mathematical existence claims are somehow weaker than other
<br />
existence claims -- perhaps merely metaphorical. That the the word
<br />
&quot;exists&quot; means different things in different contexts is easily
<br />
established.

<br />
For one thing, this is already conceded by Platonists! Platonists think
<br />
Platonic existence is eternal, immaterial non-spatial, and so on,
<br />
unlike the Earthly existence of material bodies. For another, we are
<br />
already used to contextualising the meaning of &quot;exists&quot;. We agree with
<br />
both: &quot;helicopters exist&quot;; and &quot;helicopters don't exist in Middle
<br />
Earth&quot;. (People who base their entire anti-Platonic philosophy are on
<br />
this idea are called fictionalists. However, mathematics is not a
<br />
fiction because it is not a free creation. Mathematicians are
<br />
constrained by consistency and non-contradiction in a way that authors
<br />
are not. Dr Watson's fictional existence is intact despite the fact
<br />
that he is sometimes called John and sometimes James in Conan Doyle's
<br />
stories).

<br />
A possible counter argument by the Platonist is that the downgrading of
<br />
mathematical existence to a mere metaphor is arbitrary. The
<br />
anti-Platonist must show that a consistent standard is being applied.
<br />
This it is possible to do; the standard is to take the meaning of
<br />
existence in the context of a particular proposition to relate to the
<br />
means of justification of the proposition. Since ordinary statements
<br />
are confirmed empirically, &quot;exists&quot; means &quot;can be perceived&quot; in that
<br />
context. Since sufficient grounds for asserting the existence of
<br />
mathematical objects are that it is does not contradict anything else
<br />
in mathematics, mathematical existence just amounts to concpetual
<br />
non-contradictoriness.

<br />
(Incidentally, this approach answers a question about mathematical and
<br />
empirical truth. The anti-Platonists wants the two kinds of truth to be
<br />
different, but also needs them to be related so as to avoid the charge
<br />
that one class of statement is not true at all. This can be achieved
<br />
because empirical statements rest on non-contradiction in order to
<br />
achive correspondence. If an empricial observation fails co correspond
<br />
to a statemet, there is a contradiction between them. Thus
<br />
non-contradiciton is a necessary but insufficient justification for
<br />
truth in empircal statements, but a sufficient one for mathematical
<br />
statements).

<br />
The forgoing establishes that Platonism is dispensible. What
<br />
establishes that anti-Platonism is actually preferable? One point in
<br />
its favour is that it is simpler.

<br />
All the facts about mathematical truth and methodology can be
<br />
established without appeal to the actual existence of mathematical
<br />
objects. In fact, the lack of such objects actually explains the
<br />
objectivity and necessity of maths. Mathematical statements are
<br />
necessarily true because there are no possible circumstances that make
<br />
them false; there are no possible circumstances that would make them
<br />
false because they do not refer to anything external. This is much
<br />
simpler than the Platonist alternative that mathematical statements:
<br />
1) have referents
<br />
which are
<br />
2) unchanging and eternal, unlike anything anyone has actually seen
<br />
and thereby
<br />
3) explain the necessity (invariance) of mathematical statements
<br />
without
<br />
4) performing any other role -- they are not involved inbr /&gt;
<br />
mathematical proof.

<br />
For and Against Matter
<br />
Matter is a bare substrate with no properties of its own. The question
<br />
may well be asked at this point: what roles does it perform ? Why not
<br />
dispense with matter and just have bundles of properties -- what does
<br />
matter add to a merely abstract set of properties? The answer is that
<br />
not all bundles of posible properties are instantiated, that they
<br />
exist.

<br />
What does it mean to say something exists ? &quot;..exists&quot; is a meaningful
<br />
predicate of concepts rather than things. The thing must exist in some
<br />
sense to be talked about. But if it existed full, a statement like
<br />
&quot;Nessie doesn't exist&quot; would be a contradiction ...it would amount to
<br />
&quot;the existing thing Nessie doesnt exist&quot;. However, if we take that the
<br />
&quot;some sense&quot; in which the subject of an &quot;...exists&quot; predicate exists is
<br />
only initially as a concept, we can then say whether or not the concept
<br />
has something to refer to. Thus &quot;Bigfoot exists&quot; would mean &quot;the
<br />
concept 'Bigfoot' has a referent&quot;.

<br />
What matter adds to a bundle of properties is existence. A non-existent
<br />
bundle of properties is a mere concept, a mere possibility. Thus the
<br />
concept of matter is very much tied to the idea of contingency or
<br />
&quot;somethingism&quot; -- the idea that only certain possible things exist.

<br />
The other issue matter is able to explain as a result of having no
<br />
properties of its own is the issue of change and time. For change to be
<br />
distinguishable from mere succession, it must be change in something.
<br />
It could be a contingent natural law that certain properties never
<br />
change. However, with a propertiless substrate, it becomes a logical
<br />
necessity that the substrate endures through change; since all changes
<br />
are changes in properties, a propertiless substrate cannot itself
<br />
change and must endure through change. In more detail here

<br />
The Case Against Mathematial Monism

<br />
Mathematical monism is both too broad and too narrow.

<br />
Too broad: If I am just a mathematical structure, I should have a much
<br />
wider range of experience than I do. There is a mathemtical structure
<br />
corresponding to myself with all my experiences up to time T. There is
<br />
a vast array of mathematical structures corresponding to other versions
<br />
of me with having a huge range of experiences -- ordinary ones, like
<br />
continuing to type, extraordinary ones like seeing my computer sudenly
<br />
turn into bowl of petunias. All these versions of me share the memories
<br />
of the &quot;me&quot; who is writing this, so they all identify themselves as me.
<br />
Remember, that for mathematical monism it is only necessary that a
<br />
possible experience has a mathematical description. This is known as
<br />
the White Rabbit problem. If we think in terms of multiverse theories,
<br />
we would say that there is one &quot;me&quot; in this universe and other &quot;me's&quot;
<br />
in other universes,a nd they are kept out of contact with each other.
<br />
The question is whether a purely mathematical scheme has enough
<br />
resources to impose isolation or otherwise remove the White Rabbit
<br />
problem.

<br />
Too narrow: there are a number of prima-facie phenomena which a purely
<br />
mathematical approach struggles to deal with.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* space
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* time
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* consciousness
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* causality
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* necessity/contingency

<br />
Why space ? It is tempting to think that if a number of, or some other
<br />
mathematical entity, occurs in a set with other numbers, that is, as it
<br />
were, a &quot;space&quot; which is disconnected from other sets, so that a set
<br />
forms a natural model of an *isolated* universe withing a multiverse, a
<br />
universe which does not suffer from the White Rabbit problem. However,
<br />
maths per se does not work that way. The number &quot;2&quot; that appears in the
<br />
set of even numbers is exactly the same number &quot;2&quot; that appears in the
<br />
list of numbers less than 10. It does not acquire any further
<br />
characteristics from its context.

<br />
The time issue should be obvious. Mathematics is tradionally held to
<br />
deal with timeless, eternal truths. This is reflected in the metpahor
<br />
of mathematical truth being discovered not found (which, in line with
<br />
my criticism of Platonism, should not be taken to seriously). It could
<br />
be objected that physics can model time mathematically; it can be
<br />
objected right back that it does so by spatialising time, by turning it
<br />
into just another dimension, in which nothing really changes, and
<br />
nothing passes. Some even go so far as to insist that this model is
<br />
what time &quot;really&quot; is, which is surely a case of mistaking the map for
<br />
the territory.

<br />
Consciousness is a problem for all forms of materialism and physicalism
<br />
to some extent, but it is possible to discern where the problem is
<br />
particularly acute. There is no great problem with the idea that matter
<br />
considered as a bare substrate can have mental properities. Any
<br />
inability to have mental properties would itself be a property and
<br />
therefore be inconsistent with the bareness of a bare substrate. The
<br />
&quot;subjectivity&quot; of conscious states, often treated as &quot;inherent&quot; boils
<br />
down to a problem of communicating one's qualia -- how one feels, how
<br />
things seem. Thus it is not truly inherent but depends on the means of
<br />
communication being used. Feelings and seemings can be more readily
<br />
communicated in artistic, poetic language, and least readily in
<br />
scientific, technical language. Since the harder, more technical a
<br />
science is, the more mathematical it is, the communication problem is
<br />
at its most acute in a purely mathematical langauge. Thus the problem
<br />
with physicalism is not its posit of matter (as a bare substrate) but
<br />
its other posit, that all properties are physical. Since physics is
<br />
mathematical, that amounts to the claim that all properties are
<br />
mathematical (or at least mathematically describable). In making the
<br />
transition from a physicalist world-view to a mathematical one, the
<br />
concept of a material substrate is abandoned (although it was never a
<br />
problem for consciousness) and mathematical properties become the only
<br />
possible basis for qualia. Qualia have to be reducible to, or
<br />
identifiable with, mathematical properties, if they exist at all. This
<br />
means that the problem for consciousness becomes extreme, since there
<br />
is no longer the possibility of qualia existing in their own right, as
<br />
properties of a material substrate, without supervening on
<br />
mathematically describable properties.

<br />
The interesting thing is that these two problems can be used to solve
<br />
each other to some extent. if we allow extra-mathemtical properties
<br />
into our universe, we can use them to solve the White Rabbit problem.
<br />
There are two ways of doing this: We can claim either:-

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* White Rabbit universes don't exist at all
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* White Rabbit universes are causally separated from us (or remote
<br />
in space)

<br />
The first is basically a reversion to a single-universe theory (1).
<br />
Mathematical monists sometimes complain that they can't see what role
<br />
matter plays. One way of seeing its role is as a solution to the WR
<br />
problem. For the non-Platonist, most mathematical entitites have a
<br />
&quot;merely abstract&quot; existence. Only a subset truly, conceretely, exist.
<br />
There is an extra factor that the priveleged few have. What is it ?
<br />
Materiality. For the physicalist, matter is the token of existence.
<br />
Maerial things, exist, immaterial ones don't.

<br />
The second moves on from a Mathematical Multiverse to a physical one
<br />
(3). The interesting thing about the second variety of
<br />
non-just-mathematical monism is that as well as addressing the White
<br />
Rabbit problem, it removes some further contingency. If the matter,
<br />
physical laws, and so on, are logically possible, then the general
<br />
approach of arguing for a universe/multiverse on the grounds of
<br />
removing contingency must embrace them -- otherwise it would be a
<br />
contingent fact that the universe/multiverse consists of nothing but
<br />
mathematics.
