</em><br />
<br />Hi Colin
<br />
<br />I think there's a link here with the dialogue in the 'Asifism' thread
<br />
between Bruno and me. I've been reading Galen Strawson's
<br />
&quot;Consciousness and its place in Nature&quot;, which has re-ignited some of
<br />
the old hoo-hah over 'panpsychism', with the usual attendant
<br />
embarrassment and name-calling.  It motivated me to try to unpack the
<br />
basic semantic components that are difficult to pin down in these
<br />
debates, and for this reason tend to lead to mutual incomprehension.
<br />
<br />Strawson refers to the 'magical emergence' you mention, and what is in
<br />
his view (and mine) the disanalogy of 'emergent' accounts of
<br />
consciousness with, say, how 'liquidity' supervenes on molecular
<br />
behaviour.  So I started from the question: what would have to be the
<br />
case at the 'component' level for such 'emergence' to make sense (and
<br />
I'm aiming at the semantics here, not 'ultimate truth', whatever that
<br />
might be).  My answer is simply that for 'sensing' and 'acting' to
<br />
'emerge' (i.e. supervene on) some lower level, that lower level must
<br />
itself 'sense' and 'act' (or 'grasp', a word that can carry the
<br />
meaning of both).
<br />
<br />What sense does it make to say that, for example, sub-atomic
<br />
particles, strings, or even Bruno's numbers, 'grasp' each other?
<br />
Well, semantically, the alternative would be that they would shun and
<br />
ignore each other, and we wouldn't get very far on that basis.  They
<br />
clearly seem to relate according to certain 'rules', but we're not so
<br />
naive (are we?) as to suppose that these are actually 'laws' handily
<br />
supplied from some 'external' domain.  Since we're talking 'primitives
<br />
here', then such relating, such mutual 'grasping', must just *be*.
<br />
There's nothing wrong conceptually here, we always need an axiomatic
<br />
base, the question is simply where to situate it, and semantically IMO
<br />
the buck stops here or somewhere closely adjacent.
<br />
<br />The cool thing about this is, that if we start from such primitive
<br />
'grasping', then higher-level emergent forms of full sense-action can
<br />
now emerge organically by (now entirely valid) analogy with purely
<br />
action-related accounts such as liquidity, or for that matter, the
<br />
emergence of living behaviour from 'dead matter'.  And the obvious
<br />
complexity of the relation between, say quantum mechanics and, say,
<br />
the life cycle of the sphex wasp, should alert us to an equivalent
<br />
complexity in the relationship between primitive 'grasp' and its fully
<br />
qualitative (read: participatory) emergents - so please let's have no
<br />
(oh-so-embarrassing) 'conscious electrons' here.
<br />
<br />Further, it shows us in what way 'software consciousness' is
<br />
disanalogous with the evolved kind. A computer, or a rock for that
<br />
matter, is of course also a natural emergent from primitive grasping,
<br />
and this brings with it sense-action, but in the case of these objects
<br />
more action than sense at the emergent level.  The software level of
<br />
description, however, is merely an imputation, supplied externally
<br />
(i.e. by us) and imposed as an interpretation (one of infinitely many)
<br />
on the fundamental grasped relations of the substrate components.  By
<br />
contrast, the brain (and here comes the research programme) must have
<br />
evolved (crucially) to deploy a supremely complex set of 'mirroring'
<br />
processes that is (per evolution) genuinely emergent from the
<br />
primitive 'grasp' of the component level.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From this comes (possibly) the coolest consequence of these semantics:
</em><br />
our intrinsic 'grasp' of our own motivation (i.e. will, whether 'free'
<br />
or not), our participative qualitative modalities, the relation of our
<br />
suffering to subsequent action, and so forth, emerge as indeed
<br />
'something like' the primitive roots from which they inherit these
<br />
characteristics.  This is *real* emergence, not magical, and at one
<br />
stroke demolishes epiphenomenalism, zombies, uploading fantasies and
<br />
all the other illusory consequences of confusing the 'external
<br />
world' (i.e. a projection) with the participatory one in which we are
<br />
included.
<br />
<br />Cheers

<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hi,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; COLIN
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; I don't think we need a new word....I'll stick to the far less
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ambiguous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; term 'organisational complexity', I think. the word creativity is so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; loaded that its use in general discourse is bound to be prone to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; misconstrual, especially in any discussion which purports to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assessing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; the relationship between 'organisational complexity' and consciousness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; RUSSEL
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; What sort of misconstruals do you mean? I'm interested...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'organisational complexity' does not capture the concept I'm after.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; COLIN
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) Those associated with religious 'creation' myths - the creativity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ascribed to an omniscient/omnipotent entity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) The creativity ascribed to the act of procreation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3) The pseudo-magical aspects of human creativity (the scientific ah-ha
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moment and the artistic gestalt moment).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and pehaps...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4) Belief in 'magical emergence' .... qualitative novelty of a kind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; utterly unrelated to the componentry.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; These are all slippery slopes leading from the usage of the word
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'creativity' which could unexpectedly undermine the specificity of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; technical discourse aimed at a wider (multi-disciplinary) audience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Whatever word you dream up... let me know!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; COLIN
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; The question-begging loop at this epistemic boundary is a minefield.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [[engage tiptoe mode]]&gt;&gt; I would say:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; (1) The evolutionary algorithms are not 'doing science' on the natural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world. They are doing science on abstract entities whose relationship with&gt;&gt; the natural world is only in the mind(consciousness) of their grounder
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; the human programmer. The science done by the artefact can be the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perfectly good science of abstractions, but simply wrong or irrelevant
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; insofar as it bears any ability to prescribe or verify
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; claims/propositions&gt;&gt; about the natural world (about which it has no awareness whatever). The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; usefulness of the outcome (patents) took human involvement. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inventor&gt;&gt; (software) doesn't even know it's in a universe, let alone that it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; participated in an invention process.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; RUSSEL&gt; This objection is easily countered in theory. Hook up your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; evolutionary algorithm to a chemsitry workbench, and let it go with real
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; chemicals. Practically, its a bit more difficult of course, most likely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; leading to the lab being destroyed in some explosion.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; COLIN
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Lots o'fun! But it might actually create its own undoing in the words
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'evolutionary algorithm'. The self-modification strategy was preprogrammed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by a human, along with the initial values. Then there is the matter of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interpresting measurements of the output of the chemistry set...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The system (a) automatically prescibes certain trajectories and (b)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumes that the theroem space natural world are the same space and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; equivalently accessed. The assumption is that hooking up a chemistry set
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; replicates the 'wild-type' theorem prover that is the natural world. If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you could do that then you already know everything there is to know (about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the natural world) and there'd be no need do it in the first place. This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is the all-time ultimate question-begger...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Theoretical scientists, do not have laboratories to interface to,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; though, only online repositories of datasets and papers. A theoretical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; algorithmic scientist is a more likely proposition.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A belief that an algorithmic scientist is doing valid science on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; natural world (independent of any human) is problematic in that it assumes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that human cortical qualia play no part in the scientific process in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; face of easily available evidence to the contrary, and then doubly assumes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the algorithmic scientist (with a novelty exploration -theorem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proving strategy-programmed by a human) somehow naturally replicates the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; neglected functionality (role of cortical qualia).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; (2) &quot;Is this evolutionary algorithm conscious then?&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; In the sense that we are conscious of the natural world around us? Most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definitely no. Nowhere in the computer are any processes that include all&gt;&gt; aspects of the physics of human cortical matter.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Based on this, of the 2 following positions, which is less vulnerable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; critical attack?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; A) Information processing (function) begets consciousness, regardless
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; the behaviour of the matter doing the information processing (form).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Computers process information. Therefore I believe the computer is conscious.&gt;&gt; B) Human cortical qualia are a necessary condition for the scientific
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behaviour and unless the complete suite of the physics involved in that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; process is included in the computer, the computer is not conscious. Which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; form of question-begging gets the most solid points as science?  (B)&gt;&gt; of course. (B) is science and has an empirical future. Belief (A) is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; religion, not science.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Bit of a no-brainer, eh?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I think you're showing clear signs of carbon-lifeform-ism here. Whilst I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can say fairly clearly that I believe my fellow humans are&gt; conscious, and that I beleive John Koza's evolutionary programs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; aren't, I do not have a clear-cut operational test of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; consciousness. Its like the test for pornography - we know it when we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; see it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is touching the flame - right there - where i claim this is not the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; case. Everything we are is mediated through cortical qualia. In the one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and only case - the act of doing science - this argument is not valid.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Science evidences qualia (it does not say what they are, merely that they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exist)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is the cultural blind we inhabit. Cortical qualia are all and ONLY
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evidence of _everything_ and is subjectively delivered. We cannot have it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; both ways. We cannot live and do science using it for all evidence and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then either (a) deny it or (b) claim it present in another person/artifact
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with the same ability as we declare something pornography (an arbitrary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; belief). Let the object itself demonstrate science. be scientific about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it. This is the only place any consistency can be invoked and the major
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; source of inconsistency in our own behaviour as scientists.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Like I said earlier: everything is evidence of something and scientists
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are no exception - they are evidence of something and that something is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cortical qualia.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The scientific act and the existence of scientists is the slim crack in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the cultural blind through which we can end the chronic failure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;It is therefore not at all clear to me that some n-th
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; improvement on an evolutionary algorithm won't be considered conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at some time in the future. It is not at all clear which aspects of human
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cortical systems are required for consciousness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You are not alone. This is an epidemic.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My scientific claim is that the electromagnetic field structure literally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the third person view of qualia. This is not new. What is new is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understanding the kind of universe we inhabit in which that is necessarily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the case. It's right there, in the cells. Just ask the right question of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them. There's nothing else there but space (mostly), charge and mass - all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things delineated and described by consciousness as how they appear to it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - and all such descriptions are logically necessarily impotent in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prescribing why that very consciousness exists at all.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Wigner got this in 1960something.... time to catch up.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; gotta go....
