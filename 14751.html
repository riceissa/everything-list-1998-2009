Hi Greg,

<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I agree, and I think one half of the everything-list participants  
<br />
agree on this (cf our Relative versus Absolute Self-Sample Assumption  
<br />
debates). The probabilities are relatively conditioned on the &quot;brain/ 
<br />
body&quot; states  *histories*, and things are not so different from  
<br />
Feynman integral formulation of QM.
<br />
Now, the question is &quot;why *quantum* histories&quot;. My point is that if we  
<br />
assume we are turing-emulable, then the probabilities have to be  
<br />
derived from a sum on *all* computations. Not just the quantum one.  
<br />
This means we can test the computationalist theory by comparing the  
<br />
sum on all quantum histories/computations (with its weird probability/ 
<br />
amplitude relation) and the sum on all histories/computations.
<br />
At first sight the comp theory is false because it leads to many more  
<br />
white rabbits than the quantum, but by taking into account constraints  
<br />
related to incompleteness phenomena and logic of self-references,  
<br />
there are (rather technical alas) evidences that the third person  
<br />
white rabbits go away too.
<br />
It remains abnormally too much first person white rabbits, and I am a  
<br />
bit stuck on that. QM, and physics in general, per se, does not even  
<br />
address those first person purely qualia rabbits (although Galileo,  
<br />
Einstein, Boscovitch, Everett, .Wheeler, Rossler, ... can be seen as a  
<br />
sequences of physicists converging to that.
<br />
Assuming we are turing emulable, we have to &quot;radicalize&quot; Everett. We  
<br />
have to justify why, in appearance, the QM computations wins in the  
<br />
observable game. All the pieces of the puzzle are there.
<br />
<br />Greg, I have read and appreciate very much your &quot;Permutation City&quot;  
<br />
novel, but to be honest, I see you still believe &quot;physics&quot; study what  
<br />
there is. This seems to prevent you to follow your own logical line.  
<br />
See my Sane04 paper for an argument (in english) showing that IF we  
<br />
are turing emulable, THEN the observable is just what emerges from all  
<br />
possible local merging and differentiations of computational histories  
<br />
(= as seen as first person point of view, probably plural first  
<br />
person. Merging works through amnesia, and I don't explicitly tackle  
<br />
merging in my publications).
<br />
<br />In &quot;Laws without Laws&quot;, or &quot;It from bits&quot; John Archibald Wheeler got  
<br />
that point: the physical laws emerges on something non-physical.  
<br />
Assuming we are digital machine, that non-physical stuff has not to be  
<br />
more than the additive and multiplicative properties of natural  
<br />
numbers. Poetically: what we take for being the physical reality is in  
<br />
fact the border of the ignorance of self-introspecting universal  
<br />
machine/number (&quot;us&quot;). That &quot;Ignorance&quot; is *very* big, and productive,  
<br />
almost &quot;alive&quot; when seen from inside. And mathematically tractable by  
<br />
computer science/recursion theory.
<br />
To sum up in a Soccer way: Plato 1, Aristotle 0.  (I don't pretend the  
<br />
match is over!)
<br />
<br />But I think a lot that QM confirms already the comp hypothesis, and  
<br />
the non-materiality of matter.
<br />
To sum up in a Kronecker's way: God creates the natural numbers, all  
<br />
the rest are web of coherent (and less coherent) dreams by natural  
<br />
numbers.
<br />
I think I have an argument showing that the comp hyp reduces the mind- 
<br />
body problem into a pure body problem. The problem now is that most  
<br />
physicist takes bodies from granted, and this prevents the  
<br />
understanding of the argument. But that is &quot;religion&quot;.
<br />
(For example, Vic Stenger in his &quot;God, the failed hypothesis&quot;  
<br />
identifies material with natural, and immaterial with supernatural,  
<br />
making math and logic, what? parapsychology? Theology perhaps. At  
<br />
least physicists like Penrose, Wheeler, Deutch, Tegmark are aware of  
<br />
the mathematical reality. Only logicians seems to be aware of (and  
<br />
familiar with) the intricacy of digital self-reference. It is pity  
<br />
that the gap between logicians, physicists and philosopher of mind/ 
<br />
theologian remain so wide.  At more than one level, I'm afraid. I am  
<br />
quite opposed to creationism and any &quot;authoritative&quot; bible-god  
<br />
crackpot theology, but many scientists aggravate the hiatus by being a  
<br />
bit dogmatic on matter like if we would have solved the mind-body  
<br />
problem. My modest work, and our discussions here, just points toward  
<br />
a &quot;scientific&quot; formulation of that old problem.
<br />
Some believe that science is ending. I believe that it has not yet  
<br />
begun (abstracting from -500 to +500 perhaps ...)
<br />
<br />Best regards,
<br />
<br />Bruno
