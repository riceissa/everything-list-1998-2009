<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't think anyone yet has managed a self aware formal system,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I would say all my work is about that. You can interpret Godel's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; theorem, or more exactly the fact that machine can prove their own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; provability logic, and even guess correctly the true but non provable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; part, as a general statement of self-awareness. Sometimes,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; self-awareness is defined more precisely by the &quot;4&quot; modal formula: Bp
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; -&gt; BBp. This is a theorem for PA, but not for LRA.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; When LRA proves p, then soon or later, if not already, LRA will prove
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Bp (that is LRA will prove that she prove p). So Bp -&gt; BBp is true for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; LRA, but only PA can prove such a proposition on itself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Absolutely your work is all about that. And constructing a formal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-aware system will just as likely come from an approach like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; yours as anything else. My only statement was that it hasn't been done
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; already, and certainly I wasn't aware of you claiming self-awareness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; already.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />Of course many things depends on definitions, but I thought it was 
<br />
clear that I consider that any theorem prover machine,  for a theory 
<br />
like ZF or PA, is already self-aware. And of course such theorem prover 
<br />
already exist (not just in platonia).
<br />
The &quot;interview&quot; of the lobian machine has already begun, through the 
<br />
papers of Godel, Lob, ... Then Solovay's results have captured, through 
<br />
the modal logic G and G*,  the whole (infinite) conversation we can 
<br />
have with and about such machines (G gives (self-) science and G* gives 
<br />
the (self) correct hope/bet/interrogation/theology).
<br />
The technical part of my thesis is really the *result* of the interview 
<br />
of such self-aware (and even aware of being self-aware) machine. But 
<br />
frankly I am glad with Smullyan (rather classical) definition of 
<br />
self-awareness in his little book &quot;FOREVER UNDECIDED&quot;:
<br />
A machine M is self-aware if, having proved p, she will prove soon or 
<br />
later if not already, Bp.
<br />
A machine M is self-aware of its self-awareness if for any p she proves 
<br />
Bp -&gt; BBp (that is: she knows the preceding line for any proposition 
<br />
p).
<br />
No need to put too much philosophy here, it could be prematured.
<br />
As a platonist (or just mathematician), no need to have the interview 
<br />
with an &quot;incarnate&quot; machine, we can stay in Platonia, where such 
<br />
machine and their interviews exist out of space and time. That is good 
<br />
given that the goal (made necessary by the UDA) is to derived the 
<br />
structure of space and time from the interview!
<br />
But yes, indeed I consider already PA or ZF as person, and this with or 
<br />
without terrestrial local implementations.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Admittedly, I miss some of the conclusions you do make, such as the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Theatetic axioms encapsulating knowledge, ...
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I remember. You said some times ago that the definition of knowledge of 
<br />
P (Kp) by true justified opinion (Bp &amp; p) is debatable, and you are 
<br />
right; it is somehow debated since, well, a very long time, and in many 
<br />
places: China, India, Greece up to Plato.
<br />
I postpone a bit a debate on that. Note that this idea is used 
<br />
implicitly at step 6 of the Universal Dovetailer Argument. It is 
<br />
related to the use of dream in metaphysics.
<br />
And such a definition has to be nuanced, at least if we trust Socrate's 
<br />
critics of Theatetus, or Plotinus or ... the lobian machine itself!!!  
<br />
Indeed, by incompleteness we have the new Bp &amp; Dp nuances, and we have 
<br />
the Bp &amp; Dp &amp; p nuances, etc.
<br />
Actually those who criticize the definition of knowledge by &quot;Bp &amp; p&quot; 
<br />
have to maintain that they are able to distinguish their dream and 
<br />
awakeness states. But with comp, the thought experiments (or their 
<br />
arithmetical godelian translation) show that we cannot, locally, or in 
<br />
a bounded finite time, make that distinction.
<br />
This explains why a philosopher like Malcolm (ref in my thesis), who 
<br />
reasons very rigorously, and who believes the theaetetical definition 
<br />
of knowledge is wrong,  is forced both to disbelieve in comp, and to 
<br />
disbelieve in consciousness in dreams (like with lucidity, but not 
<br />
necessarily).
<br />
Very interestingly, Barnes (ref in my theses) makes a similar move to 
<br />
escape Maudlin's &quot;~ comp or ~ materialism&quot; argument.  I am writing 
<br />
(albeit slowly) a paper on that for the journal of philosophy as a 
<br />
rejoinder to Maudlin and Barnes. We can come back on this later.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; ....and also Kripke frames being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the phenomena of time (I can see that they could be a model of time,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but that is another thing entirely).
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I don't remember having said that &quot;Kripke frames&quot;  *are*  the phenomena 
<br />
of times? What would that means?  All I say is that assuming comp (well 
<br />
the weak acomp) then the soul or the first person generates its 
<br />
subjective time, and that this is confirmed by the fact that the 
<br />
first-person hypostasis (the one given by the theaetetical definition 
<br />
of knowability) has a  temporal-intuitionistic logical semantics.
<br />
That this corresponds on the &quot;real subjective time&quot; for the 
<br />
self-observing machine already follows from the UDA, where 1) 
<br />
comp-practitioners does not modelize their brain with an artificial 
<br />
one, but really accept it as a new brain + 2) the non distinction 
<br />
between &quot;real&quot;, virtual and arithmetical.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; although self-reproducing systems have been known since the 1950s, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; are popularly encountered in the form of computer viruses.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The principle is really the same. That is what I show in my paper
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;amoeba, planaria, and dreaming machine&quot;. self-reproduction and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; self-awareness are a consequence of the closure of the set of partial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; computable function for the daigonalization procedure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Incidently, I read your Elsevier paper the other day. It has inspired
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; me to take a look at combinators for artificial life applications. I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discovered that Pietro Speroni di Fenizio has spent a PhD looking at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this. He was a student of Walter Banzhaf and Peter Dittrich - I met
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Walter shortly before I caught up with you in Brussels in 2003. Peter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I met in the Lausanne ECAL in 1999. Are you aware of any of this work?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; AFACT, he never achieved self-reproduction, which is a precursor to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evolution, but alas he didn't publish any of his code.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Thanks for the information. I didn't know him. But I know the work by 
<br />
Fontana and some of its followers in Artificial Chemistry, and which is 
<br />
based on  lambda calculus (the little cousin of combinatory logic).  
<br />
Lambda expressions and combinators are very useful to analyze 
<br />
computation with some fine graining (as my Elsevier paper illustrates a 
<br />
bit). But theology needs more the notion of computability (which is 
<br />
independent of the choice of formal systems) than the notion of 
<br />
computation, which is far more involved. Of course there are some 
<br />
links.
