<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;My belief is that in matters of faith, you can choose to believe or not

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;believe based on whether it suits your personal preferences.  Your example 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the Nazis  would not apply because there is overwhelming evidence that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the Nazis existed.  Perhaps it can be argued that there is meaningful 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;evidence that the God described in Sunday school class exists as well, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;however I don't think anyone would argue that the evidence for that God is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;nearly as strong as evidence of the Nazis.  As you say, religion, by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;necessity, is based on faith and therefore little to no objective evidence. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I guess your point was that if you already have the faith in something 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;without evidence, the fact that you are then taught as part of the belief 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;system that there are some aspects not very appealing should not have any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;bearing on whether you still have your faith?  I would disagree with that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in that you can have faith in something because the concept is attractive 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to you, but then lose your faith when the concept is shown to be less 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;attractive. (this was not really my situation as a child- I was never 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;really presented the opportunity to examine the faith until presented with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the teachings described in the original post).  This is not entirely 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;unrelated to the sciences.  Science has pushed into many areas into realms 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that can only tangentially, at best, be proven with objective evidence.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The MWI is a good example.  I believe in it, because I think it provides 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the most explanatory power over competing ideas. However, it would be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;difficult to fault someone for demanding more in the way of direct 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;evidence.  In a sense, there is an element of faith in such theories.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;String theory is another example.  I'm not saying these things are not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;science, just that they are theories beyond our reach to prove or disprove 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;at the present time.  Many scientists are quoted as endorsing string theory 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in part due to the elegance of the theory.  This goes with what I was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;saying above about accepting something on faith as long as it appears to be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the most attractive idea, even if it is not supported by much objective 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;evidence.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I doubt the beliefs of fundementalist Christianity will ever be absolutely 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;proven or disproven, and as a faith belief I reserve the right to discard 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it at my choosing!
</em><br />
<br />I think you are referring to that aspect of belief which has little to do 
<br />
with whether or not the belief is in accordance with reality. This is very 
<br />
common in everyday life, but it is also probably common in science or other 
<br />
supposedly objective fields of enquiry. One could even speculate that having 
<br />
&quot;faith&quot; in a scientific theory in its nascent phase - that is, believing it 
<br />
to be true with greater certainty than the available evidence warrants - is 
<br />
important in motivating the theorist to do the experimental work which will 
<br />
ultimately validate the theory to the satisfaction of the rest of the 
<br />
scientific community. This is fine, as long as we are clear that there is a 
<br />
distinction between the utility of a belief and the truth value of that 
<br />
belief. An interesting illustration of this distinction in philosophy of 
<br />
religion is &quot;Pascal's Wager&quot;. Pascal aknowledged that it is not possible to 
<br />
decide with any certainty whether God exists, but continued to ask the 
<br />
question, should we believe that God exists? If we believe that he does and 
<br />
it turns out that we are right, we gain eternal life in Heaven, while if it 
<br />
turns out we are wrong, we gain or lose nothing as a result of our false 
<br />
belief. On the other hand, if we declare ourselves atheists and are right, 
<br />
we gain or lose nothing, but if we are wrong, we end up in Hell. Therefore, 
<br />
we are better off believing that God does exist.
<br />
<br />The problem with almost all people with fundamentalist-type religious 
<br />
convictions that I have met, however, is that they are not as honest as 
<br />
Pascal was. They claim that their belief is certainly or almost certainly 
<br />
correct, and that it is based on empirical evidence, such as the historical 
<br />
record contained in the Bible. Pressed further, they might describe &quot;faith&quot; 
<br />
as a kind of religious experience which allows no more doubt about the 
<br />
existence of God than ordinary sensory experience allows doubt about the 
<br />
existence of the world - &quot;and if you had this experience, you would 
<br />
understand&quot;. If I suggest to them that they only believe because they were 
<br />
brought up that way, or because they want it to be true (and I think these 
<br />
two reasons account for the vast majority of people with religious belief in 
<br />
the world), they deny this vehemently.
<br />
<br />Returning to the point in my original post, I should have clarified it by 
<br />
saying that when it comes to the *truth* value of a belief, our attitude 
<br />
towards that belief is irrelevant. If some far future historian studying the 
<br />
legend of the Nazis in the 20th century decides that the legend is true 
<br />
simply because it would further his career if it were true, he would deserve 
<br />
the contempt of his peers. If the evidence does not allow a conclusion one 
<br />
way or the other, the correct answer is that the evidence does not allow a 
<br />
conclusion one way or the other; it is not a license to choose whatever 
<br />
conclusion takes your fancy.
<br />
<br />[Incidently, can you see the logical flaw in Pascal's Wager as described 
<br />
above?]
