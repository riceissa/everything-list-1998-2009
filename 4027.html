From: Osher Doctorow osher.domain.name.hidden, Thurs. Sept. 5, 2002 6:17PM
<br />
<br />I have now read page 2 of Yurtsever, having previous read page 1, and I must
<br />
confess that his style does not quite have the clarity of my style - his is
<br />
more like the clarity of Sigmund Freud's style  : &gt; )   However, I am happy
<br />
to see that he recognized the role of Godel's incompleteness theorem on his
<br />
page 1.
<br />
<br />On page 2, Yurtsever put the cart before the horse in a sense by telling us
<br />
what would happen if his theory turns out to be correct, but since he plans
<br />
to prove it in pages 3ff, he can be forgiven for that.   I notice in
<br />
connection with his last 2 paragraphs of page 2, which run over into the
<br />
first 2 paragraphs of page 3, that he seems to agree with Sir Roger Penrose
<br />
and me (independently - I have never met Sir Roger) that brain activity
<br />
cannot be faithfully simulated on a digital computer.  Sir Roger, by the
<br />
way, like me (I have been told) rather dislikes computers and does not (or
<br />
at least when last I heard about it) even answer email on computers.  I am
<br />
slightly different in that I both write and answer email, but I rather
<br />
dislike digital computers although I will defend to the death their right to
<br />
have their own opinions. : &gt; ).  I have not yet decided about quantum
<br />
computers, analog computers, molecular computers, laser/light computers,
<br />
etc.   My argument about brain activity is far simpler than Sir Roger's - I
<br />
derive it from mathematical fuzzy multivalued logics and their
<br />
probability-statistics and proximity function-geometry-topology analogs,
<br />
which does not make use of randomness as incompressibility or even computer
<br />
randomness at all.
<br />
<br />Speaking of randomness, I pointed out that incompressibility randomness is
<br />
only one interpretation of randomness.   To those of us who grew up and
<br />
spent at least half of our lives in the non-computer world (or at least, the
<br />
not heavily computerized world), probability and statistics vs computer
<br />
viewpoints are not quite the same thing.  When somebody in one of my
<br />
statistics classes tells me that something is random, I tend to be slightly
<br />
put off.   You see, everything is random in a sense in
<br />
probability-statistics.   Even the non-random world so-called is random,
<br />
only the probability of the random part is near or at zero - which,
<br />
strangely enough, does not mean impossible or the null set.
<br />
<br />Let me clarify the latter.   The probability of an impossible event, like
<br />
the probability of the null set, is zero.   But an uncountably number of
<br />
things have probability zero.   In n-dimensional Euclidean space or even
<br />
spaces that are rather similar to it, any n-k dimensional subset (k = 1, 2,
<br />
3, ..., n - 1) has probability zero provided that a continuous random
<br />
variable has a distribution on that space or on a volume of space containing
<br />
the events in question.   The proof is the same as the corresponding proof
<br />
for Lebesgue measure.   Moreover, the same is true for time, not such space,
<br />
since an event that occurs at only one point in time has dimension 0 in
<br />
time, and so has dimension one less than the time dimension of 1, and so the
<br />
above result holds.   So in 3-dimensional Euclidean-like space or 3+1
<br />
Euclidean-like spacetime, points, strings, planes, plane figures or their
<br />
approximations laminae, curves, lines, line segments, curve segments,
<br />
2-dimensional surfaces of 3-dimensional objects (e.g., the surface of the
<br />
human brain, the surface of a human being which is usually skin, the surface
<br />
of an organ, the surface of the earth, etc.), they all have probability 0
<br />
under the rather general assumption that a continuous random variable has a
<br />
distribution on space(-time), e.g., the Gaussian/normal distribution.
<br />
<br />The events at or near probability zero, and likewise processes of those
<br />
characteristics, are RARE EVENTS/PROCESSES (RARE EVENTS for short).
<br />
<br />Now that I have started elaborating, I will conclude with one other note of
<br />
caution.  In what might look like an Old Testament prohibition, I should say
<br />
that *ALL IS NOT IN CONCATENATED STRINGS OF SYMBOLS.*   In fact, it might be
<br />
more accurate to say that almost nothing is in strings, but that might be
<br />
misunderstood, so I restrain myself.   In my theory, which I refer to as
<br />
Rare Event Theory (RET), I distinguish between SYNTAX and SEMANTICS.  Of
<br />
course, computer people do that too, and computational linguists.   But when
<br />
push comes to shove, they mostly regard information as SYNTAX.   In order
<br />
not to confuse myself with computer people or computational linguists, I
<br />
distinguish between information, which is syntactic, and KNOWLEDGE, which is
<br />
semantic in the usual dictionary sense of MEANING - what symbols and words
<br />
and propositions and sentences MEAN.    I am not at all sure that
<br />
incompressibility captures KNOWLEDGE so much as SYNTAX.   However, we will
<br />
let that pass for now, except for the slight detail that Knowledge, Memory,
<br />
and Rare Events appear to coincide - although part of it is a well-motivated
<br />
and well-indicated conjecture.   In any case, I will continue to the
<br />
substance of page 3 rather than interrupt myself or you further.  For those
<br />
who are interested, I refer readers to my contributions to
<br />
superstringtheory.com, my paper in B. N. Kursunuglu et al (2000), to G. 't
<br />
Hooft's Holographic Principle, and to Statistical Learning Theory by Vapnik
<br />
(2000) for starters.
