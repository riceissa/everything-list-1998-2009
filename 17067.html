<br /><br />Cool.
<br />
<br />But you will have to understand that UDA is far more modest than what  
<br />
you are perhaps thinking.
<br />
I am not invoking a measure. What I argue for in UDA is just this:
<br />
<br />IF you are willing to accept the comp hyp (&quot;I am Turing emulable&quot;),  
<br />
then you have to find a relative measure on the computational  
<br />
histories and you have to derive the physical laws or the physical  
<br />
invariants from it.
<br />
<br />The goal of UDA consists only in reformulating the mind-body problem  
<br />
in the comp frame. And the new formulation of the mind-body problem is  
<br />
a &quot;pure&quot; body-problem in a &quot;pure&quot; theory of mind.
<br />
<br />I could have content myself with this, but in the seventies I was told  
<br />
that this was just an obvious argument showing that comp is false.  So  
<br />
I provided AUDA which shows that this is false. The math shows the  
<br />
&quot;body&quot; problem makes sense and is not trivial.
<br />
<br />With comp, the theory of mind is easy: it is computer science,  
<br />
especially the self-reference logic branch. The study of what sound  
<br />
machine can believe, imagine and hope for about themselves and about  
<br />
the most probable computations which bears them.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What is this measure?
</em><br />
<br />If the 3th, or 4th or 5th arithmetical hypostatic logics gives some  
<br />
reasonable Quantum Logics (like it does apparently), then the measure  
<br />
will be given ... by Gleason's theorem. It will be given uniquely by  
<br />
the trace of some density operator.
<br />
<br />If the 3th, or 4th or 5th arithmetical hypostatic logics gives some  
<br />
unreasonable Quantum Logics, doubts will be reasonably held that  
<br />
either comp is false, or that the Theaetetical definitions of  
<br />
knowledge and matter will have to be revised.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  and what does it actually predict.
</em><br />
<br /><br />At the AUDA level: everything, except geography and history. That is  
<br />
why it is easily testable in practice. It predicts everything non  
<br />
contingent, from the actual taste of a pizza to the existence and mass  
<br />
of the bosons (or comp is false).
<br />
The problem is technical. It may be possible that to predict the  
<br />
existence of the bosons, you have to actually run the UD for n steps,  
<br />
with n being a ridiculously large number (like OMEGA[OMEGA]OMEGA, if  
<br />
you remember).
<br />
But comp has not been &quot;invented&quot; to predict physical things, only to  
<br />
find a conceptually correct description of &quot;reality&quot; i.e. without  
<br />
eliminating consciousness and persons.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; As I said before, an *everything*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hypothesis is a cheap way to explain anything - unless you can  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explain why this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rather than that.  Bruno promises to be able to do that - so I'm  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; waiting to see.
</em><br />
<br />This is a gross overestimation of what I did.
<br />
The point of UDA is that if I am a machine, then I get the &quot;comp- 
<br />
everything&quot; as a result. The &quot;everything&quot; is NOT an hypothesis. It is  
<br />
more like the infinite terms in quantum filed theory. I just put them  
<br />
NOT under the rug. Some things have been already derived: like the non  
<br />
booleanity of the observable world, though.
<br />
The comp-everything is not a trivial &quot;everything&quot;. It is already  
<br />
amazing that it exists and that it can be defined mathematically  
<br />
(Church thesis, Gödel's miracle). This is the purpose of doing the  
<br />
seventh step with enough details.
<br />
<br />Computer science imposes a highly non trivial structure on its  
<br />
necessary &quot;everything like structure&quot;, with an incredible high  
<br />
redundancy of computational histories, and with amazing quantum like  
<br />
property for the observable propositions, so we can definitely  
<br />
conclude that comp leads to a new formulation of the mind body  
<br />
problem, which is scientific in the Popper sense.
<br />
<br />My thesis is much more a questioning than an answering. It is like:  
<br />
&quot;Do you realize that if we take comp seriously enough into account, we  
<br />
have to explain the appearance of bodies, space and time from the  
<br />
structure of numbers as &quot;seen&quot; by the numbers.
<br />
<br />UDA can be said to solve conceptually he consciousness/reality  
<br />
problem, but it leads to the obviously hard problem to extract the  
<br />
laws of physics, and this could be very difficult. AUDA is just a  
<br />
beginning, and I like it, because it attributes already a person to a  
<br />
machine. It is a vaccine against person elimination. We can already  
<br />
listen to the machine, that is what Gödel, Löb and Solovay really  
<br />
actually did, although perhaps not so much consciously so (at least  
<br />
for Gödel).
<br />
<br />I show only that with comp we have to reduce the mind body problem to  
<br />
an hard problem of matter.
