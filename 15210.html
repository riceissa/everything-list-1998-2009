<em class="quotelev1">&gt; True. You're tireless! (That's a complement.)

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I totally agree. But most people will just wave their arms and say,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;What do you mean? We're obviously in a physical universe. What's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problematic about that?&quot;
</em><br />
<br /><br />I think there is a reason for that. Million of years of Darwinian  
<br />
brain washing. But we can't complain, it has also been brain-building.
<br />
Note that the Greek are the first to rationally take a distance from  
<br />
that, and by this move created modern science including theology as  
<br />
the most fundamental science. But humanity was perhaps not mature  
<br />
enough, so when Aristotle reintroduced the idea that matter is basic,  
<br />
both scientist and theologian get back to it.
<br />
Of course poets and mystics know better ....
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And then the burden is back on us to explain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; why the concept of &quot;physical existence&quot; is more problematic than it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seems. Burden Tennis.
</em><br />
<br /><br />This is the reason why I have developed the Movie Graph Argument  
<br />
(hereafter MGA).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It is not a question of taste. It is a question of acknowledging use
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of logic and assumptions, and finding either hidden assumptions, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; imprecise statements or invalid argument step(s).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I see your point. But there are issues of clarity or focus, and to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some extent those are a matter of taste. I'd like to read an essay (by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anyone) that lays out a clear argument in favor of the position that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computations don't need to be implemented in order to be conscious.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Be careful with the term. The MGA is subtle and to explain it we will  
<br />
have to be more precise. For example here it is better to remember  
<br />
that only *person* are conscious. Computations are not conscious (be  
<br />
it soft or hard wired).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; believe this argument can be made without reference to Loebian
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machines, first-person indeterminacy, or teleportation thought-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiments.
</em><br />
<br /><br />MGA is a completely different thought experiment. It looks a bit like  
<br />
UDA, but it is deeply different.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I hope you don't find my criticism too annoying.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Not at all. But many in this list said it was obvious that the UD does  
<br />
not need to be run, and I remember that I thought that explaining MGA  
<br />
was not really necessary. Even you, right now, seem to agree that  
<br />
computation does not need to be implemented. This does not motivate me  
<br />
too much. The MGA is far more subtle than UDA, and it is a bit  
<br />
frustrating to explain it to people who says in advance that they  
<br />
already agree with the conclusion. Even Maudlin did complain to me  
<br />
that few people have understand its Olympia reasoning. Many confuses  
<br />
it with other type of criticism of comp.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's easy for me to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sit on the sidelines and take potshots, while you've done a lot of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; actual work. And remember that I do, in fact, believe that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computations don't need to be implemented in order to be conscious, so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you're usually preaching to the choir with me.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You see!
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; My point is that, I can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; imagine Dennett reading your posts, and saying &quot;Ok, that makes sense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *if* we accept that computations don't need to be implemented in order
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to be conscious. But I still don't see why I should believe that.&quot;
</em><br />
<br /><br />Dennett, like many &quot;naturalist&quot; is not aware that the notion of matter  
<br />
is not obvious at all. The greeks were much more aware than all those  
<br />
who followed, of the mind body problem (except Descartes and  
<br />
Malebranche). Today people thought about the &quot;consciousness&quot; problem,  
<br />
when the real trouble is in defining both mind and matter and relating  
<br />
them. And Dennett seems not to be aware that modern physics has not  
<br />
progressed at all in the &quot;hard problem of matter&quot;, on the contrary,  
<br />
modern physics (quantum physics) makes the problem of matter even  
<br />
harder (which in a sense *constitutes* a progress of course). The QM  
<br />
many worlds saves the idea that matter is something objective, but  
<br />
even the many worlds does not explain what matter is, and if it is, at  
<br />
all.
<br />
<br />Dennett gives a good criteria of what could be an explanation of  
<br />
intelligence or consciousness. It has to be something relating NON- 
<br />
INTELLIGENT (or non-conscious) entity in such a way it explains  
<br />
intelligence or consciousness. This is the basic idea behind Putnam's  
<br />
functionalism, or even computationalism (which is the belief that  
<br />
functionalism is true at least at some level of description of oneself).
<br />
<br />So, why does Dennett not ask the same for an explanation of matter.  
<br />
Matter should be explained without any use of the word matter, and so  
<br />
it should be explained by relating only ... non material entities. But  
<br />
nobody asks for that. Why? Because we are hardwired for not doubting  
<br />
matter. We take for granted that matter is made of ... matter.
<br />
<br />Now, physics, if you look at it, never uses the concept of matter. It  
<br />
is so typical in Newton physics where the material sun can become a  
<br />
&quot;material point&quot; whose only role is to attract or repulse other  
<br />
material point. Matter is explained in term of relative actions  
<br />
occurring in a space-time frame.
<br />
<br />Even today, if you ask a string theorist what a string is made of, or  
<br />
what a brane is made of, they look at you like if you are doing some  
<br />
metaphysics just for annoying them, or they begin a lengthy  
<br />
explanation where only mathematical objects appear.
<br />
<br />I am not sure physicist really believe in matter, but they fake such  
<br />
belief for evacuating what they feel to be &quot;only&quot; a philosophical  
<br />
problem, actually they try to escape the mind-body problem---except  
<br />
few philosophers, don't take what I am saying to literaly.
<br />
<br />It is only when you grasp the mind body problem, that you realize you  
<br />
have to be a bit more cautious when talking about mind *and* about  
<br />
matter.
<br />
And MGA has been invented only to explain that mechanism does not, per  
<br />
se, solve the mind-body problem. Indeed it makes the matter problem  
<br />
the *only* big problem. Mind is well taking into account by &quot;machine  
<br />
discourse&quot;, which are well taken into account by computer science and  
<br />
mathematical logic.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I guess what it comes down to is that the Movie Graph Argument on its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; own doesn't seem fully convincing to me. But it's quite possible that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't fully understand that argument. (I have my own reasons for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; believing that computations don't need to be implemented in order to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be conscious, and sometimes I think some of them are functionally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; equivalent to the MGA, but I'm not sure.) Where is the clearest
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; statement of the MGA?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Now I feel guilty. There is just no presentations of the MGA in  
<br />
English. The MGA appears the first time in my 1988 paper, written in  
<br />
french.
<br />
It appears in full detail in my &quot;Brussel's Thesis&quot;, 1994, which I have  
<br />
been obliged to write in French (by moral harassment). Then it appears  
<br />
in my PhD thesis in France, which I did begin in english, and then I  
<br />
have been force to translate in french (I have been unlucky, it was  
<br />
not harassment, but the first year of application of the &quot;Loi Toubon&quot;,  
<br />
forcing all thesis to be written in french). Note that in the two  
<br />
theses, MGA precedes UDA.
<br />
<br />In this list, I have always suggest people to read the Maudlin&quot;s paper  
<br />
1989, which develops a similar argument. Actually, some objections (by  
<br />
Barnes) to Maudlin does not work on MGA. And one objection to MGA, the  
<br />
conterfactual objection, is answered by Maudlin. It is easy to extend  
<br />
MGA 1988 a few bit so that it handles the counterfactual objection  
<br />
answered by Maudlin 1989 (and thats give the new MGA described in my  
<br />
two theses).
<br />
<br />Perhaps the time has come I explain the MGA on the list? Would you be  
<br />
interested? It seems that both you and Stathis already accept the  
<br />
conclusion. So ...
<br />
<br />Are there still people believing in the necessity of matter for  
<br />
consciousness (yet grasping UDA[1...7] ) ?
