<br /><br />You talk like if Nature necessarily exists in some primary sense, and
<br />
that math are just tools for the mind.
<br />
I am quite realist about numbers. Numbers kicks back in their own way.
<br />
<br />David Deutsch defends such type of number realism. Actually FOR
<br />
endorses the three points which defined what I called comp.
<br />
<br />And I am just saying  look, if comp is taken seriously enough we 
<br />
*have* to derive 'quantum computation' from what machines can possibly
<br />
expect from their possible consistent computational histories.
<br />
So I point on some work which *needs* to be done (and btw on some modest
<br />
parts which has been done!).
<br />
And, as gift, we get light on the mind body problem but also on the
<br />
origin of physical laws.
<br />
<br />About the &quot;finished Physical Program&quot; I agree with you, both empirists
<br />
and hard theoreticists are just nibbling the reality beast.
<br />
I wouldn't be so astonished that comp makes possible to prove the
<br />
impossibility of any unifying physical toes like if the set of
<br />
elementary entities was not closed for diagonalisation: give me your
<br />
particuls and I will show you a new one:) That is, although comp is 
<br />
ontologically &quot;anti-empirical&quot;, it is almost quite sure that comp
<br />
entails that some part of numberland can only be known by experimentation.
<br />
(both from third and first person point of view).
<br />
There will be forever machines saying as Rabi &quot;who asks for that?&quot;
<br />
<br />Would it be so astonishing for you that the fabric of reality relies
<br />
eventually on cohering sheafs of deep and sharable &quot;dreams&quot; (i.e. some 
<br />
computations viewed from abstract (platonic) machines)?
