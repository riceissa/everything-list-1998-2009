<br />Sorry, I am not a native english speaker, I don't understand

what &quot;on the level&quot; can mean (and especially with quotes).
<br />
In don't understand either what you mean by &quot;&lt;G&gt;&quot;.
<br />
<br />I think I have the same kind of feeble thinking tool as you
<br />
have. However I am not sure that common sense is of much
<br />
help for questions like &quot;why is there something?&quot;. Rather
<br />
it is likely that it would confuse us on such topics. It
<br />
simply did not evolved for that. Our common sense is more
<br />
a handicap than a good guide to understand quantum
<br />
mechanics. The situation is even worse here. My common
<br />
sense also says that to me. Of course, it does not follows
<br />
that nothing (or everythng) makes sense.

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; existence, etc. as very loaded words over here).

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Numbers do NOT add, subtract, etc., WE do it to (by,

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; NOT the numbers. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; SKIP
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; If there 'are' only numbers - it stays only numbers. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; That may be a neat world, but without us thinking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; about it. Do I miss the numberculus (I don't say:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; himunculus) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; DOING the operations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Who said that numbers do (or have to do or could do) anything?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I am not sure Bruno did and I did not. I only suggested that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; natural numbers might have to exist and their existence might
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; be enough to explain the existence of everything else. This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is very different.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So the numbers are only 'there' to explain the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence of everything else.
</em><br />
<br />I would not say that. I don't believe that numbers are &quot;there&quot;
<br />
for any purpose. They just are there (or exist). But their
<br />
existence might be all that we need to explain the (perceived)
<br />
existence of everything else.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What else must be there to provide such existence -
</em><br />
<br />We come here to the hard part of the story. My point is that
<br />
nothing else needs to be there to provide such existence (this
<br />
is a speculation indeed). I will try to keep it simple. Let's
<br />
assume that numbers exist (this is a speculation at that point),
<br />
not only natural numbers but also real numbers, Hilbert spaces
<br />
and all the &quot;higher level objects&quot; that &quot;comes with&quot;.
<br />
<br />Let's also consider the possibility that the universe in which
<br />
we live strictly follows some &quot;mathematical rules&quot; and that it
<br />
is completely determined by them (this is another speculation).
<br />
This is equivalent to say that this universe is isomorphic to
<br />
one of the above mentionned &quot;higher level objects&quot;.
<br />
<br />The last and hard point is that, from a mathematical point of
<br />
view, all the objects that are isomorphic one to another are
<br />
the same mathematical object (just as there is only one set of
<br />
natural numbers, no matter how is is built) and, if the universe
<br />
is isomorphic to a mathematical object, it could just be this
<br />
mathematical object.
<br />
<br />Let's consider an outrageously simplified view of the universe
<br />
as particles interacting with each others according to a set
<br />
of mathematical laws. The mathematical structure of the universe
<br />
is likely to be much more complex than that but the following
<br />
might still be correct when applied to a more complex structure.
<br />
<br />The problem with the idea that the universe could simply be a
<br />
mathematical object is that our common sense strongly suggest
<br />
that a physical universe has to be different from a mathematical
<br />
object because there is to be &quot;something in the particles&quot; to
<br />
&quot;make them real&quot;. We think that particles needs to have a mass,
<br />
an electric charge, ... But do they follows mathematical rules
<br />
thanks to these properties or do these properties appear as
<br />
such because they actually follows such rules? Since the
<br />
behavior of particles is determined by the mathematical rules,
<br />
what difference can make what they actually are made of? And
<br />
do they need to be made of something? Whatever they would be
<br />
made of would have no impact at all on what we see and feel
<br />
as soon as they follow the mathematical rules. All their
<br />
properties would be defined in the same way from these rules
<br />
and only from these rules and what they are made of wouldn't
<br />
have any effect at all. The &quot;substance&quot; of the particles could
<br />
very well come from the rule and only from them. We feel such
<br />
a substance but it might come from the rules and only from them.
<br />
<br />Once we have started thinking according to this point of view,
<br />
the charge of proof can be reversed. Occam's razor is here to
<br />
ask: why should there be some &quot;magical substance&quot; inside the
<br />
particles? Isn't that enough that they follow the rules? What
<br />
more could bring the presence of &quot;something else&quot; inside the
<br />
particles? What the idea of an &quot;internal substance&quot; could add
<br />
to any explanation? Isn't this idea just irrational and similar
<br />
to the concept of &quot;soul&quot; in a dualist view? Isn't even that a
<br />
kind of dualism?
<br />
<br />Last but not least: this view has the advantage that we no
<br />
longer have to wonder how it comes that particles follows the
<br />
rules, how can a particle influence another particle and so on.
<br />
The situation reversed here too. There is no more necessary
<br />
magic involved.
<br />
<br />This is the last but one speculation. The last one is that our
<br />
thinking and consciousness emerge from the operation of matter
<br />
(that particles are empty or not). This one is more common even
<br />
if not widely accepted. It might be the more puzzling one.
<br />
What can be said about it is that what needs to be explained
<br />
is not physical existence but the perception of a physical
<br />
existence. This is (much) weaker and comes quite easily from
<br />
the combination of all the previously mentionned speculations.
<br />
Indeed what we perceive comes from the &quot;structures&quot; occuring
<br />
from the applications of the rules and the same rules simply
<br />
makes what we perceive appear as a physical reality.
<br />
<br />Finally, Stephen Hawking compeletely missed the point by asking
<br />
&quot;What is it that breathes fire into the equations and makes
<br />
a universe for them to describe?&quot;. He fooled himself just as
<br />
if he asked &quot;Who created the world?&quot;. Common sense can be very
<br />
hard to escape to. There is no need for anything/anybody to
<br />
breathe fire into the equations: the fire *is* in the equations.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; which then you want to assign to the numbers? 
</em><br />
<br />I do not understand what you mean here.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What I really asked: WHAT is the operator? without one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the numbers just 'sit there as numbers.
</em><br />
<br />Not soo sure. The natural numbers jsut sit there bu so do also
<br />
the addition and multiplication as operators from NxN into N.
<br />
So do also the Hilbert space with all the operations that makes
<br />
it an Hilbert space.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Numbers do not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;decide&quot; to add up or else themselves into complex
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constructs (including 'ourselves') Do they?
</em><br />
<br />Indeed they do not but who said they did or the needed to?
<br />
The addition operator may just sit there with the natural
<br />
numbers. The couple that contains the second and the first
<br />
also just sit there as a semi-group and so on. Nobody has
<br />
to do any operation for that. All the complex constructs
<br />
just sit there. The fact that we perceive them as constructs
<br />
is related to the way we think of them. We ca exhibit some
<br />
relations between them that appear to us as construction
<br />
processes but that does not mean that they need us to just
<br />
sit there all together.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; SKIP
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I feel that gap here:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Finally, it might be that one of the (possibly very) complex
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; objects in this world of numbers just happens to host us and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; all that we see.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But do we need to actually believe in any of these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; speculations? 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I feel we have a discussion here. Do we just speculate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to entertain ourselves with unbelieved ideas, or some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of us take it seriously to speak about 'real' ideas?
</em><br />
<br />I asked the question but I did not intend to suggest that
<br />
the answer should be &quot;no&quot;. I find the above mentionned
<br />
speculations and the developments above them quite
<br />
entertaining. I am not sure that I am really willing to
<br />
believe into them but currently I did not find any better
<br />
alternative.
<br />
<br />Georges.
