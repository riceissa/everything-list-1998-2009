<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;    I struggle to find the right words to express the difficulty that I
</em><br />
see.
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;My problem is that your work ignores the computational complexity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;(NP-Completeness) of grading (defining measures) the relationships.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is due to the fact that from a first person point of view any delay
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will not been perceived. I do not pretend that complexity should always
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; been ignored, but to introduce it at the start would be ad hoc.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is no such thing as a delay in Platonia, but that is not my
<br />
point. I am trying to see how you deal with the problem of intractible
<br />
computations - as implementable given infinite resources - and how it may be
<br />
possible for measures to be defined using them. I had not considered this
<br />
application but it is intriguing. You touch on this below.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If complexity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; play a role it must be derived along with the measure on the comp
</em><br />
histories.
<br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, but is this derivation on that can be taken to exist independent of
<br />
the first person aspect of comp histories?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be one of my key difficulties. On one hand, I do not have a
<br />
problem with the idea of Platonic existence, re AR, of mathematical objects
<br />
but I do have a problem with the seeming lack of a clear explanation of how
<br />
the &quot;flow of temporality &quot; arises in the first person aspect.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that what ever our theory of Everything is, it must
<br />
explain how it is not just possible to have a &quot;flow of temporality&quot;  a
<br />
priori; it must have a non-measure zero sampling in the class of all
<br />
possible relationships between numbers - or whatever notion of Ur-object
<br />
that one uses.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personaly eschew the notion of fundamental &quot;objects&quot; and use the
<br />
Heraclitian notion of Process and fundamental, thus I see mathematical
<br />
objects - numbers, etc. - as derivative of this notion of Process. I see
<br />
Hintikka's idea of proofs as game theoretical constructs as strongly hinting
<br />
at this idea...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In &quot;Conscience &amp; Mecanisme&quot; I do make a case that Bennett notion of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; depth could play a role in order to derive the &quot;cosmological&quot; aspect of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics. Even prior a-la-Schmidhuber could play a role. But the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; methodology I advocate although it could justify the prior if needed,
</em><br />
cannot
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rely on it at the start.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree. We have to have the methodology itself as an a priori existent.
<br />
It is co-present in Platonia in your thinking, it seems to me. ;-)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     I do not see how the mere a priori existence of solutions (Integers)
</em><br />
and
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;the relationships between them (also Integers), as a priori existing
</em><br />
numbers
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;is sufficient.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We will discuss that after I succeed in explaining how the whole things
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; work. All Right?
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure! ;-)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;BM:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; The comp reason why the soul or the first person is never captured by
</em><br />
any
<br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; complete third person description is akin to the reason truth and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; knowledge are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; not arithmetizable (as opposed to provable and consistent).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Godel's theorem &amp; Co. makes universal machine a highly non trivial
</em><br />
type of
<br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; being.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;[SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     Does not this statement, that  &quot;truth and knowledge are not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;arithmetizable&quot;, imply that the postulation of AR is insufficient?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [BM]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No. And giving that Godel's incompleteness is true for much more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; general things than machine, we can say not only that arithmetical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; truth is not arithmetizable, but mathematical truth is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematicalizable, physical truth is not physicalizable, and more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generally [whatever]-truth is not [whatver]izable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So strictly speaking AR could be sufficient (the Pythagorean version
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of my thesis). For reason of simplicity I do not use it.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait a minute! It is one thing to say that &quot;[whatever]-truth is not
<br />
[whatver]izable&quot; and it is another to say that [whatever]-truth is finitely
<br />
constructible or approximatable. The former deals with its existential
<br />
aspects and the latter deals with its meaningfulness and expressiveness. We
<br />
do not require absoluteness (truth, decidability or otherwise) in our
<br />
interactions to be able to have meaningfulness.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is not problematic to me; I am interested in how physicality
<br />
MUST obtain, even if only in the first person sense. In fact, in my work I
<br />
anly assume first person physicality - there is no such thing as third
<br />
person or &quot;objective&quot; physicality. This is where our idea overlap
<br />
strongly.;-)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Let me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;state this in a different way. How does Digital Substitution ( &quot;yes,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Doctor&quot; ) get coded into numbers without involving physical
</em><br />
implementation?
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [BM]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But that's the point of the whole work. Now, if you have follow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a little bit the literature on the mind body problem you surely know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that nobody has succeed in explaining how a private mind can be attached
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to anything third-person describable, be it physical or mathematical.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; All what I say is that if we survive the digital brain substitution, then
</em><br />
any
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fundamental explanation of what matter *cannot* rely on anything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like Aristotelian substances or even to anything *primitively* physical.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; With comp the mind-body problem is just two times more difficult in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense that we must explain not only the mind but also the matter, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this from the mind. The UDA (alias the 1-8 reasoning) just show that:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comp *must* explain matter by a mind theory. Wait perhaps I say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more to Kory so that you can be made your objection more specific.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been following your discussion with Kory (and all others)
<br />
closely.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an attempt to &quot;put all my cards on the table&quot; I will state that my
<br />
idea is a kind of process based mind-body dualism (based on Vaughan Pratt's
<br />
work <a href="http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/pratt95rational.html">http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/pratt95rational.html</a>), but one that becomes
<br />
very similar to Russell's &quot;neutral monism&quot; in the limit of &quot;the Totality of
<br />
Existence&quot;, which I believe is the same as your Platonia, e.g. an
<br />
&quot;asymptotically vanishing dualism. I do not see Platonia as being &quot;mental&quot;
<br />
or &quot;mind&quot;, ala a new form of Berkeliean Idealism.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Best regards,
