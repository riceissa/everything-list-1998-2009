</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would work.)
</em><br />
<br />Yes, I see that that is true.  I think it points to a problem with some
<br />
of the simple conceptualizations of measure, about which I will say
<br />
more below.But let me ask if you agree that considering Conway's 2D
<br />
Life world with simply-specified initial conditions as in your example,
<br />
that conscious life would be extraordinarily rare?
<br />
<br />I want to say, vastly more rare than in our universe, but of course we
<br />
don't know how rare life actually is in our universe, so that may be a
<br />
hard claim to justify.  But the point is that our universe has stable
<br />
structures; it has atoms of dozens of different varieties, which can form
<br />
uncountable millions of stable molecules.  It has mechanisms to generate
<br />
varieties of these different molecules and collect them together in
<br />
environments where they can react in interesting ways.  We don't have a
<br />
full picture of how life and consciousness evolved, but looking around,
<br />
it doesn't seem like it should have been THAT hard, which is where the
<br />
Fermi paradox comes from.  In many ways, our universe seems tailor made
<br />
for creating observers.
<br />
<br />In contrast, in the Life world there are no equivalents to atoms or
<br />
molecules, no chemical reactions.  It's too chaotic; there's not enough
<br />
structure.  Replicators and life seem to require a balance between
<br />
chaos and stasis, and Life is far too dynamic.  It just looks to me
<br />
like it would be almost impossible for replicators to arise naturally.
<br />
Almost impossible, but not absolutely impossible, so if you tried enough
<br />
initial conditions as you suggest, it would happen.  I won't belabor
<br />
this argument unless you disagree about the ease with which life might
<br />
arise in a Life universe, and consciousness evolve.
<br />
<br />And the main point is that these are exactly the kinds of considerations
<br />
which Tegmark discusses.  Issues of stability of the building blocks
<br />
of life, of providing the right amounts and kinds of interactions.
<br />
These physics-like considerations are precisely the correct issues to
<br />
consider in looking at how easily observers will arise, and that is
<br />
Tegmark's point.
<br />
<br />I haven't read Tegmark's paper in detail recently, and to the extent
<br />
that his arguments are based on string theory or QM then I would agree
<br />
that those are too parochial.  But as I recall he had a number of broad
<br />
arguments that would apply even to a Life-like universe.
<br />
<br />Now I'll get back to the question above about measure.  There are
<br />
universes, as in your example, where life is intrinsically unlikely,
<br />
but if you make the universe large enough, and provide all possible
<br />
initial conditions for finite-sized regions, then in all that vastness,
<br />
somewhere life will exist.
<br />
<br />The problem is, this is not too different from separately implementing
<br />
alternate, smaller versions of that universe, with different initial
<br />
conditions for each, so that all possible initial conditions are tried
<br />
in some universe.  A small fraction of those universes will have life.
<br />
To specify just one of the life-containing universes will typically
<br />
take a lot of information, while specifying all of the universes takes
<br />
less information.
<br />
<br />This is analogous to the even broader picture of the &quot;universal
<br />
dovetailer (UD)&quot; program, the program that runs all programs (on all
<br />
initial conditions).  It's a very small program, yet it creates all
<br />
possible universes.  Even universes with incredibly complex laws of
<br />
physics and initial conditions are created by this extremely small
<br />
UD program.  Does this mean that all universes have the same measure,
<br />
and it is large, since this small program creates them?
<br />
<br />The answer has to be no.  It's not enough to find a small program which
<br />
generates a desired structure, somewhere in the vastness that it creates.
<br />
Otherwise all integers would have the same complexity because they are
<br />
all created by a simple counting program.
<br />
<br />Wei Dai once suggested a heuristic that the measure of a structure ought
<br />
to have two components: the size of the program that creates it; and the
<br />
size of a program which locates it in the output of the first program.
<br />
By this argument, you could have a big program which output just the
<br />
structure in question, which was then located by a trivial one; or you
<br />
could have a small program which output the structure among a vastness,
<br />
which then required a big program to locate it.  Either way, the
<br />
structure has a large measure.
<br />
<br />This was the motivation for the idea I proposed a few days ago, that
<br />
for applying anthropic reasoning, a universe should get a &quot;bonus&quot; if
<br />
it had a high density of observers, rather than merely a high absolute
<br />
number of them.  It's too easy to create universes with low-density
<br />
observers, as your example of Life suggests.  But just as the existence
<br />
of a counting program does not give a typical integer a low complexity,
<br />
so the existence of universes that are simple but contain super-rare
<br />
life forms should not give those observers a high measure.
