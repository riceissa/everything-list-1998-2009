<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a somewhat vaguely defined set of ``self-consistent mathematical

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;structures,'' implying provability of some sort. The postings of Bruno

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Marchal and George Levy and Hal Ruhl also focus on what's provable and

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;what's not.
</em><br />
<br />You know that Hal Ruhl doesn't distinguish computability and provability, 
<br />
so
<br />
it is open for me if his approach is nearer your's or mine.
<br />
<br />The difference relies more between averaging on the (local) set
<br />
of consistent extensions defined in the whole UD*, or  finding a priori
<br />
defining universes probabilities, or Universal prior.
<br />
<br />I communicate with the sound lobian machine because I agree (in 
<br />
arithmetic)
<br />
with the laws of exclude middle, and all classical logic.
<br />
Provable plays the role of thoroughly verifiable &quot;scientific&quot;
<br />
communication. (BTW *you* were the guy asking for formalisation!). Now
<br />
we are working at the metalevel (as George aptly remarks) and we will 
<br />
interview the machine on its self-reference abilities. Recall the goal 
<br />
consists in translating  UDA in a language interpretable by a sound UTM.
<br />
And UDA is a self-referential thought experiment.
<br />
<br />It will happen that the incompleteness phenomenon will force us to
<br />
take into account the nuance between []p and ([]p &amp; p) and 
<br />
([]p &amp; &lt;&gt;p) in the discourse of the machine. They will correspond to 
<br />
provable p, 
<br />
knowable p, probability(p)=1. 
<br />
Knowable will give rise to intuitionist logic and probability 1 will give
<br />
quantum logic.
<br />
<br />Probability(p) 1 will really be no more that 1) there is consistent 
<br />
extension,
<br />
2) p is true in all those consistent extension. (Only in an ideal frame
<br />
we have []p -&gt; &lt;&gt;p, remember that in the cul-de-sac world []p is always 
<br />
true).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Is provability really relevant?  Philosophers and physicists find
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it sexy for its Goedelian limits. But what does this have to do with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the set of possible universes?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Wait and see. Remember I told George we have not yet really 
<br />
beging the proof. The hard and tiedous thing is to arithmetise
<br />
the provability predicate.
<br />
I will define knowledge and &quot;observable&quot; (in the UDA sense)
<br />
&nbsp;*in* the language of the machine and I will show that the observable
<br />
propositions obeys some quantum logic. I will only consider the case
<br />
observable with a probability one. This will give a concrete 
<br />
purely arithmetical interpretation of a quantum logic.
<br />
The probabilities are taken on the set of relative consistent 
<br />
(UD accessible) extensions, and by consistent I just mean &quot;-[]-&quot;
<br />
with [] Goedel's provability predicate. (so you can guess the
<br />
role of provability).
<br />
The UD will be translated in the form of the set of 
<br />
all (true) \Sigma_1 sentences.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Is provability really relevant?  Philosophers and physicists find
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it sexy for its Goedelian limits. But what does this have to do with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the set of possible universes?
</em><br />
<br /><br />It has to do with the origin of the belief in universe(s) once
<br />
we bet we do survive digital substitution. 
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I believe the provability discussion distracts a bit from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;real issue. If we limit ourselves to universes corresponding to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;traditionally provable theorems then we will miss out on many formally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and constructively describable universes that are computable in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;limit yet in a certain sense soaked with unprovable aspects.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Actually, provability is just a step in my derivation (and we have still
<br />
not begin to discusse it! nor to define it). We have just seen some 
<br />
modal logic which have a priori nothing to do with provability.
<br />
You are still anticipating.
<br />
<br />It is a good thing you are open to unprovable aspects, and it makes 
<br />
weirder you are not open to uncomputable aspects. (Although I know
<br />
provability is relative and computability is absolute (Church's Thesis)
<br />
Do you really believe than one of us limit &quot;universes&quot; to sets of provable
<br />
theorems. I am myself just defining the local *discourse* of a 
<br />
machine-scientist.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Such a virtual reality or universe is perfectly well-defined.  At some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;point each history prefix will remain stable forever.  Even if we know p
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and q, however, in general we will never know for sure whether some q(n)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that is still zero won't flip to 1 at some point, because of Goedel etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So this universe features lots of unprovable aspects.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I have no problem with that. As you should know from our earlier
<br />
discussion. Remember that the big role in my work comes from 
<br />
(G* minus G), which
<br />
is a logic of the *unprovable* statements. G ang G* will be defined
<br />
formally soon, but you can also consult Solovay 1976 or Boolos ...
<br />
By logic here I mean a well defined set (of formulas) logically
<br />
closed for modus ponens.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Note also that observers evolving within the universe ...
</em><br />
<br /><br />The UDA shows that such an expression has no meaning.
<br />
The movie graph (or Maudlin's Olympia) illustrates how non trivial
<br />
the &quot;mind-body&quot; problem is with comp.
<br />
I am aware there is something very hard to swallow here. 
<br />
But it is a consequence of comp. 
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; ...may write
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;books about all kinds of unprovable things; they may also write down
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;inconsistent axioms; etc. All of this is computable though, since the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;entire universe history is.  So again, why should provability matter?
</em><br />
<br /><br />It matters for the same reason which makes you proving theorems
<br />
in your papers. Proving is just a polite way to communicate 
<br />
third person propositions.
<br />
You believe that we are modelising universes with proofs, when
<br />
we are just interviewing sound machines on their possible extension 
<br />
in UD*. 
<br />
<br />If we are sound machines, it is natural to be interested in what those
<br />
sound machines can prove about themselves, what they can know about 
<br />
themselves, what part of themselves they can observe, and on which 
<br />
computational consistent extensions they can bet, etc.
<br />
All the term in the preceding sentence will be formally defined and 
<br />
tranlated in arithmetic (the language of a sound UTM I will use).
<br />
The conclusion will be independent of the language chosen.
<br />
