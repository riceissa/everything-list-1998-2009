<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Actually, the real axiom is a self-duplicability principle. According

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; correct and even complete, at the propositional level, for many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;gods&quot; (non emulable entities). The theology of the machine van be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; lifted to almost all &quot;self-duplicable&quot; entities (but the proofs get
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; more complex). It applies to most of the &quot;gods&quot; I mentioned in some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; post. You have to go very near the big unnameable for getting rid of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the completeness of G/G* propositional theology. This was seen by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Solovay (with other terms).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Or you have to postulate we are much less than universal machine,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; which is just &quot;obviously false&quot;, imo.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; This is a weakness, it means we can only test a very general
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; principle. Most gods have similar physical realities, they have the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; same observable. Physics become a very strong invariant, it is stable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; for many non recursive permutations. But it is real hard math to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; handle all this material.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Actually, comp itself has a huge spectrum according to the choice of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; substitution level. Transfinite weakenings of the notion of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; substitution level can help to extend most comp consequence on those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; weakenings. But this could be only of academical interest, I don't  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; know.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I am not sure I would say &quot;yes&quot; to a doctor who does propose me an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; actual infinite brains.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Actually, I find much of the above VERY hard to follow except in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; vague way.
</em><br />
<br />The problem is that the negation of COMP is a very vague and multiple  
<br />
notion.
<br />
All what I say is that most of the consequence of COMP remains true  
<br />
for most precise technical weakening of the comp hyp.
<br />
Unless you weaken so much comp that you lost the self-duplicability  
<br />
property: you say no to all possible doctors.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Would it be possible, as an accompaniment of your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; step-by-step exposition of the UD in detail, to also give a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; step-by-step storyline of the above, but with the absolutely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; irreducible minimum of reliance on the deeper (i.e. very hard for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ingnorami like me to access) technicalities.  You could say, for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; example, at any point &quot;to go further you would need a deeper grasp of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; x, but for now, it has this or that role or function in the overall
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; story&quot; - or something like that.  I'd be very grateful - and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attentive.
</em><br />
<br />I think that you have already understood that this will just lead back  
<br />
to an unsolved mind-body problem.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We talked in the past of a grandmother version or roadmap - do you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recall?  I've got a feeling that you sometimes wonder if you may let
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; us - or yourself - down by *not* going into all the detail all the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time, but the problem - at least for me - is that my memory isn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; retentive enough to retain the pivotal elements of the narrative
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whilst we charge off on the next - no doubt essential - safari into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the logical-mathematical jungle.  But could we try grandma's version
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; again?  Even heroic failure would teach us something.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Let me define two notions of first person indeterminacies.
<br />
<br />There is the local one, when your current state is duplicated  
<br />
relatively to earth, or me (say) . This is done in the first sixth  
<br />
steps of the UD reasoning.
<br />
&nbsp;From some of your post I can suspect that there is something perhaps  
<br />
still unclear there.
<br />
<br />In the Washington/Moscow duplication, the *you* arriving in Moscow  
<br />
(resp. Washington) provably cannot understand why he is the one  
<br />
arriving in Moscow (Washington). It is the same question as the one  
<br />
you asked me: &quot;why am I me and not my brother&quot;. It is trivial, with  
<br />
comp. No program can predict which backup, among two, will be the one  
<br />
being re-instantiated, relatively to its most probable history/ 
<br />
computation.
<br />
<br /><br />Then there is the global first person indeterminacy, which appears at  
<br />
step 7, although it is &quot;definitely there&quot; with the step 8. It is the  
<br />
indeterminacy of your immediate subjective future &quot;in front&quot; of a  
<br />
never ending universal dovetailing. At that step, assuming (or not  
<br />
with step 8) a concrete universal dovetailing in the universe (or in  
<br />
arithmetic) you should understand that you are duplicated &quot; at each  
<br />
instant&quot;, so that your future subjective instant is determined by an  
<br />
infinity of computations: all those (existing in the U dovetailing)  
<br />
going through your actual states. So, in order to attach your mind to  
<br />
a physical appearance, you have to justify the physical appearances  
<br />
from an infinite set of computational histories. OK?
<br />
The physical reality can no more be just a mathematical structure  
<br />
among others. There may or may not exist such a structure, but in any  
<br />
case this structure or quasi-structure has to result from the  
<br />
statistical &quot;interference&quot; of an infinity of computations.
<br />
<br />AUDA illustrates the consistency of such an idea, and provides a  
<br />
technical way to extract already the logic of the observable events.  
<br />
But AUDA is far more demanding in logico-mathematical technicalities.
<br />
<br />AUDA is UDA, where the &quot;yes doctor&quot; is replaced by a &quot;direct&quot;  
<br />
interview of a correct self-introspecting universal machine.
<br />
<br />Somehow, what I am saying in AUDA is that, thanks to the work of  
<br />
Gödel, Löb, Solovay, etc., we can already have a talk with the  
<br />
universal machine and ask her opinion, and what &quot;her&quot; physics looks  
<br />
like.
<br />
<br />Then it is a rather technical point to show that by adding non  
<br />
computational power to such a universal machine will not change the  
<br />
AUDA interview, unless you bring necessarily vague ad hoc &quot;non comp&quot;  
<br />
feature build for changing the interview. If a universal machine bet  
<br />
that God create earth and heaven in six days and that she is not  
<br />
duplicable, well, it becomes hard to even argue if the AUDA physics  
<br />
will change or not.
<br />
<br />Hope this &quot;heroic failure&quot; can help the grandma a little bit,
<br />
<br />Bruno
