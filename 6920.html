<br />
I sometimes get into arguments with anti-science associates, who are into 
<br />
wholism, mysticism, spiritualism and so forth. They think that scientists 
<br />
are an elite with their own brand of 'ism (scientism, perhaps), which is no 
<br />
more valid than these other 'isms. I point out to these people that if they 
<br />
have figured out they have to open their mouth in order to put food in it, 
<br />
turn a handle to open a door, vibrate their vocal cords to make a sound, 
<br />
then they have performed a scientific experiment and abstracted a theory 
<br />
from it. If science is an 'ism, it's the most basic one in the world.

<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Of course science arose out of explaining
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; subjective experiences.  The basic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; theory of science (and common sense) is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that there is some mind-independent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reality out there.  When I see green
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; grass and an object that [who] is similar
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to me and that object says, &quot;I see green
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; grass.&quot; then I take that as evidence that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the object is person with experiences like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me and that there really is green grass.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Well, it's a very reasonable *conjecture*, I'd suggest.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It seems like that sort of conclusion has worked very,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;very well in the past.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Science is just common-sense writ large.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; How *very* true. [I want to rant] against the doctrine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; of the scientific method!!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;the scientific method&quot; - the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; hypothetico-deductive method?  So far as I know all the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; methods of science are just common sense applied carefully
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and thoroughly.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Yes, and that's *all* they are: just ordinary common sense applied,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;as you say, carefully and thoroughly.  It's what Galileo and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Kepler did.  Sure, Kepler would come up with wild conjectures
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(or at least ones that we think of as wild today), and some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;were right and some were wrong. He usually respected valid
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;criticism, (although everyone's ego gets in the way from time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to time).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;A good detective or a good housewife does exactly the same.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The detective formulates a theory that he hopes explains the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;crime, and goes about (usually with a bias) looking for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;evidence that supports his theory.  The housewife guesses
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and guesses at the best way to remove stains from various
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;articles in the house, and by &quot;applying common sense carefully
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and rationally&quot; gets closer and closer to the truth.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;All was well until the philosophers stepped in.  They looked
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;at what Galileo, Newton, Kepler, and Lavoisier did, and began
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to think about it.  Unfortunately.  They abstracted from what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;all these worthies were doing a so-called &quot;scientific method&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It had five steps.  Well, it did when I was in school.  To
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;execute the scientific method, you follow those steps. Even as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a child I was skeptical (rather, it just didn't do anything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;for me) because I fancied that in my understandings of astronomy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I was already a scientist.  Sort of.  A junior scientist, at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;least.  And what I did and what I learned didn't have anything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to do with all this fancy stuff.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Next the philosophers evolved this doctrine into Scientism, so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that they could look down their noses at the thoughts of many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;other people and pronounce them &quot;unscientific&quot;.  This was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;strange, since the other people were for the most part using
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the same genetically originated homo sapiens type thinking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that the real scientists were.  But it was good propaganda,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and it enabled them to put pressure on textbook publishers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;so as to curtail the spread of opinions that they disagreed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with. (It was the 20th century, after all.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Fortunately, another philosopher (Popper) came to the rescue,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and so far as I know, didn't talk much about the Method. He
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;described what people were doing---scientists, detectives,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;housewives, animals---as making conjectures and learning from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;their mistakes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But in the schools it's still taught that there is a Scientific
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Method, and that's what makes scientists' opinions better than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the non-credentialed.  (The scientists usually *do* have better
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;opinions, but only because they've studied something longer or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have been more careful, as you write, not because they use a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Method.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;You wanna teach a kid how to be a scientist?  Just have him
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;or her look into some subject matter in detail where there is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the possibility of obtaining a unified understanding, or there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is the possibility of performing experiments.  Save him from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;pedantic doctrines, such as &quot;The Scientific Method&quot;.
