<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Stephen writes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     I really do not want to be a stick-in-the-mud here, but what do we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; base
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the idea that &quot;copies&quot; could exist upon?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is a conjecture called &quot;functionalism&quot; (or one of its close variants).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I guess the &quot;strong AI&quot; view is that the mind can be emulated on a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computer. And yes, just because many people believe this---not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; surprisingly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; many computer scientists---does not make it true.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware of those ideas and they seem, at least to me, to be supported 
<br />
by an article of Faith and not any kind of empirical evidence. Maybe that is 
<br />
why I have such an allergy to the conjecture. ;-)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;[LC]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; An aspect of this belief is that a robot could act indistinguishably
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from humans. At first glance, this seems plausible enough; certainly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; many early 20th century SF writers thought it reasonable. Even Searle
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concedes that such a robot could at least appear intelligent and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thoughtful to Chinese speakers.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I suspect that Turing also believed it: after all, he proposed that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a program one day behave indistinguishably from humans. And why not,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exactly?  After all, the robot undertakes actions, performs calculations,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has internal states, and should be able to execute a repertoire as fine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as that of any human.  Unless there is some devastating reason to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contrary.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I seem to rest my skepticism upon is the fact that in all of these 
<br />
considerations there remains, tacitly or not, the assumption that these 
<br />
&quot;internal states&quot; have an entity &quot;to whom&quot; they have a particular valuation. 
<br />
I see this expressed in the MWI, more precisely, in the &quot;relative state&quot; way 
<br />
of thinking within an overall QM multiverse. Additionally, we are still 
<br />
embroiled in debate over the sufficiency of a Turing Test to give us 
<br />
reasonable certainty to claim that we can reduce 1st person aspects from 3rd 
<br />
person, Searle's Chinese Room being one example.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; What if &quot;I&quot;, or any one else's 1st person aspect, can not be copied?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; If the operation of copying is impossible, what is the status of all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of these thought experiments?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I notice that many people seek refuge in the &quot;no-copying&quot; theorem of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; QM. Well, for them, I have that automobile travel also precludes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; survival.  I can prove that to enter an automobile, drive it somewhere,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and then exit the automobile invariably changes the quantum state of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the person so reckless as to do it.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come on, Lee, your trying to evade the argument. ;-)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [LC]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If someone can teleport me back and forth from work to home, I'll
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be happy to go along even if 1 atom in every thousand cells of mine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doesn't get copied. Moreover---I am not really picky about the exact
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bound state of each atom, just so long as it is able to perform the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; role approximately expected of it. (That is, go ahead and remove any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; carbon atom you like, and replace it by another carbon atom in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different state.)
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you care to look into teleportation, as it has been researched so 
<br />
far, it has been shown that the &quot;original&quot; - that system or state of a 
<br />
system - that is teleported is not copied like some Xerox of an original 
<br />
document.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/quantuminfo/teleportation/">http://www.research.ibm.com/quantuminfo/teleportation/</a>
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such can not be done because *all* of the information about the system 
<br />
or state must be simultaneously measured and that act itself destroys the 
<br />
original. If *all* of the information is not measured, then one is not 
<br />
copying or teleporting, one is just measurering. This is not overly 
<br />
complicated!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     If, and this is a HUGE if, there is some thing irreducibly quantum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; mechanical to this &quot;1st person aspect&quot; then it follows from QM that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; copying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is not allowed. Neither a quantum state nor a &quot;qubit&quot; can be copied 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; destroying the &quot;original&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is being awfully picky about permissible transformations. I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have even survived mild blows to the head, which have enormously
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; changed my quantum state.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, you are begging the point! The impact of air molecules change 
<br />
one's quantum state! Perhaps we are stuck on this because we are assuming a 
<br />
&quot;still frame by still frame&quot; kind of representation of the situation. The 
<br />
quantum state of a system is continuously changing, that is why there is a 
<br />
variable &quot;t&quot; in the Schroedinger eqation for a wavefunction! I am commenting 
<br />
about the absurdity of copying the quantum mechanical system itself, or some 
<br />
subset or trace of it, other that that implied by the rules of QM.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; falsified, by the same experiments that unassailably imply that Nature 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; at its core, Quantum Mechanical and not Classical and thus one wonders: 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;Why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; do we persist in this state of denial?&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Probably for the same reason that some people continue to be Libertarians.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's a belief thing---the way you see the world.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure, and I hope that even Liberals can admit to errors in their beliefs 
<br />
when presented with evidence and reasonable arguments to the contrary of the 
<br />
assumptions within their beliefs. It is when people engage in active denial 
<br />
of matters of fact that persons like myself wonder about them. ;-)
