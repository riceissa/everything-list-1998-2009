<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Generally, I don't think the same logic applies to copying a mind in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;single universe than to splitting of worlds in the MWI.  Copying a mind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;will double its measure, while splitting one leaves it alone.  That is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;significant practical and philosophical difference.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Doubles its measure relative to who? If I am copied while my friend is not, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perhaps it makes sense that my measure is doubled relative to his. But what 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if our entire planet, or entire local region of the universe, was copied? 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The relative measure of any two people would not be changed, it seems. 
</em><br />
<br />Copying this much would eliminate most of the practical problems, in
<br />
terms of how many wives or how much money you would end up with.  But it
<br />
is important to understand that this is an extremely IMpractical thought
<br />
experiment.  To the extent that we are focusing on practical issues
<br />
we ought to try to stick to at least somewhat plausible experiments.
<br />
Copying a person will perhaps be feasible someday, especially if he is an
<br />
AI or uploaded person who runs as a computer program.  Such people will
<br />
have to deal with the practical as well as philosophical considerations
<br />
around potential duplication every day.  Copying an entire galaxy seems
<br />
physically infeasible and is not something that our descendants are
<br />
likely to have to deal with.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps you could say that the measure of observer-moments that take place 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; after the the copying is higher than the measure of observer-moments that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; take place before it, but I'm not sure that'd be true either, it really 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; depends on what your theory is about how measure should be assigned to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different observer-moments.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, I would say this.  It is a standard prediction of the MWI (to the
<br />
extent that the MWI is standard!).  Measure has a certain definition
<br />
in this flavor of QM, such that when a universe splits its measure is
<br />
reduced in each of the branches.  Activities which take place within a
<br />
universe (neglecting irrelevant splits) do not get their measured reduced.
<br />
<br />We use a similar concept of measure in the AUH (all universe hypothesis).
<br />
Schmidhuber defines the inverse exponential of the length of the
<br />
computer program to generate a universe as its measure.  If we think
<br />
of a universe splitting a la the MWI within the framework of the AUH,
<br />
the new universe(s) require more information to specify them, namely
<br />
the outcome of the coin flip or whatever it was that caused the split.
<br />
This additional information reduces the measure of the universes by
<br />
making their information description longer.  If there is no split and
<br />
simply a duplication of some subset, this could happen in a deterministic
<br />
universe and there would be no change in the measure.  The result is that
<br />
universe splitting reduces measure while subset duplication does not.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Part of the problem is you seem to be assuming 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure can somehow be derived from the number of physical copies in a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; single universe, whereas I lean more towards the view that a TOE would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ultimately be stated simply in terms of observer-moments and the measure on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; each, with the appearance of a &quot;physical universe&quot; just being a consequence 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the particular types of observer-moments that have higher measure. So it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seems that it partly depends whether one believes the third-person 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perspective or the first-person perspective is more fundamental. (Although 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even if you take the first-person perspective as more basic, you'd need more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of a fleshed-out theory of how the appearance of an objective physical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe comes about to say for sure whether copying a mind in a single 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe is the same or different from many-worlds splitting.)
</em><br />
<br />I would say that the first person view is consistent with Schmidhuber's
<br />
approach as well as the MWI.  Both of these models define a measure
<br />
over observer moments that can in principle be calculated precisely.
<br />
This then determines what we are likely to see and experience.
<br />
