From: Russell Standish &lt;R.Standish.domain.name.hidden&gt;
<br />
[JM:]
<br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Again, this is clearly the same argument that I made, and that Wei
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Dai made for a different reason, that the set of all Turing programs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; should lead to the appearance of simple physical laws.  It helps to
</em><br />
have,
<br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; as in the Turing case, an 'end of program' symbol; the rest of the
</em><br />
string
<br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; after this is functionless.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;[AM:]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The scheme I have described is different in that it does not necessitate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; TM's - all the computational-based
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; explanations for simple physical laws that I have seen have tended to
</em><br />
rely
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; on the specific mechanism of a sequential TM processor ('program stop'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; codes, loop-backs and so on). As you stated in our last discussion
</em><br />
(11/7),
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; only *some* mathematical structures are TM's, and one would need first
</em><br />
to
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; show that TM's were the most prolific way of generating universes out of
</em><br />
all
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; possible such structures before any of these ideas could be given good
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; credance. (From what you have said before it doesn't seem to me that you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; hold that *only* TM's are suited to generating consciousnesses - but no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; doubt you will tell me if I am wrong in this surmisal.) All this however
</em><br />
is
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; not to say that TM's may not provide a useful analytical tool in this
</em><br />
area.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; All axiomatical mathematical systems can be encoded as bit strings,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with the rules of symbol manipulation encoded as the rules of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Turing machine, and the all the output strings are theorems.
</em><br />
<br />I think it is important to clarify here the difference between the two
<br />
potential applications of TM's (there are others of course).
<br />
<br />Case 1) In my interpretation of Jacques Mallah's ideas from some of his
<br />
posts, TM's form a subset of all possible mathematical structures. Assuming
<br />
that TM's could somehow generate universes, then program loops and so on
<br />
might be able to explain the simple physical laws in most of these kinds of
<br />
universes. However it would have to be shown that the measure of these
<br />
universes was higher than those from any other possible subset of
<br />
mathematical structures.
<br />
<br />Case 2) A TM generates theorems from axioms, as you describe above. Note we
<br />
are talking about one particular TM here (or perhaps a subset of possible
<br />
ones, dependent on the precise definition of the TM) - an inference engine.
<br />
This is possibly useful as an analytical tool, but to play any (and the
<br />
only) actual role
<br />
in the production of universes it would have to counter the challenge of
<br />
'why that particular TM with that particular set of machine instructions
<br />
(Modus Ponens/substitutivity or whatever) and no other generative entity?'
<br />
(I come back to the case of all possible TM's below). Note also that 'loop
<br />
back' arguments will not apply to a program with fixed (inference)
<br />
instructions.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; However,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not all valid TM and initial bitstrings can be represented by a consistent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical system (a computer scientist might like to comment on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this assertion?)
</em><br />
<br />This seems clearly wrong to me (any tape sequence is in principle physically
<br />
(and so mathematically) realisable - unless you are asserting the
<br />
mathematical un-modellability of our universe, which takes us into a whole
<br />
new ball game) - I am guessing that what you really mean here is that in
<br />
general TM's can do more than just generate theorems (and so mathematical
<br />
structures) from axioms, and so (to continue to what you say below) are more
<br />
'basic'.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Therefore, the all TM bitstring model is more general than the all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical structure model.
</em><br />
<br />(If my guess above is correct, then this conclusion hardly follows,
<br />
otherwise brains, analogue computers and pre-programmed micro-chips
<br />
(which could also churn out theorems from axioms given simple inference
<br />
rules, as well as outputting other things) would also be more 'basic'.)
<br />
We are back here with what I think you are advocating - a *basic*
<br />
all-possible TM scheme. An incidental point to be made here is that the
<br />
scheme I have introduced can also be deemed to be more basic than
<br />
mathematical structures - it starts with symbol strings (which could be bit
<br />
strings), only some of which are wff's suitable for formal systems. But a
<br />
more important point is that any set of sequential TM processes (necessary
<br />
to invoke the advantages of loops etc) is itself a logical structure
<br />
(definable by a formal system), and for it to be considered to have any (and
<br />
the only) ontological/platonic role in the generation of universes (as
<br />
opposed to specific TM subsets being used as modelling tools), it must
<br />
be able to counter the charge  'why is the (wider) universe endowed with
<br />
that particular logical structure (and no other)?'
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Your argument would appear to work if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you asserted the essential mathematical nature of the universe, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fails miserably in the TM bitstring case.
</em><br />
<br />If you are referring to the argument I gave in response to Jacques Mallah, I
<br />
hope I have responded sufficiently, but if you are referring to the argument
<br />
in my original post in this thread, please say why you think it fails.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  However, we have already
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; worked out the solution to the TM bitstring case (see the conversation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between myself and Chris Maloney earlier in the archives).
</em><br />
<br />What thread/date is this? If by chance you are mistaking me for Chris
<br />
(heaven forbid :), the scheme we worked on a few months back necessitated
<br />
neither TM's nor loops; however a more careful explication of it (see my web
<br />
pages) turned out to be rather long-winded, hence the new (conciser) scheme,
<br />
certainly bearing similarities to our one, but not dependent upon bits or
<br />
K-specifications.
