&nbsp;Hi George,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I see your point. Brandon Carter expressed recently the same idea, it 
<br />
seams, when noting that Quantum Mechanics
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;suggests to him that &quot;objective reality is NOT a realistic objective&quot;. 
<br />
Perhaps, but that hardly implies that &quot;subjective
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;reality&quot; is any more realistic as an scientific objective, I am 
<br />
afraid! If the &quot;I&quot; maps the world than it is also likely to map
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the quantum quandary, don't you think? Subjectivity and mentality are 
<br />
surely much bigger scientific problems
<br />
&nbsp;than all of the paradoxes of QM and GR can even hope to compare!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I also have some trouble with the idea that we &quot;share an I&quot;, as you 
<br />
put it, as I don't know to what extent
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I do share mine with anyone! My notion is, instead, that the &quot;I&quot; is 
<br />
exactly what we DO NOT SHARE, what makes us different,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;while Reality is all the rest: what we DO share in a very obvious 
<br />
sense. Otherwise, why would we disagree? Do we slice
<br />
&nbsp;the Plenitude in parallel?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I also do not join you and Bruno in that eagerness for a 
<br />
&quot;self-centered science&quot; as the solution to everything.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe it is an unfair comparison but isn't that, the demand for a 
<br />
science that caters to ones believes and feelings,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;what the Kansas Board of &quot;Education&quot; is about to enshrine in its 
<br />
classrooms with the whole notion of parity between
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Evolution and &quot;Intelligent Design&quot;? Don't tax payers have the right to 
<br />
science that caters to their beliefs and biases,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;a school that, instead of teaching their children, reinforces their 
<br />
conviction that they already know what's true?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Please tell me I am wrong.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Only half joking,

<br />
<br />&nbsp;Hi Bruno and Lee,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I would invert Dennett's point to increase its emphasis: &quot;we need to 
<br />
develop some first person discourses on the third person discourse.&quot; In 
<br />
other words, I believe that the foundation is first person, and that 
<br />
third person is a consequence of anthropically determined constraints 
<br />
that we must share.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been quiet recently in part because of the sheer volume of this 
<br />
list. As you know Bruno I am an extreme believer in first person. I 
<br />
have acquired this position mainly by looking at two seemingly opposite 
<br />
trends in science. Scientific theories have become less and less 
<br />
anthropocentric removing the earth and man as the center of the 
<br />
universe. (Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, Michelson-Morley). The Earth 
<br />
does not occupy a priviledged position. There is no Ether. There is no 
<br />
absolute. Paradoxically, the observer has acquired greater importance 
<br />
through the work (Relativity Theory, Quantum Theory with the MWI, 
<br />
Shannon's communication theory). Relativity of the observer seems to be 
<br />
pervasive, not just with regards &quot;Relativity Theory&quot; but also with 
<br />
regards Quantum Theroy. It is not a coincidence that Everett called his 
<br />
paper &quot;Relative State Formulation of Quantum Mechanics.&quot; Everything is 
<br />
relative to the observer. So why not go all the way.... and take the 
<br />
first person as the base. This approach tackles the Mind-Body problem 
<br />
up-front rather than after the fact. &quot;I&quot; becomes fundamental: the 
<br />
starting assumption as well as an observable fact. &quot;I&quot; exists in the 
<br />
Plenitude and is constrained to see a slice of the Plenitude - the 
<br />
world it sees - by Anthropic constraints. Thus &quot;I&quot; and the world it 
<br />
sees share the same structure and logic whatever that logic may be. 
<br />
There are probably more than one I's/worlds/logics that satisfy this 
<br />
requirement. Bruno, you are the expert in logic. Subjective reality is 
<br />
fundamental. Objective reality arises because we share the same &quot;I&quot; and 
<br />
therefore the same world (slice view of the plenitude).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;George
