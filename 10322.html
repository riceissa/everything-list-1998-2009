</em><br />
<br />I think I see where the confusion lies. My definitions rely on there
<br />
being a unique ontologogical 'substance' because of my frustration that
<br />
there is a pervasive use (not necessarily yours) of 1st-person and
<br />
3rd-person to denote, respectively, the 'inside' and 'outside' views of
<br />
persons. This then leads to the idea that these derive from different
<br />
ontological substances (e.g. Chalmers in effect, dualism in general).
<br />
So my single substance is in that sense 'primitive'. Bruno would I
<br />
think say that this substance is Number. I just say it's whatever it is
<br />
and it's the same for everything. Of course, it's the intersection of
<br />
this substance with structure that produces persons (and all other
<br />
phenomena), which are, as you rightly say, complex.
<br />
<br />The problem
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is, that while a)-c) is not all that can be said
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about first personhood, it is pretty much all that *is* said
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in your various definitions [*].
</em><br />
<br />I quite agree, with the above proviso. I was merely trying to point out
<br />
different uses of the term that I thought important, but you may well
<br />
have found this superflous. The obvious is sometimes elusive.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK: now we seem to be getting to the nub of the problem. Consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and qualia. IOW, 1st-personhood divides into two problems: an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Easy Problem of a)-c); and a Hard problem of d) qualia and e)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; incommunicable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiences.
</em><br />
<br />I would say that qualia are the fact of *being* structured substance
<br />
*behaving* in a certain kind of 'perceiver+perceptual model' way. As
<br />
such they are themselves incommunicable, although existing in
<br />
non-random mutual relations (e.g. that of red to blue, or middle C to
<br />
bottom A). The information they encode relationally is what is
<br />
communicable both to the 'self' and to others - epistemology from
<br />
ontology. Empirically my assumption is that they must also map in some
<br />
systematic way to material structure, which is not to say that
<br />
qualitative and material structural levels map one-to-one. However I
<br />
don't believe that qualia are 'substrate independent' (you may recall
<br />
that this is where we began in the dear, dim days of the FOR group).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now: if qualia are the only aspect of 1st-personhood whose emergence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; form structured matter is &quot;fishy&quot;, why not make qualia ontologically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fundamental, and keep the Easy aspects of 1p-hood as high-level
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emergent features ? (It's not just that we don't *need* to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; treat the a)-c) as primitive, it is also that we can't! A structure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that contains representations of other structures is inherently
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; complex!)
</em><br />
<br />I think I agree, as I say above. I know I lost you with my previous
<br />
remarks about a primitive substance with primitive differentiation, but
<br />
the fundamental nature of 'qualia' was what I was trying to convey. The
<br />
substance on its own won't do, because it has no content, and
<br />
semantically to have differentiation one needs to start with a
<br />
substance. Hence qualia are to be found at the intersection, and
<br />
different types of structure yield different types of qualia.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; ( I am taking it that qualia are basically non-structural [**] )
</em><br />
<br />'Fraid not. But now I can agree with you that 1p-hood in its Easy
<br />
aspect is indeed a high level emergent feature of this structured
<br />
ontology. Then the fact of *being* the structured substance is the
<br />
'qualia', and the relational aspects (information) constitute our
<br />
knowledge of the structural entities so formed (i.e. 'the world'). I
<br />
take the 'active principle' of information to be the relational aspects
<br />
expressed as behaviour.  IOW, one structure treats another as
<br />
information when its behaviour is systematically changed by
<br />
incorporating it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is that idea even coherent ? How can a universal Person contain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; representations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of what is outside itself ?
</em><br />
<br />It can't of course. Only of what is inside itself. My intuition about
<br />
the 'Big Person' was simply to express the idea that the 'substance' is
<br />
universally available to be structured into persons. Persons are just
<br />
zones so structured. We needn't mention the BP ever again.
<br />
<br />Thank you for your excellent treatment of the physicalism/ mentalism
<br />
issues, with which I pretty much entirely agree. I'd just like to
<br />
comment on a couple of things:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But it is almost tautologous that the real world cannot be made of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; those ingredients alone (particularly that is can't be a mere
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; abstraction). Thus we have candidates for real properties of the world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not captured by physics: concreta, intrinsic properties and qualities.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The last is of the most interest, of course. The resemblance between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;qualia&quot; and &quot;quality&quot; might not be coincidental. Qualities might be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intrinsic to matter yet incapable of being &quot;seen&quot; through the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;spectacles&quot; of physics. Our own qualia might be a direct insight into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; these qualities, not something else in disguise. We need not suppose
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that all qualities are like human qualia; qualia might be only a tiny
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subset of the possible range of qualities.
</em><br />
<br />I agree, as I hope my earlier comments show. The possibilities of
<br />
structure are infinite, and consequently we could expect 'qualia' to be
<br />
at least extremely varied.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; An objection that could be raised at this point is that if qualia are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intrinsic to the matter of the brain, and we have a direct insight into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them, they should give a fine-grained physical picture of the brain.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Another is that we are not not conscious of all our mental contents --
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; most of what is going on in our heads it unconscious. So there is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;grain&quot; problem -- relating to the amount of detail in the contents of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness -- and, relatedly a &quot;level&quot; problem.
</em><br />
<br />My take is that what we experience depends on high-level emergent
<br />
aspects of the behaviour of 'perceivers+perceptual models', not the
<br />
individual components. Something that impresses me in this regard is
<br />
the central role of memory in consciousness. Consider the unfortunate
<br />
people who have suffered a catastrophic deficit in short-term memory -
<br />
say, being unable to recall what has happened more than ten minutes
<br />
ago. Often when shown video evidence of their having done something
<br />
that they can't recall, they explain this by claiming &quot;I must have been
<br />
unconscious&quot;. It's an understandable explanation for witnessing
<br />
yourself doing something you can't remember. Now supposing you imagine
<br />
yourself in this appalling situation, and your memory reduces to 5
<br />
minutes, 1 minute, 10 seconds, 1 second - how far would this have to go
<br />
before, even though you still retained your 'sensorium', you would be
<br />
effectively 'unconscious'? I think this has a lot to do with grain and
<br />
level - the 'resolving power' of the perceptual *behaviour* of the
<br />
brain.
<br />
<br />My sense now is that we may not need to disagree so much.  But I also
<br />
think we all need a better (common) terminology. Perhaps the roadmap?

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; much as it does you!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; On this occasion, I'll say simply this: whilst of course not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; unconscious of other treatments of these issues, particularly those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; addressing the physical or computational issues, there's always seemed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to me to be something philosophically fishy about how the 'first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; person' is supposed to just 'turn up' in a situation which is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; fundamentally something else - a world fundamentally composed of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; impersonal 'things'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; How fishy that is depends on what is meant by &quot;first person&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If a person is just:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a) a structure which is b) part of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wider structure, and which c) has an internal representation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the wider structure;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is no great problem. The situation is entirely structure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and relational, and can therefore easily be dealt with by physicalism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; --
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by matter forming various differnt kinds of structure. The problem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is, that while a)-c) is not all that can be said

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about first personhood, it is pretty much all that *is* said

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; treat such a 1st person as ontologically primative, it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hardly even coherent , since such a 1st person is clearly complex.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I'm convinced this puzzles and confuses others
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; too, leading to IMO pseudo-problems like 'intelligent zombies', and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; pseudo-solutions like dualism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK: now we seem to be getting to the nub of the problem. Consciousness

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and qualia. IOW, 1st-personhood divides into two problems: an

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiences.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now: if qualia are the only aspect of 1st-personhood whose emergence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; form structured matter is &quot;fishy&quot;, why not make qualia ontologically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fundamental, and keep the Easy aspects of 1p-hood as high-level
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emergent features ? (It's not just that we don't *need* to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; treat the a)-c) as primitive, it is also that we can't! A structure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that contains representations of other structures is inherently
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; complex!)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ( I am taking it that qualia are basically non-structural [**] )
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;   So it occurred to me: supposing one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; were to think of the world not as a collection of 'things' (or as I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; think physics teaches us a 'field' differentiated into apparently
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; individual 'things') but as a 'big person' (or a big personal field,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; differentiated into apparently individual persons).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is that idea even coherent ? How can a universal Person contain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; representations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of what is outside itself ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I'm sorry if this sounds like Teletubbies, but I'm not going to deploy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; my jargon this time! We're here because the 'big person' is here and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; we're a part of him (her/ us?).  Now this 'big person' would have to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; conscious in parts, and unconscious in other parts, but it then ocurred
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to me that this is *exactly* analogous to our own situation: we are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; indeed conscious in parts and at times, and unconscious in other parts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and at other times.  The distinction seems to arise from local strucure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and function.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And therefore doesn't require any personhood apart from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; those structures and funtions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Everything else really follows from this, and personally I've found
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that thinking in this way dissolves the sort of conceptual confusions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that I've mentioned - same structure, same function, same first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; personhood (no zombies, no dualism).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But always *some* first-personhood, or how else
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could it be universal ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The rest of course, is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; infamous 'easy problem', on which I have no particular purchase.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Now that I've put it in this I hope disarmingly naive way, you may wish
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to request clarification on any point, or you may feel that you simply

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; disagree, or aren't interested.  As ever, I'd be pleased to hear from

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but depends on the means of communication being used.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Feelings and seemings can be more readily communicated in artistic,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; poetice language, and least readily in scientifi technical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; language. Since the harder, more technical a science is, the more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical it is, the communication problem is at its most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; acute in a purely mathematical langauge. Thus the problem with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physicalism is not its posit of matter (as a bare substrate)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but its other posit, that all properties are phycial. Since physics is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical, that amounts to the claim that all properties
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are mathematical (or at least mathematically describable). In making
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the transition from a physicalist world-view to a mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one, the concept of a material substrate is abandoned (although it was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; never a problem for consciousness) and the posit of mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; properties becomes, which is a problem for consciousness becomes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; extreme.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What Is Physicalism Anyway ? Quantities, Qualities and Russell's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Alternative.`
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Our unwillingness to identify the physical and the mental is at heart a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; descriptive problem. (There is a class of objections, based on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; causality, and another on intentionality which I will get onto in due
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; course). Detailed physical descriptions just don't capture the &quot;feel&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of conscious states. This is brought out in Frank Jackson's parable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about Mary, the neuroscientist who, imprisoned in a monochrome
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; environment, knows all there is to know about colour perception in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; principle, but is still surprised by the actual experience of colour on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; her release.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yet there is a wealth of evidence that the mental is strongly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correlated with the physical. One way out of this impasse is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical descriptions do not &quot;capture&quot; the mental, but the mental is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nonetheless &quot;there&quot;. This is a kind of two Language view. It is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; departure from the strongest varieties of Physicalism without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entertaining any supernaturalism about the mind. (Of course, if in some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; underlying way the mental is the physical, albeit under a different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; description, there is no causal problem.The mental story , in terms of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intentions and actions, and the physical story in terms of neural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; firings and muscular twitches are two different descriptions of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; same event, so neither the physical nor the mental is squeezed out of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the causal picture).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But why don't physical descriptions capture the mental? Consider the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way physical theories are verified. An experiment is set up; a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theoretical calculation is made of the expected outcome; the experiment
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is performed and a comparison is made between expectation the actual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; outcome. The outcome matches the expectation , or it doesn't. But the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; outcome and the expectation relate to instrument-readings. There is no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; further requirement to capture the essence of the thing being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; investigated. The height of a column of mercury in a thermometer is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very much like heat (subjectively or objectively!), but that doesn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter; it only matter whether it is the expected value of not. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instrument reading only has to track -- vary in line with -- the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; underlying phenomenon. The other ingredient is the theoretical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; apparatus, the graphs and formulae used to generate the expectation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; These are abstract mathematical structures. If the theory is correct,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the abstract structures it uses will stand in a certain relationship to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the real phenomenon, one of &quot;modeling&quot; or &quot;mapping&quot; it , so the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interrelationships of the elements of the abstract theory will mimic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the structure and behaviour of the real phenomenon. nothing further is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; required, and this relationship of modeling between theory and reality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is itself an abstract structure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So these are the ingredients of physical: modeling, mapping,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; isomorphism, abstraction, relation, quantities.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But it is almost tautologous that the real world cannot be made of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; those ingredients alone (particularly that is can't be a mere
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; abstraction). Thus we have candidates for real properties of the world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not captured by physics: concreta, intrinsic properties and qualities.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The last is of the most interest, of course. The resemblance between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;qualia&quot; and &quot;quality&quot; might not be coincidental. Qualities might be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intrinsic to matter yet incapable of being &quot;seen&quot; through the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;spectacles&quot; of physics. Our own qualia might be a direct insight into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; these qualities, not something else in disguise. We need not suppose
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that all qualities are like human qualia; qualia might be only a tiny
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subset of the possible range of qualities.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not all qualities need to be had consciously by a being with a mind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (human qualia are necessary constituents of full human consciousness,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but might not be sufficient constituents). If they are, and they are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intrinsic to matter, that suggests panexperientialism. If not, there is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an extra factor to conscious experience beyond the nature of experience
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; itself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; An objection that could be raised at this point is that if qualia are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intrinsic to the matter of the brain, and we have a direct insight into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them, they should give a fine-grained physical picture of the brain.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Another is that we are not not conscious of all our mental contents --
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; most of what is going on in our heads it unconscious. So there is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;grain&quot; problem -- relating to the amount of detail in the contents of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness -- and, relatedly a &quot;level&quot; problem.
