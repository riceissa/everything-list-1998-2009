Bruno had written
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [Lee wrote] 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What do you think of your survival chances if you happen to know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that after you fall asleep tonight, you will be disintegrated,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but the information will be used to create two exact duplicates,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and then one of the duplicates is vaporized and the other 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; returned to your bed completely unaware?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Zero?  (I.e., you don't survive the &quot;teleportation&quot; aspect at all.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One-half?  (I.e., your soul goes into one at random, and if that's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;             the one that dies, then your number is up.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One?   (I.e., Stathis will wake up in bed for sure tomorrow, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         resume his life just as he has done everyday (since our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;          fiendish experiments began when he was five years old))
</em><br />
<br />and then Bruno said: &quot;Interesting question. I am interested in your
<br />
own answer. I let Stathis answer (to see if he will give the comp one).
<br />
Note that the comp answer here is not needed in the UDA argument where 
<br />
overlapping reconstitution (like in duplications) are never followed by 
<br />
somethings which looks (at least) like a murder.&quot;
<br />
<br /><br />Well, in the first place, I assume that when a question is asked of
<br />
anyone on this list, EVERYONE is invited to answer. Certainly when
<br />
I ask any question, it is for everyone, even if it's true that at
<br />
the moment I seem more interested in some particular person's answer.
<br />
<br />Stathis now answers my question:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; One. That's how it will *seem* and that is what is important to me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As discussed previously, I like to say that the actual objective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality is that I die in any case every moment, and that the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appearance/sensation of continuity is just that. This is a non-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; normative use of the terms &quot;I&quot; and &quot;die&quot;, I know, but what I want 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to capture is that there is in fact no soul that flies from one 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instantiation to another instantiation of me, making sure that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it really is me and not just some guy who thinks he is me. It 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certainly *feels* that there is such a persisting soul, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; occupying only one body at any one time, but there isn't.
</em><br />
<br />Well, I am sure that &quot;probability=one&quot; is as close to being a &quot;correct&quot;
<br />
answer as there can be. So I'm glad to see that several people agree
<br />
with me (Bruno didn't actually say yet, nor did anyone else).
<br />
<br />For the record, it is still curious to me that you persist in using
<br />
non-normative terms, even though they invite confusion. (Honestly,
<br />
I am not sure that I do not sometimes do the same :-)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; While you may agree that the answer to your question above is &quot;one&quot;, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we may differ in another thought experiment.
</em><br />
<br />Now you're talking!  The terms we use, phooey.  The philosophical
<br />
ramblings we emit, phooey. True philosophy should be about prescriptions
<br />
for action!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Suppose you were offered two choices for tomorrow: you will be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; disintegrated tonight and a single copy made tomorrow, or you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would be disintegrated tonight and one copy as per usual made
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tomorrow plus an extra copy made with a mild headache.
</em><br />
<br />I would choose the two copies, because I will get over my headache
<br />
when I am in the 2nd location. (The 2nd location conceivably could
<br />
be 10^10^20 light years from here, and it really is a case of whether
<br />
I want to execute in some volume of spacetime, or if instead I would
<br />
prefer to be dead there. You clearly prefer to be dead almost everywhere,
<br />
or at least to not care much.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I feel that if I choose the two copies, my soul might end up in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the one with a headache, whereas if I choose the single copy, my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; soul is guaranteed to end up in the headache-free copy. So I would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; choose the single copy option, even though I would much rather have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a mild headache than be dead. I know that you might call this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; irrational,
</em><br />
<br />Actually, it's not only irrational, but in my opinion it is inconsistent.
<br />
Because in the above experiment that I formulated, you readily agree that
<br />
you survive no matter which duplicate is destroyed. Therefore, it is 
<br />
logical and necessary that you survive (a) in the headachey duplicate
<br />
and (b) in the ordinary duplicate. Mathematical symmetry grabs to by
<br />
the throat and FORCES you to admit it!  (To borrow a phrase from Lewis
<br />
Carroll.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and it is irrational if we are talking about the objective reality. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But wanting to be alive at all is not rational or irrational: it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is not inconsistent to imagine an intelligent being completely 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indifferent to its continuing survival, or even actively suicidal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on a faint whim.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, that is right. You have a point there.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is just my evolutionary programming which makes me want to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; survive, and it is that same evolutionary programming which 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tells me my soul can only occupy one body at a time.
</em><br />
<br />But you as a free being  :-)  do not have to actually *believe*
<br />
what your evolutionary programming suggests. You *can* simply
<br />
practice saying &quot;I know that the objective truth is that I will
<br />
be in two places at the same time. I know that I will have a
<br />
headache and I know that I will not have a headache.
<br />
<br />I suggest that if you practice it then it will actually be easier
<br />
to believe than &quot;the photon is both a wave and particle&quot;.  Hah!
<br />
What I suggest is child's play compared to that!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I *know* that there is no such thing as a soul, that I die
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; every moment, was dead before birth, will be dead for most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of eternity, am dead almost everywhere, death doesn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessarily hurt, but I still don't want to die.
</em><br />
<br />Of course.  Here is another analogy.  &quot;Stathis!&quot;, says the fireman,
<br />
&quot;if you stay here you will probably die. But if you take a running
<br />
leap through that wall of fire, you will be pulled to safety on the
<br />
other side.&quot;  Now, who do you *believe*?  Your evolutionary programming,
<br />
which says to always run away from fire, or the fireman, who has 
<br />
attained a higher level?  When the chips are down, you just have to
<br />
force yourself to believe the truth.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Similarly, I *know* that each of the copies tomorrow has equal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; claim to being me, but I still feel that only one of them is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; going to me,
</em><br />
<br />Okay, so sometimes our feelings are wrong!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and I worry about which one it's going to be. There is, on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the one hand, logic and empirical truth, and on the other hand
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the way I feel, and the two do not necessarily coincide.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would be *wrong* if I made an empirical claim about the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world on the basis of a feeling;
</em><br />
<br />Yeah, right!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; for example, that I must have an immaterial soul which persists
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in a single version of my body throughout life. But I am *not*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wrong if I simply report that I have the strong feeling of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; persistent soul,
</em><br />
<br />Well, I have a strong feeling that I should not jump out of a plane
<br />
at high altitude. But I also have a homo sapiens level brain that 
<br />
says that the parachute *will* open and I will live.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; that I don't want to die, and that I can only feel that I am one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person at a time.
</em><br />
<br />Yes. Now the *easy* part is announcing that you (a) will be the person
<br />
with the headache and that equally truly (b) you will be the person without
<br />
the headache. That's because it's about the future.
<br />
<br />What is vastly harder is to look across the room at your recent duplicate,
<br />
and say, &quot;There by the grace of God goes I.&quot;
<br />
<br />But that's true too!
<br />
