<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Again, the mere postulation of existence is insufficient: it does not

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;thing to inform us of how it is that it is even possible for us, as mere

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;finite humans, to have experiences that &quot;change&quot;. We have to address why it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is that Time, even if it is ultimately an &quot;illusion&quot;, and the distingtion
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;between past and future is so intimately intetwined in our world of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;experience.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Good question. But you know I do address this question in my thesis
<br />
(see url below). I cannot give you too much technical details, but here is a
<br />
the main line. As you know, I showed that if we postulate the comp hyp
<br />
then time, space, energy and, in fact, all physicalities---including the
<br />
communicable (like 3-person results of experiments) as the uncommunicable
<br />
one (like qualie or results of 1-person experiment) appears as modalities 
<br />
which are
<br />
variant of the Godelian self-referential provability predicates. As you know
<br />
Godel did succeed in defining &quot;formal provability&quot; in the language of a
<br />
consistent machine and many years later Solovay succeeds in formalising
<br />
all theorems of provability logic in a couple of modal logics G and G*.
<br />
G formalizes the provable (by the machine) statements about its own
<br />
provability ability; and G* extends G with all true statements about the
<br />
machine's ability (including those the machine cannot prove).
<br />
Now, independently, temporal logicians have defined some modal
<br />
systems capable of formalizing temporal statements. Also, Brouwer
<br />
developed a logic of the conscious subject, which has given rise to a whole
<br />
constructive philosophy of mathematics, which has been formalize
<br />
by a logic known as &quot;intuitionist logic&quot;, and later, like the temporal logic,
<br />
the intuitionist logic has been captured formally by an modal
<br />
extension of a classical modal logic. Actually it is Godel who has seen
<br />
the first that Intuitionist logic can be formalised by the modal logic S4, and
<br />
Grzegorczyk makes it more precise with the extended system S4Grz.
<br />
And it happens that S4Grz is by itself a very nice logic of subjective,
<br />
irreversible (anti-symmetric) time, and this gives a nice account too of the
<br />
relationship Brouwer described between time and consciousness.
<br />
Now, if you remember, I use the thaetetus trick of defining
<br />
(machine) &quot;knowledge of p&quot; by &quot;provability of p and p&quot;. Independently
<br />
Boolos, Goldblatt, but also Kusnetsov and Muravitski in Russia, showed
<br />
that the formalization of that form of knowledge (i.e. &quot;provability of p 
<br />
and p&quot;)
<br />
gives exactly the system of S4Grz. That's the way subjective time arises
<br />
in the discourse of the self-referentially correct machine.
<br />
Physical discourses come from the modal variant of provability given
<br />
by &quot;provable p and consistent p&quot; (where consistent p = not provable p):
<br />
this is justified by the thought experiment and this gives the arithmetical
<br />
quantum logics which capture the &quot;probability one&quot; for the probability
<br />
measure on the computational histories as seen by the average consistent
<br />
machine. Physical time is then captured by &quot;provable p and consistant p and p&quot;.
<br />
Obviously people could think that for a consistent machine
<br />
the three modal variants, i.e:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provable p
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provable p and p
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provable p and consistent p and p
<br />
<br />are equivalent. Well, they are half right, in the sense that for G*, they 
<br />
are indeed
<br />
equivalent (they all prove the same p), but G, that is the self-referential 
<br />
machine
<br />
cannot prove those equivalences, and that's explain why, from the point of 
<br />
view of the
<br />
machine, they give rise to so different logics. To translate the comp hyp 
<br />
into the
<br />
language of the machine, it is necessary to restrict p to the \Sigma_1 
<br />
arithmetical
<br />
sentences (that is those who are accessible by the Universal Dovetailer, 
<br />
and that step
<br />
is needed to make the physicalness described by a quantum logic).
<br />
The constraints are provably (with the comp hyp) enough to defined all
<br />
the probabilities on the computational histories, and that is why, if ever 
<br />
a quantum
<br />
computer would not appear in those logics, then (assuming QM is true!) comp
<br />
would definitely be refuted; and that is all my point.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; [BM]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; OK. Just to cut the hair a little bit: with Church thesis &quot;computational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; realism&quot; is equivalent to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a restricted form of arithmetical realism. Comp. realism is equivalent to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Arith. realism restricted
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to the Sigma_1 sentences, i.e. those sentence which are provably
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;equivalent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (in Peano arithmetic, say) to sentences of the form &quot;it exists x such that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; p(x)&quot; with p(x) a decidable (recursive) predicate.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This is equivalent to say that either a machine (on any argument) will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;stop
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; or will not stop, and this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; independently of any actual running.  Indeed, sometimes I say that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (Sigma_1) arithmetical realism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is equivalent to the belief in the excluded middle principe (that is &quot;A or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; not A) applied to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (Sigma_1) arithmetical sentences. (Sigma_1 sentences plays a prominant
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;role
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in the derivation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of the logic of the physical propositions from the logic of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; self-referential propositions). Actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the Universal Dovetailing is arithmetically equivalent with an enumeration
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of all true Sigma_1 sentences. The key feature of those sentences is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; their truth entails their provability (unlike
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; arbitrary sentences which can be true and not provable (by Peano
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; arithmetic, for exemple).

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Bruno, I do not understand why you use so weak a support for your very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;clever theory! If we are to take the collection of a &quot;true Sigma_1
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sentenses&quot; to have &quot;independent of implementation&quot; existence, why not all of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the endless hierarchy of Cantor's Cardinals? I have never understood this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Kroneckerian attitute.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />This is related to the Skolem theorems or to the so-called &quot;Skolem Paradox&quot;,
<br />
Cantorian cardinals are relative notions (in set theory). There is no sense
<br />
to talk about an absolute implementation of those cardinals. I do believe
<br />
in the Cantorian theory but high cardinal are measure on our high ignorance;
<br />
I don't see how we could extend a &quot;set realism&quot; for them, unlike what we can do
<br />
with numbers (but also with all ordinals less than the first non constructive
<br />
ordinal of Church and Kleene, by using an extended version of Church 
<br />
thesis, the
<br />
so-called hyper-arithmetical Church thesis; but that step would be a step
<br />
toward a weakening of comp and the \Sigma_1 sentences should be replaced
<br />
by something else ...).
<br />
<br />Hoping having not been too technical. A good book is Rogers' one, see the ref
<br />
in my thesis or papers, and of course a must is the Boolos 1993 book.
<br />
Even in my french thesis I have not give all technical details. I have done 
<br />
that
<br />
in my &quot;brussel's thesis&quot; which I will soon put on my web page, but then it
<br />
is 800 pages of technical details ... in french (I did not choose it).
<br />
<br />Remember that I am not a defender of comp. My only goal is to show that comp
<br />
is enough precise so that it can be refuted; or put in another way, my goal is
<br />
to show comp is a scientific theory in the popper sense of the word; a 
<br />
little like
<br />
John Bell succeeded in showing that the Einstein Podolski Rosen paper
<br />
leads to verifiable propositions, and was not philosophy (as Bohr implicitly
<br />
argued, and as so many physicist did believe (without thinking on the matter).
<br />
<br />Best Regards, and have a nice week-end,
<br />
<br />Bruno
