</em><br />
<br />I certainly agree that it would be &quot;extraordinarily rare&quot;, in the sense 
<br />
that the size of the lattice would need to be very big, and the number of 
<br />
clock-ticks required would need to be very large. But &quot;big&quot; and &quot;large&quot; are 
<br />
such relative terms! Clearly, our own universe is very, very big. The 
<br />
question is, how can we sensibly determine whether life is more likely in 
<br />
our universe or in Conway's Life universe?
<br />
<br />I don't believe we have anywhere near enough data to answer this question, 
<br />
but I don't think it's unanswerable in principle. Fredkin actually believes 
<br />
that our universe is a 3+1D cellular automata, and if anyone ever found 
<br />
such a description of our physics (or some other fundamentally 
<br />
computational description), then we could directly compare it with Conway's 
<br />
Life, determining for each one how big the lattice needs to be, and how 
<br />
many clock-ticks are required, for life to appear with (say) 90% 
<br />
probability. (Of course, this determination might be difficult even when we 
<br />
know the rules of the CAs. But we can try.)
<br />
<br />One thing that you'd have to take into account is the complexity of the 
<br />
rules you're comparing, including the number of states allowed per cell. 
<br />
Not only are the rules to Conway's Life extremely simple, but the cells are 
<br />
binary. All things being equal, I would expect that an increase in the 
<br />
complexity of the rules and the number of cell-states allowed would 
<br />
decrease the necessary lattice-size and/or number of clock-ticks required 
<br />
for SASs to grow out of a pseudo-random initial state. I mention this to 
<br />
point out a problem with our intuitions about our universe vs. Conway's 
<br />
Life: the description of our universe is almost certainly more complex than 
<br />
the description of Conway's Life with a simple initial state. If Fredkin 
<br />
actually succeeds in finding a 3+1D CA which describes our universe, it 
<br />
will almost certainly require more than 2 cell-states, and its rules will 
<br />
certainly be more complex than those of the Life universe. We have to take 
<br />
this difference into account when trying to compare the two universes, but 
<br />
we have nowhere near enough data to quantify the difference currently. We 
<br />
really don't know what size of space in the Life universe is equivalent to 
<br />
(say) a solar system in this universe.
<br />
<br />In a way, this is all beside the point, since I have no problem believing 
<br />
that one CA can evolve SASs much more easily than some other CA whose rules 
<br />
and initial state are exactly as complex. (In fact, this must be true, 
<br />
since for any CA that supports life at all, there's an equally complex one 
<br />
that isn't even computation universal.) I have no problem believing that 
<br />
the Life universe is, in some objective sense, not very conducive to SASs. 
<br />
Perhaps it's less conducive to SASs than our own universe, although I'm not 
<br />
convinced. What I have a problem believing is that CAs as a class are 
<br />
somehow less conducive to observers than quantum-physical models as a 
<br />
class. In fact, I think it's substantially more likely that there are 
<br />
relatively simple CA models (and other computational models) that are much 
<br />
more conducive to SASs than either Conway's Life universe or our own. 
<br />
Models in which, for instance, neural-net structures arise much more 
<br />
naturally from the basic physics of the system than they do in our 
<br />
universe, or the Life universe.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;In many ways, our universe seems tailor made for creating observers.
</em><br />
<br />I understand this perspective, but for what it's worth, I'm profoundly out 
<br />
of sympathy with it. In my view, computation universality is the real key - 
<br />
life and consciousness are going to pop up in any universe that's 
<br />
computation universal, as long as the universe is big enough and/or it 
<br />
lasts long enough. (And there's always enough time and space in the 
<br />
Mathiverse!) When I think about the insane, teetering, jerry-rigged 
<br />
contraptions that we call life in this universe - when I think about the 
<br />
tortured complexity that matter has to twist itself into just to give us 
<br />
single-celled replicators - and when I think about the insane reaches of 
<br />
space we see around us (even if we end up finding life in practically every 
<br />
solar system, there's a crazy amount of space even between planets, not to 
<br />
mention stars) - I find it easy to believe that our universe is just one of 
<br />
those countless universes out there in Mathspace which isn't especially 
<br />
conducive to life at all, but is simply computation universal, so life pops 
<br />
up eventually.
<br />
<br />Because of the above conclusions, the problem of measure is a serious one 
<br />
for me. I don't have a clue why I would be more likely to find myself in a 
<br />
universe like this one instead of some CA universe. Regarding your 
<br />
suggestion that we might judge universes not only by the complexity of 
<br />
their rules and initial states, but also by the complexity of the simplest 
<br />
program which &quot;finds&quot; SASs within them: as I understand the proposal, 
<br />
universes (or observer-moments within the universes) which have simple 
<br />
rules and initial states and yet generate SASs easily would have greater 
<br />
measure, because the program needed to &quot;find&quot; these very common SASs would 
<br />
also be simple. This is an intriguing idea, but it doesn't help me, because 
<br />
I don't (yet) see why simplicity or complexity of any kind should affect 
<br />
measure. I can imagine a CA world which is sparsely populated with SASs, 
<br />
and one that's densely populated with them, but the number of SASs (or the 
<br />
number of observer moments) in both worlds seems exactly the same - 
<br />
(countably?) infinite. So why would I be more likely to find myself in one 
<br />
of those universes rather than the other?
