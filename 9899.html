</em><br />

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in any way equivalent to the statement that it predicts X and Y are

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; likely. One is an absence of any prediction, the other is a specific and

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; definite prediction.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;IOW, if MMW heories worked, MMW theories would work.
</em><br />
<br />No, that is not a fair paraphrase of what I said. I meant exactly what I 
<br />
said I meant--if a hypothesis is not well-defined enough to tell you the 
<br />
relative probability of different possibilities, that does not justify the 
<br />
claim that the hypothesis predicts each possibility is equally likely. Do 
<br />
you agree with this principle or not?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;Classical physicists din't WANT to make the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;implications that atoms are unstable and will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;implode; nonetheless, classical phsyics makes that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;assumption.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Yes, that is a definite prediction of classical mechanics, and therefore 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; nothing to do with examples of theories that cannot make definite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; predictions about certain questions in the first place. A more analogous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; case would be the fact that string theory cannot at present predict the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; value of the cosmological constant; would you therefore conclude that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;string theory predicts all values of the cosmological constant are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;equally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; likely&quot;?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;That isnot really analogous becasue the CC can only have one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;value at a time.
</em><br />
<br />That difference is irrelevant to my point about probabilities. Again, it is 
<br />
*always* unjustified to say that because a theory doesn't predict the 
<br />
relative probabilities of different outcomes, that means it predicts they 
<br />
are equally likely; it doesn't matter whether or not we are talking about 
<br />
the probability in the context of a large ensemble of events (say, the 
<br />
probability a certain type of atom will decay in a 1-minute time period, 
<br />
where we are repeating the test with a large number of atoms) or in the 
<br />
context of a single event.
<br />
<br />Anyway, it is quite possible that even if string theory could make 
<br />
predictions about the value of the cosmological constant, it would only be a 
<br />
probabilistic prediction rather than predicting a single unique value, which 
<br />
means that if you are prepared to entertain either the MWI of quantum 
<br />
mechanics or &quot;chaotic inflation&quot; where new universes bubble from prior ones 
<br />
via inflation, then there might in fact be different &quot;universes&quot; with 
<br />
different values of the cosmological constant.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;Platonists about mathematical objects claim that the theorems 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;mathematical theories - sentences like '3 is prime' (a theorem 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;arithmetic) and 'There are infinitely many transfinite cardinal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;numbers' (a theorem of set theory) - are literally true and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the only plausible view of such sentences is that they are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ABOUT
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;ABSTRACT OBJECTS &quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(emphasis added)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What do the words &quot;abstract object&quot; mean to you? To me, if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;propositions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about numbers have a truth independent of human minds or

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;beliefs,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;that's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; equivalent to saying they are true statements about abstract
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;objects--how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could a statement be objectively true yet not be about anything?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;By having sense but no reference, for instance.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_and_reference">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_and_reference</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The sense/reference distinction is about the possibility of our 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;having
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; multiple mentally distinct terms which map to the same real-world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; object...but what would &quot;sense but no reference&quot; mean?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;We can make &quot;sense&quot; of &quot;unicorns have horns&quot;, despite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;the lack of reference.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; In this case I would say the reference would be to a certain concept 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; humans have collectively defined;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;No, that's the sense. Sense is in-hte-head , reference
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is out-of-the-head.
</em><br />
<br />OK, I see. So what if we are talking about a concept in itself, as in &quot;most 
<br />
people's concept of a unicorn is that of a horse-like creature with a single 
<br />
horn&quot;; would the &quot;concept&quot; itself be a reference?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don't see how there can be an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; objective, mind-independent truth about a term that doesn't refer to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; coherent object or possibility.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;I am not asking you to. There are coherent possibilities that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;are not instantiated (or perphaps
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;I should say, pace many-worlders, not obviously instantiated).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;Nonetheless, we can address many issues about these possibilites
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;without peaking into the universe next door. Many-world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;metaphysics is not needed to explain how abstrract reasoning
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;is possible.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I agree, and even a &quot;modal realist&quot; philosopher like David Lewis (see
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lewis_(philosopher">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lewis_(philosopher</a>) ), who thinks 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; propositions about possibilities can only be objectively true or false 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;if we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; assume all possible worlds actually exist, would not say that there is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; kind of causal interaction between worlds needed to explain our ability 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; reason about them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If we can reason about (for instance)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;historical what-is without concrete ferefernces is parallel
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;dimensions, we can reason about maths without taking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a trip to Plato's heaven.
</em><br />
<br />But I have already made clear that I *don't* think that we need to refer to 
<br />
platonic forms which somehow causally interact with people's brains in our 
<br />
explanation of how people reason about math, just like David K Lewis doesn't 
<br />
think we need a causal interaction between different possible worlds to 
<br />
explain how people reason about possibilities.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  Can you think of any statements outside of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; math or logic that you would say have &quot;sense but no reference&quot; but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a mind-independent truth value?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;What difference does it make ? The topic is maths.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The question was to try to help me grasp what you meant by &quot;sense 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; reference&quot; and &quot;mind-independent&quot;. If it's impossible to come up with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; examples outside of math, that should make you suspicious whether
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; mathematics really has the strange and marvellous property of there 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; objective mind-independent truths about mathematical terms even though 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; lack any reference.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;No it shoudn't. Maths is obviously unique in a number of respects.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;That is why there is such a subject as philosophy-of-mathematics.
</em><br />
<br />That's pretty vague--unique in what respects? Does uniqueness in these other 
<br />
respects somehow justify the belief that it is unique in the respect of 
<br />
involving both sense-without-reference and mind-independence?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  If you really believe this, you should at least be able
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to give an argument about *why* math is different from every other 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;domain in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; this respect.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It is on a deeper level of abstraction.
</em><br />
<br />That doesn't remotely resemble an argument--can you define precisely what 
<br />
&quot;deeper level of abstraction&quot; means, and why &quot;deepness of abstraction&quot; 
<br />
should be in any way related to statements that lack sense but are 
<br />
objectively true?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;The case for mathematical Platonism needs to be made in the first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;place; if numbers do not exist at all, the universe, as an existing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;thing, cannot be a mathematical structure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Again, what does &quot;exist&quot; mean for you?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;Capable of interacting casually with me,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Well, I don't think the world obeys mathematical laws because it is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;causally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; interacting with platonic forms, any more than I think the world obeys 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; law of noncontradiction because it is causally interacting with platonic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; laws of logic. I would say ontology is about the most exhaustive 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; list of objective truths, and any entity referred to in this exhaustive 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;list
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of objectively true statements &quot;exists&quot; by definition.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If you are going to claim we are already inside Plato's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;heaven, as many on the list do, you are laready dealing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with a stronger definition of ontology than that,
</em><br />
<br />No I'm not. In terms of the notion that &quot;existence&quot; just means the entities 
<br />
you'd need to refer to in an exhaustive list of all objective truths, the 
<br />
idea that &quot;we are already inside Plato's heaven&quot; could be understood to mean 
<br />
that as long as you include all the true statements that deal with the 
<br />
mathematical question of how a theoretical universe with our laws of nature 
<br />
and initial conditions would behave, then your exhaustive list of truths 
<br />
doesn't need to include any additional non-mathematical truths which tell 
<br />
you this particular mathematical description is actually &quot;physically 
<br />
instantiated&quot; or something like that.
<br />
<br />Of course, I'm not sure I believe myself that the exhaustive list of true 
<br />
statements would include *nothing* but mathematical statements--I think it 
<br />
might also have to include some truths about consciousness and qualia. In 
<br />
this sense, it is conceivable that the exhaustive list of truths would tell 
<br />
you that only some mathematically-describable worlds containing intelligent 
<br />
life would actually lead to conscious experiences, while others wouldn't--in 
<br />
this sense only some (or one) possible world would be &quot;real&quot;. I think it's a 
<br />
lot simpler to just assume all mathematically-possible observers are equally 
<br />
real with respect to consciousness, but I can't prove it obviously. Still, I 
<br />
have no idea what it would mean to say that some mathematically possible 
<br />
worlds are *physically* real if &quot;physical&quot; was meant as anything other than 
<br />
a shorthand way for talking about consciousness.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Incidentally, does your definition of &quot;exists&quot; mean that you don't think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; anything exists beyond the boundaries of the observable universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;That depends on what the &quot;able&quot; means in &quot;observable&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />Well, put it this way--as long as the expansion of the universe is not 
<br />
slowing to zero in the limit as time goes to infinity (and observational 
<br />
evidence suggests the rate of expansion is actually accelerating), then any 
<br />
event beyond the boundaries of the observable universe at this moment of 
<br />
cosmological time will never, ever be able to have any causal influence on 
<br />
us, because the space between us and the point where the event occurred will 
<br />
always be expanding faster than light from the event can close the gap 
<br />
between it and us. So unless relativity is wrong and it's possible to travel 
<br />
faster than light, you would not in principle be &quot;able&quot; to observe anything 
<br />
happening beyond the observable universe, at any point in the future. So do 
<br />
you think that anything &quot;exists&quot; beyond the observable universe? And what if 
<br />
you and I are in different galaxies, so that the boundaries of the 
<br />
&quot;observable universe&quot; are slightly different for each of us? Do you think 
<br />
that existence is relative to the observer, rather than being objective and 
<br />
universal?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Tend to&quot;, although occasionally they can make mistakes. For the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;answer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be really objective, you need to refer to some sort of ideal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;mathematician
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or computer following certain rules, but that is just another form 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Platonism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;Not really. You can understand how an ideal system
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;would behave by projecting from non-ideal ones. You
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;don't need an actual example of one.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Do you think there is any sense in which your projection could be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; objectively wrong, even if you believe it is correct?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It could be wrong. So it doesn't necessarily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;deliver objectivity, Hiwever it allows us to understand
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;what objectivity is.
</em><br />
<br />But again, to have a notion of objectivity you must have at least an ideal 
<br />
of an error-free theorem-producer (though again, I'm not claiming that such 
<br />
an ideal is causally interacting with us from its place in platonic heaven, 
<br />
as you say our thought-processes about such ideal systems are based on 
<br />
projecting from real ones).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;It certainly *could* be, at least. Platonism is *not* the only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;philosophy of mathematics!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think it's the only philosophy of mathematics that says that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; statements have a *mind-independent* truth-value, though.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;Nope.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; OK, can you describe another?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Formalism is a bit iffy. Apart from that, they all do.
</em><br />
<br />Are you sure? Does empiricism say there are objective mathematical truths 
<br />
separate from whatever empirical &quot;observations&quot; we happen to make, for 
<br />
example?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  What I'm saying is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that it's necessarily ontological, as are any claims about the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;objective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (mind-independent) truth-value of a given proposition.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;So you are claiming that mathematical Platonism is not merely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;true but *necessarily* true ? That is quite a claim!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No, you misunderstood. I'm saying that *if* you believe that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; statements have a mind-independent truth-value, that is necessarily 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; equivalent to what I understand &quot;mathematical Platonism&quot; to mean.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;Then you are wrong. MP is an ontological thesis.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You are still misunderstanding, of course MP is an ontological thesis, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; do you think I was arguing otherwise? What I'm saying is that any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;statement
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of the form &quot;there is a mind-independent truth about X&quot; is an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ontological
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; statement, by necessity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It is obviously epistemoligcal, It deals with truth, not being.
</em><br />
<br />But as I pointed out, it is common among philosophers to define &quot;being&quot; in 
<br />
terms the set of all possible objective truths. I certainly don't think many 
<br />
philosophers would define &quot;being&quot; the way you do in terms of ability to 
<br />
causally interact with us.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  It is not a &quot;necessity&quot; to believe that statements
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; about math are ontological ones, though, because you are free to deny 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; there is any mind-independent truth about them (in which case you are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; obviously not a mathematical platonist).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I believe there is mind-independent truth about them AND deny they are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ontological
</em><br />
<br />Then I think you are defining &quot;ontological&quot; in a different way from most 
<br />
philosophers, or at least most analytic philosophers of the 20th century 
<br />
(the 'continental' philosophers have their own way of thinking about 
<br />
ontology, but then continental philosophers hardly ever deal with philosophy 
<br />
of math).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But your claim that &quot;the truth
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; value of '17 is prime' is mind-independent&quot; is a &quot;purely 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;epistemological&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; claim is what I'm disagreeing with, because again, any statement about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; mind-independent truths is an ontological statement as I understand
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ontology.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;How can it be ontological when it says nothing about being, existence,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;etc ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Bearing in mind that *my* definition of existence entails the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;possibility
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of causal interaction...
</em><br />
<br />I acknowledge that with *your* definition of existence, mathematical objects 
<br />
do not exist. But I think you're using a pretty idiosyncratic definition 
<br />
that would be miles away from how most analytic philosophers would define 
<br />
existence, in particular those who work with philosophy of math.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  Of course,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you may not in fact believe that mathematical statements have any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind-independent truth-value.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;As I ahve stated, everybody believes that. You are talking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;as though it were an obvious fact that ontolical realsim
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;is the only explanation for epistemological objectivity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Yes, but that's because my notion of &quot;existence&quot; is simply a shorthand 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; an element of reality about which there exist objective truths.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Oh come on, that's like defining God as a necessarily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;existing being. You need to *show* that truth
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;implies existence, not just assert it.
</em><br />
<br />You're acting as though we have some mutually agreed-upon prior definition 
<br />
of &quot;existence&quot; which is separate from objective truth, and that I am trying 
<br />
to make an *argument* that objective truth implies existence in this sense. 
<br />
But that's not what I'm doing at all--I am *defining* the word &quot;existence&quot; 
<br />
in terms of objective truth, not making an argument. I agree that if 
<br />
existence is defined in your way instead of my way, then objective truth 
<br />
doesn't imply existence, but then I think you're using a very weird 
<br />
definition which is different from how virtually any analytic philosopher 
<br />
would define it, and which leads to internal problems like the issue of 
<br />
whether anything &quot;exists&quot; beyond the boundaries of the observable universe.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Perhaps this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; debate is just a disagreement about word-definitions, but I suspect that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; other notion of existence would either be too poorly defined to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; meaningful, or would lead to bizarre conclusions like the notion that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; nothing exists beyond the boundaries of the observable universe (or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;beyond
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; your own past light cone).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It is very much a disagreement about word-definitions.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, that's becoming more clear as we go on.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But that would make &quot;existence&quot; local too, rather than objective. My 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;light
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; cones are different from yours, so if you want to say that the past is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;real&quot; in a sense that the future is not, that would make the reality of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; events different for each observer.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Not if ptoetnial causal interaction is allowed to run in both
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;directions. There
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is chain of ackward causes linking me to the BB; running forward again,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;another chain connects to events outside my light-cone.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, but as I pointed out above, events happening at the current 
<br />
cosmological time outside the current observable universe cannot ever have 
<br />
an effect on anything in your future light cone, nor can they have been 
<br />
affected by any event in your past light cone, assuming the expansion of 
<br />
space is not slowing to zero.
<br />

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;<a href="http://www.geocities.com/peterdjones/met_time2.html">http://www.geocities.com/peterdjones/met_time2.html</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; His argument simply assumes that a moment can &quot;become existent&quot;, without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; addressing this question of whether we need a second time dimension to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; sense of this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;We don't, since nothing changes once it has come into existence.
</em><br />
<br />I don't understand how this response addresses the issue of needing a second 
<br />
time dimension. Our notion of spatial movement depends on the idea of a time 
<br />
dimension for something to have moved from one location in space at an 
<br />
earlier time to another location at a later time; if you believe the present 
<br />
is &quot;moving forward&quot; along our universe's time dimension, that requires some 
<br />
sort of meta-time for it to make sense in the same way (as in, 'at an 
<br />
earlier point in meta-time, the present moment was 1985; but later in 
<br />
meta-time, the present moment had moved forward to 2006'). And then you have 
<br />
the same issue with whether you take an A-series view or a B-series view of 
<br />
meta-time, and if you want to adopt an A-series view you'd have to introduce 
<br />
meta-meta-time to make sense of that, and so forth.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; . And as he admits, he is &quot;assuming that such a thing as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; becoming is possible without describing or explaining it&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It is philoosphically respectable to regard tiem as fundamental.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;something has to be fundamental.
</em><br />
<br />It's &quot;philosophically respectable&quot; because it has such a long history, but I 
<br />
can think of a number of similar ideas with a long history that don't seem 
<br />
in any way coherent to me, like the notion of &quot;free will&quot; as distinct from 
<br />
determinism or randomness or  any combination of the two.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;Mathematical Platonism also doesn't (obviously) have the resources
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;to keep &quot;worlds&quot; separate.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Sure it does. Different Turing machine programs are mathematical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;objects,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; no?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Different substrings within TM programmes can be identical, no ?
</em><br />
<br />Sure, but you still aren't explaining how this suggests beings in one 
<br />
program would have knowledge of programs different from their own. Obviously 
<br />
if you had two simulations which behaved identically in some region of 
<br />
simulated space and time, then simulated observers within these regions 
<br />
would have identical experiences, but they are still both experiencing 
<br />
things which happen in their own simulation, they have no knowedge of events 
<br />
which don't correspond to anything in their simulation, which is what you 
<br />
seemed to be suggesting earlier when you claimed that if the &quot;everything&quot; 
<br />
idea was right we should be able to observe events in alternate worlds which 
<br />
didn't happen in our own world.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Bearing in mind that the physical  universe provides us with a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mechanism --
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;spatio-temporal location -- which allows identical things to be kept
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;separate,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and which doesn't exit in Platonia.
</em><br />
<br />But we're not talking about keeping identical things separate, we're talking 
<br />
about keeping *different* things separate, namely different worlds within 
<br />
the &quot;everything&quot; (like a lawlike universe vs. a universe that obeys one set 
<br />
of laws up to a given moment but then switches over to totally different 
<br />
'Harry Potter' laws after that moment).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  If you run a particular Turing machine program which contains
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; intelligent beings, will they somehow have psychic knowledge of what's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; happening in other distinct programs? Obviously not, we could run the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; program on a real computer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;uh-uh! Real programmes are run at distinct spatio-temporal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;locations. They don't exist in Platonia.
</em><br />
<br />But the programs themselves are distinct, just like the integers 8 and 9 are 
<br />
distinct. Are you saying that we can have no concept of 8 and 9 being 
<br />
different numbers without referring to specific collections of 8 objects and 
<br />
9 objects at different spatio-temporal locations? If you're not saying this, 
<br />
what makes programs any different from integers? After all, you can make a 
<br />
one-to-one mapping between the set of all integers and the set of all turing 
<br />
machine programs.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  and see that the beings have no such mysterious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; knowledge, and barring errors the ideal &quot;Platonic&quot; program should have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; same output as the 'physical' instantiation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;That is beside the point. The question is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;waht it woould feel like to be in the programme.
</em><br />
<br />Unless you are an extreme mind/body dualist, the feelings and thoughts of a 
<br />
being in a computer program should correspond to the type of 
<br />
information-processing going on in his simulated brain, and should generally 
<br />
correspond to what the simulated being claims to be experiencing within the 
<br />
simulation. If he doesn't say he's experiencing an infinite number of 
<br />
universes at once when you examine the program's output, then you can 
<br />
probably assume he isn't. Of course there is still the issue of whether he's 
<br />
actually &quot;experiencing&quot; anything at all, or whether he's a philosophical 
<br />
zombie with no qualia at all (see 
<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_zombie">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_zombie</a> ).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ('physical' from the perspective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of the most fundamental laws of our universe, which could itself be a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; program running in a bigger universe or in 'Platonia').
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The laws of physics, then, are &quot;in&quot; the programme -- not vice--versa.
</em><br />
<br />I don't understand this comment. What would it mean for the program to be in 
<br />
the laws of physics? And what relation does this have to the context of my 
<br />
claim that 'barring errors the ideal &quot;Platonic&quot; program should have the same 
<br />
output as the 'physical' instantiation'?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No multiverse theory predicts that observers should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have an omniscient view of all universes, they only see the one they 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; living in.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;All mathematical multiverse theories have the implication that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;I have many identical counterparts.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;Identical&quot; only to the extent they are experiencing the exact same 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;things
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; you are.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Nope. Also identical in that they share all my memories up
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;until time T , when things turn Harry Potter.
</em><br />
<br />OK, but the point is that the version of you in the universe where the laws 
<br />
of nature *didn't* change after time T is no longer identical to the version 
<br />
of you in the universe where they did, and there's no reason that you in the 
<br />
non-Harry-Potter universe would have any awareness of what he's experiencing 
<br />
at this moment.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; There's no reason to think that counterparts basically similar to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; you but having different experiences (say, of a hippogriff flying 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;through
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the window) would have some sort of psychic knowledge of each other.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;They would share my memories, identify themselves as me,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and so on. There would be counterparts which have my memories
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;up to time T, then an outpurst of HP, then normal memories from time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;T+1 onwards.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, I agree. But again, the version of you in the universe with no HP 
<br />
events would not have any awareness of them.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have my doubts that philosophers of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mathematics would see the categories described here as mutually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;exclusive.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For example, a formalist, to the extent he believes there is an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;objective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; truth about whether certain statements are derivable from a set of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;axioms
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and rules of inference, is just a species of platonist as I would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;define
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;it;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;which is not how eeverybody else defines it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; If not, then perhaps that's just because they don't in fact think that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;formalism&quot; means believing there's an objective truth about whether a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;given
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; statement is derivable from a given set of axioms.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It's because they do think Platonism means numbers exist in some sense.
</em><br />
<br />Only in the sense that they must be included in an exhaustive list of 
<br />
objective truths about reality. Again, my understanding is that this 
<br />
basically is how most analytic philosophers would *define* existence, 
<br />
including philosophers studying philosophy-of-math.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; If you are claiming that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;everybody&quot; does think that formalists believe this, yet they are still 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; considered &quot;Platonists&quot; in any way, I'd like to see some evidence for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; claim.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Formalism is alaways cited as a different position to Platonism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mathematics">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mathematics</a>
</em><br />
<br />I didn't just ask for evidence that formalists and Platonists are different, 
<br />
I asked for evidence that there is anyone who considers them completely 
<br />
different but who *also* understands &quot;formalists&quot; to be acknowledging that 
<br />
there are objective mind-independent truths about whether a given formal 
<br />
system produces a given theorem (as opposed to just understanding 
<br />
'formalists' to be saying that mathematics is a game we humans play with 
<br />
deriving theorems from axiomatic systems, without making any claims that 
<br />
there is an objective truth about whether our derivations are 'correct' or 
<br />
not).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;But if any non-Platonic hteory is correct, truths do not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;need to refer.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Can you provide a quote or citation for the idea that any philosophers 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; math subscribe to a view where there are objective truths about 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; objects yet the statements do not refer?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;Logicism is the thesis that mathematics is reducible to logic, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;hence nothing but a part of logic (Carnap 1931/1883, 41). Logicists
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;hold that mathematics can be known a priori, but suggest that our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;knowledge of mathematics is just part of our knowledge of logic in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;general, and is thus analytic, not requiring any special faculty of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mathematical intuition&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mathematics">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mathematics</a>
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK, but are you assuming that purely logical statements don't refer?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;The idea that mathematical truths cannot have been different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;can be supporte without any appeal to ontology.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Again, not if you define existence and ontology in the way I am doing, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; have serious doubts that there is another way to define these terms in a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that is coherent and which does not lead to a kind of ontological 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;relativism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; where what is &quot;objectively true&quot; can differ for different observers.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;You are just building your conckusion into your definitions.
</em><br />
<br />As I said earlier, this criticism would only make sense if we had some prior 
<br />
notion of &quot;existence&quot;, and I was trying to make the argument that objective 
<br />
truth necessarily implies this prior notion. But I'm not, I'm just defining 
<br />
the word &quot;existence&quot; in terms of objective truths, because I can't think of 
<br />
any way to define the word that seems coherent and which doesn't lead to 
<br />
bizarre conclusions like &quot;nothing exists beyond the boundaries of the 
<br />
observable universe&quot; (except possibly for the notion of equating existence 
<br />
with consciousness, which might make sense and would potentially allow for 
<br />
mathematical structures containing intelligent observers which nevertheless 
<br />
don't 'exist'). I agree that if we define &quot;existence&quot; in your way, 
<br />
mathematical objects do not exist. I just don't think your way of defining 
<br />
it is how most philosophers would define it, particularly the analytic 
<br />
philosophers who study philosophy of mathematics; most of them would define 
<br />
it in a way more similar to mine, I think. This is a sociological question 
<br />
rather than a philosophical one, I suppose we'd have to do a poll or 
<br />
something to be sure.
