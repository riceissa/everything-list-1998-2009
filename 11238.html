<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So I ask again HOW would we act DIFFERENTLY if we acted &quot;as-if&quot; MIND
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; EXISTED.  So far
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the only difference I SEE is writing a lot of stuff in CAPS.

<br />FIRSTLY
<br />
Formally we would investigate new physics of underlying reality such as
<br />
this:
<br />

<br />
and Matter: Nova Publishers.

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
---------------------------------------
<br />
Instead of competing with traditional 'appearances' physics we go straight
<br />
to brain material and make it construct atom behaviour, molecule, cell
<br />
behaviour...etc and look at what behaviours might correspond to whatever it
<br />
is that functions as phenomenal consciousness in brain material.
<br />
<br />Currently this physics (of an underlying structure) is ignored because all
<br />
it does is compete with alternate mainstream physics on its own turf.
<br />
Instead the physics needs to go to where mainstream physics is voiceless and
<br />
impotent by definition - consciousness - and predict brain material
<br />
behaviour. This is its validity and its unique entrée into acceptability.
<br />
=========================================
<br />
<br />SECONDLY
<br />
Computationally we would investigate the same systems using cellular
<br />
automata:
<br />
---------------------
<br />
Wolfram S. 2002. A new kind of science. Champaign, IL: Wolfram Media. xiv,
<br />
1197 p.
<br />
---------------------
<br />
....and ask the one question Wolfram failed to ask: &quot;What is it like to be a
<br />
cellular automata&quot;.... one that makes atoms, space and higher level
<br />
structures (like our universe). Also we need to work on CAs of the cell
<br />
types based on noise/fluctuation as per Cahill. CAs that construct their own
<br />
cells and cell rules at higher and higher levels of complexity - free
<br />
running CAs.
<br />
==================================
<br />
<br />Currently both these techniques and people are eschewed as invalid for no
<br />
reason other than the virtual solipsism I have been talking about. Both of
<br />
these folks have viable things to say about consciousness that mainstream
<br />
physics can&#x2019;t. And they don&#x2019;t realise it and they don&#x2019;t understand why they
<br />
have trouble with acceptance. The reason they are not accepted is that they
<br />
are 
<br />
<br />a) working on models of an underlying reality 
<br />
and
<br />
b) do not realise the implications in consciousness studies 
<br />
and
<br />
c) are competing with traditional explanations when they shouldn&#x2019;t be
<br />
<br />so....
<br />
<br />The reason they don't get listened to is 
<br />
because
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;underlying physics is regarded as unscientific
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;eschewed as 'mere metaphysics'
<br />
because
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;they think there's no evidence
<br />
because
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;they don&#x2019;t realise the underlying physics is causing mind
<br />
..not laws derived using it
<br />
because
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;They think mind will be explained by models of appearances
<br />
Because 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;They haven't realised/accept mind as evidence in its own right
<br />
<br />= mind does not exist
<br />
<br />= as-if solipsism.
<br />
<br />This situation stems form the Kantian era when the noumenon was accepted
<br />
(now erroneously) as proven to be scientifically intractable. Modern
<br />
neuroscience shows it to be not intractable. We know where 'mind' is. The
<br />
underlying reality is not as unknowable.... the assumption of direct access
<br />
(=knowability) is still with us. In summary
<br />
<br />KANTIAN VIEW (single aspect, unsituated science)
<br />
a) Phenomenon	External reality: 	ACCESSED, KNOWABLE
<br />
b) Noumenon		Underlying reality	INACCESSIBLE, UNKNOWABLE
<br />
&lt;inconsistent attitude to evidence source&gt;
<br />
<br />MODERN VIEW (dual aspect, situated science)
<br />
a) Phenomenon	External reality: 	ACCESSIBLE, LIMITED KNOWABILITY
<br />
b) Noumenon		Underlying reality	ACCESSIBLE, LIMITED
<br />
KNOWABILITY
<br />
&lt;consistent attitude to evidence source&gt;
<br />
<br />Science currently is a 250 year old museum to the Kantian model. The key is
<br />
simply that our scientific evidence model needs to be fixed. None of the
<br />
existing empirical laws (a) are invalidated by this approach. They all stay
<br />
the same. QM, the lot ...Only their explanatory scope is questioned. They
<br />
are recognised as fundamentally prevented from dealing with consciousness
<br />
because they are derived FROM it. We lose nothing - indeed the existing laws
<br />
(a) are valuable constraints in (b) because whatever model for (b) we derive
<br />
must simultaneously provide appearances in which all (a) will be observable.
<br />
This is a highly constrained simultaneous equation, in effect. Both (a) and
<br />
(b) are tied at the hip by phenomenal consciousness. The two descriptive
<br />
domains form the basis for what I have called 'dual aspect science'.
<br />
<br />That&#x2019;s exactly what, how, why, when, where and who in the bare practical
<br />
reality of it. The fundamental difference is that class (a) folks derive
<br />
laws of appearances eg quantum mechanics and (b) folks work on systems of
<br />
things that behave quantum mechanically when viewed by a viewer made of it.
<br />
<br />This is a cultural problem. We are already doing both sorts of physics. We
<br />
just don&#x2019;t realise the full implications/context of it in a brain context.
<br />
We need to rescue the real noumenon physicists from the metaphysics/space
<br />
cadet purgatory they inhabit and simply listen to them make predictions
<br />
nowhere else but in brain material. That is their trump card. Conversely
<br />
phenomenon physicists must put themselves back inside the universe and get
<br />
over the assumed 100% access to 100% of truth and back it off to 100% access
<br />
to 50% of the KNOWABLE truth in a science where we honestly deal with the
<br />
evidence source: phenomenal consciousness.
<br />
<br />I can&#x2019;t put it any clearer than this. I have been working within this model.
<br />
Within it qualia are EASY. I can predict them formally and computationally
<br />
in CAs. Qualia are possible in the entire class of physics that results from
<br />
structured noise of the Cahill (Prigogine) kind.
<br />
<br />It took way longer to work out why science hadn't done it already. It was my
<br />
problem - I naturally thought in (b) terms because I have never been in
<br />
science before and had my structural evidentiary blindness installed. Go ask
<br />
any wet neuroscientist (physiology/anatomy) about studying
<br />
consciousness...and in about 10 milliseconds you'll get a lecture on
<br />
evidence based on the Kantian museum-piece evidence system. Then that
<br />
neuroscientist will walk off and demand all their novices use phenomenal
<br />
consciousness to get their evidence..... It's all so weird.
