<br /><br />Hence a Reality, yes. But not necessarily a physical reality.
<br />
Perhaps I should ask you what do you mean by a physical reality, and how
<br />
do you explain the presence of &quot;qualia&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  I don't think I could have know the notion of number without physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  context, but this does not logically imply that numbers *arise* from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  physical context.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I see now you appear to have change your thinking from the last time I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;said this,
</em><br />
<br /><br />Not at all. I was even repeating myself. Here is the logical dependence:
<br />
<br />NUMBERS -&gt; &quot;MACHINE DREAMS&quot; -&gt; PHYSICAL -&gt; HUMANS -&gt; PHYSICS -&gt; NUMBERS.
<br />
<br />Numbers appears and reappears enfolded in histories without ends. But they
<br />
are the simplest thing which I cannot imagine falsified. I would lie to
<br />
myself accepting that the truth of Fermat proposition or of Goldbach
<br />
conjecture, depends on me or on us.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Nore can you imply the opposite, it is harder to prove since where 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ever you go your within it!
</em><br />
<br /><br />Sure. 100% OK! But neither Newton nor Schroedinger would have dreamed
<br />
&quot;proving&quot; F+MA or SWE. What is the point? This shows only we have not the same
<br />
theory (although we have the same realist philosophy, I think).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;How can he since he is made of it and even if he discovers what you have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;there how can he tell if there isnt more to it and that this is just an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;abstraction???
</em><br />
<br /><br />Perhaps I underestimate the importance of uda, but uda shows exactly this.
<br />
The invariance of first-person impressions for any third person transformation
<br />
(respecting functionnal description at some level) entails that we must sum up
<br />
on all virtual realities. Even the holopeople should be able to 
<br />
extract SWE, or whatever is physically true, from the comp hyp. And a 
<br />
minority of them will
<br />
conclude in non comp only if you have manage to falsify him/her in 
<br />
some perverse
<br />
way. This is theoretical, you will succeed only if
<br />
you know the measure on consistent histories allowed by comp and if you use it
<br />
to (perversely) falsify his inferences. And that will be an infinite game.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Machine implies Physical does it not without a Context system based or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Physical this would not have been discovered and can be operated upon?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Church thesis makes any UM a potentially universal context.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Dont confuse Physical with just fixed Classical rules?
</em><br />
<br />?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;What kick back are part which we name words numbers etc.... and these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are abstraction of different things some of which we group differently?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I dont see people saying when a rock hits them oh there that 2 AGIAN. ;D
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Nor do I say that when I am hit by a rock in a dream. The number 2 is more
<br />
solid than the Hilbert Space or any algebra needed to describe a rock. IMO.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;[Bruno]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  Of course we will never be sure of any theory (but that is not the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  point, is it?).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  Nor can we solve all questions. For exemple we cannot solve the question
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  of the origin of natural numbers.
</em><br />
<br />[Gordon]
<br />
Patterns you mean all depends on how you look at things?
<br />
<br />Not at all. &quot;17 is prime&quot; does not depend on any point of view.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;psychology Hmm I dont recall that being a science yet?
</em><br />
<br /><br />I mean the logic of provability by sound universal machine. Psychology is
<br />
more short and actually more correct, with the hyp comp (nobody ask you to
<br />
buy it). The first fundamental theorem in &quot;computationnalist&quot; psychology
<br />
is that IF we are consistent THEN we cannot prove it (Godel 1931).
<br />
The first consequence of that, with respect to the mind-body problem, is
<br />
that the geometry/topology/algebra of our *consistent* extensions is quite
<br />
non trivial.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Agreed we are alike in some ways but our differences are more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interesting dont you agree?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Only if there is a genuine attempt to understand the difference :) Isn't it?
<br />
Remember my &quot;proposition&quot; (that we are machine) is testable.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I shall and thanks has for not using Hilbert space ...
</em><br />
<br />That's another thread but why are you so angry with Hilbert Space?
<br />
Are you angry with vector space too? How to dispense with them at
<br />
the beginning (at least).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Also David Peat Certainty to Uncertianty, Ian stewarts Collapse of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Chaos, these last to are more Philosophy based and cover a wide area,and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;show how it had to escape and see Reality outline.Why I think it best to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;develop within Reality and try to bring different Knowlegde together and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;from there see whats beyond other wise we end up going round in circle
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;which is what NON-Reality group have done for 50 years.Aprat from your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;self who aleast try to put somthing behind it!
</em><br />
<br /><br />I insist: I do not belong to the NON-reality view. You must not
<br />
conflate a priori &quot;Reality&quot; and &quot;Physical Reality&quot;. Unless you *postulate*
<br />
at the start that the physical is the fundamental, but then we should
<br />
not even discuss, isn't it?
<br />
Now I *do* believe in Physical Reality. But I do not believe Physical Reality
<br />
is fundamental. Well, actually I don't know: I just say that IF we are
<br />
machine then &quot;Physical Reality&quot; *cannot* be fundamental, and *must* be
<br />
explained by some measure on our relative consistent extensions.
<br />
<br />It is not because I need eyes to see the moon that the moon needs
<br />
my eyes to exist. It is not because I need a brain for playing with numbers
<br />
that numbers needs my brain for existing. Nor your's, with my respect :)
<br />
<br />It is more easy to explain the mind/moon/eyes relations from numbers than
<br />
explaining relation between numbers from the mind/moon/eyes relations.
<br />
<br />But even if that was less easy, with comp it is not a matter of choice,
<br />
(if you disagree it is up to you finding a flaw in the uda reasoning).
