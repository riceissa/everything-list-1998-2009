Jamie, 
<br />
thanks for the post in parts to my points (e.g. the &quot;changing of definitions&quot; semantically reformulates my position nicely - without the 'atom'-example, of course)

<br />
Sponging the 'gedanken..' - the falling treebranch reflects in your version the omniscient arrogant reductionist position. I go with Popper: no evidence, because we cannot encompass 'totality'  (my conclusion). 

<br />
I would'nt go to the primitive mechanistic AI-levels to learn about mentality unlimited. Bits (and pieces) for unrestricted relations. 
<br />
AI simulates (mechanically?) certain aspects of human mentality - up to a limited fashion. 

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;I put it to you that this is 
</em><br />
exactly the relational key to understanding Csness.&quot;&lt;
<br />
--- understanding what? (I know well MY abbreviation). 

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot; &quot;Imagine youself floating totally alone in a lightless, energyless universe, with no external anything - to gauge anything by. Not motion not anything. ...&quot; What purpose would consciousness serve? &quot;&lt;
</em><br />
I cannot imagine neither 'such' myself nor the situation at all. 

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;Consciousness is only of utile value in situations where self encounters else.&quot;&lt;
</em><br />
I think you speak about sentience, miss the 'response' activity I feel within the (unidentified) majority of the Ccness ideas. What you described is in my terms &quot;information&quot;: some acknowledged  difference. And what do you mean  by &quot;s e l f &quot;?  (I really would like to know - one of the topics of my long speculations).

<br />
Then again 'complexity' (I believe you use it here in form of the term 'convolutedness/complexness' not the Rosen-totality sense) is as primitive as little we include into its model (system). And you mention 'Universe&quot; - I prefer plenitude, from which arose the multiverse in its unlimited variety of universes. It's only semantic. 

<br />
What is that 'spacetime' you mention? I know it 'has' a fabric, but otherwise I consider it an organizational aid for our universe to &quot;understand&quot; its details in our physically-based reductionist view.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;John,

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;My email pgm sometimes (as now) balks at quote/copying 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;material from emails I'm replying to.  So I'll do as best
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;to reply without having your exact words to refer to.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;re Bruno's inquiring about how I link changes of inertia
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;to Csness, I'll do that in a few days.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;re Gendankens - I won't waste time debating you. The only 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;thing that's important about gedankens is that they
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;isolate and highlight certain relationships which seem
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;important to the line of inquiry. If real-event scenarios
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&amp; analogs can be used - all the better. But if invented,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;that's not criminal or necessarily 'conceptually illegal'
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;:-) .. serves the inquiry and 'what if' exploration of 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;relations, I WOULD SAY.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;re 'falling branch/tree', yes it came to be 'experienced
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;sound' versus 'generated wave' - but originally, it was
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;a clear 'existential' question: can a thing 'exist' if
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;something else doesn't experience the effects OF that
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;first thing's existence.   Ie: if science hasn't acknowledged
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;something experimentally/experientially, then the 'something'
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;has no verity or validity.  No 'proof', no existence.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, there is a conflated/confused definition of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;'proof'; it now embraces: 'explanation' and independent record.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;re Csness=data storage.  Yes, you no longer count it sufficient for
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Csness.  But a lot of folks do, especially AI researchers.  They 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;presume that 'memory reconstitution' is equal to Csness reconstitution.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And that's not the case.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;re femto coma-awakening-death.  it may be the gedanken you may find
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;frustrating, and then cast it aside as 'unknowable', and if
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;unknowable, then ..SOWHAT&quot;, but I put it to you that this is 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;exactly the relational key to understanding Csness.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the limit of us, or any system for that matter, to wholistically
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;'experience itself'.   That was the opening concept notion I put forth
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;in Understanding the Integral Universe.  &quot;Imagine youself floating
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;totally alone in a lightless, energyless universe, with no external
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;anything - to gauge anything by. Not motion not anything. ...&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What purpose would consciousness serve?  .. It wouldn't. Consciousness
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;is only of utile value in situations where self encounters else.&quot;

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I keep on that track of logic for a while, parsing away until
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;concluding that anykind of 'response' can be embraced as a
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;'primitive consciousness' - no matter that its not
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;complex or re-reportable/transmittable/sharable.  But it's
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;at that extreme, that I conclude that any holistic system,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;even if minimalized in complexness of architecture, can
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;be projected to be holistically self-sensitive in an
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;information disseminational way.  That the formative 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;entity: spacetime - it already presumed non-discontinuous.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;That continuousness is the stage for disseminated information,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;where changes of time, motion, fields, forces, waves --
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;least action -- constitute a 'sharing' of change-information.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Batesonian minimal'bit'.  Reliant on the smallest 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;spacetime 'change' .. which is identifiable as some or 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;any change-of-inertia event.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;[ok Bruno, I guess here is a good portion of what you were 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;asking about].

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;My main goal was this:  find a reasonable comprehension for
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;primitives that could develop into complexities - have a 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;core foundation of simple 'relations' that -become- 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;human/animal sentience.  Bridge the realms of physics
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;and biology, without breaking the known/presumed relations
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;already identified.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Only I had to make one crucial change in definitions.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;The universe is not dichotomized nonliving/living.  It is
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;dichotomized preliving/living.  The qualia we find in 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;living systems ARE PRESENT in pre-animate systems, only
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;they are there in simple basic preparatives forms.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;My favorite example being the valence shells of atoms.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;These are relationally and effectively the &quot;lungs&quot; of 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;an atom - able to fill (inhale) an electron, and 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;unfill (exhale) an electron.  Do atoms actively 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;flex these 'cavities' to capture/exude electrons?  No,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;absolutely not. But life 'breathes', if and only if 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;atoms chemically transfer electrons by moving them
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;into and out of valence shelled arrangements.  Life
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;'breathes' because atoms breathe.  Atoms aren't 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;'alive', but we couldn't be either unless that
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;shared/similar function-relation was fundamentally 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;there in the first place.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;The same goes for Csness.  The universe is a 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;fundamentally pansentient organization with many
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;levels of sentient compleness and self-awareness.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;We humans, are part of the sentient capacity of the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;universe to 'understand itself'.  We aren't a separate
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;mentality exploring an &quot;it&quot; -- 'out there';  we ARE
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;a piece of the 'it' exploring the other parts of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the It.  We are the universe attempting to not
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;just experience itself, but to understand itself - in 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;a novel, different, available, way.
