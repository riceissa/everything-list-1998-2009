<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  at all.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I'm not sure what the right way to define a universe is yet. For example I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;don't know if the definition should allow uncomputable universes, and if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;so how. But I have at least two starting points, Schmidhuber's and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Tegmark's definitions, both of which while flawed at least make sense to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;me. I am still unable to really understand yours.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Have you understand what I call the invariance lemma? (The fact that
<br />
if I am multiplied into 1000 copies in a whole space-time decor, real,
<br />
virtual or arithmetical) the measure of comp indeterminacy depends
<br />
only on &quot;1000&quot;).
<br />
Perhaps the trouble is that you are not really aware of the mind-body
<br />
problem?
<br />
I don't yet understand how Schmidhuber attach the mind to its computa-
<br />
tional history.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;First I question the necessity of defining that average.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />This is where the list splits in two. Those aware of a measure problem
<br />
and the other ... It is linked to our all debate between RSSA and ASSA
<br />
(Relative Self-Sampling Assumption/Absolute SSA).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Suppose we just ignored the issue of first person indeterminancy, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;made no reference to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it at all. Speak only in third-person terms about the future. Why can't we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;just do that?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Because we want to understand the nature of reality and where does it comes
<br />
from. Consciousness is part of the data we must explain, physicals laws
<br />
also. With comp the laws emerge from the relation between numbers, but as
<br />
seen from inside, so that I don't see how to avoid the modal distinctions in
<br />
a search toward a toe. I think you fail to appreciate the &quot;proof&quot; character
<br />
of the uda.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Second, why do you restrict yourself to interviewing sound machines? I'm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sure I'm not a sound machine, yet I am an conscious observer. So I'm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;confused. Why do you ignore most of the conscious observers who are not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sound machines?
</em><br />
<br /><br />I'm not sure you are not a sound machine especially when proving
<br />
things on numbers. In the worst case take my &quot;restriction&quot; as a
<br />
simplifying assumption. But I don't think there is any restriction here.
<br />
The amazing fact is that the sound machine has (through the Z logics) an
<br />
amazingly large non-monotonical layer. Remember that &quot;inconsistency&quot; has
<br />
been shown consistent in Peano Arithmetic, ZF theory, etc. Sound machines,
<br />
sound at the basic level I interrogate them, can be consistently very unsound
<br />
once entangled to deep computational histories. I am taking the full nuance
<br />
given by the second incompleteness theorem into account here.
<br />
You would be really unsound, through my basic use of the term, only if you
<br />
were able to give a finite proof of a false proposition, not just pretend
<br />
you could find it.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;When I first thought about the issue of duplication, I was on a similar
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;track - there's first person indeterminancy, so let's figure out how to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;quantify it. But then I realized it's not necessary, because we can just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reason and make decisions in third person terms. Why complicate things
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;beyond what's needed?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Because with comp the relation between our first person inspired decisions
<br />
and third person (or first person plural) realities remains to be explained.
<br />
The comp indeterminacy, by the invariance lemma, pertains on the whole
<br />
of UD* (the computationalist form of everything).
<br />
Of course you can forget comp, postulate a reality (defined by what you
<br />
see and expect to see) and take your decisions. But we are looking for
<br />
a toe, not a recipe for life. You don't need quantum gravity for everyday
<br />
decision do you? But you can imagine quantum gravity being related to the
<br />
search of a TOE, ok? Well, what I try to say is that if you take seriously
<br />
the hypothesis that our private experience are invariant for functional
<br />
substitution at some level, then the utimate explanation of quantum gravity
<br />
is accessible by UTMS pure introspection, and that the toe is a mixture
<br />
of machine's machine psychology (G), and machine psychology (G*).
<br />
The advantage of my way is that it gives an explanation for the origin
<br />
of physical laws and at the same time of physical sensations. It has no direct
<br />
use in decision theory, except perhaps by predicting new phenomena, perhaps
<br />
exploitable, like any new theory.
<br />
No doubt I make simplifications here and there, but what remains is
<br />
very complex and unknown. I would be glad if someone find a flaw or some
<br />
implicit hypothesis I use unconsciously ...
<br />
<br />About Schmidhuber's toe, perhaps you could try to explain me how you keep
<br />
being in the same computation in front of the invariance lemma, knowing
<br />
that all computations exist.
