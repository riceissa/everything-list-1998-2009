<br />It still seems like we're talking about the same thing. Its just that
<br />
in the myth case, there is no explanation for the creativity, it is
<br />
merely asserted at the start. I have little interest in myths, but I
<br />
recognise that the omniscient being in those stories is being creative
<br />
in exactly the was as evolution is being creative at producing new species.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) The creativity ascribed to the act of procreation.
</em><br />
<br />Well I admit that pornographers are a pretty creative bunch, but what
<br />
is so creative about reproducing?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3) The pseudo-magical aspects of human creativity (the scientific ah-ha
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moment and the artistic gestalt moment).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and pehaps...
</em><br />
<br />Human creativity is an interesting topic, but I wouldn't call it
<br />
pseudo-magical. Poorly understood, more like it. Comparing creativity in
<br />
evolutionary processes and the human creative process is likely to
<br />
improve that understanding.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4) Belief in 'magical emergence' .... qualitative novelty of a kind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; utterly unrelated to the componentry.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />The latter clause refers to &quot;emergence&quot; (without the &quot;magical&quot;
<br />
qualifier), and it is impossible IMHO to have creativity without emergence.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; These are all slippery slopes leading from the usage of the word
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'creativity' which could unexpectedly undermine the specificity of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; technical discourse aimed at a wider (multi-disciplinary) audience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />Aside from the easily disposed of reproduction case, you haven't come
<br />
up with an example of creativity meaning anything other than what
<br />
we've agreed it to mean.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The system (a) automatically prescibes certain trajectories and 
</em><br />
<br />Yes.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; (b)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumes that the theroem space [and] natural world are the same space and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; equivalently accessed. 
</em><br />
<br />No - but the system will adjust its model according to feedback. That
<br />
is the very nature of any learning algorithm, of which EP is just one example.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The assumption is that hooking up a chemistry set
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; replicates the 'wild-type' theorem prover that is the natural world. If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you could do that then you already know everything there is to know (about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the natural world) and there'd be no need do it in the first place. This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is the all-time ultimate question-begger...
</em><br />
<br />Not at all. In Evolutionary Programming, very little is known about the
<br />
ultimate solution the algorithm comes up with.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Theoretical scientists, do not have laboratories to interface to,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; though, only online repositories of datasets and papers. A theoretical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; algorithmic scientist is a more likely proposition.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A belief that an algorithmic scientist is doing valid science on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; natural world (independent of any human) is problematic in that it assumes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that human cortical qualia play no part in the scientific process in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; face of easily available evidence to the contrary, and then doubly assumes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the algorithmic scientist (with a novelty exploration -theorem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proving strategy-programmed by a human) somehow naturally replicates the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; neglected functionality (role of cortical qualia).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />Your two &quot;assumptions&quot; are contradictory. I would say no to the first,
<br />
and yes to the second.
<br />
<br />...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;It is therefore not at all clear to me that some n-th
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; improvement on an evolutionary algorithm won't be considered conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at some time in the future. It is not at all clear which aspects of human
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cortical systems are required for consciousness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You are not alone. This is an epidemic.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My scientific claim is that the electromagnetic field structure literally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the third person view of qualia. 
</em><br />
<br />Eh? Electromagnetic field of what? The brain? If so, do you think that
<br />
chemical potentiation plays no role at all in qualia?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is not new. What is new is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understanding the kind of universe we inhabit in which that is necessarily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the case. It's right there, in the cells. Just ask the right question of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them. There's nothing else there but space (mostly), charge and mass - all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things delineated and described by consciousness as how they appear to it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - and all such descriptions are logically necessarily impotent in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prescribing why that very consciousness exists at all.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Wigner got this in 1960something.... time to catch up.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />I don't know what your point is here ...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; gotta go....
