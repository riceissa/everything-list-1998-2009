<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not to try to answer the Puzzle, but just some thoughts for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conversation:
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />That's the right spirit!
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; At one glance, it seems that the argument is trying to transcend
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Godel's Incompleteness theorems.  The Universal Language is trying to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be both universal (complete) and consistent.
</em><br />
<br /><br />The Universal Language is trying to be universal, and actually will  
<br />
succeed, if we accept Church thesis. That is, concrete languages like  
<br />
fortran, python, java, c++ .... , which can all be proved equivalent  
<br />
with respect to the ability to define *computable functions*, *are*  
<br />
universal once we accept Church thesis.
<br />
But now let me say something quite important. The term &quot;consistent&quot; is  
<br />
not genuinely used here. Consistency is said about a THEORY, and until  
<br />
now we are just talking about &quot;programming language&quot; or machine. A  
<br />
theory is inconsistent if it proves a falsity, but a programming  
<br />
language just prove nothing. There is no axioms, nor any inference  
<br />
rules. There is no theory (not yet!); just primitive instructions which  
<br />
can be used to explain how to compute functions and which can be  
<br />
interpreted by some entities/machines.
<br />
I am not saying your intuition fails you completely because we are  
<br />
indeed very near a proof of incompleteness theorem for ALL *theories*,  
<br />
but this will be a consequence (here) of accepting Church thesis, and  
<br />
thus understanding how fortran (say) can escape the use of  
<br />
diagonalization for going outside the sequence of functions defined in  
<br />
the language. That is, at some point you will see that incompleteness  
<br />
of theories, i.e. with respect to provability, is a consequence of  
<br />
completeness of universal machine/language, that is with respect to  
<br />
computability.
<br />
Of course you make me anticipating a little bit, but once you will see  
<br />
that Church thesis CT can be consistently assumed despite the  
<br />
diagonalization, you will see that (with CT):
<br />
<br />1) the notion of COMPUTABILITY is ABSOLUTE, and will not depend on any  
<br />
choice of (universal) language, formal system or machine: there exist  
<br />
universal languages (or machines), and they are all equivalent with  
<br />
respect of the definable, codable, describable, computable functions.
<br />
<br />but then as a consequence (and that's a part of the price):
<br />
<br />2) the notion of PROVABILITY is necessarily RELATIVE, and will always  
<br />
depend on the choice of a particular formal system or machines. In  
<br />
particular there will never be any universal theory, even if the  
<br />
discourse domain is restricted just to positive integers or natural  
<br />
numbers.
<br />
<br />Ah. You see computer science is nice: it assesses both the relativist,  
<br />
at the level of theories and proof, and the absolutist, at the level of  
<br />
programming languages and computations.
<br />
<br />A good understanding of this will help you later to get a better  
<br />
appreciation of G and G*, which show that, although provability is a  
<br />
relative notion, there are universal feature of provability which can  
<br />
be captured by some modal logics.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This Puzzle seems to corresponding to part of Step 7 in your Universal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dovetailer Argument (UDA).  In that Step, you perhaps answer the Puzzle
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so I don't want to simply quote the answer, which might short-circuit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my/our understanding.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I'm not sure. Step seven introduces the UD and thus relies on Church  
<br />
thesis and I suppose people already knows why the UD and CT is possible  
<br />
despite diagonalization.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  But I have a problem with answering that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; programs which conclude that 0 = 1 simply run forever.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Couldn't you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; build any &quot;complete&quot; system or theories by simply letting programs run
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; forever.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You seem to be close to the right idea here ...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This seems to be an artificial/arbitrary path to the truth.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Couldn't you conclude whatever you want with this method?  Perhaps I'm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just proving your point.
</em><br />
<br /><br />... but a little bit less here :)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; PS Rereading some recent mails I wrote, I am ashamed of my style (when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I complete a sentences!) and by my enduring mishandling of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; singular/plural (the &quot;s&quot; problem). Please accept my apologies, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; don't hesitate to correct me or to ask questions in front of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ambiguities. Thanks for the interest anyway.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is probably mainly because of English being not your native
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; language.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Alas this is only partially true. Well, perhaps it is due to my use of  
<br />
both english and french all the time, but I have a tendency to mess up  
<br />
the &quot;s&quot; in french too. The &quot;s&quot; rule are 90% opposed in french and  
<br />
english.
<br />
A deeper explanation could perhaps be related to .... the  
<br />
reason-&amp;-person thread! Once you allow, like Parfit and some people in  
<br />
this list to do thought experiments in which amnesia is accepted, then,  
<br />
as I have already try to explain to Lee Corbin some month ago, you will  
<br />
converge toward the idea that there is only one person possible. For  
<br />
example, if you think that after a duplication Washington/Moscow both  
<br />
of &quot;you&quot; continue to be you *at the first person*, then you should  
<br />
already accept that all the descendants of the amoeba, that is all of  
<br />
us, are in reality the same person. Put in another way, personal memory  
<br />
is capital for personal identity. (I have discovered recently in a book  
<br />
by Guthrie that the Pytahgorean already insisted on that(*)). This  
<br />
should be true for individuals, nations, community, etc. This is  
<br />
obvious with my UDA definition of first person discourse which is just  
<br />
the content of a personal diary/memory. But this will appear as being  
<br />
less obvious once we interview the lobian machine, so that, although  
<br />
the UDA definition is enough to get the &quot;reversal&quot;, incompleteness will  
<br />
utimately justified that a non trivial notion of first person will  
<br />
emerge from incompleteness, I mean a notion of first person which  
<br />
relies not exclusively on personal memory.

<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; My familiarity with a few non-English Latin-based languages
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; helps in my understanding, I hope.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Thanks for trying anyway.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  If only there was a Universal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Language.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Church thesis *is* the statement that there is a universal language,  
<br />
for computation, and I hope you are not taking my &quot;refutation&quot; of  
<br />
Church thesis too much seriously. The &quot;refutation&quot; is wrong, I have  
<br />
really make an error (on purpose). The question is which one?
<br />
<br />You did thought at some moment that I was using the axiom of choice and  
<br />
that I was leaving the finite area and I told you I didn't. Indeed I  
<br />
did not even use the excluded middle principle and the transfinite  
<br />
extensions were all definable intuitionistically, that is  
<br />
constructively (indeed all the growing functions where programmable).
<br />
Now, to solve *the puzzle*, there is indeed a need to leave the  
<br />
constructive (intuitionist) area. Mathematicians do that all the time,  
<br />
even if not always consciously. Before proceeding let me ask you if you  
<br />
accept the following reasoning.
<br />
<br />Oh, I'm interrupted, and I will do it in another post asap. Still today  
<br />
I hope.
<br />
