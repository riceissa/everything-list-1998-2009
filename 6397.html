<em class="quotelev1">&gt; claimed &quot;an order of succession&quot;, if we are considering only events in

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; space-time that we can specify, e.g. take as a posteriori. What I am trying

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to argue is that we can not do this in the a priori case for reasons that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have to do with Heisenberg's Unceratanty Principle. Since it is impossible 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to construct a space-time hypersurface where each point has associated with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it all of the physical variables that we need to compute the entire global 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; manifold, from initial Big Bang singulary to the, possibly, infinite future, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it is a mistake to think of time simply as a coordinate. OTOH, it is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consistent if we are dealing with some particular situation and using 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Special (or General) Relativity theory to consider the behavious of clocks 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and rulers. ;-)
</em><br />
<br />I agree that in our particular universe the role of time is complex.
<br />
Since we don't have a unified theory yet, we really can't say anything
<br />
definitive about what time will turn out to be.  It's entirely possible
<br />
that time may yet turn out to be a simple coordinate.  Wolfram is pushing
<br />
ideas where the universe is modeled as a cellular automaton (CA) which
<br />
has discrete units of space and time.  Of course his theories don't
<br />
quite work yet, but then, nobody else's do, either.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     I am trying to include the implications of QM in my thinking and hence 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my point about time and my polemics against the idea of &quot;block&quot; space-time. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I do not care how eminent the person is that advocates the idea of Block 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; space-time, they are simply and provably wrong.
</em><br />
<br />In this universe, perhaps so, although as I argued above absent a true
<br />
and accurate theory of physics I don't agree that we can so assertively
<br />
say that block models are disproven.  But I do agree that a simple,
<br />
relativity-based block model (if such exists) is incomplete as a model
<br />
for our universe since it does not include QM.
<br />
<br />BTW there is also a block-universe type construction possible in QM.
<br />
Let phi(t) represent the state function of the entire universe at time t.
<br />
Then Schrodinger's equation H(phi) = i hbar d/dt(phi) shows how the
<br />
wave function will evolve.  It is determinstic and in a many worlds
<br />
interpretation this is all there is to the underlying physics.  So this
<br />
is a block-universe interpretation of QM.
<br />
<br />However, it is non relativistic.  From what I understand, a full marriage
<br />
of QM and special relativity requires quantum field theory, which is
<br />
beyond my knowledge so I don't know whether it can be thought of as a
<br />
block universe.  And then of course that still leaves gravitation and
<br />
the other phenomena of general relativity, where we have no theory at
<br />
all that works.  Whether it will be amenable to a block universe view
<br />
is still unknown as far as I understand.
<br />
<br />I don't see why you are so bound on rejecting block universes.  You just
<br />
don't like them?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     If you look around in the journals and books you will find discussion of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the implications of multiple-time dimensions.  For example:
</em><br />
<br />Sure, in fact I first learned of the idea from one of Tegmark's
<br />
papers, he who is unknowingly one of the founding fathers of this list.
<br />
<a href="http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/dimensions.html">http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/dimensions.html</a> describes his ideas
<br />
for why universes with 2 or more time dimensions are unlikely to have
<br />
observers.  The point is, you can't go quoting Leibniz about
<br />
this stuff.  We've left him far behind.
