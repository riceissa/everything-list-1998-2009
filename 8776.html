<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Your explication seems to turn on a pun.  &quot;End&quot; as something of value
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; doesn't imply a beginning.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To the contrary an end or goal or terminus generally entails a beginning. A

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person interested in this subject from a theoretical viewpoint does have to

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; confront that. It may help to have some acquaintance with past thought on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter.
</em><br />
<br />OK, I'll bite.  I sometimes consider having something to eat a value.  What 
<br />
beginning does that entail?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Sure, people care about (value) all kinds of things; even the words used to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; describe things - see recent debate over &quot;theology&quot; vs &quot;metaphysics&quot; - some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; inherently, some instrumentally, and some mixed.  But I'm not sure I'd call
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; those &quot;powers&quot; - I guess you mean something like &quot;motivations&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I mean like power, control, force, things that make things happen or not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happen, things that decide what happens. People want to decide and determine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things, not just be means to things or to be the ends, Pygmalions or prey, of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; others.
</em><br />
<br />OK, they value autonomy - I guess that's why some get so exercised over the 
<br />
compatibilist view of &quot;free will&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; They care about their relationship, such as they believe it to be, their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; relationship to the power of the universe itself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The power of the universe itself&quot;?  What would that be?  Are you going all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; mystical on me?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm talking about religious people and people who at least have religious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tendencies. Religion is a common phenomenon with a lot of history to it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; These are sources, beginnings, leaderships, principles, (Greek)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; _/arches/_. This is not mere instrumentality. Deciding and determining is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; not a mere means, the decider employs means to ends. The decider in that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; sense is the beginning, the leader.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Not if no one follows.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The leader of one's own process. As in, being in charge, in situations where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being in charge is not a given. This situation includes basic aspects of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one's life.
</em><br />
<br />That seems to be a dualist position in which YOU are something apart from your 
<br />
processes.  Or do you mean aspiring to power over others - which some find very 
<br />
gratifying?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; _/Arches kai mesa/_, beginnings/leadings, and means. It's the difference
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; between (a) **will &amp; character** and (b) **ability &amp; competence**.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Aristotle wrote his ethical treatises about character in a broader sense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; than exclusively that of morality, and character in that broader sense is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; what it's about. It's a shame that Aristotle didn't also write treatises
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; about ability and competence, _/hikanoteta/_. Now, a carpenter, for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; instance, is not simply a means to carpentry, a means for carpented
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; things to actualize themselves.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Has anyone every suggested such a thing?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You have commited yourself to that view in dividing everything into means and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ends (&quot;instrumental value&quot; and &quot;inherent value&quot;). Since you hold that view,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you must say that the carpenter's decision to do a job is a means to that job
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or the end of that job. 
</em><br />
<br />No, that's not exactly my view.  As I said, things can have both instrumental 
<br />
and inherent value.  So a carpenter might decide to do a job because he needs 
<br />
the money and because he enjoys doing capentery.  I didn't divide *everything* 
<br />
into &quot;ends&quot; and &quot;means&quot;.  I noted that *values* can be of two kinds or have two 
<br />
dimensions: instrumental and inherent.  Some things aren't values at all - a 
<br />
decision is not usually a value for example.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Yet it is plain that the carpenter's decision is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; carpenter's means and it is plain that the job is not a means for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; carpenter to decide to do the job. This shows the inadequacy of means-ends as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a dichotomy, a division of a whole into two.
</em><br />
<br />It is not plain to me that the carpenter's decision is the capenter's means.  If 
<br />
his decision is make a doorway, then his means are a series of actions.  Of 
<br />
course making a door is not a means to decide to make a door.  But what are the 
<br />
&quot;means to decide&quot;?  I'd say they are consideration of the consequences of making 
<br />
a door and how they comport with the carpenter's values.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; The carpenter tries and deliberates, pursues, chooses or accepts (or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; rejects), and adheres to (or renounces) his/her underlying decisions even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; to do the work at all, throughout the process. Is all this volition a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;means&quot;? 
</em><br />
<br />No - I don't insist on *everything* being a means or an end.  Somethings are 
<br />
neither, e.g. &quot;volition&quot;.  My view is that volition is a feeling that the brain 
<br />
attaches to decisions to mark them as internal - as opposed to, for example, 
<br />
perceptions which are external and not voluntary.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Somebody else's means, perhaps; the market's means perhaps, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; so on. But it isn't the carpenter's means, it's the carpenter's leading,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; deciding, etc. which, by means, tools, resources, s/he carries out. This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; striving and deciding is most clearly seen as no mere means in contexts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; where control is truly at stake.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I would suppose that a carpenter has pride of workmanship and so there is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; inherent pleasure in doing his job well.  His choice of this tool or that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is partly instrumental relative to that pleasure.  But he also does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; carpentry as a means to food, shelter, etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So what? You're confusing the decision-making with the goals and values and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; feelings, as if, given a set of goals, the decisions were already made, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; get made automatically, and as if people's decision-making were a trivial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; process. 
</em><br />
<br />I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;trivial&quot;?  How do you know they aren't?  Are you 
<br />
aware of the experiments of Libet and Grey Walter.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;But goals and values and feelings sometimes conflict, in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multifarious ways. Sometimes there is no clear answer and one has to decide
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anyway.
</em><br />
<br />So what?  It is usually uncertain what all the consequences of an action may be. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Also people often have values that are not transitive, i.e. they prefer A to B 
<br />
and B to C and C to A; particularly when A, B, and C may be in different mental 
<br />
categories.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; In the carpenter's sawing, hammering, etc., the exercise of skills and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; abilities, control is not really at stake. But in the carpenter's will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; and decision-making, control of the situation among various factors in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; the carpenter is at stake.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I think I understand the words, but the sentence leaves me blank.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The carpenter may be of more than one mind on what to do. I don't mean that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the carpenter has a multiple personality. I mean that the carpenter may be of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more than one mind in just the sense that &quot;more than one mind&quot; is commnly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; used. Some element in the carpenter's mind will have to gain the upper hand.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This will embody certain interests and efforts rather than others by the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; carpenter in his/her life. Or maybe the carpenter will solve diverse problems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; together with creative solution.
</em><br />
<br />But whatever choice he makes it is his choice - his control wasn't at stake?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Now, one is free to devise an epicycle-filled &quot;anthropo-nomy&quot; in order to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; describe intelligent beings while classing volition and decision-making
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; as mere means, but it's not particularly useful.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It's the basis of a whole branch of mathematics called decision theory, a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; branch which is widely *used*.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; They can use it all they like, that won't stop the terminology from being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inferior. Since we're talking about mathematicians, in whom eloquence is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rarer than speech in goldfish, my safe guess is that they're just using words
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like &quot;means&quot; or &quot;instrumentality&quot; in sub-optimal ways. Economists talk about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the inherent value which people ascribe to things but they call it &quot;utility
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; value.&quot; Unfortunately I can't recommend contemporary lit. depts. as any sort
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of remedy. 
</em><br />
<br />I'd recommend contemporary lit depts as sources of disease. :-)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Anyway, I see no reason to take such terminologies seriously --
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it's useless and counterproductive when the purpose is understanding.
</em><br />
<br />One way of understanding the mind is to create an artificial one.  People who do 
<br />
that find the terminology useful.  See for example John McCarthy's writings on 
<br />
robots and self-awareness.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Another way to see this is by a set of examples comprising an exhaustive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; set of a certain kind of combinations of the two.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; What two - you seem to introduce a lot more than two things below?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1. Choice and decision-making. 2. Means, methods, practices.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then I combine those two things in four ways.
</em><br />
<br />Oh, OK.  So choice about means is economics - but isn't it also engineering? 
<br />
And don't generals choose the means the means to attack or defend?  I guess 
<br />
&quot;with regard to&quot; seems very vague to me.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Or maybe a lot of categories we've invented for the work.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Politics &amp; martial affairs; business; management &amp; compliance; skills of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; labor &amp; cooperation -- &quot;invented categories&quot;? That's not a serious remark.
</em><br />
<br />Why not?  I could also categorize the same actions as communication, 
<br />
calculation, and physical labor?  All categories are invented.  My point was 
<br />
that simply classifying something according to a lot attributes doesn't make 
<br />
that something any bigger (or smaller).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I'm always suspicious of schemes with &quot;Levels&quot;.  Sometimes the schemer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; invents the levels to put his opinions at the highest (and implicity, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; best) level.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I was talking about Tegmark's Levels and correlations thereto, as I mentioned
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that I thought I should try to bring the discussion &quot;back to the Everything,&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm not aware of high-low valuations among those Levels.
</em><br />
<br />OK.
