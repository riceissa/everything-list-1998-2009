<br />I'm glad to see you bring it up, because I do want to discuss it. :)
<br />
<br />For people who haven't read Marcus's paper, the model consist of two 
<br />
computers, one representing an intelligent being, and the other one the 
<br />
environment, communicating with each other. The subject sends its 
<br />
decisions to the environment, and the environment sends information and 
<br />
rewards to the subject. The subject's goal is to maximize the sum of 
<br />
rewards over some time period. The paper then presents an algorithm that 
<br />
solves the subject's problem, and shows that it's close to optimal in some 
<br />
sense.
<br />
<br />In this model, the real goals of the subject (who presumably wants to 
<br />
acomplish objectives other than maximizing some abstract number) are 
<br />
encoded in the environment algorithm. But how can the environment 
<br />
algorithm be smart enough to evaluate the decisions of the subject? Unless 
<br />
the evaluation part of the environment algorithm is as intelligent as the 
<br />
subject, you'll have problems with the subject exploiting vulnerabilities 
<br />
in the evaluation algorithm to obtain rewards without actually 
<br />
acomplishing any real objectives. You can see an example of this problem 
<br />
in drug abusers. If we simply assume that the environment is smart enough, 
<br />
then we've just moved the problem around.
<br />
<br />So, how can we change the model so that the evaluation algorithm is part 
<br />
of the subject rather than the environment? First we have to come up with 
<br />
some way to formalize the real objectives of the subject. I think the 
<br />
formalism must be able to handle objectives that are about the internal 
<br />
state of the environment, rather than just the information the subject 
<br />
receives from the environment, otherwise we can't explain why people care 
<br />
about things that they'll never see, for example things that happen after 
<br />
they die. Then we would invent a universal decision algorithm for 
<br />
acomplishing any set of objectives and show that it's close to optimal.
<br />
This seems very difficult because we'll have to talk about the internal 
<br />
state of general algorithms, which we have very little theory for.
