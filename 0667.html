<br />&lt;&lt; The answer is that the structure(s)

<br />
<br />To paraphrase Einstein, and in keeping with the MWI, when God threw the dice, 
<br />
all faces came up. Not just a dice with six faces but one with an infinity. 
<br />
This is brute force creation to say the least, requiring no &quot;creative 
<br />
ingenuity&quot; in the human sense. You assume that &quot;the structures that obey 
<br />
physical laws are more numerous than those that do not, and hence we are more 
<br />
likely to find ourselves in those.&quot; 
<br />
The problem with this reasonning is that it is self sampling. We can find 
<br />
ourselves ONLY in those structures that obey physical laws because these are 
<br />
the ONLY structures that can support us as rational beings (SAS). The 
<br />
assumption that worlds with (rational) physical laws are  more more numerous 
<br />
than those without is therefore unwarranted.  In fact I would believe in the 
<br />
opposite. That the worlds without rational physical laws, (if these could be 
<br />
called worlds at all), are more numerous than those with rational physical 
<br />
laws.
<br />
<br /><p><strong>attached mail follows:</strong></p><hr /><br />
In Tegmark's paper,
<br />
in section 2G, he makes a crucial point that the fewer axioms
<br />
you use to define your mathematical structure, the larger is
<br />
the ensemble.  This provides a concrete justification for the
<br />
principle of Occam's Razor.  Similarly to the argument given
<br />
above, we would expect to find ourselves in worlds with fairly
<br />
few laws of physics, since those admit the most SAS's.  You
<br />
can always add any bizarre behavior to the structure by adding
<br />
ad hoc axioms, but worlds in which that is the case
<br />
have a smaller measure than those that do not.
<br />
<br />This line of reasoning also explains why, in a general sense,
<br />
we find that our universe behaves sensibly from moment to moment.
<br />
Many philosophers have pondered the question of why everything
<br />
doesn't disintegrate into chaos in the next instant.  What holds
<br />
the world together such that things persist and our memories
<br />
match our external reality?  The answer is that the structure(s)
<br />
we are in obey physical laws, not because they were cast by
<br />
fiat from some omnipotent being, but simply because the structures
<br />
that do obey physical laws are more numerous than those that do
<br />
not, and hence we are likely to find ourselves in those.
