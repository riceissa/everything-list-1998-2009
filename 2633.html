<br />Yes, you've pointed out a big problem there. (it's connected to Russell
<br />
Standish's remark &quot;The trouble with this argument, ...&quot; on page 4 of
<br />
&quot;Why Occam's Razor&quot;).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt; Juergen Schmidhuber's paper goes into more detail on the class of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; measures that the universal prior is a &quot;good enough&quot; approximation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; for, right?  
</em><br />
<br />Yes. This class of measures corresponds to the set of all universal
<br />
programming languages (i.e., all programming languages that are
<br />
equivalent to the Turing Machine). 
<br />
(by the way, your particular example that is 100% concentrated on a
<br />
particular bitstring, is not necessarily in this class; only if the
<br />
chosen bitstring is computable).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt; Maybe I need to go read that...
</em><br />
Yes, it's very good stuff. Read &quot;A Computer Scientist's View on Life,
<br />
the Universe, and Everything&quot; first. After that, if you have a bit of
<br />
background in computer science, then &quot;Algorithmic Theories of
<br />
Everything&quot; is also very good reading. In this last paper, Schmidhuber
<br />
differentiates between two ways to derive a measure from a universal
<br />
programming language: 
<br />
1) by program length (the standard way in algorithmic information
<br />
theory)
<br />
2) by program execution time (a very interesting alternative).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt; using the universal prior might turn out to be a bit like 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; &quot;renormalization&quot; in quantum field theory, i.e. a tool that's useful for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; making calculations but probably isn't going to be the basis of our final 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; TOE.
</em><br />
<br />You're right. Your question was about the &quot;basis of our final TOE&quot;,
<br />
and I gave you an answer about a &quot;tool&quot;. So, after some more thinking
<br />
and reading, I want to change my answer to option 1: there is no
<br />
global measure. As Russell Standish writes in &quot;Why Occam's Razor&quot;:
<br />
<br />&quot;The conscious observer is responsible, under the Anthropic Principle, 
<br />
for converting the potential into actual, for creating the observed
<br />
information from the zero information of the ensemble&quot;.
<br />
<br />If I interpret him correctly, this means that we should not try to
<br />
make any specific predictions on the basis of a global measure,
<br />
because all computable universes are possible anyway.
<br />
<br />I think this is also what Hal Ruhl means:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; My particular approach is to produce an Everything that contains no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; information at all either absolute or relative.
</em><br />
<br />I think that trying to establish a single superior global measure is
<br />
already a violation of the zero information principle, because it
<br />
excludes other possible measures. The probability of being in a
<br />
certain universe is only determined by the SAS making
<br />
observations. His universe is determined by the outcomes of his
<br />
observations, not by some a priori global measure.
<br />
<br />Then, the logical next question would be:
<br />
What is the prior probability over the different outcomes of such
<br />
observations?
<br />
<br />It looks like the problem of choosing a measure has been shifted from
<br />
the choice of universe to the repeated choice of
<br />
observation-outcomes. But I think the important difference here is that 
<br />
an observation has only 2 possible outcomes, &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;, whereas
<br />
the choice of universe has infinitely many outcomes. It seems to be
<br />
much more defendable to use the &quot;one-structure-one-vote&quot; principle for 
<br />
observation-outcomes, than for a global measure on universes.
<br />
<br />I think this must have been Wheeler's motivation for taking on the
<br />
it-from-bit view. See <a href="http://suif.stanford.edu/~jeffop/WWW/wheeler.txt">http://suif.stanford.edu/~jeffop/WWW/wheeler.txt</a>
<br />
for a good summary of it.
<br />
<br /><br />Cheers,
<br />
Michiel de Jong.
