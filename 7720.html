UD is the Universal Distribution, which assigns measure to information
<br />
objects as the fraction of computer programs which output them on a
<br />
given Universal Turing Machine.  (I know I promised to use UDist for
<br />
this acronym but I couldn't resist the title I chose.)
<br />
<br />ASSA is the Absolute Self Selection Assumption, which says that we
<br />
should reason as though we are randomly selected observer moments (OMs).
<br />
Combining the UD+ASSA means that the OMs should be selected according
<br />
to the Universal Distribution.
<br />
<br />QTI is the Quantum Theory of Immortality, which says that in a
<br />
many-worlds or multiverse model, each of us will experience immortality
<br />
with certainty, because our deaths in some worlds will not affect the
<br />
fact that we live on in others.
<br />
<br />The DA is the Doomsday Argument, which says (among other things) that
<br />
the human race will not greatly increase in numbers beyond its present
<br />
day size, because otherwise the chances that we would find ourselves
<br />
so early in its history are insignificant.
<br />
<br />Here is an idea to tie these together.  Some time back [1] I proposed
<br />
that the measure of observer-moments would be amplified for those OMs
<br />
which were remembered.  Most OMs exist only transiently and are forgotten,
<br />
but certain ones are special, make an impression, and are remembered for
<br />
hours, days or even years.  The measure of such OMs is arguably greater
<br />
than the ones which are forgotten because of this effect.
<br />
<br />Let us assume that this is true and that in fact it can be a very
<br />
strong effect, such that remembered OMs may acquire far more measure
<br />
than forgotten ones.  Then what does that suggest for the DA and QTI?
<br />
<br />One way to state the DA, using ASSA concepts, is to start with the
<br />
supposition that the human race actually will vastly increase its numbers,
<br />
perhaps spreading throughout the entire universe.  Then we have to
<br />
ask the question, how could it be that we are so early in its history?
<br />
In measure terms, the total measure of late observer moments is vastly
<br />
greater than the total measure of OMs as early as ours, so the odds are
<br />
overwhelmingly against these OMs being experienced.
<br />
<br />Just as we accept the low measure of Flying Rabbit OMs as explaining
<br />
the lawfulness of the universe, we should accept this way of expressing
<br />
the DA as showing the contradiction in assuming that the human race
<br />
will grow enormously.  That is the conclusion of the DA, which some
<br />
find paradoxical.
<br />
<br />The resolution could be to suppose that as the human race spreads,
<br />
somehow it will retain a memory of its youth.  The OMs that we are
<br />
experiencing today will echo through time and gain measure in that way,
<br />
via the remembering effect I discussed above.  It could happen as literal
<br />
memories, if we assume that somehow we will become personally immortal and
<br />
create copies of ourselves who will spread throughout the universe and
<br />
share in the vastening of the human race.  Or perhaps a similar measure
<br />
amplification effect could occur more indirectly; perhaps our mere
<br />
influence on future events could leave sufficient traces down through
<br />
time that present day OMs have much larger measure than future ones
<br />
(on a per-OM basis).  This would allow our present-day existence to be
<br />
consistent with even a great vastening of humanity, resolving the DA.
<br />
<br />A similar argument might apply to the QTI.  In ASSA terms, the
<br />
conventional QTI does not work because the measure of extremely old
<br />
versions of people is very small, so they would not be very prominent
<br />
in the multiverse, any more than inhabitants of Flying Rabbit worlds.
<br />
However, if the memory-amplification effect holds, then there could be
<br />
a similar phenomenon to QTI.
<br />
<br />If we suppose that somehow certain people are destined for immortality,
<br />
then the measure of even their young-age OMs would be greatly increased
<br />
relative to their fellows by virtue of memory amplification.  This would
<br />
mean that those of us who are fortunate enough to have such destinies
<br />
(which is not completely impossible today, given the progress of medical
<br />
technology), would have very high-measure OMs.
<br />
<br />This implies that the experience of being a person is prima facae evidence
<br />
that he may expect a much longer than usual life span, perhaps even an
<br />
immortal existence.  Such lucky individuals would have so much higher
<br />
measure OMs even in their youth (due to memory amplification) that a
<br />
randomly selected OM would very plausibly be that of such an individual.
<br />
<br />And the fact that we are young and not super-old is perhaps consistent as
<br />
well, since younger OMs would have more memory amplification, both due
<br />
to the fact that early experiences have more inherent distinctiveness
<br />
and novelty because of youth, and due to the additional years they have
<br />
to be remembered and for the echo effect to produce measure amplification.
<br />
<br />In short, finding onesself to be young is not necessarily an argument
<br />
against this variant of the QTI, and may in fact be considered evidence
<br />
in favor of a long or even immortal life span.
