Dear Brent,
<br />
If you had the most extravagent MRI machine in history, which trapped
<br />
complete maps of all electrons, neuclei and any photons and then plotted
<br />
them out - you would have a 100% complete, scientifically acquired
<br />
publishable description and in that description would be absolutely no
<br />
prediction of or explanation of why it is necessarily 'like it is' to 'be'
<br />
the brain thus described, what that experience will be like. It would not
<br />
enable you to make any cogent claim as to why it is or is not 'like
<br />
something' to be a computer except insofar as it doesn't have neurons. Why
<br />
am I saying this....Please read David Chalmers. This is not new.
<br />
<br />Science does not and never has EXPLAINED anything. It merely describes.
<br />
Read the literature. For the first time ever, to deal with qualia, science
<br />
has to actually EXPLAIN something. It is at the boundary condition where
<br />
you have to explain how you can observe anything at all.
<br />
<br />As to your EM theory beliefs... please read the literature. Jackson
<br />
&quot;Classical electrodynamics&quot; is a brilliant place to start. For nobody
<br />
around here in electrical engineering agrees with you... and I have just
<br />
been grilled on that very issue by a whole pile of very senior academics -
<br />
who agree with me. Even my anatomy/neuroscience supervisor, who are
<br />
generally pathologically afraid of physics....tells me there's nothing
<br />
there but space and charge....
<br />
<br /><br />If you want to draw a line around a specific zone of ignorance and inhabit
<br />
it...go ahead. If you want to believe that correlation is causation go
<br />
ahead. &quot;This is what we do&quot;  is what you say when you are a member of a
<br />
club, not a seeker of truth. You have self referentially defined
<br />
truth....and you are welcome to it. ...
<br />
<br />Meanwhile I'll just poke around in other areas. I hope you won't mind.
<br />
Please consider your exasperation quota reached. Job done.
<br />
<br />colin
