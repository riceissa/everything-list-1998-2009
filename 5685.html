<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Hal:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I found the paper you referred to, and it certainly has some very 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interesting ideas, for example the idea that the arrow of time is actually 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;an anthropic artefact. I admit that I have much reading to do if I am to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;understand the paper properly, but I am not sure what I was proposing - 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that all possible worlds will at some stage exist - is the same thing as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the Poincare recurrences discussed in this paper. It possible that only a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;subset of possible events (everything that has occurred so far, and then 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;some) will cycle endlessly, and if so, as Nietzche commented, that'll suck 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(or words to that effect). I probably gave the wrong example when I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;proposed as my unlikely event the formation of an exact copy of our solar 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;system and its inhabitants in far future interstellar space; much more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interesting would be a rather different copy, where you would be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;resurrected with intact personality and memories of your past life, with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;enhanced intelligence and physical abilities, and a whole new civilization 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with scientific wonders, intelligent aliens, and things so strange that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;no-one today has even imagined them, all to explore. Of course, you will 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;also experience burning in hellfire as the flipside to this happy state, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;but who was it that said it was better to burn than to disappear?
</em><br />
<br /><br />?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Bruno:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I agree that my four assumptions are dubious, but I chose them, for the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sake of argument, as being (a) most inimical towards Many Worlds theories,
</em><br />
<br /><br />Thank you for your frankness. And your clarity.
<br />
As far as I feel concern you can be as inimical
<br />
as you want when you still play honest.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;(b) closest to what most people would think of as common sense,
</em><br />
<br />I said once that common sense is the only tool
<br />
we have to go beyond common sense.
<br />
I'm afraid the &quot;common sense&quot; you mentioned
<br />
is just Aristotle theory of mind and matter.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;and (c) least controversial/ most conservative in the scientific community.
</em><br />
<br />1) This is not an argument (I guess you know that)
<br />
2) It is related to b, so reread my answer to be (or just recall it).
<br />
3) The scientific community is putting the mind-body problem under the 
<br />
carpet. A
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brilliant simplification and a partially successful strategy but I 
<br />
don't seriously think
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that can last forever: The data are too big!
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I do think they are internally consistent, even if they are completely wrong.
</em><br />
<br /><br />It is here that we really differ. I do think they are inconsistent, unless you
<br />
manage to have only little universes, or sequence of little universes,  so that
<br />
you never get a complete (never stopping) execution of a universal dovetailer
<br />
(giving that you accept comp). This follows from the UDA.
<br />
And with the FGA (filmed graph argument) that moves is also prohibited.
<br />
More easy to abandon comp, I think.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I do not understand your comment that by saying the universe is unique, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;finite, expanding and cooling forever, it is contradictory to allow that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;my example of an unlikely event will occur as time approaches infinity.
</em><br />
<br />I have not criticize this.  (?) I only say that if you keep comp
<br />
and want to remain physicalist then you must find a way no
<br />
UD runs forever, + do a magical trick to link our private
<br />
feelings with individuated little universe. If not you fall in the UDA's
<br />
consequences. (reread UDA or UDA step by steps perhaps,
<br />
help you perhaps with the pictures in my recent Paris paper, see
<br />
my url below). Don't hesitate to ask question. I am aware it is
<br />
rather counter-intuitive, and you might suffer from some
<br />
metaphysical vertigo. Nobody asks you to believe a word of it.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  The increase in entropy and cooling which go with the model I suggested 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are average trends over time. It is possible within this long term 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; decline to have pockets of order/ decreasing entropy, both in classical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; statistical mechanics and quantum mechanics. It is a mathematical fact, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; independent of the actual physics, that given enough time (and eternity 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is certainly enough time), any event that is possible, however close to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; zero its probability per unit time, will occur with probability 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arbitrarily close to 1. What rather surprised me, however, is the fact 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the last statement is only true in general if the probability per 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unit time stays constant or increases with increasing time; if it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; decreases, limiting towards zero as time approaches infinity, then it is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible that this event, which still always has non-zero probability per 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unit time, may never actually occur. For example, if Pr(P)=1/(t^2), as t 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; goes from 2 to infinity, the cumulative probability that P will occur at 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some point is 1/2.
</em><br />
<br />Really?
<br />
<br />Bruno
