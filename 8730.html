My belief is that in matters of faith, you can choose to believe or not 
<br />
believe based on whether it suits your personal preferences.  Your 
<br />
example of the Nazis  would not apply because there is overwhelming 
<br />
evidence that the Nazis existed.  Perhaps it can be argued that there is 
<br />
meaningful evidence that the God described in Sunday school class exists 
<br />
as well, however I don't think anyone would argue that the evidence for 
<br />
that God is nearly as strong as evidence of the Nazis.  As you say, 
<br />
religion, by necessity, is based on faith and therefore little to no 
<br />
objective evidence.  I guess your point was that if you already have the 
<br />
faith in something without evidence, the fact that you are then taught 
<br />
as part of the belief system that there are some aspects not very 
<br />
appealing should not have any bearing on whether you still have your 
<br />
faith?  I would disagree with that in that you can have faith in 
<br />
something because the concept is attractive to you, but then lose your 
<br />
faith when the concept is shown to be less attractive. (this was not 
<br />
really my situation as a child- I was never really presented the 
<br />
opportunity to examine the faith until presented with the teachings 
<br />
described in the original post).  This is not entirely unrelated to the 
<br />
sciences.  Science has pushed into many areas into realms that can only 
<br />
tangentially, at best, be proven with objective evidence.  The MWI is a 
<br />
good example.  I believe in it, because I think it provides the most 
<br />
explanatory power over competing ideas. However, it would be difficult 
<br />
to fault someone for demanding more in the way of direct evidence.  In a 
<br />
sense, there is an element of faith in such theories.  String theory is 
<br />
another example.  I'm not saying these things are not science, just that 
<br />
they are theories beyond our reach to prove or disprove at the present 
<br />
time.  Many scientists are quoted as endorsing string theory in part due 
<br />
to the elegance of the theory.  This goes with what I was saying above 
<br />
about accepting something on faith as long as it appears to be the most 
<br />
attractive idea, even if it is not supported by much objective evidence.
<br />
<br />I doubt the beliefs of fundementalist Christianity will ever be 
<br />
absolutely proven or disproven, and as a faith belief I reserve the 
<br />
right to discard it at my choosing!
<br />
<br />Danny
