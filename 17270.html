2009/8/14 1Z &lt;peterdjones.domain.name.hidden&gt;:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I think need to take a hard line on RITSIAR.  I feel that the key lies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; in what Bruno terms the certainty of the ontological first person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (OFP): i.e. the sine qua non of reality as it is uniquely available to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; us.  Since this is inescapably the foundation of any and all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; judgements whatsoever, it is simultaneously both the both point of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; departure and the 'what-is-to-be-explained' of RITSIAR.  In this light
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; it becomes self-evident that any and all explanatory entities -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; physical, computational, or whatever - are severely restricted to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; domain of epistemology.  IOW - as Bruno says above - they are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; theoretical constructions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That doesn't follow at all. A theoretical construct can have a real
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; referent. eg, if the theory of quarks is true , quarks exist. What
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; else
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would &quot;theory X is true&quot; mean?
</em><br />
<br />Yes, of course, I agree with you that we take our references to have
<br />
real referents.  Part of our problem in discussion I think is that you
<br />
tend to attribute views to me that - if I held them - would indeed be
<br />
fatuous.  Now, you are within your rights to say that it's my fault
<br />
for giving you this impression.  But I can only reply that my
<br />
intention is to draw attention to something more subtle, and this is
<br />
difficult.
<br />
<br />I think if I had to sum up the point of departure for more or less
<br />
everything I've been saying, it would be that I question the
<br />
assumption that everything we can discover or know about the world can
<br />
be exhausted by describing its observable behaviour - whatever the
<br />
model.  This is I think what has been called the 'view from nowhere'
<br />
and - wonderfully useful though it undoubtedly is, and prone as I am
<br />
myself to rely on it much of the time - I'm not alone in criticising
<br />
it in the context of mind-body issues.  And this is because it seems
<br />
to me - though I think not to you - that in this domain alone we're
<br />
forced out of our view from nowhere and confronted with the fact that
<br />
what we're trying to explain by observation is the very phenomenon
<br />
we're using to make the observation.  And this is the problem.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; So far so obvious.  But - as has again been recognised immemorially -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; solipsism is a dead-end and hence we seek a theory to capture the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; relation between the OFP and its environment.  But immediately we are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; faced with the notorious 'explanatory gap',
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and it seems to me that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; its most precise expression is in the gap between ontology and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; epistemology.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don;t know what explanatory gap you are talking about,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but is doesn't sound like Levine's one.
</em><br />
<br />Well, as I imply above, I'm using ontology in the sense of 'what it is
<br />
to be' - not 'what it is to describe' - so maybe we need another term
<br />
to avoid confusion.  So the gap is the one between these two things.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What is &quot;Ontological certainty&quot;? Certainty belongs to epistemolgoy,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so &quot;onotlogical&quot; can't bve qualifying &quot;certainty&quot;. Do you mean
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something like &quot;the one certain fact about ontology/existence&quot;?
</em><br />
<br />My rhetorical question was &quot;how do we reach a state of certainty about
<br />
'what it is to be' on the basis of 'what it is to describe'.  To which
<br />
my response is that we can't, because in the area of the first person
<br />
we have indubitable acquaintance with at least some aspect of the
<br />
former.  And in my view, this acquaintance is so alien to 'what is
<br />
described' that the assumption of the gap being bridged on the basis
<br />
of *any* model of observability can only be a brute apriori
<br />
assumption.  Now I know that many people aren't troubled by this, and
<br />
some just are.  Frankly, by this stage I'm ready to put it down to
<br />
differences in imaginative style, what we're trying to achieve
<br />
personally with our thinking, or something equally idiosyncratic.  I
<br />
don't really believe it can be resolved entirely by persuasion.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Realism doesn;t need the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence of a non-mental world to be a certainty, it just needs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it to be more plausible than the alternatives.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, in general I agree with you.  But I suppose on the mind-body
<br />
question, the various positions that I've successively tried to hold
<br />
on to (and I think I've traversed most of them over the last 30 years
<br />
or so) having become less and less plausible to me.  I don't want to
<br />
be a mysterian, but I think that the assumption that with a bit more
<br />
effort we've got the mind sorted on the basis of current theories will
<br />
turn out to be more like Lord Kelvin's notorious dicta on black-body
<br />
radiation and the ether wind.  Actually, if that were the case, it
<br />
would be a good omen, because that presaged relativity and QM.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Is there a coherent way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to conceive what it could mean to *be* a theoretical entity (as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; opposed to postulating or observing one)?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Probably not, but that is because the question posed is somethign of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a category error. What the realist would say is that she can conceive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of theoretical statements havign real referents.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, but my view is that mind-body shows us that to consider the
<br />
referent of a theoretical statement to be something 'external' is in
<br />
fact the category error - i.e. the view from nowhere again.  Someone
<br />
(can't remember who) put it like this: &quot;what is the external world
<br />
supposed to be external to?&quot;  Look, it may well be that you're capable
<br />
of doing this sort of category-juggling in your head whilst still
<br />
using the standard theoretical language.  Part of the trouble is that
<br />
I'm never quite sure if others are doing this, which is why I try to
<br />
proceed in a painfully step-by-step way in enquiring into it - which
<br />
probably makes me sound like the village idiot to you.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; There is something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; quintessential that stubbornly eludes capture, because epistemological
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; access never tells us what an entity *is* - only what can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ascertained of its 'externalised' properties.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; How do you know? If you can't detect some mysterious inner essence,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; how do you know there is one?
</em><br />
<br />I certainly wouldn't put it like that.  I don't think that the view
<br />
from nowhere can 'detect' anything of the sort precisely because it
<br />
doesn't - can't - say anything about the 'inner' at all - i.e. its
<br />
externalised: that's its point.  Theories represent the limit of what
<br />
the world can *tell* us, not the limit of what it *is*.   Do you
<br />
really suppose that you are limited in any such way?  That your
<br />
existence as it is known to you by acquaintance is entirely exhausted
<br />
by what I can glean by interacting with you or bouncing signals off
<br />
you?
<br />
<br />What we know by indubitable acquaintance is something absolutely
<br />
qualitatively different to what is described theoretically - it has to
<br />
be - and whereas of course I'm not implying that this acquaintance
<br />
gives us the ante on the whole nature of existence, I do believe that
<br />
it should be a salutory corrective to any notion of the 'completeness'
<br />
of our theories of observation.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;And lest we be tempted
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to accept the sum of these properties as exhausting 'existence', we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; need only turn to the self-evident corrective of the OFP.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; THat passage is very far from self evident. Explain, please.
</em><br />
<br />What I said above.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; So the gap must remain, and I think that now I see why Bruno appeals
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; simply to the 'ordinary' mathematical sense of existence - because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; COMP, under this analysis, is an epistemological schema, and its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; entities are theoretical constructions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No, Bruno is a Platonist. He thinks numbers are RITSIAR
</em><br />
<br />Well, I don't suppose you'll ever agree on that.  But I think, on the
<br />
basis of my latest discussion with him, that he sees all theory -
<br />
including number theory - as standing in relation (i.e. referring to)
<br />
to what is RITSIAR, not as actually *being* RITSIAR.  Elsewhere, he's
<br />
distinguished between a representation of a number, and a number.  It
<br />
seems to me that you are using Platonic to characterise what is in
<br />
principle unobservable, but surely that also applies to many of the
<br />
theoretical entities appealed to by physics with equal force?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  Hence the question of jumping
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the ontological gap is in abeyance, perhaps permanently, but in any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; case in the realm of faith.  And if this is true for COMP, then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; mutatis mutandis it is true for physics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course not. Physics is about explaining the real world.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, I agree that physics is about explaining a real world - i.e. it
<br />
stands in some theoretical relation to the describably real.  But I
<br />
reiterate that you can't jump the gap from description to 'what it is'
<br />
for free - and this is not to rubbish the unique achievement of
<br />
science in human understanding.  It is simply to warn against hubris,
<br />
I suppose.  What has been extraordinarily successful in one domain of
<br />
application may yet flounder when pushed too far beyond it.
<br />
<br />You see, the thing that interests me about comp isn't that I know that
<br />
it's true.  Rather it's because I think that it confronts the
<br />
mind-body issue without sweeping the real problems under the rug.
<br />
That doesn't mean that it doesn't face the final explanatory abyss
<br />
too, but I think it positions the mysteries much more insightfully.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The unavoidable consequence of the foregoing is that atoms, quarks and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; numbers cannot be RITSIAR.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That has not been demonstrated at all. At best you have an argument
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that they are not necessarily RITSIAR. Which is straightforwardly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; given
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by the observation that theories are less than certain. All you have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; writen
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; boils down to the fallacy that &quot;no necessarily true&quot; implies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;necessarily untrue&quot;
</em><br />
<br />No, I think it boils down to the fact that no theoretical entity
<br />
should ever be seen as RITSIAR - only in some relation to it.  The
<br />
difference between physics and comp is that in terms of the former
<br />
there's virtually no way of expressing this thought coherently,
<br />
whereas in terms of the latter it's a key aspect of the theory.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The unique feature of consciousness is not - as you claim - its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'epistemic' certainty, but its status as what is *ontologically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; certain*.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Whatever that means.
</em><br />
<br />It means its status as evidence by acquaintance of at least some
<br />
indubitable aspects of 'what it is to be' something.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;To regard consciousness itself (or in Bruno's terms the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ontological first person) as merely the object of 'knowledge' is to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; commit the fallacy of taking 'observation' in a naively literal sense:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; i.e. to require there to be an 'observer'.  But this, self-evidently,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; can only lead to infinite regress.  Consequently, consciousness does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; not consist in the 'observation' of epistemic entities, but in their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; instantiation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Whatever that means. Surely if soemthign is insantiated, it exist and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is therefore ontological.
</em><br />
<br />I mean that consciousness isn't what we observe in others - or in the
<br />
functioning of our brains - it's what they experience.  We probably
<br />
need a different term - like consciousness-related behaviour - for the
<br />
former to avoid this confusion.  I also mean that 'epistemic entities'
<br />
- the things that we use to refer with - are instantiated in
<br />
consciousness.  Mine are anyway.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Consciousness is, as it were, the 'ontology of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; epistemology'.  When you say that the physical is basic, you are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; yourself mistaking the epistemological for the ontological.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No, I am takign certain highly succesful theories to be true.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, given that the physical is what is deemed to be described by
<br />
physics, then it is indeed what is assumed to be true by highly
<br />
successful theories.  But this success is not what is necessary to
<br />
bridge the mind-body gap, because the theories aren't designed for
<br />
that particular job.  In fact, they are designed precisely for the
<br />
opposite of that job - i.e. to describe a state of affairs in a way
<br />
that deliberately obscures the reversal of the relationship between
<br />
theory and reality.  IOW, in this view, consciousness is theory and
<br />
the physical is the touchstone of reality.  But this view relies on
<br />
the denial (in an unavoidably Freudian sense) that the physical is
<br />
known exclusively in terms of conscious representations on which all
<br />
extrapolation to an 'observable' reality rests.
<br />
<br />Since such representations are not in themselves observable (though of
<br />
course not unknowable) it is unreasonable to suppose that any
<br />
putatively 'final' ontology known entirely on the basis of observation
<br />
could ever be considered a complete account of the situation.  This is
<br />
a real issue.  I'm by no means the only one who thinks that standard
<br />
physics lacks a natural way to address this, and I feel there must be
<br />
ways to re-position the issues more fruitfully - comp being one such
<br />
approach.  I don't know what I can say to make this more compelling
<br />
so, if you still see this as nothing but the old category error stuff
<br />
again, I give up.  No hard feelings.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; As to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; your evidence consisting in 'the whole of science', since the nature
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and significance of this evidence is precisely what is in question, it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is inadequate merely to make such appeals to authority.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Au cotnraire, it is inadequate to assume that theories are necessarily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; false bcause they are not necessarily true.
</em><br />
<br />How could I disagree?  Do you really think this is the substance of
<br />
our divergence?  I merely reiterate that if some aspect of the
<br />
scientific method and its interpretation is under dispute it is
<br />
insufficient merely to lean too heavily on the fact that lots of
<br />
scientists don't question it.  Whilst it would of course be foolish to
<br />
disregard this, one may surely still have the temerity to question any
<br />
authority if we think it may be mistaken.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The problem is this: in the face of one indubitable ontology - that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; exemplified in consciousness - you try get physically-basic ontology
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; for free.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Free? The development of physics involves a huge effort. And note
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that I am not claiming cvertainty for it.
</em><br />
<br />Look, for most of my life, most of my heroes have been the champions
<br />
of science.  I'm the last person to rubbish this effort.  All I'm
<br />
saying is that in the mind-body domain the carefully designed
<br />
methodology of 'vexing nature' is seeking to get a 'theory of
<br />
everything' for free - because if you really believed that physics
<br />
could account for 'everything' on the basis of' any possible set of
<br />
observations, then IMO you don't take the 'gap'  - between the
<br />
observable and the ontologically real  - that seriously.  Actually,
<br />
thinking about everything you've said, I conclude that you don't take
<br />
it seriously in that way. And that means that I'm worrying about
<br />
something unnecessarily in your view because you say it's just a
<br />
category error.  OK, we can agree to disagree.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And I don't think I get any ontology from consciousness. I'll grant
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that it is indubitable that it exists, but that tells me nothing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about *what* it is. A brute fact is not an ontology.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;In other words, you simply assume that if we take ourselves
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to 'be' - what? - say, neural activity in 'computational' - or some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; yet-to-be-established  - guise, then - pouf! - the ontological first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; person is conjured from mere description.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No, the first person is conjured from the brain -- from the territory,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the map.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, but the territory is entirely known (to the extent that it is
<br />
known) in its conscious aspect, not in in terms of the observably
<br />
'physical' referents of physics-as-theory.  And saying that these two
<br />
categories are 'identical' is just pretending to monism whilst
<br />
continuing to think dualistically IMO, as I've said - and as you've
<br />
denied - repeatedly.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But there is no sense in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; which one can simply 'be' an epistemic 'object' - a theoretical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; construction.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As noted before, that is an artificial problem. Since theories
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *can* be correct, one *can* be the referent of a  theoretical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; description, and the referent of  a theoretical construction, if it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has one, is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a real thing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;*This* is the explanatory gap,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No, it is nto the standard one in the literature. You are just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; commiting a basica fallacy -- saying that because the map is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; itself real, it cannot *represetn* a real territory.
</em><br />
<br />No, I'm not saying that.  I'm casting doubt on whether the mapping to
<br />
the territory can be complete.  In other words, the territory mapped
<br />
on the basis of observation is still only a partial account of the
<br />
complete state of affairs.  However, I do realise that this amounts to
<br />
heresy according to the standard doctrine of physics.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; You still haven't said what the objection is to saying that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; the mental emerges from the physical.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I'm saying that all that can 'emerge' from one class of description is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; another class of description.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The physical is not a description/map. Physics is the description/map.
</em><br />
<br />True.  But we have no direct access to the physical-in-itself through
<br />
description, theory or mapping - only (in certain of its aspects)
<br />
through consciousness.  So if you want the mental to 'emerge' from -
<br />
or stand in true relation to - 'something', we must look beyond what
<br />
is needed to account merely for what is observed.  This is the facer
<br />
for physics, because of course it is precisely committed to
<br />
restricting itself to accounting for what is observed, and I
<br />
understand the power and intent of this approach.  But to extrapolate
<br />
from this to the causal closure of a physical ontology of everything,
<br />
independent of consciousness, is fatal to a coherent resolution of the
<br />
mind-body issues IMO.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; If that exhausts your idea of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'mental' I say you are an eliminativist.  But you say you're not.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; What then?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I do think there is an explanatory gap, and I also think it is very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; specific
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the the nature of the mental and the nature of phsycial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *descriptions*. However
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that does not mean that it is impossible for the mental territory to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emrge
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from the physical territory. There are two things here, the brute fact
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; -- *that* the mental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emerges -- and the  explanation -- *how* it emerges.
</em><br />
<br />We may agree here.  It depends what you mean by 'how'.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You have in fact *not* criticised
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the emergence of mental territory from physial territory, you have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; criticised the emergence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the mental territory from the physcical map. Well, you can't grow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; potatos in a map of Norfolk,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but you can still grow potatos in Norfolk.
</em><br />
<br />Well, it's not because I don't recognise the distinction, at any
<br />
event.  I just want to be convinced we're getting real potatoes, and
<br />
not just a load of stories about potatoes, that leaves us as hungry as
<br />
before.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;This, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; take it, can be construed only as a particularly odd form of dualism,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; or eliminativism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Don't take it, expalin how you came to that.
</em><br />
<br />The explanation, which I've referred to above, is this: there is a
<br />
claim that two categories -  conscious experience itself, and a
<br />
physical ontology characterised exhaustively in observable terms - are
<br />
equivalent.  I say that any such claim is implicitly dualistic: IOW it
<br />
must appeal to 'something else' to fill what is not accounted for.
<br />
Alternatively, to deny that anything remains unaccounted for is to
<br />
*eliminate* the 'something else'.
<br />
<br />At this point, I feel that the issues have had a good outing and
<br />
further detailed commenting would be otiose.  I don't expect either of
<br />
us have shifted our position, though speaking personally I would
<br />
really welcome the opportunity to do so, if I could see a compelling
<br />
reason.  If you can think of a new angle of attack, that could be
<br />
really helpful.  But for now, I'm signing off.
<br />
<br />David
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The 'arbitrariness' is inherent in the burden of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the term 'functionalism', which is intrinsically neutral as to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; details of physical implementation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No, there are two quite differnt claim here:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1. A function can have multiple instantions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2. Anything can instantiate any function.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; This is its great strength in its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; legitimate sphere of application, and its fatal weakness in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; present context.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;But then one must
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; abjure functional-computational justifications for the 'mental':
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; again, fair enough (it's probably closer to my own prejudice).  But
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; unless you're an eliminativist about the mental, you can't have it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; both ways.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; Of course you can! There are plenty accounts of the mental that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; are neither functionalist nor elimintativist. Sheesh.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Yes of course there are other accounts, but my argument at this point
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is specifically against functionalist accounts based on an assumed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; physical ontology.  So I repeat: the burden of my claim is that if you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; want to be ontological about the physical, you must give up
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; functionalist arguments for mind; otherwise you are an implicit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; dualist, or else an eliminativist, even though you may be unaware of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; it (as indeed an eliminativist would have to be!)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You haven't supported any of that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;You may of course
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; disagree, but saying 'of course you can' is not an argument.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is noting that most people disagree with you conclusion. What is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; asserted
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with little argument can be rejected with little argument. The burden
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is on you.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Beyond
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that, I'm not arguing here against other accounts of the mental,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; though you don't indicate what you have in mind (as it were)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; But I think we can save them quite handily.  First, calling something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; 'idealism' just pumps the intuition that there have to be sort of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; bright images everywhere independent of 'minds'.  The problem here is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that we're stuck with folk vocabulary that drags in extraneous notions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; left, right and centre causing an implosion of the imagination.  We
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; need to fix this, and I have a couple of suggestions.  The first was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; in my reply to Rex, where I suggest, in answer to your implicit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; question above, that the universe has to take things just as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; personally as it needs to exist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; Why, for heaven's sake? That seems completely arbitrary.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Perhaps you could try a little harder to go beyond the vocabulary (I'm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; sorry if this seems impolite, I don't intend it to be).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; As I've said,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; virtually every term we use has been used by someone else to mean
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; something different.  The use of the term 'personal' in this context,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; as I've tried to explain, is to carry the sense that what 'exists' is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; always, as it were, incipiently personal or 'owned'.  This is, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; believe, not crude idealism, but in fact the crucial prerequisite for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; any intuition as to how the 'ownership' of consciousness could be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; conceived to emerge from something in some sense more fundamental, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; nonetheless categorically congruent.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is still arbitrary. Why would the personal have to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fundamental,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rather than the cognitive, the experiential, etc etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you have a *specific* explanatory gap in mind, that guides you into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what is specifically missing from physical accounts. For, instance
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Levine-Nagel gap indicated that phenomenal expereince is lacking, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is what people like Chalmers and Rosenberg try to plug back in.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, you don't have a specific explanatory gap in mind. Your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argument that the &quot;epsistemtologcial&quot; (theoretical?? descriptive??)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can never
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be the &quot;ontolgical&quot; (real?) is general-purpose.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; This leads to the second suggestion: what we call 'mind' is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; evolved capacity for representation, memory and intention directed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; towards an environment, resulting from selected-for elaborations of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; primitive but critically-similar potentials.  Of course, this is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; standard direction of any explanatory thrust, but with the critical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; stipulation that we must be able to preserve the appearances from soup
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to nuts: this is, as you point out, the nub.  Again, I don't insist on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; any particular vocabulary, only the necessary sense.  As Popper
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; remarks, debate about words is futile - just clarify your terms until
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the problem emerges precisely, or goes away.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; Repeating that we need to save the appearances does nothing to save
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; them
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Patience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Of the above factors, the one that bears, I think, most on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; 'appearance of mindlessness', is memory (a point made by Russell in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; his neutral monist guise).  Essentially, we're 'conscious' of what we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; can remember - this is inherent in the sense of re-presentation.  So
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; it may not in fact meet the case to hold that we're 'unaware' of what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; we don't remember so well, but rather that 'primitive' awareness is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; swamped in our memory by repeated re-presentation of dominant
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; higher-order themes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; You cannot derive an &quot;is true&quot; from a &quot;might be true&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; No, of course not.  But your mind seemed to be boggled by the idea
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that the fundamental 'personalisation' of the universe must
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; necessarily manifest with a very different appearance to that which is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; in evidence.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No, I am just noting that having arbitrarily put forward
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a hypotheises, you are arbitrarily adding qualifications to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it to save appearances.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I'm merely trying to apply a little massage to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; intuition that this doesn't have to be so.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; You have no need to struggle to come up with a panpsychist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; theory,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I don't have a 'panpsychist' theory.  Rather, I've made some general
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; arguments relating to the various senses of the term 'to exist' with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; which I hope to give a shove to intuitions that have perhaps become
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; too stuck in one groove
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; since you have no valid objection to physicalism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; Your argument so far has been based on two dubious premises --
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; that eliminativism and functonalism are the only physicalist options,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; and that functionalism is arbitrary and in-the-eye-of-beholder.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Again, calling them 'dubious' is not an argument (as you correctly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; pointed out when I lazily resorted to 'specious').
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The first is just plumb wrong, and the second is based on a confusion,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have shown.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; AFAICS you have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; not independently argued for their dubiousness, but instead have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; gestured towards 'well-established' positions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you argue that X and Y are the only theories, how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; else can I refute that but to point to the existence of theory Z in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the literature?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Furthermore, I haven't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; at all claimed that they are the *only* physicalist options, I've
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; simply attacked these specific positions where they are resorted to.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; If you are prepared to confront what has actually been said,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; specifically and point for point, we may make progress, but otherwise
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I fear we shan''t get much further.
