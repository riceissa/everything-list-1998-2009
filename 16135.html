Hi Günther,
<br />
<br />Nice work Günther. Now my comment is longer than I wish. I really  
<br />
would insist on one change. See (**) below.

<br /><br />I would separate better the introduction to (general) mathematical  
<br />
logic ...
<br />
<br />Enderton (you mention it)
<br />
Mendelson (one of the best introduction to mathematical logic)
<br />
Perhaps the Podniek web page
<br />
The book by Boolos and Jeffrey (and Burgess for the last edition), and  
<br />
the book by Epstein and Carnielli
<br />
Kleene's 1952 book on Metamathematics.
<br />
<br />...from the  general book on computability (but those books are really  
<br />
needed already for the UDA, actually for the seventh step of UDA): so  
<br />
I would put them there: I am thinking about
<br />
<br />Cutland
<br />
Rogers
<br />
<br />And then come the most fundamental books on the logic of self- 
<br />
reference and/or provability logic per se (those are books on G and  
<br />
G*). This is part of AUDA:
<br />
<br />First the main initial original papers : Davis 1965 (contain Gödel  
<br />
1931, Church, Post, Kleene, Rosser). Then the textbook on self- 
<br />
reference (provability) logic:
<br />
<br />Boolos 1979
<br />
Boolos 1993
<br />
Smorynski 1985
<br />
Smullyan's Forever undecided (a recreative introduction to the modal  
<br />
logic G).
<br />
<br />And then you can add some books on (general) modal logic (but they are  
<br />
not needed because the book on provability logic reintroduces the  
<br />
modal logic). You did already mentioned :
<br />
<br />Chellas (excellent)
<br />
But the new edition of Hugues and Creswel is an easier one, and is  
<br />
very good too imo.
<br />
<br />The relation between modal logic and provability is a bit like tensor  
<br />
calculus and general relativity. Modal logic is but a tool, provabilty  
<br />
logic (sometimes called self-reference logics) is the object of study.  
<br />
It is part of AUDA. &quot;AUDA&quot; really begins with Gödel's famous 1931  
<br />
paper, and the very special modal logic G and G*, found by Solovay, is  
<br />
a machinery encapsulating all the incompleteness phenomenon.
<br />
<br /><br />(**) If you want make just one little change in the page:  in your  
<br />
sentence &quot;For modal logic these are further guides:&quot;  I would make  
<br />
clear you are referring to the modal logic G and G*, that is the logic  
<br />
of self-reference. Or just put &quot;provability&quot; or &quot;self-reference&quot;  
<br />
instead of modal.
<br />
<br />I would not put the Solovay paper in &quot;guide on modal logic&quot;. It is  
<br />
really the seminal paper on the self-reference logics.
<br />
<br />The modal logic G and G* are really the logic of provability or self- 
<br />
reference on which AUDA is based.
<br />
<br />I am aware we touch &quot;advanced matter&quot;, which presupposes a good  
<br />
understanding of mathematical logic, or metamathematics, something  
<br />
which is usually well known only by professional mathematical  
<br />
logicians. Even a genius like Penrose got Gödel's wrong. By the way,  
<br />
Hofstadter got Gödel's right in his book &quot;Gödel, Escher, Back&quot;. He is  
<br />
correct on computationalism too, but he missed the &quot;matter problem&quot;,  
<br />
and even the universal machine, the first person indetermincay and its  
<br />
&quot;reversal&quot; consequences.
<br />
<br />I have realized that some of my students have still a problem with  
<br />
completeness and incompleteness. In part due to the bad choice in the  
<br />
vocabulary (yet standard).
<br />
For example the theory PA (Peano Arithmetic) is complete in the sense  
<br />
of Gödel 1930, and incomplete in the sense of Gödel 1931.
<br />
<br />Completeness: (PA proves A) is equivalent with (A is true in all  
<br />
models of PA). This makes &quot;Dt&quot; equivalent with &quot;there is a reality&quot;:  
<br />
the basic theological bet.
<br />
Incompleteness: there are true arithmetical statement (= true in the  
<br />
standard model of PA) which are not provable by PA.
<br />
<br />Don't hesitate to ask any question. Of course UDA is *the* argument.  
<br />
AUDA is far more difficult and is needed to pursue the concrete  
<br />
derivation of the physical laws (among all hypostases). UDA shows that  
<br />
physics is a branch of computationalist self-reference logic. AUDA  
<br />
begins the concrete derivation of physics from the existing self- 
<br />
reference logic (thanks to Gödel, Löb, Solovay).
<br />
<br />Note that for a time i have believed that the hypostases were all  
<br />
collapsing. If this would have been the case, the comp-physics would  
<br />
have been reduced to classical logic, and what we call physics would  
<br />
have been a sort of comp-geography. The SWE would have been a local  
<br />
truth.
<br />
<br />Ask any question, we are in deep water. People like Tegmark and  
<br />
Schmidhuber are on the right track concerning the ontology. The  
<br />
intersection of Tegmark work and Schmidhuber's work gives the  
<br />
&quot;correct&quot; minimal ontology: the mathematical elementary truth (on  
<br />
numbers or mathematical digital machine). My (older) work derives this  
<br />
from comp and  the imperative of the mind body problem, which both  
<br />
Schmidhuber and Tegmark seems not willing to take into account: they  
<br />
presuppose some mind:machine identity which the UDA shows impossible  
<br />
to maintain.
<br />
<br />I cpntinue to think that for a non mathematician, a thorough  
<br />
understanding of the UDA is needed before AUDA. UDA is really the  
<br />
question,  including the consequences that the solution has to be  
<br />
given by the self-introspective universal machine; and AUDA is that  
<br />
beginning of the universal machine's answer. For a logician AUDA is  
<br />
far simpler than UDA, but only for them. My work, like the work by  
<br />
Penrose illustrates that mathematical logicians are not well  
<br />
understood by non logicians. Mathematical logicians lives in a ivory  
<br />
tower.
<br />
<br />Best,
<br />
<br />Bruno
