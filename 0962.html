Thanks to David Seaman and Bruno Marchel for acknowledging my posts.
<br />
<br />Bruno wrote in response to:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;All
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mathematical structures necessarily have in common an existence.
</em><br />
<br />This does not necessarily help. You could have said that all
<br />
mathematical structure have in common the fact that they ere equal
<br />
to themselves. But this does not help to give existence to the
<br />
set V = {x : x = x} in naive set theory.
<br />
<br />You are making a mathematical structure a thing, so that the thing is
<br />
equal to itself. If you notice I write and propose ideas from what may
<br />
seem like an alien perspective to others, perhaps without normal
<br />
definitive sets. To me, infinity is not a series. Real time, for
<br />
example, distinct from measurable clock time, is simply one enormous
<br />
moment, without beginning or end.
<br />
<br />Above I am saying that all mathematical structures exist undivided from
<br />
one another. All are here in the very same space we exist within. It is
<br />
a simple truism and for certain no argument can change this inevitable
<br />
truth. There is one physical Universe and one mathematical Universe,
<br />
un-divided by such things as universes that don't exist or mathematical
<br />
structures which don't exist. There is no meaning to the idea of
<br />
division between one structure and another, if there is no non-medium or
<br />
non-thing to divide them.
<br />
<br />And yes, the physical and mathematical Universe are the same. Any TOE
<br />
must unify all structures into one whole, and so model the definite not
<br />
as a multiplicity of worlds or things; a grande total sum, but rather as
<br />
a synthesis of many lesser parts of one grande whole, such as positive +
<br />
negative = a neutral whole.
<br />
<br />Because we interpret the world to be many things, we think of the
<br />
maximum universe as the maximum number of things, rather than a
<br />
synthesis of positive and negative and so two sets of infinities.
<br />
<br />We cannot bend our ordinary math, based upon the existence of definite
<br />
things, toward understanding a Universe of infinities. The axioms do not
<br />
allow it, since zero is nothing and numbers count an endless array of
<br />
things without completion. Example: the sum total of a positive infinity
<br />
(counting up indefinitely) and a negative infinity (counting down
<br />
indefinitely) is of course an indefinite sum. As well, to make things
<br />
worse, since zero is defined as no definite things, the sum, if we allow
<br />
ourselves to imagine a sum, it produces a cancellation, a sum of
<br />
nothing, when in fact the whole is a synthesized combination, an
<br />
everything, which by nature is not relative to anything but its internal
<br />
self (as a friend of mine, Steven Kaufman would say).
<br />
<br />Mmmh... My (humble) opinion is that &quot;existence&quot; is relative.
<br />
<br />Well, definition is relative, but existence is not relative. All
<br />
positive numbers and all negative numbers are relative. But zero is not
<br />
relative . You are not alone. Collectively we see and describe only the
<br />
defined world of things as real in physics and math.
<br />
<br />Existence appears indefinite because it doesn't have an opposite. This
<br />
is the precise reason everyone believes existence is relative, because
<br />
we think the world is made of things and that whatever is without
<br />
definition is not existent. Still, the laws of physics break down at a
<br />
singularity, where there is no longer a distinction between time and
<br />
space. It isn't that there is no such thing as a singularity. Rather it
<br />
is that infinity in nature is not a definitive process like the infinity
<br />
of ordinary mathematics. It is an actuality. And, for example, an
<br />
infinity of time (without beginning or end) is a singularity of time,
<br />
not a progression.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;There is no such thing; no meaning to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;anomalous idea that something doesn't exist.
</em><br />
<br />I like the idea, but I would put in in the relative way. Everything
<br />
exists for the genuine observer who can look at things from
<br />
some angle. I would say that there is no meaning to the
<br />
anomalous idea that something doesn't absolutely exist, except that
<br />
I don't believe in square circle or transcendantal fraction.
<br />
<br />Good point. This is what many people say to the argument that there is
<br />
no such thing as non-existence.
<br />
<br />Please notice that what I am saying, the argument that existence is
<br />
inevitable, without beginning or end, and is without opposite, because
<br />
non-existence cannot be, also applies to the idea of a square circle.
<br />
Separately non and existence have meaning. I can put the two words
<br />
together... non + existence and say the word non-existence, but together
<br />
the words form a contradiction in terms. No word can represent non-being
<br />
because there is no such state. There is no something that does not
<br />
exist. There is no meaning for the words to represent.
<br />
<br />Similarly, the idea of a square circle also mixes two meanings to form
<br />
what has no meaning. There is no meaning to the idea of a square circle.
<br />
But it isn't that a square circle does not exist. For that idea, that it
<br />
doesn't exist, also has no meaning.
<br />
<br />Hopefully you might sense just a bit what happens to one's view of
<br />
reality when the idea of non-existence is removed. You might consider
<br />
being aware of how often you use the notion and how integrated it is in
<br />
your thinking. Doing so certainly has had a profound effect on myself
<br />
and its exclusion has allowed me to be very productive in theoretical
<br />
cosmology, and some mathematical ideas, even without a good education.
<br />
This matter also has much to do with why I think of the universe and
<br />
reality as the stuff of knowing or meaning.

<br />
<br />Devin, you are very welcome to make such an interesting interpretation,
<br />
but
<br />
the three equations were meant to be read from the rather dry point of
<br />
view
<br />
of information theory.
<br />
<br />Do you mean that the statement sum(everything) = 0, means something
<br />
different than I interpreted it to mean. I interpreted 'sum' as a
<br />
combination of, 'everything' as all that exists, and then I recognized
<br />
that the use of zero was not consistent with the axiom or ordinary
<br />
meaning of mathematical zero as nothing or no things.
<br />
<br />I don't agree with seeing fundamental issues through a complex series of
<br />
ideas, (an example being the anthropic principle) over a simple study of
<br />
the basic meaning of such words as everything, nothing, or existence.
<br />
<br />sum(everything not known by conscious subjects) = 0
<br />
means that the parts of information space not observed by conscious
<br />
subjects are likely to be equivalent to white noise.  Any tests carried
<br />
out
<br />
by a  hypothetical outside observer would show zero information content.
<br />
<br />This is  because the part of information space available to conscious
<br />
subjects is probably of measure zero on the whole of information space.
<br />
<br />Again, which 0 do you mean? 0 as nothing; white noise; no information,
<br />
or 0 as the combined sum of everything.
<br />
<br />I would say that zero is being torn in half as we venture into MWs
<br />
theory. We are exacting a great deal of abuse to the concept of zero
<br />
these days.
<br />
<br />Zero is in my mind is the most fundamental axiom of math, physics,
<br />
philosophy, and yet we presently use it, especially in cosmology,
<br />
without consistency, in ways that its meaning changes vaguely back and
<br />
fourth between a finite count of things and a total measure of the all.
<br />
We constantly refer to the infinity of things, worlds, whatever, and no
<br />
one is saying that its all unreal, yet the sum total is somehow seen as
<br />
void and indefinite, as we default back to zero as nothing.
<br />
<br />The intuition that I expect everyone who believes in MWs shares yet
<br />
cannot reconcile on a mathematical or non-intuitive level is that
<br />
sum(everything) = 0. We do this because of one reason that is I admit
<br />
difficult to discuss and resolve. That which is exists. Anything that
<br />
exists is part of, and undivided from the whole of existence. There are
<br />
no border lands of non-being or non-matter separating worlds. It is all
<br />
inevitably one thing, one existence. Only from such a base can we move
<br />
forward.
<br />
<br />Back to Bruno who responded to:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;There is no such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;alternative. There is only being. That existence becomes what we think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of as a mathematical system and all mathematical structures are subsets
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the one elementary math.
</em><br />
<br />Euh ... This is a little too vague.
<br />
<br />I assume you mean  existence becomes what we think
<br />
of as a mathematical system...  is vague.
<br />
<br />Okay. First simple.
<br />
Everything, The Infinite, Universe, all could mean the same thing or
<br />
refer to the same base of existence. Each is a different way of saying
<br />
the same thing. Note that there is no more fundamental meaning than
<br />
existence. Out of that base comes the relative or defined. The most
<br />
basic and simple ideas or concepts are something and nothing. Like
<br />
positive and negative mathematical values they are relative and
<br />
contradictory. All that is defined is synthesized within either
<br />
something or nothing. As well, something and nothing are contained
<br />
within everything or existence. Again notice the simplicity of meaning.
<br />
<br />Consider that there are two versions of binary coding: (0,1) and (0,-1).
<br />
<br />Now more complex. I tried to clarify two different ways of describing
<br />
the value of 0 in a recent post. There is the 0 = nothing of ordinary
<br />
mathematics (or 0 things) and there is a very different system of values
<br />
where 0 = sum of everything which for years I have called symmetry math.
<br />
<br />Sum(everything) = 0
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Positive + Negative =  0 = neutral
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Positive whole + Negative whole = 0
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Infinity = 0  (Not axiomatically possible or describable in
<br />
ordinary mathematics)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New Axiom: 0 = sum of all reality =
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0 does not mean nothing or non-existence, absence, vacuum,
<br />
or void
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0 means indefinite, same as undefined, same as non-polar,
<br />
same as neutral
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0 means whole, complete, finished, same as singularity
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0 means not many but one thing, one whole, oneness
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New mathematical axiom: 0 = sum of all other numbers and values
<br />
=
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0 = Largest value in system
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 = Less than zero
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0 = whole infinity
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 = must be smaller than 0 or infinity
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 = ?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 = Combined sum of all real numbers also except (-1) is
<br />
missing
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 = Combined sum of all real numbers except (-2)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(-1) = Combined sum of all real numbers also except (1) is
<br />
missing
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sum of all numbers except (-2) = 2
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1,2,3...) all numerics other than zero in system are
<br />
infinite values less than 0
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Counting up into larger numerics = smaller value
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Larger numerics converge in value toward infinitely small
<br />
value
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smallest value in system =  +oo  or   -oo  (note: relates to
<br />
point of infinite density)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smallest value still is an infinity
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+oo = half of whole
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smallest value in system still equals half of whole
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+oo or -oo both definite infinite values, not processes, but
<br />
numbers
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+oo and -oo represent duality, definition, and thingness
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+oo and -oo are positive and negative singularities
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0 or oo is a neutral singularity (Omega zero)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(+oo)  +  (-oo)  = 0 = oo
<br />
<br />This is possibly difficult to accept, but I am proposing that ordinary
<br />
math reflects an abstract view of the world as many things, and that it
<br />
is secondary to a more primary mathematics. By no means am I suggesting
<br />
that the world of things is unreal or an illusion. The defined or
<br />
relative world is real but it is not fundamental. Existence is primary
<br />
or elementary. Definition and relativity is secondary.
<br />
<br />There is a mathematical system which measures definition and there is a
<br />
mathematical system derivable from the mathematical value that is
<br />
existence i.e. infinity.
<br />
<br />I believe the mathematical system of infinities described above is
<br />
similar to Cantor's Transfinite math, yet different. I haven't studied
<br />
Cantor as much as I would like to, but from what I have read and heard,
<br />
Cantor didn't clearly establish an absolute infinity, and am fairly
<br />
certain there is no whole spectrum, such as a smallest to largest
<br />
cardinal. I don't believe the series of cardinals was ever directly
<br />
related to the mathematical plane as an alternate set of axioms.
<br />
<br />I said existence as a mathematical system. In Symmetry math the absolute
<br />
set or absolute infinity is very clearly defined as zero. The smallest
<br />
possible infinities are +oo and -oo, yet each is half of the whole. Each
<br />
is a synthesize of all the positive numbers and all the negative numbers
<br />
(all other numbers are formed by the combination of positive and
<br />
negative values i.e. +1 equals a synthesis of all the positive numbers
<br />
and all the negative numbers except (-1)).
<br />
<br />I relate this system of values directly to basic meanings and the
<br />
physical universe of space-time. I believe +oo and -oo are equivalent to
<br />
something and nothing. I believe the point of infinite density
<br />
(positive) in our past is +oo, or half of the whole, and that the
<br />
universe expands and cools toward absolute zero because of an influx of
<br />
negative into that original positive.
<br />
<br />You computer gurus should like these elementary infinite numbers, since
<br />
the same ideas relate to binary logic 0 (oo) and 1 (+oo), except that
<br />
all those bit words are countered by an alternate universe of 0 and -1
<br />
(-oo). I would think this would relate to computation theory. Has anyone
<br />
considered an inverse set of computations? I am just now reading about
<br />
computation theory in Deutsch's Fabric of Reality.
