<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Interesting. I don't know how to proceed in this area.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />I've been meaning to write something up on this for a long time, but 
<br />
have never gotten around to it. I'll try now.
<br />
<br />FIRST, let me say I am not denigrating the quantum mechanics issue of 
<br />
Many Worlds. I was first exposed to it maybe 30 years ago, not counting 
<br />
science fiction stories about parallel worlds, and even Larry Niven's 
<br />
seminal &quot;All the Myriad Ways,&quot; which was quite clearly based on his MWI 
<br />
readings. Also, I am reading several recent books on QM and MWI, 
<br />
including Barrett's excellent &quot;The Quantum Mechanics of Minds and 
<br />
Worlds,&quot; 1999, which surveys the leading theories of many worlds (the 
<br />
bare bones theory, DeWitt-Graham, Albert and Loewer's &quot;many minds,&quot; 
<br />
Hartle and Gell-Mann's &quot;consistent histories,&quot; and so on. Also, Isham's 
<br />
&quot;Lectures on Quantum Theory,&quot; and I've just started in on Nielsen and 
<br />
Chuang's &quot;bible of quantum computers&quot; massive book, &quot;Quantum 
<br />
Computation and Quantum Information,&quot; from whence I got the funny 
<br />
Hawking quote about him reaching for his gun when Schrodinger's cat 
<br />
gets mentioned.
<br />
<br />So I am deeply interested in this, more so for various reasons than I 
<br />
was 30 or 20 or 10 years ago.
<br />
<br />SECOND, my focus is much more on the tools than on any specific theory. 
<br />
I may be one of the few here who doesn't some wild theory of what the 
<br />
universe is! (I'm only partly kidding...we see a lot of people here 
<br />
starting out with &quot;In my theory...universe is strand of 
<br />
beads...embedded...14-dimensional hypertorus...first person 
<br />
awarenesss...causality an illusion...M-branes are inverted...&quot; sorts of 
<br />
theories. Some have compared our current situation to the various and 
<br />
many theories of the atom in the period prior to Bohr's epiphany. 
<br />
Except of course that various theories of the atom in the 1900-1915 
<br />
period were testable within a few years, with most failing in one 
<br />
spectacular way or another. Today's theories may not be testable for 
<br />
1000 years, for energy/length reasons. (One hopes some clever tests may 
<br />
be available sooner...)
<br />
<br />When I say tools I mean mostly mathematics tools. I'm a lot more 
<br />
interested, for instance, in deeply understanding Gleason's Theorem and 
<br />
the Kochen-Specker Theorem (which I do not yet understand at a deep 
<br />
level!) than I am in idly speculating about the significance of QM for 
<br />
consciousness or whatever. (No insult intended for those who work in 
<br />
this area...I just don't see any meaningful connections as yet.)
<br />
<br />And the mathematical tools of interest to me right now are these: 
<br />
lattices and order (posets, causal sets), the connections between logic 
<br />
and geometry (sheaves, locales, toposes), various forms of logic 
<br />
(especially modal logic and intuitionistic logic), issues of time (a la 
<br />
Prior, Goldblatt, causal sets again), and the deep and interesting 
<br />
links with quantum mechanics. I'm also reading the book on causal 
<br />
decision theory that Wei Dai recommended, the Joyce book. And some 
<br />
other tangentially related things. A lot of what I am spending time on 
<br />
is the basic topology and algebra I only got smatterings of when I was 
<br />
in school, along with some glimpses of algebraic topology and the like.
<br />
<br />I'm using category theory and topos theory not as end-alls and be-alls, 
<br />
but as the lens through which I tend to view these other areas. 
<br />
Frankly, I learn faster and more deeply when I have some such lens. If 
<br />
this lens turns out to be not so useful for what I hope to do, I'll 
<br />
find another one. But for now, it gives me joy.
<br />
<br />I wrote a fair amount here last summer about topos theory, 
<br />
intuitionistic logic, notions of time evolution, and the work of Baez, 
<br />
Smolin, Markopoulou, Crane, Rovelli, and about a half dozen others. 
<br />
This remains a core interest, with some interesting (but not worked 
<br />
out, IMO) connections with QM (cf. the papers of Isham and Butterfield, 
<br />
and I. Raptis, and even some Russians). Bruno is more advanced than I 
<br />
am on the logic, as I have only gotten really interested in it 
<br />
recently. (I studied some logic out of Stoll, Quine, etc., and one of 
<br />
my best profs was Ray Wilder, a leading metamathematician of the 1950s. 
<br />
But I always thought logic was &quot;obvious, but grungy in the details.&quot; 
<br />
More akin to bookkeeping, in other words. It took my realization that 
<br />
all is not what it appears to be in Quine and Tarski and for me to 
<br />
realize that nonstandard logics may have deep significance for our 
<br />
views of the universe or metaverse. Reading Lee Smolin's &quot;Three Roads 
<br />
to Quantum Gravity&quot; and Greg Egan's &quot;Distress&quot; were what did it for me, 
<br />
triggering me to start buying and reading books on category theory, 
<br />
topos theory, modal and nonstandard logic, and so on.
<br />
<br />(Again, I currently have no pet theory of what Reality is. But I'm 
<br />
happy to be building a base of tools to be able to more intelligently 
<br />
comment later. Having a pet theory is not so important.)
<br />
<br />THIRD, here's an explanation of some of the names I mentioned in the 
<br />
paragraph you quoted:
<br />
<br />&quot;Aristotle, Leibniz, Borges, C.I. Lewis, David Lewis, Stalnaker, Kripke&quot;
<br />
<br />* Aristotle. Famous of course for &quot;A or not-A&quot; classical logic 
<br />
(although modern logicians typically refer to &quot;classical logic&quot; as that 
<br />
of Frege, Russell, Tarski, et. al., that is, the logic which took shape 
<br />
around 1900). But even Aristotle knew the limitations of &quot;A or not-A.&quot; 
<br />
Consider the proposition &quot;There will be a sea battle next month.&quot; 
<br />
Either true or not true, right? Aristotle understood that not only do 
<br />
we &quot;not yet know&quot; the answer, but that in a deep sense there can BE NO 
<br />
ANSWER at this time, the time we are making the statement. If in fact 
<br />
the answer is &quot;Yes, there will be a sea battle next month,&quot; or the 
<br />
inverse, then this implies nothing we do today can change this truth.
<br />
<br />Aside: Part of the &quot;the answer must be yes or no&quot; intuition we 
<br />
initially have comes from our observation that in a month we will have 
<br />
either answered the question in the affirmative or the negative, that 
<br />
this is our Bayesian experience with recording history. &quot;In a month 
<br />
we'll have our answer one way or the other&quot; is what we have always 
<br />
experienced. This is the &quot;honest observers will always agree&quot; point 
<br />
that Smolin makes at one point, which can be interepreted in 
<br />
topos-theoretic terms as a time-varying set or a set with a subobject 
<br />
classifier. &quot;The moving hand of time writes, and having writ, moves 
<br />
on.&quot; But Aristotle was anticipating modal logic, the logic of &quot;it must 
<br />
be the case&quot; (square) and &quot;it may be the case&quot; (diamond).
<br />
<br />* Leibniz. He also dealt with possibilities, with &quot;possible worlds.&quot; A 
<br />
possible world is a world which, for example, does not violate any laws 
<br />
of logic. (There are some possible worlds which violate our known laws 
<br />
of physics, some which obey laws of physics, etc. Differing gradations 
<br />
of &quot;possible&quot; are often used.)
<br />
<br />Voltaire later wrote about &quot;this is the best of all possible worlds,&quot; 
<br />
but Leibniz deserves the credit for thinking deeply about the idea.
<br />
<br />Aside: Possible worlds are all around us. Fiction, &quot;what if?,&quot; even 
<br />
planning. More on this below.
<br />
<br />* Borges. I mentioned him because of his seminal &quot;Garden of Forking 
<br />
Paths&quot; story. He was not the first to write about alternate 
<br />
histories...I'm not sure who wrote the first recognizable story in this 
<br />
genre. Probably as old a concept as any.
<br />
<br />* C.I. Lewis (I hope I got his initials right...can't check right now) 
<br />
was an American logician who formalized modal logic around 1920. One of 
<br />
his systems, or that of his collaborators perhaps, was the &quot;S3&quot; (and 
<br />
&quot;S4&quot;) systems which Bruno often mentions. I won't define these here, as 
<br />
the Web has better and more detailed explanations than I can give here.
<br />
<br />It was shown in the 1930s that some of Lewis' modal logic systems 
<br />
correspond exactly to some of the  logic systems which arise in 
<br />
Intuitionistic logic (Brouwer, Heyting). Godel proved this, and then 
<br />
Marshall Stone showed some representation theorems linking such 
<br />
geometric ideas as the topologies of open sets and their algebras to 
<br />
the logics described by Lewis and others. (Some of these results I 
<br />
discussed last summer, such as simple examples of why &quot;not (not A) is 
<br />
not the same as A.&quot; Saunders Mac Lane gives a good example of this in 
<br />
&quot;Mathematics Form and Function,&quot; and I gave an example last summer of 
<br />
how &quot;not (not Past) is not the same as the Past, in terms of light 
<br />
cones and causal reasoning. Prior, Goldblatt, and others have 
<br />
interpreted Stone's work in terms of the nature of time. I find this 
<br />
fairly compelling, though it is only a _facet_ of reality, not a theory 
<br />
of reality.
<br />
<br />* David Lewis is a much more recent logician, who died just a couple of 
<br />
years ago. He is sometimes caricaturized as the guy who believes that 
<br />
there &quot;really are&quot; worlds in which unicorns exist, that there really 
<br />
are worlds in which Germany won the Second World War, etc. (By the way, 
<br />
I'm rereading Phillip K. Dick's important novel, &quot;The Man in the High 
<br />
Castle,&quot; about just such a possible world.)
<br />
<br />But Lewis was no dummy. In his books &quot;Counterfactuals&quot; and &quot;On Possible 
<br />
Worlds&quot; (book not handy to me where I am typing), he makes the case for 
<br />
&quot;modal realism,&quot; arguing that nothing is gained by adopting the conceit 
<br />
that the world we &quot;are&quot; in is the &quot;actual&quot; world and that other 
<br />
possible worlds are of lesser status or are wholly fictive. I think he 
<br />
has a point.
<br />
<br />He argues that some possible worlds which we actually know to be 
<br />
unachievable in any actual reality are of more importance to us than 
<br />
more achieveable worlds. For example, the possible world of ideal 
<br />
geometric shapes. We know that we can make a rope or a pencil line more 
<br />
and more ideal by straightening out its kinks, narrowing the line, etc. 
<br />
At the end of this refinement process, this nested series of 
<br />
improvements (shades of Stone's topology, by the way), lies the 
<br />
possible world of the straight line or the perfect plane. And so on, 
<br />
for all of our ideals. Some call this &quot;Platonia.&quot;
<br />
<br />Where this stops being obvious is where our next guy, Saul Kripke, 
<br />
comes in.
<br />
<br />* Kripke. Saul Kripke looked at certain linguistic problems and found 
<br />
that the semantics of possible worlds provided important answers. I 
<br />
confess that I have not found his one book, &quot;Naming and Necessity,&quot; to 
<br />
make this point as clearly as I would like, so I am relying mostly on 
<br />
what others have said about his work.
<br />
<br />The semantics of possible worlds is having a lot of significance for 
<br />
AI, especially in scene and language understanding, planning, etc. (An 
<br />
example would be a robot explorer on Mars attempting to understand what 
<br />
it is &quot;seeing&quot; by constructing various possible worlds and comparing 
<br />
sensory data against those &quot;mental models&quot; and trying to determine 
<br />
&quot;which world are we actually in?&quot;
<br />
<br />Aside: Much of science and everything we do is connected to trying to 
<br />
determine which of many possible worlds we are in. Assuming there is 
<br />
&quot;the&quot; world is not so useful. Agents of bounded rationality, or agents 
<br />
in a world of limited and finite information, must test their notions 
<br />
of which world they are actually in. Connections to philosophy of 
<br />
science, falsfifiability, decision theory, etc. are pretty obvious, and 
<br />
this is why the work Kripke did in the 1960s has had an enormous effect.
<br />
<br />OK, these were some of the names I mentioned. Bruno probably knows of 
<br />
some I missed. (Oh, I left out Stalnaker here. He's a contemporary of 
<br />
David Lewis and has similar, though slightly less &quot;radical,&quot; ideas.).
<br />
<br /><br />FOURTH, and last for now, what does all this stuff have to do with MWI 
<br />
and QM?
<br />
<br />One of the reasons people take to the Many Worlds Interpretation (or 
<br />
are repelled...) is that it suggests that the other realities, the 
<br />
possible worlds, are somehow more &quot;real&quot; than the mere figments of some 
<br />
novelist's imagination are, or more real in some tangible sense than 
<br />
the possible worlds of Platonia are. And perhaps we can even 
<br />
_communicate_ with these worlds (a la the novel by James Hogan in the 
<br />
mid-90s) or even _travel_ to these worlds (a la Barnes' &quot;Finity&quot; and 
<br />
many other novels and stories).
<br />
<br />The formalism of the theory makes &quot;splitting on quantum events or 
<br />
measurements&quot; look more &quot;physically plausible&quot; than just hand-waving 
<br />
about realities where Germany won the Second World War might seem.
<br />
<br />However, I argue that the views are not different at all. Any 
<br />
_possible_ world, of the sort where the laws of physics are obeyed but 
<br />
specific details are diferent, is formally indistinguishable from a 
<br />
possible world where things branched a different way than in the world 
<br />
we find ourselves in. (I think this can be formalized more precisely, 
<br />
probably in terms of sheaf theory and related topological/logical 
<br />
ideas, but I'm a long way from attempting this formalization myself.)
<br />
<br />And of course in an Eganesque or Tegmarkian way (&quot;Distress&quot; with &quot;all 
<br />
topologies model&quot; and Tegmark with &quot;everything&quot; theory, respectively), 
<br />
one can extend the possible worlds to those with different laws of 
<br />
physics (talked about even earlier than Egan and Tegmark, of course) 
<br />
and even with different laws of mathematics (naturally reflected in 
<br />
toposes, which are like universes of mathematics, pocket realities).
<br />
<br />In other words, the quantum branchings are not needed to give the same 
<br />
piquancy to the idea of parallel realities.
<br />
<br />Unless, of course, one thinks the quantum branchings are &quot;real&quot; in some 
<br />
ways that merely conceivable branchings are not. Which may turn out to 
<br />
be the case...and Deutsch (or is it Deutch?) would argue that Young's 
<br />
double slit experiment already tells us that the other branches already 
<br />
_do_  (must, modal square) exist and that coherence between many 
<br />
realities is maintained for at least a while. Entanglement, in other 
<br />
words.
<br />
<br />I'll wrap up here.
<br />
<br />I hope this better explains where my interests lie and what I think is 
<br />
a fertile area for mathematical and logical work. Of course, the lack 
<br />
of experimental verification (aside from the above point, which is an 
<br />
interpretation, subject to alternative interpretations) makes the 
<br />
situation we are now in quite interesting and quite frustrating.
<br />
<br />Best wishes,
