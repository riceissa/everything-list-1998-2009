Hi Johnathan, Kim, Stathis
<br />
<br /><br />I agree with you Johnathan. Scientists learn a lot from extreme cases,  
<br />
and altered states of consciousness is worth to study, even to  
<br />
understand better what is a &quot;normal&quot; (if that exists) states of  
<br />
consciousness.
<br />
<br />Now remember that our brain seems to generate already by itself a  
<br />
numerous of different &quot;naturally&quot;,  or self-altered, consciousness  
<br />
states.
<br />
The most amazing and well known is the state of the so called  
<br />
paradoxical sleep, or REM period, or dream state, or reality  
<br />
simulation state. It is a state unknown by the dinosaurs and the  
<br />
reptiles. It appears with the birds and then all the homeothermic  
<br />
animals. Michel Jouvet called it paradoxical, because it makes the  
<br />
animal hallucinated and paralyzed which makes it an easy prey for the  
<br />
predator, yet that states has survived 65 millions of years, nobody  
<br />
really knows why, but we suspect its importance.
<br />
<br />During sleep, with some training you can be &quot;lucid&quot; not just during  
<br />
the REM paradoxical state, you can be somehow lucid during the slow  
<br />
wave states, and that gives roughly speaking another collection of  
<br />
four &quot;natural altered states&quot;. Fever, some headache, some stroke could  
<br />
lead to variants.
<br />
<br />Why altered states? I can find plausible that in situation of stress,  
<br />
like for a mouse in the mouth of a cat, your probabilities of  
<br />
surviving are made higher if your brain has a system of self calm  
<br />
down, if not self lying. It is known that mouse indeed generates  
<br />
endogenous morphine like pain killer, and as you know the brain is  
<br />
full of enhancers and inhibitors. Most drugs coming from plants are  
<br />
molecules looking like our own inhibitors of enhancers, general or  
<br />
specific. Which means (but don't repeat) that the first big drugs  
<br />
constructor is the brain itself (don't repeat because make they will  
<br />
make the brain and computer illegal).
<br />
Like anything alive a big part of the work consists in self-repairing  
<br />
and all those endogenous drugs, well all, depending the amount, can  
<br />
alter *a little bit more* the state of consciousness, than it does in  
<br />
normal circumstances, so that, again, a normal state of consciousness  
<br />
is a sum of altered states in a equilibrium, belonging to some  
<br />
neighborhood of states.
<br />
<br />And why does plant constructs altered states of consciousness  
<br />
molecules? In my opinion it has all to do with the incredibly complex  
<br />
relationships that plant have with animals, in general, and insects in  
<br />
particular. Many plants have to detract predator insects. By killing  
<br />
them, or by just smelling like, or imitating the smell of, of the  
<br />
appearance of  the worst predators of the insect (sort of lies!). But  
<br />
they must also to attract insects, feed them, and manipulate them in  
<br />
such a way that Mister plant can send its Message to Missis Plant  
<br />
which leaves at five miles from Him. You bet that with millions of  
<br />
years they knows about manipulating insects and animals, from predator  
<br />
and pollinator to consumers.
<br />
<br />And which explains perhaps why there are so much medicinal and  
<br />
&quot;psychedelic&quot; plants (entheogen).
<br />
<br />Now I agree with you Johnathan, that for discussing about  
<br />
consciousness, we should distinguish between drugs which alter the  
<br />
mood and the perception, like cannabis and alcohol from hallucinogen,  
<br />
like some mushrooms and cactus, and dissociators like Ketamine. Salvia  
<br />
Divinorum, strictly speaking, is a bit of both a dissociator and an  
<br />
hallucinogen. The first alter your &quot;actual&quot; consciousness, the second  
<br />
triggers an actual different in nature experience, like an out of body  
<br />
experience, or a near death experience, or a dream, or a dream-like  
<br />
scenario. Typically and without training you don't remain lucid: you  
<br />
forget you are under the product. You can't take Salvia casually, you  
<br />
take it to live a particular experience which requires your attention,  
<br />
and preparation.
<br />
<br />Now, I would not compare the effect of Salvia with anything produced  
<br />
by any other entheogen. When smoked, it produces an effect which lasts  
<br />
in general between 3 and 6 minutes. Unlike cannabis, alcohol, LSD, and  
<br />
many others, the effect is disphoric, meaning not typically pleasant.  
<br />
Animals does not push twice on the &quot;button&quot; with salvia, showing in  
<br />
particular it is not addictive. Normal, &quot;my thesis&quot; in four minutes,  
<br />
the poor animals!
<br />
<br />The effect are quite different from people to people, and according to  
<br />
the concentration of the salvinorin molecules. You find it  from 1X  
<br />
(the leaves), to 5X, 10X, ... 40X (beyond it seems to me only the  
<br />
price grows up, not the effect).
<br />
<br />Many meet typical archetypes (elves, carnival wheel, clown). Some will  
<br />
relive childhood events, or complete life of someone else. Most will  
<br />
talk about a strong pulling or pushing rotation, physically felt,  
<br />
which can sometimes leads to being cut in billions parts and send to  
<br />
as much parallel realities (some can panic here). All talk about  
<br />
realities and perception of realities. many% (on about 1000 reports)  
<br />
talk explicitly about feeling a &quot;feminine presence&quot;, which &quot;teach&quot; you  
<br />
something, the last point of it seeming unmemorable. Some lives the  
<br />
experience very badly. In my own experiment, with 30 participants (one  
<br />
by one), they made rewarding experiences, you just need to be patient  
<br />
and to increase the amount of concentration incrementally, and to  
<br />
encourage the respect of the plant. Most learns this by experience.
<br />
<br />Is it safe? The effect are impressive, but apparently not dangerous.  
<br />
If you look at the YouTube Video, you see that used in the worst  
<br />
conditions it leads, in the worse case only to bruises and nightmares.  
<br />
(With alpinism, a slight error can kill you and others). Like  
<br />
cannabis, no overdose level exists. Given big amount of  
<br />
&quot;infinityX&quot; (pure salvinorin) to rats makes then &quot;sleep&quot; for 4  
<br />
minutes, and then they resume their activities. It is estimated that  
<br />
on the last 2 millions of American who smoked salvia, there are zero  
<br />
death related to it, nor even emergency calls. There are thousand of  
<br />
death related to alcohol consumption, and many more injuries, just to  
<br />
compare.
<br />
<br />Salvia is above all a medicinal plant. Incredibly enough, I did cure a  
<br />
severe migraine recently. The person told me she did try all possible  
<br />
medications, without success, she has to just keep calm in the dark  
<br />
for 12 hours. A little hit of leave made it disappear in three  
<br />
minutes.  It is one of the main use among the Mazatec. It helps for  
<br />
nasal congestion too, it helps for sleep (always 1X here).
<br />
It is antidepressant, and it is antiaddictive. It is a medication  
<br />
against drugs!
<br />
<br />And yes Kim, it is easy (far more than cannabis which is already easy)  
<br />
to grow your own plant and to multiply it. It is alas less easy to  
<br />
find the plant, there are no seeds available, because Salvia Divinorum  
<br />
has literally abandon sexual reproduction (I think she did have its  
<br />
own predator as pollinator, explaining the subtleties of her message).
<br />
You don't need light, she hates light, she loves the dark, heat and  
<br />
water a lot. She lives, or at least her ancestors were used to live  
<br />
(because since 700 years she has been cultivated by the Mexican  
<br />
Mazatec) in dark hot and humid forest, in the nightlight of the day  
<br />
within the shadows of trees with many branches. Below 0° (celsius) she  
<br />
dies.
<br />
<br />I am glad I found my master. A plant!  (grin). But I will continue to  
<br />
explain UDA+AUDA for those who prefer the pure third person  
<br />
communicable way. Don't worry, (or worry, perhaps :).  It is a  
<br />
question of taste. Reality is creative, beyond wonders and surprises.  
<br />
People who does not like wonders, surprises should not study computer  
<br />
science and logics, neither physics, and should avoid Lewis Carroll  
<br />
and Salvia Divinorum. That plant likes joking. Here a video of someone  
<br />
very sensible, and a bit unprepared, who seems to appreciate the joke:
<br />
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1QavlZe2H8&amp;feature=channel_page">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1QavlZe2H8&amp;feature=channel_page</a>
<br />
<br />About that plant, I would like to add that I am certainly in favor of  
<br />
some regulation. But criminalization of it is no less than criminal.  
<br />
The plant becomes really dangerous: it can send you to hell (jail),  
<br />
even without smoking it!
<br />
We should have laws forbidding defamation about products related to  
<br />
health. Against the abuse of systematic well known errors of logic,  
<br />
the ignorance of what is a trance states, etc.
<br />
<br />Best,
<br />
<br />Bruno
