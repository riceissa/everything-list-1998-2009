<br />As I said, I am an engineer, and am not too familiar with philosophical

terms. My approach as been to apply to its ultimate conclusion, Galileo's and

Einstein's principle of relativity. Each &quot;self&quot; is an observer, unique in his 
<br />
or her perspective on the MW. I do not agree at all with your term &lt;&lt;&quot;*mean* 
<br />
machines (and the means are taken on the whole set of 
<br />

<br />
participatory universe with which I do not agree at all. It's like saying 
<br />
that there is an Ether which defines absolute motion in the Universe. In 
<br />
contrast, I believe that each &quot;beholder&quot; or observer carries his own frame of 
<br />
reference. Each Self has his own perspective, or IS HIS OWN, PERSPECTIVE of 
<br />
the MW.
<br />
<br />Going back to relativity theory. Its principles can be expanded to the domain 
<br />
of information theory and consciousness through Shannon's concept of &quot;mutual 
<br />
information&quot; which I like to call &quot;relative information.&quot; Taking an excerpt 
<br />
from my book:
<br />
<br />Beginning of Quote
<br />
&lt;&lt;
<br />
&quot;&quot;Claude E. Shannon, an American mathematician, the founder of information 
<br />
theory, derived a concept called mutual information according to which, the 
<br />
amount of information contained in a given message transmitted from a source 
<br />
to a destination database, is not fixed but depends on the information 
<br />
already available at the destination database. In other words information is 
<br />
a relative quantity. For example, if you are told that &quot;a day on earth has 24 
<br />
hours,&quot; the amount of information transmitted to you with 27 characters, 
<br />
including spaces, is zero because I have not added anything new to your 
<br />
knowledge base. However if I tell you &quot;a day on Mars has 23 hours,&quot; the 
<br />
amount of information carried by these 25 characters is probably significant 
<br />
since you are less likely to know this fact. Thus, the information transfer 
<br />
between us is relative to our mutual states of mind. By the same token, 
<br />
perception of the world is relative to our frame of mind...&quot;

<br />
<br />How does this affect our concept of consciousness? Each self can be viewed as 
<br />
a &quot;Godelian?&quot; machine with his own set of axioms and rules. When the behavior 
<br />
of a &quot;thinking&quot; entity, A, is predictable, from the point of view of a second 
<br />
&quot;thinking&quot; entity, B, then from B's point of view, A has no free will. 
<br />
Otherwise, if A is not predicatble, then A has free will. The degenerate case 
<br />
occurs when A looks at himself. Can A predict his own thoughts (or his own 
<br />
actions)? Obviously yes and no, for as soon as he makes the prediction he 
<br />
also has the thought!
<br />
<br />So my point of view, I guess, is not that computationalism, (if I understand 
<br />
the term) causes consciousness, but it is the BREAKDOWN of computationalism 
<br />
that does. Consciousness arises at the border between what can be 
<br />
computationally known and what is, for Godelian reasons, beyond computation. 
<br />
It requires one to REFLECT on oneself, in a kind of infinite recursion, to 
<br />
experience the Self (Le Moi). It is kind of a logical black hole, a blind 
<br />
spot of the mind, as I have explained earlier. Consciousness is a consequence 
<br />
of the infinity of the MW.... it is also related to the experience of the 
<br />
divine (for the religious among you). EACH SELF IS HIS OWN PERSPECTIVE OF THE 
<br />
MW.

<br />Here is a little story that extends Newcomb's paradox, again an excerpt from 
<br />
my book (excuse its lack of conciseness - Also, please keep in mind that this 
<br />

<br />
<br />Beginning of Quote
<br />
&lt;&lt;
<br />
Relativity of Free Will
<br />
A wonderful way to illustrate the relativity of free will is the Newcomb 
<br />
paradox, named after its originator, William A Newcomb, a theoretical 
<br />
physicist at the University of California, Lawrence Livermore Laboratory. 
<br />
This paradox was published for the first time by Robert Nozick, a philosopher 
<br />
at Harvard university, and reprinted by Martin Gardner in the Scientific 
<br />
American (July 1973 and March 1974).
<br />
<br />This paradox involves a God-like or extraterrestrial Being with an 
<br />
extraordinarily precise knowledge of human psychology, capable of predicting 
<br />
choices that humans make. His ability to second guess people has been 
<br />
unquestionably proven in numerous tests involving large numbers of people 
<br />
making choices. Never once has this Being been wrong. He presents a human, 
<br />
that we’ll call Alice, with two boxes B1 and B2 and explains to her that she 
<br />
will be given the opportunity to choose either B2 only, or both B1 and B2. B1 
<br />
will contain $1,000 and B2, will either contain $1 million or nothing. He 
<br />
also explains that he already knows what her decision will be. If she decides 
<br />
to select only B2, he will, before she actually makes her choice, deposit 
<br />
$1,000 in B1 and $1 million in B2. If she decides to pick both B1 and B2 he 
<br />
will deposit $1,000 in B1 and nothing in B2. He then ask Alice to leave the 
<br />
room temporarily so that he can deposit money in the boxes. When Alice 
<br />
returns, he asks her to make her choice. What should she do? 
<br />
<br />If she decide to take both boxes, the Being would, most probably, have left 
<br />
B2 empty and she will only get the $1,000 in B1. Contrariwise,  If she 
<br />
decides to take only B2, the Being would have put the million in it. This 
<br />
argument appears to favor choosing only B2. 
<br />
<br />On the other hand, what the Being has done cannot be undone. Reverse 
<br />
causality does not exist and present actions cannot influence the past. If 
<br />
Alice were to select only B2, it would not change the fact that B1 contains 
<br />
$1,000. So why not take it too? Clearly it is in the advantage of Alice to 
<br />
take both boxes. 
<br />
<br />Alice’s first reaction is to question the validity of the test and the 
<br />
credibility of the Being. Given the laws of nature as she knows them, there 
<br />
is no possible way for such a being to exist she argues. She is then assailed 
<br />
by self doubts. Is it possible, after all, that her own consciousness and 
<br />
free will is just a figment of somebody’s imagination? Is it possible that 
<br />
the Being is God? Unable to resolve these issues, she confides in her 
<br />
co-workers, her friends and her clergyman. What could possibly motivate God 
<br />
to give her such a test she asks....
<br />
<br />Implicit in the statement of this paradox is that your brain operates 
<br />
according to purely deterministic rules and that the Being uses this fact to 
<br />
predict Alice’s decision. Also, implicit is the fact that Alice is making 
<br />
conscious decisions. In fact both of these assumption could be challenged. As 
<br />
explained previously, the brain may not operate according to purely 
<br />
deterministic rules and such a perfectly prescient Being may be a physical 
<br />
impossibility. In addition Alice’s consciousness may exist only in 
<br />
relativistic terms. What appears to be a free choice for Alice may not be for 
<br />
the super Being. How is this possible? We can illustrate these ideas by 
<br />
extending Newcomb’s paradox.
<br />
<br />As it turns out, Alice is a very good AI engineer. Her human simulation 
<br />
program, the Advanced Digital Automatic Machine or ADAM has won the Turing 
<br />
Olympiads several years in a row, having repeatedly convinced or fooled the 
<br />
judges into believing that it is human. Whether the judges were &quot;convinced&quot; 
<br />
or &quot;fooled,&quot; of course, depended on the frame of reference of the observer 
<br />
since consciousness is relative, as was already explained in the second 
<br />
section. Alice was of the firm opinion that the judges were fooled, but her 
<br />
boss and coworkers were more kind. They believed that she had truly created a 
<br />
conscious machine. 
<br />
<br />Having unsuccessfully grappled with questions such as who the Being is and 
<br />
why he gave her this test, she decides to conduct an experiment and to find 
<br />
out how ADAM would react to the same test. After examining ADAM’s programming 
<br />
very carefully, she finds out that one of the parameter used by ADAM 
<br />
subroutines has a high value. As a result, ADAM has the tendency to assert 
<br />
his independence from authority and therefore, if ADAM is ever faced with the 
<br />
Newcomb test, it would pick both boxes. 
<br />
<br />She then gives the Newcomb test to ADAM, playing herself the role of the 
<br />
super Being. The results are interesting. First ADAM goes into a flurry of 
<br />
digital activity. It questions the validity of the test itself and the 
<br />
credibility of Alice, claiming that a being such as Alice is physically 
<br />
impossible. It then commiserates that its own consciousness may be an 
<br />
illusion. It even links to chat rooms on the Internet to discuss with real 
<br />
humans the theological implications of Alice being God and what could 
<br />
possibly be her motive in giving this test. Finally, ADAM makes its choice. 
<br />
And as Alice has predicted, it picks both boxes… 
<br />
<br />Annoyed with the predictability of her own program, Alice turns the computer 
<br />
off. After pondering for five minutes how to make her program unpredictable 
<br />
she shrugs her shoulders and walks away. She then goes back to the super 
<br />
Being and picks both boxes…
<br />
<br />This example illustrates the relativity of free will. ADAM is a very good 
<br />
human simulation program which has passed numerous Turing tests. From the 
<br />
point of view of the judges, there is no question that ADAM is conscious and 
<br />
has free will. From the point of view of Alice, however, ADAM is very 
<br />
predictable and has fooled the judges into believing that it is human. It 
<br />
consists of 5,000,000 lines of code which she has spent the past ten years of 
<br />
her life writing. By the same token, from the point of view of her 
<br />
colleagues, Alice appears to be conscious and to have free will, but from the 
<br />
point of view of the Being, she is a very predictable ensemble of atoms. 
<br />
<br />Consciousness and free will are relativistic concepts that depend on the 
<br />
frame of reference of the observer and in this case, the frame of reference 
<br />
is the mind of the observer. When the observer is a superior being in 
<br />
comparison with the observed, the observed is perceived as having no free 
<br />
will. When the observer is an inferior being, the observed is perceived as 
<br />
having undisputed free will. When the observer observes himself, then the 
<br />
perception of free will becomes undecidable. This is precisely the situation 
<br />
where consciousness arises.

.)
<br />
<br />OR the computationalist hypothesis is false.
<br />
<br />That is why I ask for, ultimately, a serious consideration on Church's

thesis.
<br />
<br />I agree with Wheeler that physics cannot explain the origin of the 
<br />
physical
<br />
laws, by itself. Physics inspired without doubt our issues, but physics 
<br />
per se
<br />
doesn't help for in some sense physics IS the issue.
