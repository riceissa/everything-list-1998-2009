<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hi Russell,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I got your book. Congratulation for that very nice introduction to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subject and to your ideas. It is a very gentle and lovely book.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Probably because you are to kind to your audience, it seems to me you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have sacrifice perhaps a bit of rigor. I am still not sure about your 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; most basic assumption, but I see we share a big amount of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; philosophy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am already glad you did take into account 1/5 of my earlier remarks, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I wish you at least five next editions ;-).
</em><br />
<br />That's a bit like the old chinese curse - &quot;I wish you live in
<br />
interesting times&quot;! 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; To be honest I don't think you really get the comp idea, and it is a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; good think your work does not really rely on it. 
</em><br />
<br />It is true that my work is an independent line of work, but probably
<br />
related. I am interested in the connections, however.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now I will not hide 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the pleasure I have when seeing the 8 hypostases (even the sixteen 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one!) sum up through their modal logic in table 71 page 129.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I will neither repeat my olds comments nor make new one, but hope our 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; future discussion will give opportunities to clarify the possible 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; misunderstandings and relationship between our approaches.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />Indeed.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I let you know that I will be very busy from now until end of october, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so that I will be more slow for the comments' replies (or more grave 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for the spelling mistakes if that is possible).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ==================================
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This can make sense only if you tell us how to interpret a string or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; how you interpret the Nothing, I mean formally.
</em><br />
<br />Interpretation is by an observer. Formally, the observer is a map from
<br />
a string to an integer. To understand why the observer is such a
<br />
formal object requires informal modelling talk, obviously.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  From this I infer that your nothing is an informal theory of infinite 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; strings.
</em><br />
<br />It is a mixture of both. The formal part is not so interesting, but
<br />
necessary to get some interesting conclusions.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Also I give only ontological status to object in the scope of an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arithmetical existential statement. For example I do believe in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence of prime numbers.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />Whereas I think the whole notion of &quot;existence&quot; is highly dubious. :)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; must be inconsistent, of course.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Only a theory can be inconsistent. But I don't see a theory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />I would say also that interpretations could be inconsistent, but
<br />
perhaps there is not much difference between interpretation and
<br />
theory. Would you say &quot;There is a red flower&quot; is a theory, or merely
<br />
an interpretation of an image?
<br />
<br />If it were possible to view the entire &quot;Nothing&quot;, it would be
<br />
an inconsistent interpretation. However it is not so possible, and
<br />
indeed it may be true that it is impossible to have an inconsistent
<br />
interpretation (I do not assert this however).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; reasoning about it need not be, and certainly I would be grateful for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; anyone pointing out inconsistencies in my writing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is why I would insist to be as clear as possible so that the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inconsistencies are more easy to find.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />Indeed - however we do have a difference in emphasis. Yours is towards
<br />
more formal models, but with obscure modeling relations, whereas I
<br />
prefer to spend more effort on the modeling relation than with the
<br />
formal content (the formal content of my ideas are small, no doubt why
<br />
you are disappointed!)
<br />
<br />In that respect, I am more the physicist, and you the mathematician. :)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Perhaps the exchange is unfair because I react as a &quot;professional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; logician&quot;, and you try to convey something informally. But I think 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; at some point, in our difficult subject, we need to be entirely clear
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; on what we assume or not especially if you are using formal objects,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; like strings.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I'm not that informal. What I talk about are mathematical objects, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; one can use mathematical reasoning.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The formal/informal distinguo has nothing to do with the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical/non-mathematical distinguo. Nor with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rigorous/non-rigorous.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 100 % of mathematics, including mathematical logic is informal. Now, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logicians studied &quot;formal theories&quot; or &quot;machines&quot; because it is what 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they are studying. But they prove things about &quot;formal systems&quot; in an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; informal way like any scientist.
</em><br />
<br />Well, yes - we probably are using the word formal differently
<br />
then. For me, a formal system is a mathematical system with the
<br />
modelling relation thrown away. Triangles without trangular shaped
<br />
paddocks for example.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In some context formal and informal are relative.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course a description of a formal system looks formal, but we reason 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *about* those formal systems. Now, if your strings are all there is, I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wait for an explanation of what those strings does &quot;formally&quot;, but I am 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not asking to formalize your reasoning in your string-language, unless 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for illustrative purpose in case you want to illustrate how a string 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interprets something. Like we can explain how a brain or more simply 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; how a turing machine can interpret some data. To be sure, given that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your strings are infinite I have no clue how the strings can interpret 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />Nor do I. Observers do the interpretation, the strings are what they
<br />
observe. Self-awareness requires some form of mapping between strings
<br />
and the observer. Supervenience means this is a map, not a multimap.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I should note that the PROJECTION postulate is implicit in your UDA
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; when you come to speak of the 1-3 distinction. I don't think it can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; derived explicitly from the three &quot;legs&quot; of COMP.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<br />...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Fair enough, the &quot;Yes Doctor&quot; is sufficiently informal that perhaps it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; contains the seeds of the PROJECTION postulate. When we come to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; discussion of the W-M experiment, there are 3 possible outcomes:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 1) We no longer experience anything after annihilation at Brussels
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;    (contradicts YD)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 2) We experience being both in Moscow and Washington simulteously
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;    (kinda weird, and we dismiss as a reductio, but could also be seen
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;    as contradicting PROJECTION)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 3) We experience being in one of Moscow or Washington, but not both,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;    and cannot predict which.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I've noticed a few people on this list arguing that 2) is a possible 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; outcome -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; probably as devil's advocates.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Really? I thought only Chalmers does that. Do you know someone else?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Lee Corbin was apparently doing that, but when I insisted on the 1/3 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distinction, Lee did eventually admit he could not predict its 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; immediate future *first person* experience: the comp 1-person 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indeterminacy (casr &quot;3)&quot; above). OK Lee, if you are still there?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />But is this 1-3 distinction implicit within your statement of COMP?
<br />
I'm not sure that it is.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; That would certainly be eliminated by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; something like the PROJECTION postulate.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Honestly I feel it not being necessary, for the same reason the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; collapse is not necessary in QM.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />Collapse is conceived of as a physical process, and as such is
<br />
problematic. Nonphysical collapse is just the 1 POV of the
<br />
Multiverse. That's all I'm talking about.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What is 1*, is it  &quot;1111111111...&quot; why 1/2?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is it &quot;1&quot; follow by any strings. Then OK, for some measure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />Yes - I'm just using standard regular expressions. The measure will
<br />
follow provided we insist on another rule:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;m(x_1x_2...x_N*) = m(y_1y_2...y_N*)
<br />
<br />\forall x_i, y_i.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Looks like a topological line, but would need to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; check the axioms.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It is &quot;Nothing&quot;, because of the modelling relation, and the insistence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that all we can know of anything comes in the form of strings.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is that a new postulate? Why &quot;Nothing&quot; ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />It is not new, it underlies all of Chapter 2 of my book, and also of
<br />
&quot;Why Occams Razor&quot;. Perhaps I'm guilty of assuming it without
<br />
explicitly stating it, but by way of challenge can you give me a piece
<br />
of knowledge that doesn't come in the form of a string? It is
<br />
certainly hard, given we live on the opposite sides of a digital world
<br />
- a record of a telephone conversation we have will be a a string of
<br />
bits, as will any emails we use, any my book left my hands in the form
<br />
of a string of bits and so on.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Indeed, but a theory of everything should, in some sense (by definition 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of everything). If you have only infinite string in the ontology, I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; guess you have to modelize the observers by an infinite string, or by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something you can derive from the set of infinite strings, and you have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to explain how you make the derivation, and how those observer will 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; converge on your theory, or explain why they diverge from it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />Perhaps thats why I say my theory is a &quot;theory of nothing&quot;
<br />
:). Seriously, all I am interested in an understanding of why the world is
<br />
as it appears - theories of everything are of little use.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; One
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; can use whatever mode of logical reasoning one is comfortable with -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sure, but in front of unclarity or conceptual problems we should be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; able to say which logic we use, even informally, like with or without 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; excluded-middle, or with or without some infinity axiom, etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />I use the usual one (excluded middle), and I don't use any infinity
<br />
axiom that I'm aware of.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I guess you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; presuppose some set theory? 
</em><br />
<br />Yes. See page 6 of &quot;Why Occams Razor&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is different to say &quot;all strings exist&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and &quot;the set of all string exists&quot;. Again, in some informal reasoning 
</em><br />
<br />Yes - I appreciate the ontological difference. I would say that only
<br />
&quot;Nothing&quot; exists (in ontological meaning). Strings and sets of strings
<br />
only exist in the same sense that the number &quot;1&quot; exists.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; to make that difference explicit would be falling in the 1004 fallacy, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but if you say the strings are the fundamental object, then if you talk 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on that set you have to explain in which sense that set is a string.
</em><br />
<br />The set of all strings is not a string in itself - there is no need
<br />
for self-reference. But there is a need for the string to describe the
<br />
observer of that string - this is the supervenience or anthropic
<br />
issue. And I note there is still unfinished work here, for those who
<br />
sense an element of confusion. I don't have _all_ the answers.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; To my knowledge only the UD does that effectively. In a frame with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; infinite objects, some non effective way has been given but it always 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lead toward very difficult mathematics (ZF + axiom of anti-foundation 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like Stephen appreciates, or NF + universal sets (NF = Quine's new 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; foundation; nobody know really if NF is consistent).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />Perhaps - but I think this more correctly touches on the
<br />
anthropic/supervenience issue.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; When one shows that this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; leads to Occams razor, one is doing logic, not ontology.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Are you really saying that Occam follows from your string &quot;theory&quot;?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Also you could perhaps use &quot;stream&quot; instead of &quot;string&quot;, to prevent 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; confusion with the use of string by physicist, and also because for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; many computer scientist strings (of characters) are supposed to be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; finite. Just a little suggestion.
</em><br />

<br />Arrrgh! That is why I used &quot;description&quot; in the first place! Now
<br />
someone will complain they are confused because stream might mean a river...
<br />
<br />At some point we need to pick a word and define it. Something
<br />
pronouncable usually helps.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; To be franc I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; astonished you want already infinite objects at the ontological level.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; If *all* infinite strings are in the ontology, that could be a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; departure from comp (and that would be interesting because, by UDA,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; that would make your theory predicting a different physics and then we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; could test it (at least in principle), and only when your theory will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; be precise enough.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I'm not convinced it is a departure from COMP, but as you say it would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; be interesting if true. Can you elaborate further on your reasons,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; perhaps saying which infinite strings cannot be found in UD* for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; example?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I could elaborate a lot about the vagueness of the notion of &quot;finding&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something in the UD* (the infinite complete running of the UD).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I could ask &quot;finding by who?&quot;, from inside? from the terrestrial 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (verifiable) view or the divine one (true but non verifiable)?, from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which x-person point of view? Etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Given that the UD cannot not dovetail on all the reals, there is a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense in saying all the infinite strings are generated, but this gives 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a noisy background first person machine have to live with. The UD is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not equivalent with &quot;all infinite strings&quot;, the UD* is a static given 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of all computations. Those computations can be represented by very 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; peculiar finite and infinite strings together with a non trivial 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure inherited from computer science/number theory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />About the only difference I see is that the measure might be different...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; I though your ontic TOE (the strings) was similar to RA, but I guess I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; was wrong, so I am less sure I understand what you try to do.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I would say it is more like assuming that UD* exists, whilst remaining
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; silent on the topic of whether a universal dovetailer exists, or even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; on the prerequisites such as AR or the CT thesis.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What could &quot;UD* mean, without CT? 
</em><br />
<br />Um - the set of all infinite length strings perhaps?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you don't use CT, you have to give 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at least one precise universal machine (or sigma1 complete theory).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />No - we needn't suppose a builder, just because we see a
<br />
cathedral. This is the falacy of Paley's watch.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; or you note as I do that the set of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; strings is the simplest possible object (by definition of simplicity).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; An infinite set of infinite objects ? Including obviously some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure on it, if only to give sense to your projection postulate, I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; am not sure this is simple.
</em><br />
<br />One can &quot;prove&quot; it. If N is the set of all strings, C(N)=0 for all
<br />
observers, where C is the complexity function defined in equation
<br />
(2.1) of my book, or equation (2) of &quot;Why Occams Razor&quot;.
<br />
<br />Of course this is ultimately a metaphysical argument relying on a
<br />
modeling relation - if you don't accept it, there is not much I can do
<br />
about it. Of course if you arrive at the same position from another
<br />
angle (such as from COMP), I don't have a problem with that either.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; guess your theory is complementary to comp instead. 
</em><br />
<br /><br />I more or less always assumed this. Either COMP is more specialised
<br />
(you can derive some my postulates from COMP, and others are compatible
<br />
with it), or COMP is the only way of deriving these same postulates,
<br />
or COMP in some way contradicts these postulates.
<br />
<br />I do not know which after 8 years of studying it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; UD* is a far more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sophisticate mathematical structure than a real topological line. Its 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sophisticateness, if I may say, comes from the non triviality of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computer science, of the Fi and the Wi, for example,  through the many 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; incompleteness phenomena, and it is that highly structured complexity 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which gives rise to highly non trivial internal n-person views (the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hypostases and their logical multiverses).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />Ideed. And if we think hard enough, these additional structures may be
<br />
empirically distinguishable. One can dream...
