<br />
One problem with &quot;reality&quot; in the context of multiverse theories is that
<br />
it may mean different things to different people.
<br />
<br />If we assume (for analytical purposes) that some form of multiverse
<br />
exists, then ultimately the reality is the multiverse.  But it seems that
<br />
each person is constrained only to see one universe out of the multiverse.
<br />
For him, that universe is all that is real, the rest of the multiverse
<br />
is irrelevant.  So already there is confusion over whether we should
<br />
include the other worlds of the multiverse in &quot;reality&quot;.
<br />
<br />I have been exploring the concept that the Universal Distribution exists
<br />
and is &quot;real&quot;.  Reality in this model is every computer program execution,
<br />
or equivalently (I would claim, but it is not too important here) every
<br />
information pattern.
<br />
<br />This is a sort of &quot;multiverse&quot;, in that it includes multiple &quot;universes&quot;.
<br />
Anything that can be created by a computer program exists, and arguably
<br />
universes fall into this category.
<br />
<br />But it also includes other things.  Chaotic information patterns
<br />
that would not seem to possess most of the properties of a universe
<br />
exist as well - without time, or causality, or dimensionality perhaps -
<br />
just raw noise.
<br />
<br />And disembodied consciousnesses exist, too.  We could each have our
<br />
information patterns, the processes that make up our minds, be produced by
<br />
programs which do not actually create the rest of the universe but simply
<br />
contain hard-coded sense impressions which are delivered by clockwork.
<br />
<br />The UDist framework allows us to theoretically approximate the measure
<br />
of these various information objects, so we can say that some are more
<br />
&quot;prominent&quot; in the multiverse than others.  But all exist, all are real,
<br />
in this model.
<br />
<br />One of the points Bruno makes is that in these kinds of models,
<br />
the reality for a given observer is pretty complicated.  Much of the
<br />
multiverse is irrelevant to him, but that doesn't mean he can focus on
<br />
just one universe as &quot;real&quot;.  The observer spans multiple universes and
<br />
multiple realities.
<br />
<br />In the UDist framework, I would say it in this way:  Many programs
<br />
create the information pattern corresponding to a given observer.
<br />
Some of those programs create the observer as part of a relatively
<br />
straightforward universe that corresponds fairly simply to his sense
<br />
impressions.  Some programs create the observer within a universe that
<br />
has a far more subtle and complex relationship to what the observer
<br />
senses.  In some universes the observer is part of a simulation a la
<br />
The Matrix, being run on artificial machines within that universe, so
<br />
that what the observer sees has little relation to the &quot;true reality&quot;
<br />
of that universe.  And some programs create the information pattern as
<br />
I described above, without a real universe at all, so that the observer
<br />
in effect hallucinates the entire universe.
<br />
<br />The point is that all of these programs exist, hence all contribute
<br />
measure to the observer.  From the observer's perspective, all of these
<br />
are in a sense &quot;real&quot; to him.  However, he can in principle calculate
<br />
(at least approximately) the numerical contribution made by each of
<br />
these programs, and perhaps it turns out that the vast majority of the
<br />
measure comes from just one of them.  He might be justified in that case
<br />
in largely ignoring the others and saying that only that one is &quot;real&quot;
<br />
for him.
<br />
<br />But for full precision he must still take into consideration all of
<br />
the programs that could create instances of his information pattern,
<br />
and consider all of them to be &quot;real&quot; to some extent.  And then, perhaps,
<br />
he may choose to accept that the whole multiverse is real, even the parts
<br />
which do not affect him.  Otherwise he has to say that all programs exist
<br />
which happen to include an information pattern corresponding to him,
<br />
the observer who is making this claim.  That's not a very compelling
<br />
theoretical model.
