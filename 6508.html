Jesse comments on Brian's remarkable and exceedingly valuable
<br />
explication (thanks, Brian!), even if some old-timers are
<br />
having deja-vu all over again, and are wondering if indeed
<br />
the universe isn't hopelessly cyclic after all.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; triggering tape locations. To make it even simpler, the read/write head can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; be replaced by a armature that moves from left to right triggering tape
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; locations. We have a very lazy machine! It's name is Olympia.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The main objection that comes to my mind is that in order to plan ahead of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time what number should be in each tape location before the armature begins 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moving and flipping bits, you need to have already done the computation in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the regular way--so Olympia is not really computing anything, it's basically 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just a playback device for showing us a *recording* of what happened during 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the original computation.
</em><br />
<br />It seems to me that you are exactly correct!  Admittedly I'm not
<br />
very articulate on this, partly because it's such a mystery, BUT:
<br />
<br />It seems to me that there must be real information flow between
<br />
states of a real computation. When things are just laid out in a
<br />
way that circumvents this information flow, this causality, then
<br />
neither consciousness nor observer-moments obtain.
<br />
<br />I admit that this is most peculiar. I admit that this may be
<br />
just another way of saying that time is mysterious. I admit
<br />
that it is logically possible that ditching the real universe
<br />
and regarding it as only a certain backwater of Platonia could
<br />
be correct. But so far:  I can't accept it, and partly for the
<br />
*moral* aspects that Jesse brings up later.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't think Olympia contributes anything more to the measure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the observer-moment that was associated with the original 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computation, any more than playing a movie showing the workings
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of each neuron in my brain would contribute to the measure of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the observer-moment associated with what my brain was doing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; during that time.
</em><br />
<br />Just so. But don't you find this difficult, as I do?  Don't
<br />
we need stronger arguments than these to counter those who
<br />
believe that Platonia explains everything?  Don't you also
<br />
feel that time and causality are linked here strongly, and
<br />
that somehow you and me and people like us seem to have a
<br />
&quot;faith&quot; that time and causality are real and independent of
<br />
such performances of Olympia, or &quot;performances&quot; by the
<br />
timeless Universal Dovetailer?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But this would still be just a playback device, it wouldn't have the same 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;causal structure&quot; (although I don't know precisely how to define that term, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so this is probably the weakest part of my argument)
</em><br />
<br />yes, we seem to have the same misgivings after all
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This actually brings up an interesting ethical problem. Suppose we put a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deterministic A.I. in a simulated environment with a simulated puppet body 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whose motions are controlled by a string of numbers, and simulate what 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happens with every possible input string to the puppet body of a certain 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; length.
</em><br />
<br />An old idea, the Giant LookUp Table, or GLUT, did what to me
<br />
amounts to the same thing.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The vast majority of copies of the A.I. will observer the puppet 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; body flailing around in a completely random way, of course. But once we have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a database of what happened in the simulation with every possible input 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; string, we could then create an interactive playback device where I put on a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; VR suit and my movements are translated into input strings for the puppet 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; body, and then the device responds by playing back the next bit of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appropriate recording in its database. The question is, would it be morally 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wrong for me to make the puppet body torture the A.I. in the simulation?
</em><br />
<br />In my opinion: NO.  It would not be morally wrong, because (as
<br />
you too believe) there are no observer moments in the playback.
<br />
When subsequent events are *causally* calculated from prior ones,
<br />
then, and only then, can moral issues arise, because then, and
<br />
only then, does an entity either benefit or suffer.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm really just playing back a recording of a simulation that already
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happened,
</em><br />
<br />that's right!
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so it seems like I'm not contributing anything to the measure of painful 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer-moments for the A.I., and of course the fraction of histories where 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the A.I. experienced the puppet body acting in a coherent manner would have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; been extremely small.
</em><br />
<br />Yes.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I guess one answer to why it's still wrong, [IT IS???]  besides 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the fact that simulated torture might have a corrupting effect on my own 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mind,
</em><br />
<br />yeah, but that's not relevant. Let's hypothesize that you're
<br />
a very strong adult and can watch, say, violent or really scary
<br />
films or other portrayals, and not be too &quot;disturbed&quot;
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; is that there's bound to be some fraction of worlds where I was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tricked or deluded into believing the VR system was just playing back 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recordings from a preexisting database, when in reality I'm actually 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interacting with a computation being done in realtime, so if I engage in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; torture I am at least slightly contributing to the measure of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer-moments who are experiencing horrible pain.
</em><br />
<br />Very good point.  An important part of these hypotheses that we
<br />
play with is that we aregiven all the information.  Thus, we do
<br />
not need to have the concern that you have just voiced.
<br />
(It's interesting enough, as is.)
<br />
<br />Yes, indeed, whenever called upon to do something momentous, it
<br />
is wise for one to always question one's sanity, and to double-check
<br />
that (for example) the world really will be saved if I shoot down
<br />
that airliner, or throw an innocent person out of an airlock as in
<br />
the Tom Godwin (Ray Bradbury) story, &quot;The Cold Equations&quot;. But those
<br />
considerations aren't really relevant here, so far as I can see.
<br />
<br />As most readers will agree, it is better for a million portrayals
<br />
of Auschwitz to occur, than for one genuine kitten to be thrown into
<br />
boiling water. Now an *emulation* of Auschwitz?  Well, that would be
<br />
different. Goodbye kitty, I'm sorry.
