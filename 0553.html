<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let box one contain m pounds and box two 2m pounds, where m is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any real positive number. You may choose a box look at the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; amount of money inside and decide either to keep this amount or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the other box's amount. (For this exercise you may think of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cheques with real numbers on it and a special bank account where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you can  actually bank any real number of pounds.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In Peter's inaugural, he suggested that if you pick a box at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; random and find x pounds, you might conclude that the other box
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; either contains x/2 or 2x pounds, the average of which is 1.25x.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So you are better off (on average by 25%!) choosing the other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; box. He left it to the audience to decide whether this conclusion
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is valid or not.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It was immediately clear to me - and I am sure, it is immediately
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; clear to you - that the argument is flawed.
</em><br />
<br />Errrm... do you mean the argument exactly as given above (with the
<br />
conclusion that choosing randomly and then always switching - which is
<br />
of course just a different style of &quot;choosing randomly&quot;! - is 1.25 times
<br />
better than not switching) is flawed? If so, then you and I certainly
<br />
agree it's flawed, and probably Pete agrees too! (Though he'll have to
<br />
speak for himself of course.) Or do you mean the &quot;meta-argument&quot; (which
<br />
correctly points out the absurdity of one random 50-50 choice generation
<br />
protocol being 1.25 times better than another, but goes on to conclude
<br />
sweepingly that *no* choice protocol, random or non-random, can be
<br />
better than any other for this problem) is flawed? If this latter, then
<br />
I agree with you that the &quot;meta-argument&quot; is flawed - though maybe for
<br />
different reasons than yours! - and I think Pete possibly *disagrees*
<br />
and takes the meta-argument to be just fine, sweeping conclusion and
<br />
all! (Again, of course, he'll have to speak for himself... I really
<br />
shouldn't play guessing games with other people's opinions like this. I
<br />
wasn't even at his inaugural talk after all!!)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We both know that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; choosing a box at random (eg, using a fair coin) and keeping the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contents gives you 1.5m pounds on average. The same is true by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; symmetry if you choose a box randomly and keep the contents of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the **other** box: both methods must add up to the 3m pounds.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />Exactly. That's the &quot;correctly points out&quot; clause at the beginning of
<br />
what I'm calling the meta-argument above. Fine so far. And indeed any
<br />
other *non-quantity-of-money-driven* elaboration of &quot;50-50 random
<br />
choice&quot; would be no better or worse too. You can think up really
<br />
glorious protocols here, like choosing a box, choosing an integer to say
<br />
how many times to &quot;dither back and forth&quot; (of course this integer may as
<br />
well be restricted to 0 or 1 since dithering back and forth is cyclic
<br />
mod 2), and then duly &quot;dithering&quot; that many times before finally
<br />
announcing the box one settles on. All these
<br />
non-quantity-of-money-driven elaborations are the same as just flipping
<br />
a coin and getting the thing over with.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Peter's argument has the following flaw: The core argument is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that reading one box's cheque (say, amount x) makes the contents
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the other box's cheque amount a random variable with values 2x
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and x/2 and a uniform distribution (50% probability for either).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But the contents of the other box is not random at all! It is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; either 2x or x/2, and this depends on the experimentor's mood
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; when the boxes were set up.
</em><br />
<br />I agree here - everything depends on the distribution the experimenter
<br />
used to generate the secret number m (the number which is used to fill
<br />
the boxes with m and 2m) in the first place. Even if the experimenter
<br />
later says something like &quot;But I didn't use a distribution! I just shut
<br />
my eyes and thought of a number on a whim!&quot;, that statement is
<br />
scientifically meaningless - after all their &quot;whim&quot; has to be encoded
<br />
somehow in their brain state, and so the distribution is &quot;whatever
<br />
probabilities brains in that whim-state have for thinking up numbers&quot;.
<br />
By hook or by crook, there's a distribution for m lurking in there!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;                                                       This is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; classical example for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assuming a probability distribution for something that you don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; know. People who do this
</em><br />
<br />...(including me!)...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;                                           call themselves Bayesians.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The problem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with the Bayesian  approach is that in some cases, when you are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not careful, it can produce misleading results.
</em><br />
<br />Ah, but all good Bayesians are careful. :-)
<br />
<br />I think what you mean by being &quot;not careful&quot;, in the context of this
<br />
example, is taking the distribution for the question &quot;Is the box I've
<br />
just opened the m box or the 2m box?&quot; to always be 50-50, *even after
<br />
you've read the quantity of money it contains*. That would indeed be not
<br />
just careless but wrong - it is, after all, 50-50 *before* you've read
<br />
the quantity of money, and *therefore*, for that very reason, is not in
<br />
general 50-50 *after* you've read the quantity of money. If you had
<br />
access to the experimenter's secret distribution for generating m in the
<br />
first place (which is not the same thing as access to the value of m
<br />
itself on this occasion, I hasten to add!), you could perform the update
<br />
in a fully proper and knowledgeable way. If you are a Bayesian, then
<br />
even in the absence of access to the experimenter's distribution for m,
<br />
you take it upon yourself to do the next best thing to this: you make
<br />
your own guess as to &quot;what kind of distributions experimenters like when
<br />
playing games with people&quot;, you weight *these* distributions according
<br />
to a guessed set of weightings (&quot;meta-distribution&quot;?) of your own, you
<br />
collapse the meta-distribution of &quot;ordinary&quot; distributions into one
<br />
consolidated distribution by the standard
<br />
&quot;multiply-it-all-out-and-add-it-all-up&quot; method, and you use *that*
<br />
next-best-thing consolidated distribution (and your just-obtained
<br />
knowledge of the quantity of money in the box you opened) to update your
<br />
weightings - previously 50-50 - for that dangling question this long and
<br />
rambling paragraph started off with: &quot;Is the box I've just opened the m
<br />
box or the 2m box?&quot;. Then, of course, you switch iff your updated
<br />
weightings favour the unopened box. Phew! :-)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thinking deeper about Peter's box problem after the inauguration,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I thought that there might be a similar experiment that actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; increases your expected return of 1.5m.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You may find this astonishing, but I actually came up with a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; strategy that has an expected return of **more than** 1.5m -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no matter what m is (as long as m is bigger than zero).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In order to increase suspension a little and give you some time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to think about this, I'll reveal my method to you - after you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reply to this mail saying something to the effect of &quot;It would be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; astonishing and completely unbelievable that such a method should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exist&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Regards!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Stefan
</em><br />
<br />Well, as should now be clear, I wouldn't use *those* words - and in fact
<br />
the algorithm I said a good Bayesian would follow (the business about
<br />
the consolidated distribution, in my long and rambling paragraph above)
<br />
*would*, I believe, increase the expected return above 1.5m in most
<br />
real-life cases. Even using a very crude caricature of what I called the
<br />
meta-distribution in that paragraph would probably raise the expected
<br />
return a wee bit above 1.5m. So, I'm not saying such an algorithm would
<br />
be &quot;astonishing and completely unbelievable&quot;. Not at all! But of course
<br />
I'd still like you to tell me your method. I'm too tired to work out a
<br />
particular instantiation of my own &quot;algorithm in words only&quot; in my long
<br />
and rambling paragraph above! :-)
<br />
<br />Bye for now... (and apologies to those on the Theories of Everything
<br />
mailing list for whom this might all be a bit out of context - but it is
<br />
a fairly well-known &quot;toy probability paradox&quot; in the literature, and
<br />
Stefan's explanation of it at the beginning is quite self-contained.)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Iain.
