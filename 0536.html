<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Gilles Henri:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;What I'd like to stress is that even if infinite computing is a &quot;practical&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;possibility (the word &quot;practical&quot; should be carefully defined in that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;context), it would not realize a duplication of an individual being in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;same world, but rather a duplication of the entire Universe. So it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;conceptually different of the COMP hypothesis of Bruno, which applies to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;the generation of &quot;clones&quot; of yourself, who could eventually replace you.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Perhaps I should insist that the comp hypothesis, as I conceive it, does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;put any restriction on the level of substitution.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Comp is still correct if the correct description of my brain is given by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the complete quantum state of the &quot;universe&quot; (the multiverse).
</em><br />
<br />My point was that
<br />
1) COMP can be correct only at this level (at least...)
<br />
and
<br />
2) then it forbids the ACTUAL copy of an individual being in our apparent
<br />
world.
<br />
<br />if you agree, many discussions on this forum assuming a copy of people
<br />
become void of interest...
<br />
<br />But in fact I think that if you give up the idea of simulating a perfect
<br />
copy of yourself (and ONLY yourself) with a computer (i.e. building another
<br />
&quot;you&quot; in our universe), that is if you admit that you need to simulate a
<br />
brain+its complete physical environment to reproduce its actual evolution,
<br />
you loose completely the &quot;computer-like&quot; nature of the brain. The COMP
<br />
hypothesis has now nothing to do with the fact that we are conscious. You
<br />
are only saying that physical laws are computable (I agree) and that their
<br />
computation is equivalent to their physical implementation for ANY system
<br />
(not only conscious beings). That's the strong assumption. So it's not
<br />
surprising that you end up with the last conclusion...which was in fact an
<br />
hypothesis included in Comp from the beginning.
<br />
<br />BTW there is still an unanswered question. The mystery of consciousness
<br />
comes from the fact  that with mechanism, human beings and brain are
<br />
nothing else than ordinary matter (whatever the latter can be). So why is
<br />
consciousness specifically attached to this matter? If with Comp you need
<br />
to simulate a complete Universe to reproduce brain evolution, you face the
<br />
same mystery, because the brain would be made of the same kind of
<br />
computation as the whole physical Universe. So the question remains.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;If you appeal to &quot;spatio-temporal&quot; continuity here, you are begging the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;question. Only if comp is false can such an argument be use to define a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;non
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computational -may be correct, but outside the scope of my working
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;hypothesis- definition of identity.
</em><br />
.....
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The main problem here is to understand our motivation, I mean the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;motivation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of those who are searching for a *theory of everything*.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I do not accept a theory of everything which put the &quot;problem of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consciousness&quot; under the rug. And once you mind seriously the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem with comp, you eventually realise that it is much more easy to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;explain where our beliefs in &quot;physical structures&quot; come from than to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;explain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; how a *subjective* belief can be *attached&quot; to anything *material*.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Gilles, you said elsewhere in this discussion that you don't take
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the physical laws for granted. But if you base an identity criterion on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;things like &quot;physical continuity&quot; you will enter into a loop...
</em><br />
<br />I don't know the nature of space and time and why there are physical laws.
<br />
I just know that they appear to exist - in our perception of Universe. So
<br />
are us. By defining identity, which is in all manner an appearance, you
<br />
must refer to what we can measure, which is certainly not the ultimate
<br />
reality. In the discussion with James we were really speaking of the
<br />
possibility of creating another &quot;you&quot; and try to define what we mean by
<br />
that. I don't think you can give a definition of what is &quot;you&quot; without
<br />
referring to a spatio-temporal frame, just like you cannot define what an
<br />
&quot;eddy&quot; is without referring to a fluid flow, whatever fluids are made of.
<br />
&nbsp;Again a more profound theory (like statistical mechanics) must be able to
<br />
decribe how the approximate quantities (like velocity, density) emerge from
<br />
the deeper level. That's what I miss in Comp. I don't see how the physical
<br />
appearance (space, time, matter ) emerges from a succession of 0 and 1. But
<br />
you already told me that your goal was not to find a better physical
<br />
theory, and I already answered you that then it belongs to the field of
<br />
metaphysics, and that I doubt that anything useful can emerge from that...
<br />
A+
<br />
<br />Gilles
