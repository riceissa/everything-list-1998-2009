<br /><br /><br /><br />Why so much fuss for just having 1000$ more than 1000000$ ?
<br />
I would take box A, letting the 1000 dollars in box B as a pourboire for
<br />
the predictor :-)
<br />
<br />A more symmetric version of the paradox prevents this joke.
<br />
The predictor gives you the choice between taking 2 boxes or just
<br />
one. In that case you can choose it at will. The predictor said
<br />
again that he can predict what you will do; and in case you will take the
<br />
two boxes, he will put nothing in it! If you take just one box, he
<br />
puts  1000000$ in each boxes.
<br />
<br />This version makes possible to reason in term of Einstein's reality
<br />
elements (which he did introduce in the famous EPR paper).
<br />
<br />Einstein defines an element of reality by the rule: If I can predict
<br />
with certainty the outcome of an experiment I could do (but will not do)
<br />
then the outcome I would have find corresponds to an element of reality.
<br />
<br />The &quot;rational&quot; causalist Rachel reasons like that: the predictor is
<br />
very good (hypothesis) so by taking one box I will gain 1m$.
<br />
Now this does not depend on which box I choose. So I can predict with
<br />
certainty that if I take only box A, I will find 1m$ inside, and
<br />
similarly I can predict that if I take only box B, I will find 1m$ inside
<br />
too. Like in EPR the causalist Rachel supposes some form of locality
<br />
(no action at a distance, no action in the past, ...). This gives a
<br />
proof that the element of reality &quot;owning 1m$&quot; is true for each boxes.
<br />
So she decides to take the two boxes. And because the predictor is
<br />
indeed good, she wins O$!
<br />
<br />The &quot;irrational (?)&quot; evidencialist Irene reasons like that: the predictor
<br />
is very good (hypothesis), so by taking just one box I will gain 1m$
<br />
---whichever box I choose!  So let me choose just one box.
<br />
And she goes away with her box, and she wins 1m$. Rachel comes by and ask
<br />
her if she (Irene) realizes that she has just abandoned 1m$. 'No, said Irene.
<br />
'the predictor would have predict I would have take the two boxes, and he
<br />
would have put nothing in it. And I would have win 0$. Why not take seriously
<br />
the hypothesis that the predictor is good'. -'But still you know there
<br />
is 1m$ left in the other box', said Rachel. 'Yes, Irene said, 'but only
<br />
because the predictor knew I will take only one box. Now nothing prevent you
<br />
of taking the other box'. So thanks to &quot;irrational&quot; Irene, both of them
<br />
wins 1m$. And then they married and get a very happy life! The kind of
<br />
life you can get when you manage to handle both cause and evidence, a subtle
<br />
mixture of reason and madness perhaps!
<br />
<br />My opinion: Giving the hypothesis that the predictor is good, I think
<br />
Irene makes the right choice. In both this version and the traditional one.
<br />
In real life, though, I would be doubtful that such a predictor can exist.
<br />
So I am not sure there can be a pragmatic content in those stories.
<br />
I think also Hal makes an interesting point showing perhaps the first (to
<br />
my knowledge) rational argument for a role of consciousness/free-will in
<br />
&quot;collapsing&quot; the wave packet(*), or for consciousness deciding the output of a
<br />
quantum experience, or, in this version, consciousness making up 
<br />
elements of reality (all this deserves perhaps to be more deeply 
<br />
scrutinized).
<br />
The weakness of the argument comes from the existence of the predictor hyp.
<br />
<br />Bruno
<br />
<br />(*) Still in Everett sense, not in the Copenhague sense.
