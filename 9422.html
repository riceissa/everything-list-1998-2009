<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK.  I see that so far (above) there's no problem.  (See below for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where I still have concern(s).)  Here I was taking a fixed N, but G is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; defined as the diagonal, so my comparison is not valid, and so my proof
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that G is infinite for a fixed N is not valid.  I was taking G's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assignment of an ordinal of omega as being that it is in every way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; larger than all Fi's, but in fact G is larger than all Fi's only when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comparing G(n) to Fn(n), not when comparing G(Nfixed) to Fi(N) for all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; i's.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Right.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK.  I think you are just throwing me off with your notation.  Do you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have to use transfinite ordinals (omega) to do this?  Couldn't you just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stay with successively combining and diagonalizing, like below, without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; using omegas?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; G(n) = Fn(n)+1
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Gi(n) = G(...G(n)), G taken i times
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then instead of using more and more additional letters, just add
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subscripts...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; H1(n) = Gn(n)+1
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; H1i(n) = H1(...H1(n)), H1 taken i times
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; H2(n) = H1n(n)+1
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; H2i(n) = H2(...H2(n)), H2 taken i times
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then the subscripts count the number of diagonalizations you've done,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and every time you do the Ackermann thing, instead of adding an omega
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you add another subscript.   Then it continues ad infinitum.  You can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do the Ackermann thing with the *number* of subscripts, i.e. do the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ackermann thing on the number of times you've done the Ackermann
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thing... etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This may just be a technical point, but it doesn't seem precise to do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very much arithmetic with ordinals, like doing omega [omega] omega,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because you're just ordering things, and after a while you forget the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computations that are being performed.  I can see that it works for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just proving that you can continue to diagonalize and grow, which is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what you're doing.  I just don't want to be caught off guard and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suddenly realize you've slipped actual infinities in without me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; realizing it.  I don't think you have.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />OK. And you are right, I could have done this without mentioning the 
<br />
constructive ordinal. But it is worth mentioning it, even at this early 
<br />
stages, because they will reappear again and again.
<br />
Note that all those infinite but constructive ordinal are all countable 
<br />
(in bijection with N), and even constructively so.  Note also, if you 
<br />
haven't already done so, that omega is just N, the set of natural 
<br />
numbers. I will soon give a more set-theoretical motivation for those 
<br />
ordinals.
<br />
<br />Actually there is a cute theorem about constructive ordinal. Indeed 
<br />
they are equivalent to the recursive (programmable) linear 
<br />
well-ordering on the natural numbers. Examples:
<br />
<br />An order of type omega: the usual order on N (0&lt;1&lt;2&lt;3&lt;4&lt;5&lt;6&lt;...)
<br />
<br />An order of type omega+1 : just decide that 0 is bigger than any non 
<br />
null natural numbers:
<br />
<br />1&lt;2&lt;3&lt;4&lt;5&lt;6&lt; .... &lt;0
<br />
<br />It is recursive in the sense that you can write a program FORTRAN (say) 
<br />
capable of deciding it. For example such a program would stop on &quot;yes&quot; 
<br />
when asked if 4&lt;8, and &quot;no&quot; if you ask 0&lt;8, etc.
<br />
<br />An order of type omega+omega: just decide that all odd numbers are 
<br />
bigger than the even ones, and take the usual order in case the two 
<br />
numbers which are compared have the same parity:
<br />
<br />0&lt;2&lt;4&lt;6&lt;8&lt;10&lt; ..... 1&lt;3&lt;5&lt;7&lt;9&lt;...
<br />
<br />An order of type omega+omega+omega: just decide that multiple of 3 are 
<br />
bigger than the multiple of two, themselves bigger than the remaining 
<br />
numbers:
<br />
<br />1&lt;5&lt;7&lt;11&lt;13&lt;14&lt;17&lt;...  0&lt;2&lt;4&lt;6&lt;8&lt;10&lt;... 3&lt;6&lt;9&lt;12&lt;15&lt;...
<br />
<br />Again it should be easy to write a Fortran program capable of deciding 
<br />
that order (that is to decide for any x and y if x &lt; y with that 
<br />
(unusual) order.
<br />
<br />Exercise: could you find an order of type omega*omega? (Hint: use the 
<br />
prime numbers).
<br />
<br />Those omega names are quite standard.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK.  So we haven't left the finite behind yet.  It makes intuitive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense to me that you can diagonalize till the cows come home, staying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; within countability, and still not be done.  Otherwise infinity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wouldn't be infinite.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; On the tricky question, it also makes intuitive sense that you can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sequence effectively on all computable growing functions.  This is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because the larger the growing function gets, the more uncovered space
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (gaps) there are between the computable functions.  Any scheme for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generating growing functions will also leave behind every-growing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; uncomputed gaps.  Very unmathematical of me to be so vague, but you've
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; already given us the answer, and I know you will fill in the gaps.  :)
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I will. Unfortunately this week is full of duty charges. Meanwhile, I 
<br />
would like to ask George and the others if they have a good 
<br />
understanding of the present thread, that is on the fact that growing 
<br />
functions has been well defined, that each sequence of such functions 
<br />
are well defined, and each diagonalisation defines quite well a precise 
<br />
programmable growing function (growing faster than the one in the 
<br />
sequence it comes from).
<br />
Just a tiny effort, and I think we will have all we need to go into the 
<br />
&quot;heart of the matter&quot;, and to understand why comp makes our &quot;universe&quot; 
<br />
a godelized one in the Smullyan sense.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I meant that it makes intuitive sense that you *cannot* sequence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; effectively on all computable growing functions.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />You are right. But would that mean we cannot dovetail on all growing 
<br />
computable functions? I let you ponder this &quot;not so easy&quot; question.
<br />
<br />Bruno
<br />
<br />PS About Parfit, I have already said some time ago in this list that I 
<br />
appreciate very much its &quot;Reasons and Persons&quot; book, but, in the middle 
<br />
of the book he makes the statement that we are &quot;token&quot;, where it 
<br />
follows---[easily? not really: you need the movie graph or some strong 
<br />
form of Occam]--- that comp makes us type, even abstract type. It just 
<br />
happens that from a first person point of view we cannot take ourselves 
<br />
as type because we just cannot distinguish between our many instances 
<br />
generated by the Universal Dovetailer. A similar phenomenon occur 
<br />
already with the quantum. But from the point of view of this thread, 
<br />
this is an anticipation. The things which look the more like token, 
<br />
with the comp hyp, are the numbers. This makes the second half part of 
<br />
Parfit's book rather inconsistent with comp, but, still, his analysis 
<br />
of personal identity remains largely genuine. (I don't like at all his 
<br />
use of the name &quot;reductionism&quot; in that context, also, it's quite 
<br />
misleading).
