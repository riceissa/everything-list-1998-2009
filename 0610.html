equal 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to m, which agrees with common sense.

<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope you now see the error in your above paragraph.  The
<br />
log of the expectation value of the amount in the box is not equal to the
<br />
expectation value of the log of the amount.&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br /><br />MMM.... there is nothing better than an experiment to resolve the issue one 
<br />
way or another. 
<br />
<br />I first thought of making presenting you with a Bayesian experiment selecting 
<br />
m from a set of natural numbers ranging from 0 to M. The problem with this 
<br />
approach is that 2m will always be even while m will have a 50% chance of 
<br />
being even. So it will be easy for the chooser (you) to decide on average 
<br />
which one is the m box and which one is the 2m box. 
<br />
<br />I could force the both boxes to be odd by redesigning the experiment as 
<br />
follows: m is always picked from the set of odd natural numbers in the range 
<br />
from 1 to M ( where M is odd). And the second box is filled with 2m+1 dollars 
<br />
to insure that it is also odd. Now both boxes are odd and you have no way of 
<br />
knowing which box contains more money than the other one. One more thing: m 
<br />
is always in whole dollars.
<br />
<br />Now let me present you with the following four tests, each test using a 
<br />
different range M which is unknown to you.
<br />
<br />Test 1. You open one of two boxes and find one dollar. What do you do? Pick 
<br />
the other box? How much are you expecting to win if you do? (Answer is 
<br />
obvious)
<br />
<br />Test 2. You open one box and find three dollars. What do you do? How much are 
<br />
you expecting to win if you do? 
<br />
<br />Test 3. You open one box and find 87 dollars. What do you do? How much are 
<br />
you expecting to win if you do? 
<br />
<br />Test 4. You open one box and find 782364981238562094058281094092365745841 
<br />
dollars. What do you do? How much are you expecting to win if you do? 
<br />
<br /><br />Responding to Test 1 was easy because you knew that m ranges from 1 to M. The 
<br />
probability of finding 2m+1 in the other box was one. 
<br />
Responding to Test 2 was more difficult, but given the low value (3) found in 
<br />
the box, it may be better to switch. However I do not know how to quantify 
<br />
this.
<br />
Test 3 and 4 have much higher values..., however using the same reasonning, 
<br />
it may be argued that it is better to switch. Again I do not know how  to 
<br />
quantify this.
<br />
<br />So far it appears that you may be right.. It may be preferrable to switch on 
<br />
the basis of information gleaned from the fact that our distribution has a 
<br />
lower limit at 1.
<br />
<br />So let's pick a distribution with no definite lower limit. Let's pick the 
<br />
positive set of real numbers but EXCLUDE zero. Any number above zero will do. 
<br />
There is no explicit &quot;last digit&quot; visible to the chooser (you) since real 
<br />
numbers generally require an infinite number of digits after the decimal 
<br />
point. 
<br />
<br />Now let's repeat the four tests:
<br />
<br />Test 1a: You pick a box and find 0.0000001412349886934509831341231..... What 
<br />
do you do and how much is your expected return?
<br />
<br />Test 2a: You pick a box and find 3.873480139834690210093.... What do you do 
<br />
and how much is your expected return?
<br />
<br />Test 3a: You pick a box and find 87.2230984930987319030379021.... What do you 
<br />
do?
<br />
<br />Test 4a: You pick a box and find 
<br />
782364981238562094058281094092365745841.3459024948240482874559425.....
<br />
What do you do?
<br />
<br />In the last four tests the lack of &quot;reference&quot; such as a boundary lets you 
<br />
float along what I feel  to be a logarithmic scale. There does not appear to 
<br />
be any way to take a &quot;FIX&quot; as they say in the field of navigation. There does 
<br />
not appear to be any rational for switching. Or is there? One may argue that 
<br />
any distribution that my mind is capable of generating is centered around 1 
<br />
and on that basis there may be an extremely small advantage in switching when 
<br />
the number is below one and not switching when the number is above one. I 
<br />
could certainly counter this strategy by willingly biasing myself to generate 
<br />
distributions centered above one. And you knowing what I know will adapt your 
<br />
strategy too. In the limit the end result will be no advantage in switching. 
<br />
Certainly the simple minded expectation value of  0.5(2m + 0.5m) = 1.25m for 
<br />
switching does not make any sense. If you believe that it does make sense, I 
<br />
think I just have found a way to make a quick buck.
<br />
<br />George :-)
