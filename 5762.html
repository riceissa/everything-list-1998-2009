scerir quotes Basil Hiley saying:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Sure there is an interference effect simply because Afshar's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;experiments do not 'follow' anything and they do not 'look at' each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;photon as it  passes through a pinhole. He is simply collecting and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;counting the distribution of photon arrivals at his two detectors.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Then he makes inferences about what could possibly be going on and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;concludes, incorrectly that a photon detected in the 'photon detector
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;for pinhole 1' came from pinhole 1.  However that conclusion is based
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;on the assumption that the rays emanating from pinhole 1 arrive at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the 'photon detector for pinhole 1'. But the ray picture breaks
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;down as soon as you enter the region of overlap of the two beams and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you cannot conclude that the photon entering pinhole 1 arrives at the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;'photon detector for pinhole 1'. You haven't measured which pinhole
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;each photon passed through so you have not contradicted Bohr.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Unfortunately Afshar's conclusion,  &quot;According to my experiment one of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the key assumptions about quantum theory is wrong&quot; is incorrect.  His
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;conclusion is wrong simply because he doesn't understand the physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;optics that lies behind the experiment he is doing.
</em><br />
<br />I think Basil Hiley's analysis here may be incorrect. In the normal 
<br />
double-slit experiment, the interference pattern in probabilities you get 
<br />
from quantum physics when you don't know which slit the photon went through 
<br />
is the same as the interference pattern in light intensities you get from 
<br />
classical optics when you shine a light through two slits. So, if classical 
<br />
optics predicts that light from two pinholes shining on a lens will be 
<br />
focused onto two distinct spots, with no interference between the spots and 
<br />
with all the light from one pinhole focused on one spot, then it seems 
<br />
likely that quantum mechanics would predict the same thing.
<br />
<br />Also notice that in the analysis of Afshar's experiment by W. Unruh at 
<br />
<a href="http://axion.physics.ubc.ca/rebel.html">http://axion.physics.ubc.ca/rebel.html</a> which scerir linked to, Unruh does 
<br />
not dispute Afshar's claim that all the photons from the each pinhole end up 
<br />
in a single detector. In fact, he offers a &quot;simpler version of the 
<br />
experiment&quot; involving a multiple pass interferometer, depicted in figure 2, 
<br />
and says that in this experiment you do know which path a photon took by 
<br />
looking at which detector it hits: &quot;By measuring which detector they 
<br />
triggered, 5 or 6, one measures which of the beams, 1 or 2, the photon 
<br />
traveled along&quot;. Since the experiment in figure 2 is just supposed to be a 
<br />
&quot;simpler version&quot; of Afshar's experiment, it's pretty clear that Unruh would 
<br />
not disagree that the lens insures that knowing which detector absorbed a 
<br />
photon is enough to tell you which path the photon must have taken through 
<br />
the pinholes. Unruh is a fairly big-name physicist and his explanation of 
<br />
what's wrong with Afshar's conclusions about complementarity are pretty 
<br />
detailed, while I don't know anything about Basil Hiley and his criticisms 
<br />
are more vague.
<br />
<br />Anyway, after thinking more about this experiment it's clear to me that even 
<br />
if the lens is enough to insure that all photons from the left pinhole end 
<br />
up in the right detector and vice versa, complementarity should still 
<br />
predict that wires placed at the interference minima will not register any 
<br />
hits. Consider modifying Afshar's experiment by adding extra wires at 
<br />
positions other than the interference minima, and sending the photons 
<br />
through the pinholes one-by-one. In some cases the photon will be registered 
<br />
at one of the wires in front of the lens, in others it will be registered at 
<br />
one of the detectors behind the lens. Now, if you consider *only* the subset 
<br />
of cases where the photon was absorbed by a wire, in these cases the photon 
<br />
never passed through the lens, so you have absolutely no information on 
<br />
which pinhole these photons went through. So if you compare the frequency 
<br />
that the photons hit different wires, complementarity must predict that 
<br />
you'll get an interference pattern--wires closer to the interference maxima 
<br />
will register more hits, wires closer to the interference minima will 
<br />
register fewer hits, and wires placed exactly at the minima will register 
<br />
zero. So why should an advocate of complementarity be surprised that, after 
<br />
removing all the wires *except* those placed exactly at the minima, these 
<br />
wires continue to register zero hits?
<br />
<br />You could also turn this into a &quot;proof-by-contradiction&quot; that 
<br />
complementarity actually demands that wires exactly at the minima will not 
<br />
register any photons. Suppose in Afshar's experiment you sent photons 
<br />
through one-by-one, and found that there was some nonzero number of cases 
<br />
where the photons hit one of the wires at the minima. Since these photons 
<br />
did not make it to the lens, you have no information about which slit they 
<br />
went through, and so complemantarity says that the probability of finding 
<br />
these photons in any given location is determined by an interference 
<br />
pattern. But the interference pattern predicts *zero* probability of finding 
<br />
a photon whose path you don't know at an interference minima, in 
<br />
contradiction with the initial assumption that you saw a nonzero number of 
<br />
cases where the photon was detected at one of the wires at these minima. 
<br />
Thus, the only outcome consistent with complementarity is to have zero cases 
<br />
where the photons hit one of these wires, just as Afshar found.
