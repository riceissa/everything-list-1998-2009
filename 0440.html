A somewhat delayed reply to certain previous posts. I apologize
<br />
if there is some redundancy with subsequent messages by others.

<br />Gilles Henri writes: 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have much more objections in fact to models like Schmidhuber's one:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; again what are these Turing machines, Big programmer and so on made of?
</em><br />
<br />This does not seem essential and is therefore left unspecified.  You can
<br />
try to make one of the stuff you find in your own universe.  Note that
<br />
many of the Great Programmer's universes indeed feature another Great
<br />
Programmer who programs another (possibly different) Big Computer to
<br />
run all possible universes. Obviously there are infinite chains of
<br />
Great Programmers.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Who is &quot;interpreting&quot; a string as a Universe?
</em><br />
<br />This may be a somewhat misleading question. It seems based on the
<br />
assumption that the interpreter is not himself part of a computable
<br />
world representable by bitstrings.  E.g., your internal state changes
<br />
and email messages and worries about &quot;interpretations&quot; are just part of
<br />
the computable evolution of a particular universe.  It does not matter
<br />
that we may produce computable outputs claiming otherwise (&quot;it doesn't
<br />
feel like it&quot;), to be interpreted by other computable interpreters like
<br />
ourselves. None of us needs to be aware of the bitstring representation.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is it true that in this model every &quot;state&quot; is finite, that is  the set of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all possible states of all possible universes is countable? 
</em><br />
<br />Yes, definitely! Just like sqrt(2) is describable by a finite
<br />
algorithm. Most real numbers, however, are not describable at all -
<br />
they convey infinite information.  We cannot even talk about them. No
<br />
room for them in any of the Great Programmer's universes!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Does it mean for example that the possible values of physical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constants are discrete?
</em><br />
<br />Discrete or at least computable. In none of the Great Programmer's
<br />
universes there is Super-Turing computability,  although the concept
<br />
has become fashionable in our particular computable universe, and lots
<br />
of computable people make computable noises about it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The simplest program just enumerates all integer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;numbers. If you can tell me which integer describes the existence of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consciousness or to the existence of anything like an electron or whatever
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you want, I would be very grateful to you!
</em><br />
<br />To comment on this in the spirit above, I took a paragraph from my little
<br />
paper and replaced every occurrence of &quot;life&quot; by &quot;consciousness&quot;:
<br />
<br />What is consciousness? The answer depends on the observer.  For instance,
<br />
certain substrings of E_k may be interpretable as the evolving
<br />
consciousness of a living thing L_k in U_k.  Different observers will
<br />
have different views though. What's consciousness to one observer will
<br />
be noise to another. In particular, if the observer is not like the
<br />
Great Programmer but also inhabits U_k, then its own consciousness may
<br />
be representable by a similar substring.  Assuming that recognition
<br />
implies relating observations to previous knowledge, both  L_k's and
<br />
the observer's consciousness will have to share mutual algorithmic
<br />
information: there will be a comparatively short algorithm computing
<br />
L_k's from the observer's consciousness, and vice versa.
<br />
<br />And Bruno wrote: 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; ...I will be very short. Nevertheless, about Schmidhuber, although there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is some superficial resemblance with my thesis, I realise Schmidhuber has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an inconsistant understanding of the computationnalist hypothesis. More
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on this latter....
</em><br />
<br />Did I miss a follow-up message? I guess I haven't seen any subsequent 
<br />
explanation of Bruno's claim.
<br />
<br />The Great Programmer religion is a religion of simplicity.  One may
<br />
believe in it until (a) there is evidence against it (e.g., someone shows
<br />
that our own universe won't run without all the real numbers), or (b) someone
<br />
comes up with an even simpler explanation of everything. Right now neither 
<br />
option seems very likely to me.   ;^)
