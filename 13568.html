<br />Phew, it's difficult to break into this debate!  Colin, I'm trying to
<br />
support your line of argument here, so do us both a favour and tell me
<br />
what you think is wrong (or isn't it even wrong?)  I'll reiterate in
<br />
the simplest way I can. At root, my take is that our only 'primitive'
<br />
direct contact with 'reality' is what you're calling 'qualia' -
<br />
*everything else* is metaphor.  Consequently, what we must do is
<br />
establish the connection between the reality of 'qualia' (what I'm now
<br />
going to call our 'personal world') and whatever metaphor we choose to
<br />
adopt.
<br />
<br />The example I've been using for the metaphor is particle-force, which
<br />
is just a generalisation of the notion of 'relationship' within a
<br />
differentiated continuum. What we most need to account for in our
<br />
personal worlds is our direct contact with multiple modes of awareness
<br />
and motivation.  We really see, hear, suffer, will, and act.  What I'm
<br />
saying that to make the 'emergence' of such realities semantically
<br />
coherent, they must be inherited from primitive 'relationship' that
<br />
has these characteristics in 'reduced' form - i.e. a mediator that
<br />
unites 'sensing' and 'acting'.  In the conventional 'physical'
<br />
account, the mediator is tacitly assumed to carry only 'acting', and
<br />
hence direct personal-world 'sensing' is - crucially - lost at
<br />
source.  This is because these accounts map to abstracted *models* of
<br />
'external worlds', not to 'personal worlds', and consequently are
<br />
'uninhabited' (i.e. zombies).
<br />
<br />In the particle-force metaphor, 'particle' is a differentiated
<br />
'entity', and 'force' is necessarily both mediator of its 'sensing' of
<br />
other particles, and their 'interaction'.  'Necessarily' because,
<br />
primitively, an entity can't 'interact' with another without 'sensing'
<br />
it (as Kant's monads demonstrate).  This is a key point!  One could
<br />
say then that particles 'grasp' each other.  Now we can map from such
<br />
primitive 'grasp' in two directions.  First: upwards via genuine
<br />
emergence to the multiple modalities of 'grasping' within our personal
<br />
worlds - seeing, hearing, willing acting, suffering.  Such emergence
<br />
is genuine because, although we don't know the *precise* mapping,
<br />
we're not dodging the issue of what 'personal' grasp inherits from -
<br />
it builds on the primitive grasp of the 'particles' (or some
<br />
preferred, but semantically isomorphic, metaphor of primitive
<br />
relationship).  Second: from our personal worlds to 'external worlds'
<br />
beyond, but still in terms of a seamless continuation of the primitive
<br />
'grasped' relationship.  In this way, the 'external world' remains
<br />
inhabited.
<br />
<br />IMHO this semantic model gives you a knock-down argument against
<br />
'computationalism', *unless* one identifies (I'm hoping to hear from
<br />
Bruno on this) the 'primitive' entities and operators with those of
<br />
the number realm - i.e. you make numbers and their relationships the
<br />
'primitive base'.  But crucially, you must still take these entities
<br />
and their relationships to be the *real* basis of personal-world
<br />
'grasp'.  If you continue to adopt a 'somethingist' view, then no
<br />
'program' (i.e. one of the arbitrarily large set that could be imputed
<br />
to any 'something') could coherently be responsible for its personal-
<br />
world grasp (such as it may be).  This is the substance of the UDA
<br />
argument.  All personal-worlds must emerge internally via recursive
<br />
levels of relationship inherited from primitive grasp: in a
<br />
'somethingist' view, such grasp must reside with a primitive
<br />
'something', as we have seen, and in a computationalist view, it must
<br />
reside in the number realm.  But the fundamental insight applies.
<br />
<br />I think you can build all your arguments up from this base.  What do
<br />
you think?

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You can't use an object derived using the contents of

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness(observation) to explain why there are any contents of

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness(observation) at all. It is illogical. (see the wigner quote

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; below). I find the general failure to recognise this brute reality very

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; COLIN
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But then we're not talking about merely being 'highly effective'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in a target problem domain, are we? We are talking about proving

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; COLIN
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; My scientific claim is that the electromagnetic field structure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; literally the third person view of qualia.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Eh? Electromagnetic field of what? The brain? If so, do you think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; chemical potentiation plays no role at all in qualia?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Chemical potentiation IS electric field.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; RUSSEL&gt; Bollocks. A hydrogen molecule and an oxygen atom held 1m apart have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; chemical potential, but there is precious little electric field
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am talking about the membrane and you are talking atoms so I guess we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; missed somehow...anyway....The only 'potentiation' that really matters in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my model is that which looks like an 'action potential' longitudinally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; traversing dendrite/soma/axon membrane as a whole.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Notwithstanding this....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The chemical potentiation at the atomic level is entirely an EM phenomenon
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mediated by QM boundaries (virtual photons in support of the shell
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure, also EM). It is a sustained 'well/energy minimaum' in the EM
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; field structure....You think there is such a 'thing' as potential? There
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is no such thing - there is something we describe as 'EM field'. Nothing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; else. Within that metaphor is yet another even more specious metaphor:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Potential is an (as yet unrealised) propensity of the field at a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particular place to do work on a charge if it were put it there. You can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; place that charge in it and get a number out of an electrophysiological
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probe... and 'realise' the work (modify the fields) itself- but there's no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'thing' that 'is' the potential.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not only that: The fields are HUGE &gt; 10^11 volts/meter. Indeed the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entrapment of protons in the nucleus requires the strong nuclear force to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; overcome truly stupendous repulsive fields. I know beause I am quite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; literally doing tests in molecular dynamics simulations of the E-M field
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at the single charge level. The fields are massive and change at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; staggeringly huge rates, especially at the atomic level. However....Their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; net level in the vicinity of 20Angstroms away falls off dramatically. But
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this is not the vicinity of any 'chemical reaction'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And again I say : there is nothing else there but charge and its fields.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; When you put your hand on a table the reason it doesn't pass through it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even though table and hand are mostly space ...is because electrons
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; literally meet and repulse electrons.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; between them. Furthermore, the chemical potential is independent on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; separation, unlike the electric field.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Nope. There is a &quot;potential well&quot; close in to the relvent atoms, created
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on approach by the near-EM field interactions close in.....The field draws
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the atoms together and the resulting field stablises the result (emitting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; photons or creating other sources of kinetic energy as necessary). In
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; femtochemistry the exquisite detail of the interrelationships of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fields determines the detail as they approach each other. The words
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;chemical potential&quot; is just a metaphor for the potential well in close to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the participants...no wonder it is independent of distance - the well is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in close! . There is no such 'thing' as 'chemical'. There is no such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'thing' as mechanical, including 'quantum mechanical'. There is just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something: ...where some of it bahaves like charge/fields with/without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mass and the rest of it behaves like space.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; RUSSEL&gt; You're obviously suggesting single neurons have qualia. Forgive me for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being a little sceptical of this suggestion...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There are so many good reasons to hold them accountable ..... Read the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recent book by Jon Edwards...In any event - I hold the FIELD accountable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The fact that it happens to be delivered by astrocytes/neuron membranes is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; incidental. If you have to be skeptical about something, please be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; skeptical about the right thing for a good reason!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In a critical argument about hypothesis viability it stacks up. I have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; truckloads of empirical correlates consistent with it. Neurons and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; astrocytes can have their own qualia. They can participate collaboratively
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to construct more complex qualia. It's all self-similar/recursive. And, as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a result...I have a 'necessary primitive' in the electric field. No
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; membrane field =  No qualia.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That the perfect field happens to be implemented in the membrane of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; astrocytes and neurons is not relvant. An inorganically produced field
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with the same spatiotemporal characteristics should be produce the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; effect (virtual bosons).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The fact that it may be difficult (at this stage) to see HOW this may
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deliver qualia is not relevant: especially when the circumstances of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; claim are at an epistemological cul-de-sac that precisely predicts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a-priori that very difficulty....consider Eugene Wigner in &quot;Are we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machines?&quot; in 1960s...P96. Top right. In respect of scientific laws:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;The primitive facts in terms of which the laws are formulated are not the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; positions of atoms, but the results of observations. It seems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inconsistent, therefore, to explain the state of mind of the observer, his
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; apperception of the result of an observation, in terms of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concepts, such as positions of atoms, which have to be explained,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then, in terms of the content of consciousness&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Wigner is too reserved...Instead of &quot;It seems inconsistent...&quot; I would say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;It's at best completely meaningless and at worst a grave mistake....&quot;.
