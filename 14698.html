I'm going to go out on a limb here for a second.
<br />
<br />IF, and that's a big if, the algebraic physics theory is correct (whatever
<br />
that means in this context), time in my discussion of transition dimensions,
<br />
which is something I wrote in my notebook about dimensions that doesn't need
<br />
to correlate to &quot;your&quot; perceived reality or paradigm within a co-created
<br />
reality, are far too abstract to simply say something about cause and
<br />
effect, prior and subsequent, nor does it account for time in the
<br />
Einsteinian sense at all.
<br />
<br />Despite the physical correlational significance of &quot;algebraic physics,&quot; I
<br />
believe, like perhaps Cantor did when he was rhetorically assaulted by
<br />
people like Dedekind who, in my understanding, rejected his ideas about the
<br />
infinite in general which are, today, widely accepted (but not
<br />
universally).  Cantor's response, again from my understanding, was that to
<br />
&quot;defend&quot; his work he did these things:
<br />
1. stop seeking -validation- from the &quot;powers that be&quot; of the time, the
<br />
reigning paradigm champions like Bohr and Everett were later.
<br />
2. state something to the effect: -if- the theory, such as infinite ordinals
<br />
or algebraic physics, is -internally- consistent, that makes it a valid
<br />
mathematical theory.
<br />
<br />I do not make statements in my theory that suggest there is an answer to any
<br />
physics question in my paper (the current version is 00-02-00), --except--
<br />
that I conjecture something to that effect, after removing the conjecture
<br />
about the CRH which, evidently, was a valid conjecture to settle as Bruno is
<br />
attempting to demonstrate, quite well I might add, in my humble opinion,
<br />
that it need not be a conjecture.  So the few other conjectures remain and I
<br />
do think that in settling them, a deeper understanding of at least what I'm
<br />
discussing in my algebraic physics paper will be obtained, if not about the
<br />
universe at large.
<br />
<br />The universe in my paper is meant to be the actual universe in conjectures 4
<br />
and 5 on page 3 of the 4 page document (if memory serves).  This is resting
<br />
severely, if you will, upon the MUH which is not falsifiable in a scientific
<br />
sense, is it?  Is the MUH a science hypothesis or a mathematical one?  I
<br />
think the MUH is a -philosophical- hypothesis, actually.
<br />
<br />To continue with my point, time, or the transition dimensions, are
<br />
compatible slightly with Einstein's view of time but, for the most part, in
<br />
my paradigm (and I honestly don't wish to trap anyone in my paradigm as this
<br />
paper is supposed to be free-ing and not meant to elicit conviction that it
<br />
is correct even by me, except conjectures are meant to be settled and I
<br />
can't say whether I believe they are true or false I just want to say
<br />
'maybe' which is the worst possible answer to a yes/no question in terms of
<br />
the frustration in the lack of understanding there), time is too abstract to
<br />
just say there is a continuous flow of consciousness to and from an
<br />
abstract, unfleshed world, such as mathematics or Platonic Form Worlds (I
<br />
call parallels wurldes, actually), and a concrete wurlde such as ours.
<br />
<br />However, I do suspect and perceive there to be a connection, a deep one,
<br />
between the abstract and concrete.  The multiverse in Physics would seem to
<br />
be a concrete wurlde (level 1 to 3 multiverse to use Tegmark's paradigm)
<br />
while my algebraic physics is meant to be discussion about the level 4
<br />
wurldes.  I am attempting to go through what is &quot;up&quot; with level 4
<br />
multiverses by first ascertaining what exactly the universe is.  If I am
<br />
barking anywhere near the right tree, I feel this &quot;discovery&quot; -is- (or would
<br />
be, to use time as a crutch for discussion as, in some sense, all events
<br />
occur simultaneously, will occur, and have occurred as though all on one
<br />
point in the &quot;flatland&quot; sense) about as rudimentary to humanity in one
<br />
millennium as negative numbers are to -us- now.
<br />
<br />Especially if algebraic physics is just balderdash.  I'm guessing no one
<br />
would wager with me in that I bet many rank-and-file physicists will loathe
<br />
my theory because, for one thing, if the true answer to their questions on
<br />
TOE's are not to be found in science, then they would never have found out
<br />
what &quot;the universe&quot; is (see page 3 of my 00-02-00 &quot;algebraic physics&quot;
<br />
article) with a telescope, atom smasher, or their eyes.  No equipment beyond
<br />
imagination could, imho, have found this and that might be why it is
<br />
incorrect, if it is.
<br />
<br />If not loathe, then be exceptionally reluctant to study.
<br />
<br />Any takers on this wager?
<br />
<br />;)
<br />
<br />Cheers
<br />
Brian
