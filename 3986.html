<br />
I was re-reading Rudy Rucker's 1982 book Infinity and the Mind last week.
<br />
This is a popular introduction to various notions of infinity.  Rucker
<br />
includes some speculations about the possibility that the multiverse
<br />
could be identified with the class of all possible sets, similar to the
<br />
idea that Tegmark later developed in greater detail.
<br />
<br />First I'll say a little something about infinite numbers.  Many people
<br />
are familiar with the transfinite cardinals: aleph-zero (or aleph-null),
<br />
the cardinality of the integers; aleph-one, aleph-two, and so on; C,
<br />
the cardinality of the continuum, which may or may not be one of the
<br />
earlier alephs.  However there is a whole other system of transfinites,
<br />
the ordinals.
<br />
<br />The transfinite ordinals are generalizations of counting numbers.
<br />
The first infinite ordinal is omega, which I will write here as w, which
<br />
the greek lower-case omega resembles.  We can create a number series like:
<br />
<br />0,1,2,3,... w,w+1,w+2,... w*2,w*2+1,... w*3,... w*4, ..., w^2, ... w^3, ...,
<br />
w^w, ..., w^w^w, ...
<br />
<br />The idea here is that w has no predecessor, but it has a successor, w+1.
<br />
And that has a successor, w+2.  We can keep on with this process until
<br />
we get to the next number which has no predecessor, w+w, written as w*2.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From here we get to w*3, w*4 and so on, and we can then generalize this
</em><br />
pattern to get to w*w which we write as w^2.
<br />
<br />There is no end to this type of pattern; we can go on finding new infinite
<br />
ordinals indefinitely.  However all of the ordinals generated via this
<br />
scheme share the property of being countable.  That is, they can all be
<br />
put into one-to-one correspondence with w.
<br />
<br />This leads to the definition of cardinal numbers; a cardinal number is
<br />
the smallest one of a set of ordinals which can be put into one-to-one
<br />
correspondence with each other.  This distinction is irrelevant for
<br />
finite numbers, but for transfinites, all of the numbers beyond w in
<br />
the list above can be put into one-to-one correspondence, and all have
<br />
the same cardinality, which is written aleph-zero and is equal to w.
<br />
<br />The first non-countable transfinite is aleph-one.  You would have to
<br />
put aleph-one w's together to reach aleph-one; you can't get there
<br />
by any countable process involving w.  Beyond aleph-one is of course
<br />
aleph-two, and so on, and we can now use our ordinals very usefully to
<br />
list the alephs:
<br />
<br />aleph-0, aleph-1, aleph-2, ..., aleph-w, aleph-(w+1), ..., aleph-(w*2), ...
<br />
aleph-(w^w), ... aleph-(aleph-one), ...
<br />
<br />Theta is the smallest transfinite for which theta = aleph-theta, which can
<br />
also be considered aleph-aleph-aleph-... going on forever.  And this is
<br />
far from the end.  Rucker describes vastly, vastly larger transfinites.
<br />
<br />So, what is the relevance of this for all-universe models?  Rucker
<br />
describes how numbers, in modern mathematics, can be considered to be
<br />
special kinds of sets; specifically sets of sets in certain combinations.
<br />
Similarly, all mathematical objects can be built ultimately on set theory.
<br />
And this raises the possibility that physical objects are sets as well.
<br />
Rucker writes on page 200:
<br />
<br />&quot;And consider this: If reality is physics, if physics is mathematics,
<br />
and if mathematics is set theory, then everything is a set.  I am a set,
<br />
my thoughts are sets, my emotions are sets.... If everything is a set,
<br />
then only pure form exists, which is nice.  The whole physical universe
<br />
could be a single large set U.&quot;
<br />
<br />Rucker then speculates on where this U would be in the framework of
<br />
ordinals and other mathematical objects.  He shows a diagram in the
<br />
shape of a V, with the empty set at the bottom, at the point of the V.
<br />
Going straight up above it is a vertical line where the ordinals are
<br />
found.  To the side of the line are other mathematical objects that have
<br />
similar complexity.
<br />
<br />This diagram in principle holds all sets, meaning that it holds all
<br />
mathematical objects.  It is well known in set theory that &quot;the set of
<br />
all sets&quot; is a contradictory concept, so instead the V as a whole is
<br />
called &quot;the class of all sets&quot; and Rucker uses V to denote this concept.
<br />
He then asks how U, the set which is the universe, compares with V.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From page 201-202:
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Say that U is the set coding up our physical universe.  How far up would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one expect to find U?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ...How much information is in the universe?  If the universe is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; completely finite, then U is a set somewhere in V_w, perhaps in V_googol.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And even if it is infinite, we wouldn't expect it to be so very far out -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; surely U must lie in V_(w+w).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It seems strange to have our physical universe being just a little set
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; U floating around in the big universe V of all possible sets.  Under
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this viewpoint, all the possible universes would be sets in V.  Is it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; really reasonable to have an idea like V be so much bigger than the real
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is always the possibility... that the collection U coding up the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical universe is very much larger than we had expected.  If there were
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; many parallel universes to be included, if matter were transfinitely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; divisible, if time were transfinitely long - in any of these cases, it might
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; actually be possible to have U too big to be a set, too big to fit inside
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; V....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course, our daily experience flies in the face of any suggestion that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; U is so very big.  But there is a traditional philosophical principle,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Principle of Plenitude, which suggests that the physical universe should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be as rich as the set theoretic universe of pure Platonic forms.  Insofar
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as any physical structure can be coded up as a set, we already expect V
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to be as large or larger than U.  The Principle of Plenitude insists that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; U must be as large or larger than V as well, leading to the conclusion
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that U and V are equally large.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A more extreme statement of this would be to insist that U and V are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; identical, but this is really pretty hard to swallow.  An argument in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this direction might be begun by remarking that we should understand U to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; include all the alternate universes as well as our own perceived universe.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And one could then point out that a possibly existing alternate univese
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is really an abstract form no different than a set.
</em><br />
<br />So here Rucker is advancing the notion that U, the universe, is identical
<br />
to the class of all sets, which is itself the same as the class of all
<br />
mathematical structures.  This is the same idea which Tegmark championed,
<br />
where he brought in the anthropic principle to explain why the visible
<br />
universe has the lawful and orderly structure that we observe.
<br />
<br />I had some very enlightening discussions with Wei Dai at the Crypto
<br />
conference last week, and he mentioned that this view of the multiverse,
<br />
which we associate with Tegmark, implies a very much larger multiverse
<br />
than the computational view advanced by Schmidhuber, at least if we
<br />
restrict the notion of computation to Turing machines and simple
<br />
extensions.  Most of the objects treated by modern set theorists
<br />
are vastly larger than even the transfinite theta I mentioned above,
<br />
putting them far outside the reach of a Turing machine.  A computer is
<br />
fundamentally a sequential object with a finite, or at most countably
<br />
infinite, complexity, and these infinite objects are far more complex.
<br />
<br />When we do mathematics, we are no more than a Turing machine, but we
<br />
should not confuse our limited understanding of these mathematical objects
<br />
with the objects themselves.  Godel teaches us that axiomatic reasoning
<br />
is a very limited tool for approaching mathematical truth, but it is
<br />
unfortunately the only tool we have (modulo claims of extra-algorithmic
<br />
&quot;mathematical intuition&quot;).  A multiverse built on computational engines
<br />
would be far more limited than one which includes all the endless richness
<br />
of mathematical set theory.
