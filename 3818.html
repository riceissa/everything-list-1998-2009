Hi Stephen,
<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the concreteness of &quot;what it is like to be 'me' experiencing 'me'&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     One possibility that I have considered is that these two 'me's are not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;one and the same, they are more like an object and its abstract
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;representation.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes, but once you postulate comp you are willing to identify yourself
<br />
with a ... somehow abstract representation, or certainly with something
<br />
immaterial. For exemple, in a well developed comp civilisation, you could
<br />
choose each morning the body which you feel more suitable for the day.
<br />
And each evening you will do some backup of yourself, i.e. of your immaterial
<br />
relative abstract/concrete (it's a number) representation.
<br />
Now you will argue that you still need a concrete universe with physical
<br />
resource for making manifest your incarnation during the day.
<br />
But here I refer you to the uda reasoning which shows that if you can survive
<br />
such a backup then you loose all possible criteria for distinguishing if,
<br />
from one instant to some next one, you are still manifested by some
<br />
&quot;physical&quot; universe, or if you are manifest by some purely arithmetical
<br />
version of the
<br />
running of a program which approximates (perhaps perfectly, perhaps not) some
<br />
portion of that &quot;universe&quot;, so that, with or without a physical universe, your
<br />
expectation must be given by a measure on all computations (living 
<br />
immaterialy in
<br />
numberland), which are going through your actual state.
<br />
The slogan is that there is no need to run the UD. There is no need to imagine
<br />
we are living through the working of a screen saver of a computer in some other
<br />
universe (like Tim said), because the &quot;apparantly singular universe&quot; emerge
<br />
from all possible running which exists atemporaly in the &quot;block arithmetical
<br />
truth&quot;. That's useful because that suppress the need for an infinite regress.
<br />
I don't know for sure if comp is true, and so you may be right 
<br />
invoking &quot;natural
<br />
resource&quot;, but at this stage you would just be stepping outside my working
<br />
hypothesis ;)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Bruno, I still don't understand how your theory dispenses with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;necessity of physical resources.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Honestly the necessity of apparent resource is what we must explain (if comp).
<br />
Now, either you mean some materialist concrete and singular decomposable
<br />
aristotelian stuff, and *I* ask you what do you mean by that. Or you accept
<br />
the idea that physical resources (including its necessity-like feature)
<br />
emerge from some inside view (first person plural) for collection of
<br />
machines (necessarily sparsely distributed in the deployement of the UD),
<br />
in which case it is clear that I don't dispense with those resources at all.
<br />
I just don't believe they are fundamental or primary. The primeness op 17 is
<br />
more primary (I think, or, by definition with comp).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Another way of posing my question is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;perhaps: How can a Platonic Comp perform a computation without some analogue
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of persistence of memory or duration.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I have an explanation of persistence of memory with the Z1 logics, and it
<br />
can be related with JL Bell quantum logic. But that looks like an authoritative
<br />
answer isn'it? Roughly speaking you can bet we are embedded in a
<br />
deep (= +/- necessarily long computation, cf Bennett) computation 
<br />
which dovetails
<br />
on some big (like the continuum) sets (the reals, the complex numbers
<br />
perhaps, perhaps the quaternions, why not the octonions ...), so that our type
<br />
of story is terribly rare, but our singular computations (with that similar
<br />
type) is terribly multiplied. (A little like our genome btw: your precise
<br />
DNA is unique on earth, but similar DNA code is numerous and kept to be
<br />
multiplied; It is also not unlike quantum states. (And this is related
<br />
with the very interesting notion of quantum depth, by David Deutsch)).
<br />
Now Platonic Comp don't *perform* any computation. All computations
<br />
are there, and notion like &quot;performance&quot; emerge, from our multiplied point of
<br />
views of finite being necessarily ignorant (but yet betting) on
<br />
(never completable) realities in which we are embedded.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     I can't seem to get the idea out of my head that information can not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;just refer to information itself but merely can encode the &quot;address&quot; of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;where and when it can be found - this is how I think Goedelization works.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I don't think there is an absolute &quot;where&quot; and &quot;when&quot; in arithmetic, but
<br />
the analogy between godelisation and programmation helps to figure out what
<br />
you intend to say I think. Information does not need to refer to 
<br />
itself, though.
<br />
Only UTMs will makes reference relatively to emerging patterns, which are
<br />
emerging and stable relatively to their (the UTM) most probable computational
<br />
continuations.
<br />
<br />Best Regards,
<br />
<br />Bruno
