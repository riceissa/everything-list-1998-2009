<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the number of copies of yourself in the multiverse. Pushing the button

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;does. There is a symmetry between the two versions of yourself in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;coin tossing scenario. Clearly there is no reason for one to be preferred
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to the other, then it is reasonable to believe there is a 50% probability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;for you to experience each. But there is an asymmetry between you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and your copies, and there is some reason to believe that your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consciousness cannot experience to be the copies, namely, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;argument that you should not experience anything strange if someone
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;scans your body without your knowledge.
</em><br />
<br />The argument that the two copies are symmetrical in the MWI and there is no 
<br />
reason to choose one over the other is exactly my point about duplication in 
<br />
one world. For technical reasons, it generally *would* be possible to 
<br />
distinguish a copy from the original if we were using, for example, 
<br />
non-destructive teleportation, but surely this is just a detail. You have 
<br />
aknowledged that all the atoms in your body change over time, replaced by 
<br />
atoms from the environment, and you are still the original &quot;you&quot;. This is a 
<br />
gradual process, although the turnover in the brain is surprisingly fast 
<br />
(thanks to Jesse Mazer for that reference). Presumably, you would not be 
<br />
worried if the replacement happened all at once rather than gradually. 
<br />
Suppose you are standing still, and to your right is a supply of all the 
<br />
elements that are found in a human body. When you press a button, each atom 
<br />
in your body will move one metre to the left, while at the same time, an 
<br />
appropriate atom from the supply to your right will move into the position 
<br />
vacated by the atom that has just moved. The result is that there are now 
<br />
two copies of you, one metre apart. One copy is in the position you were in 
<br />
originally, but is comprised of different atoms. That shouldn't worry you, 
<br />
because this happens all the time anyway, so this copy could claim to be the 
<br />
original. On the other hand, the copy one metre to the left of where you 
<br />
were originally is no different to what would have occurred if you had just 
<br />
stepped one metre to the left, so this copy could claim to be the original. 
<br />
It seems both have a very good claim to being the original!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;p.s.: By the way, this remark in the last message also applies to choice C:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;About choice B (and C), it raises other interesting questions: suppose you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;know that the copies are going to undergo some sort of plastic surgery a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;week
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;or so after the experiment, and will look very different from yourself now. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;They
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;could also undergo some type of slow personality modification (as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;education),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;such that they would at any moment agree that they are experiencing a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;continuity of identity. Would you still choose B? What if this change
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;really isn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;slow, but sudden, at the time of creation of the copy? Does it make a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;difference? Then what is the difference between doing a copy of yourself or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a copy of someone else, since any two people could be connected by a series
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of continuous transformations? Would you still be comforted by the fact 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;someone, even if very different from you, would be created to replace you?
</em><br />
<br />This question applies without copying as well: if you had plastic surgery, 
<br />
then gradual personality change, gradual or sudden memory loss, would you 
<br />
still be &quot;you&quot; or would you be someone else? It illustrates the fact that 
<br />
there is no obvious or &quot;correct&quot; answer when it comes to questions of 
<br />
continuity of identity. In the final analysis, the answer has to be 
<br />
arbitrary.
