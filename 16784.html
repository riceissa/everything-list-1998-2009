Hi Marty,
<br />
<br />On 05 Jun 2009, at 00:30, m.a. wrote:

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;            I don't have dyslexia
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Good news.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; but my keyboard doesn't contain either the UNION symbol or the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; INTERSECTION symbol
</em><br />
<br /><br />Nor do mine!
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; (unless I want to go into an INSERT pull down menu every time I use  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; those symbols).
</em><br />
<br /><br />Like I have to do too.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't need you to switch to English symbols, but I would like to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; see the English equivalents of the symbols you use (so that I can  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; use them).
</em><br />
<br /><br />I gave them.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would also like a reference table defining each term in both your  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; symbols and their English equivalents which I could look back to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; when I get confused.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I suggest you do this by yourself. It is a good exercise and it will  
<br />
help you not only in the understanding, but in the memorizing. Then  
<br />
you submit it to the list, and I can verify the understanding.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Please include examples.
</em><br />
<br />Up to now, I did it for any notions introduced. Just ask me one or two  
<br />
or (name your number) examples more in case you have a doubt. If I  
<br />
send too much posts, and if there are too long, people will dismiss  
<br />
them. try to ask explicit question, like you did, actually.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I tend to be somewhat careless when dealing  with very fine  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distinctions
</em><br />
<br /><br />This means that a lot of work is awaiting for you. It is normal.  
<br />
Everyone can understand what I explain, but some have more work to do.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and may type the wrong symbol while intending to type the correct one.
</em><br />
<br /><br />That is unimportant. I am used to do typo errors too. One of my  
<br />
favorite book on self-reference (the one by Smorynski) contains an  
<br />
average of two or three typo error per page. Of course, once a typo  
<br />
error is found, it is better to correct it.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Also, I must admit that the lessons are going too fast for me and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are moving ahead before I've mastered the previous material.
</em><br />
<br /><br />We have all the time, and up to now I did not proceed without having  
<br />
the answer of all exercises. You make no faults in the first set of  
<br />
seven exercise, and that is why I have quickly proceed to the second  
<br />
round. For that one, you make just one error, + the dismiss of a  
<br />
paragraph on &quot;UNION&quot;.  To slow me down it is enough to tell me things  
<br />
like &quot;I don't understand what you mean by this or that&quot; and you quote  
<br />
the unclear passage. If you can't do an exercise, just wait for some  
<br />
other (Kim?) to propose a solution. Or try to guess one and submit, or  
<br />
just ask. I will not proceed to new matters before I am sure you grasp  
<br />
all what has been already presented.
<br />
What is possible is that you understand, but fail ti memorize. This  
<br />
will lead to problems later. So you have to make your own summary and  
<br />
be sure you can easily revise the definition.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If I'm requesting too much simplification, please let me know  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because I'm quite well adjusted to my math disabilities and won't  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; take offence at all. Thanks,      marty a.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I think that there is no problem at all. I am just waiting for  
<br />
explicit question from the second round. You can ask any question, and  
<br />
slow me down as much as you want so that we proceed at your own rhythm.
<br />
Don't ask me to slow down in any abstract way. You are the one who  
<br />
have to slow me down by pointing on what you don't understand in a post.
<br />
take it easy, and take all your time. Don't try to understand the more  
<br />
advanced replies I give to people who have a bigger baggage.
<br />
<br />You did show me that you have understood the notion of set, and the  
<br />
notion of intersection of sets. Have you a problem with the notion of  
<br />
union of sets? If that is the case, just quote the passage of my post  
<br />
that you don't understand, or the example that I gave, and I will  
<br />
explain. Try to keep those post in some well ranged place so as to re- 
<br />
access them easily.
<br />
<br />I ask this to Kim too, and any one interested: just let me know what  
<br />
you don't understand, so that I can explain, give other examples, etc.
<br />
<br />Take it easy, you seem quite good, you suffer just of a problem of  
<br />
familiarity with notations. You read the post too quickly, I suspect  
<br />
also.
<br />
<br />Are you OK? I can understand you could be afraid of the amount of  
<br />
work, but given that we have all the time, there is no exams, nor  
<br />
deadline, I am not sure there is any problem. Of course, things of  
<br />
life (like holidays, taxes, etc.) can slow us down too, but this is  
<br />
not a real problem. Of course you can realize you don't want really to  
<br />
learn all this: in that case you tell me, and we can stop, or make a  
<br />
pause, etc.
<br />
<br />I choose the path (given that the goal is given: explaining the real  
<br />
stuff in the UDA-step seven), and you can accelerate me, slow me down,  
<br />
halt, etc. as you wish. OK?
<br />
<br /><br />Just tell me if you have a problem with the two statements quoted  
<br />
below. I think we could make post with fewer examples, and fewer  
<br />
exercises, perhaps. Don't be ashamed by any question you want to ask.  
<br />
There is no shame in questioning anything.
<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Examples

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; {1, 2, 3} ∩  {3, 4, 5} = {3}
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; {1, 2, 3} ∪  {3, 4, 5} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
