<br />I happen to have the e-text/online versions of some of Egan's novels, 
<br />
including &quot;Distress.&quot; I'll include below an excerpt describing the 
<br />
fictional ATM (which I found inspirational enough to trigger my recent 
<br />
interests!). This is not the only description of ATMs and MWI issues in 
<br />
&quot;Distress,&quot; but it's one of the most succinct.
<br />
<br />By the way, the book is copyrighted &quot;1995,&quot; so I repeat my claim that in 
<br />
many ways Egan preceeded Tegmark, at least in terms of copyright. 
<br />
(Likewise, I am disappointed to see Marcus Chown and other writers 
<br />
giving Tegmark credit for the &quot;stand in front of a machine gun and if 
<br />
you survive then MWI is real&quot; gedankenexperiment. Hans Moravec wrote at 
<br />
length about how to win in a gambling casino by committing suicide if 
<br />
one loses in any universe. I, myself, described a way to factor large 
<br />
numbers by &quot;guessing&quot; the factors and then detonating the world's 
<br />
nuclear arsenal if the guesses don't multiply together to the right 
<br />
number. Moravec wrote in the late 80s on this and my own RSA spoof was 
<br />
circa 1993.)
<br />
<br />Anyway, here is a &quot;fair use&quot; excerpt from &quot;Distress.&quot; I recommend people 
<br />
find the book. In this excerpt, the main character, a science 
<br />
journalist, is flying to an artificial island in the South Pacific where 
<br />
a conference on Theories of Everything is about to occur. He is planning 
<br />
to interview a mathematical physicist and cosmologist who has developed 
<br />
an &quot;all topology model&quot; of the multiverse. The time is around 2050.
<br />
<br />--begin excerpt from Greg Egan's &quot;Distress,&quot; copyright 1995--
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I forced my attention back to the subject of All-Topology Models.
<br />
<br />The concept of ATMs was simple enough to state: the universe was 
<br />
considered to possess, at the deepest level, a mixture of every single 
<br />
mathematically possible topology.
<br />
<br />Even in the oldest quantum theories of gravity, the &quot;vacuum&quot; of empty 
<br />
space-time had been viewed as a seething mass of virtual worm-holes, and 
<br />
other more exotic topological distortions, popping in and out of 
<br />
existence. The smooth appearance at macroscopic lengths and human 
<br />
timescales was just the visible average of a hidden riot of complexity. 
<br />
In a way, it was like ordinary matter: a sheet of flexible plastic 
<br />
betrayed nothing to the naked eye of its microstructureómolecules, 
<br />
atoms, electrons, and quarks but knowledge of those constituents allowed 
<br />
the bulk substance's physical properties to be computed: its modulus of 
<br />
elasticity, for example. Space-time wasn't made of atoms, but its 
<br />
properties could be understood by viewing it as being &quot;built&quot; from a 
<br />
hierarchy of ever more convoluted deviations from its apparent state of 
<br />
continuity and mild curvature. Quantum gravity had explained why 
<br />
observable space-time, underpinned by an infinite number of invisible 
<br />
knots and detours, behaved as it did in the presence of mass (or 
<br />
energy): curving in exactly the fashion required to produce the 
<br />
gravitational force.
<br />
<br />ATM theorists were striving to generalize this result: to explain the 
<br />
(relatively) smooth ten-dimensional &quot;total space&quot; of the Standard 
<br />
Unified Field Theory whose properties accounted for all four forces: 
<br />
strong, weak, gravitational, and electromagnetic as the net result of an 
<br />
infinite number of elaborate geometrical structures.
<br />
<br />82
<br />
<br />Nine spatial dimensions (six rolled up tight), and one time, was only 
<br />
what total space appeared to be if it wasn't examined too closely. 
<br />
Whenever two subatomic particles interacted, there was always a chance 
<br />
that the total space they occupied would behave, instead, like part of a 
<br />
twelve-dimensional hypersphere, or a thirteen-dimensional doughnut, or a 
<br />
fourteen-dimensional figure eight, or just about anything else. In fact 
<br />
just as a single photon could travel along two different paths at once 
<br />
any number of these possibilities could take effect simultaneously, and 
<br />
&quot;interfere with each other&quot; to produce the final outcome. Nine space, 
<br />
one time, was nothing but an average.
<br />
<br />There were two main questions still in dispute among ATM theorists:
<br />
<br />What, exactly, was meant by &quot;all&quot; topologies? Just how bizarre could the 
<br />
possibilities contributing to the average total space become? Did they 
<br />
have to be, merely, those which could be formed with a twisted, knotted 
<br />
sheet of higher-dimensional plastic or could they include states more 
<br />
like a (possibly infinite) handful of scattered grains of sand where 
<br />
notions like &quot;number of dimensions&quot; and &quot;space-time curvature&quot; ceased to 
<br />
exist altogether?
<br />
<br />And: how, exactly, should the average effect of all these different 
<br />
structures be computed? How should the sum over the infinite number of 
<br />
possibilities be written down and added up when the time came to test 
<br />
the theory: to make a prediction, and calculate some tangible, physical 
<br />
quantity which an experiment could actually measure?
<br />
<br />On one level, the obvious response to both questions was: &quot;Use whatever 
<br />
gives the right answers&quot; but choices which did that were hard to 
<br />
find . . . and some of them smacked of contrivance. Infinite sums were 
<br />
notorious for being either intractable, or too pliable by far. I jotted 
<br />
down an example remote from the actual tensor equations of ATMs, but 
<br />
good enough to illustrate the point:
<br />
<br />Let S=l-l+l-l+l-l+l-...
<br />
Then S= (1-1)+(1-1)+(1-1)+...
<br />
=0+0+0. ..
<br />
=0
<br />
But S=l +(-1+1)+(-1+1)+(-1+1)...
<br />
=1+0+0+0...
<br />
= 1
<br />
<br />83
<br />
<br />It was a mathematically naive &quot;paradox&quot;; the correct answer was, simply, 
<br />
that this particular infinite sequence didn't add up to any definite sum 
<br />
at all. Mathematicians would always be perfectly happy with such a 
<br />
verdict, and would know all the rules for avoiding the pitfalls and 
<br />
software could assess even the most difficult cases. When a physicist's 
<br />
hard-won theory starred generating similarly ambiguous equations, 
<br />
though, and the choice came down to strict mathematical rigor and a 
<br />
theory with no predictive power at all ... or, a bit of pragmatic 
<br />
side-stepping of the rules, and a theory which churned out beautiful 
<br />
results in perfect agreement with every experiment ... it was no 
<br />
surprise that people were tempted. After all, most of what Newton had 
<br />
done to calculate planetary orbits had left contemporary mathematicians 
<br />
apoplectic with rage.
<br />
<br />Violet Mosala's approach was controversial for a very different reason. 
<br />
She'd been awarded the Nobel prize for rigorously proving a dozen key 
<br />
theorems in general topology theorems which had rapidly come to comprise 
<br />
a standard mathematical toolbox for ATM physicists, obliterating 
<br />
stumbling blocks and resolving ambiguities. She'd done more than anyone 
<br />
else to provide the field with solid foundations, and the means of 
<br />
making careful, measured progress. Even her fiercest critics agreed that 
<br />
her mathematics was meticulous, beyond reproach.
<br />
<br />The trouble was, she told her equations too much about the world.
<br />
<br />The ultimate test of a TOE was to answer questions like: &quot;What is the 
<br />
probability of a ten-gigaelectronvolt neutrino fired at a stationary 
<br />
proton scattering off a down quark and emerging at a certain angle?&quot; ... 
<br />
or even just: &quot;What is the mass of an electron?&quot; Essentially, Mosala 
<br />
prefixed all such questions with the condition: &quot;Given that we know that 
<br />
space-time is roughly four-dimensional, and total space is roughly 
<br />
ten-dimensional, and the apparatus used to perform the experiment 
<br />
consists, approximately, of the following...&quot;
<br />
<br />Her supporters said she was merely setting everything in context. No 
<br />
experiment happened in isolation; quantum mechanics had been hammering 
<br />
that point home for the last hundred and twenty years. Asking a Theory 
<br />
of Everything to predict the chance of observing some microscopic event 
<br />
without adding the proviso that &quot;there is a universe, and it contains, 
<br />
among other things, equipment for detecting the event in question&quot; would 
<br />
be as nonsensical as asking: &quot;If you pick a marble out of a bag, what 
<br />
are the odds that it will be green?&quot;
<br />
<br />Her critics said she used circular reasoning, assuming from the very
<br />
<br />84
<br />
<br />beginning all the results she was trying to prove. The details she fed 
<br />
into her computations included 50 much about the known physics of the 
<br />
experimental apparatus that indirectly, but inevitably they gave the 
<br />
whole game away.
<br />
<br />I was hardly qualified to come down on either side . . . but it seemed 
<br />
to me that Mosala's opponents were being hypocritical, because they were 
<br />
pulling the same trick under a different guise: the alternatives they 
<br />
offered all invoked a cosmological fix. They declared that &quot;before&quot; the 
<br />
Big Bang and the creation of time (or &quot;adjoining&quot; the event, to avoid 
<br />
the oxymoron), there had been nothing but a perfectly symmetrical 
<br />
&quot;pre-space,&quot; in which all topologies carried equal weight. . . and the 
<br />
&quot;average result&quot; of most familiar physical quantities would have been 
<br />
infinite. Pre-space was sometimes called &quot;infinitely hot&quot;; it could be 
<br />
thought of as the kind of perfectly balanced chaos which space-time 
<br />
would become if so much energy was poured into it that literally 
<br />
everything became equally possible. Everything and its opposite; the net 
<br />
result was that nothing happened at all.
<br />
<br />But some local fluctuation had disturbed the balance in such a way as to 
<br />
give rise to the Big Bang. From that tiny accident, our universe had 
<br />
burst into existence. Once that had happened, the original &quot;infinitely 
<br />
hot,&quot; infinitely even-handed mixture of topologies had been forced to 
<br />
become ever more biased, because &quot;temperature&quot; and &quot;energy&quot; now had a 
<br />
meaning and in an expanding, cooling universe, most of the &quot;hot&quot; old 
<br />
symmetries would have been as unstable as molten metal thrown into a 
<br />
lake. And when they'd cooled, the shapes into which they'd frozen had 
<br />
just happened to favor topologies close to a certain ten-dimensional 
<br />
total space one which gave rise to particles like quarks and electrons, 
<br />
and forces like gravity and electromagnetism.
<br />
By this logic, the only correct way to sum over all the topologies was 
<br />
to incorporate the fact that our universe had by chance emerged from 
<br />
pre-space in a certain way. Details of the broken symmetry had to be fed 
<br />
into the equations &quot;by hand&quot; because there was no reason why they 
<br />
couldn't have been utterly different. And if the physics resulting from 
<br />
this accident seemed improbably conducive to the formation of stars, 
<br />
planets, and life . . . then this universe was just one of a vast number 
<br />
which had frozen out of pre-space, each with a different set of 
<br />
particles and forces. If every possible set had been tried, it was 
<br />
hardly surprising that at least one of them had turned out to be 
<br />
favorable to life.
<br />
<br />85
<br />
<br />It was the old anthropic principle, the fudge which had saved a thousand 
<br />
cosmologies. And I had no real argument with it even if all the other 
<br />
universes were destined to be forever hypothetical.
