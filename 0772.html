<br />&lt;&lt; 
<br />
&nbsp;Mmm...I don't know. Perhaps. I must say that I agree a lot with Gilles Henri
<br />
&nbsp;when he said to George (about the 4 june 99):
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;Generally speaking, I find it a curious idea to base any ethical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;consideration upon scientific theories. Science's goal is not to tell what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;is good or not. It just deals with objective facts and tries to find
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;relationships between them. It could be a scientific question (although not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;often asked) to ask why and how we define our categories of good and evil.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;It is not a scientific one to ask if they are justified. &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<br />I am primarily a scientist and not at all religious in the traditional sense. 
<br />
However, I feel a deep responsibility in releasing upon an unsuspecting 
<br />
world, in Jacques words, &quot;this monstrous cult of death.&quot; While I fully agree 
<br />
in the scientific justification for QS, in the Tegmark sense, I am deeply 
<br />
apprehensive about the nihilistic connotations and the the possible social 
<br />
consequences of the MWI if this theory was validated and taken seriously by 
<br />
the general public. It is for this reason that I have turned the QS 
<br />
justification on its head thus providing a positive approach to life and 
<br />
offering an alternative philosophy to candidates for QS. &quot;I shall fear no 
<br />
evil,&quot; life is but a game to be enjoyed and played fully by the rules. 
<br />
Ultimately no one is a looser because everyone survives. We can be 
<br />
magnanimous as winners and gracious as loosers. If the MWI assures us of 
<br />
immortality, then our vision of the world is forever changed. This new 
<br />
scientific outlook of the world competes directly with the traditional 
<br />
religious outlook. Therefore, as a scientist I felt that I could borrow from 
<br />
religion the words of the 23 psalm simply because it can communicate better 
<br />
than I possibly could the feeling of security offered by the MWI. K. David 
<br />
said it, and he was, in this matter, a better communicator than George. For 
<br />
the French speakers in this group Enrico Macias also expresses this feeling 
<br />
very well in his song &quot;Jusqu'au bout de la course il faut continuer...
<br />
Here is an English Translation which I have prepared for an article I am 
<br />
writing:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&quot;Jusqu’au Bout de la Course&quot; translated here from the French as &quot;Till the 
<br />
end of the race:&quot; 
<br />
<br />Till the end of the race, we must participate,
<br />
Even if no matter how hard we try, being the last will be our fate,
<br />
<br />Let’s make our whole life a struggle with no mercy,
<br />
But yet  fulfill our most cherished childhood fancy,
<br />
<br />Till the end of the race, let’s keep our self respect,
<br />
And to the fallen, always offer a helping hand,
<br />
<br />Let’s give ourselves a break  when we are wary,
<br />
And continue when we feel better, content and happy,
<br />
<br />At the starting line, each one for himself,  together, racing,
<br />
And at the finish line, happy surprise!  everyone’s winning,
<br />
<br />Till the end of the race, we must participate,
<br />
Even if no matter how hard we try, being the last will be our fate,
<br />
<br />Running with our heart on the road to happiness,
<br />
This is the best reason for our existence,
<br />
<br />Till the end of the race, let’s treat ourselves,
<br />
And teach our children that spring returns every year,
<br />
<br />Let’s start them in the race and teach them as well,
<br />
That love is truly the most beautiful race in life,
<br />
<br />We dream of our future, but whichever one we’re living,
<br />
Sooner or later we’ll cross the finish line, and regret the beginning,
<br />
<br />Till the end of the race, we must participate,
<br />
Even if no matter how hard we try, being the last will be our fate,
<br />
<br />Let’s make our whole life a struggle with no mercy,
<br />
But yet  fulfill our most cherished childhood fancy,
<br />
<br />Till the end of the race, let’s treat ourselves,
<br />
And teach our children that spring returns every year,
<br />
<br />Let’s start them in the race and teach them as well,
<br />
That love is truly the most beautiful race in life,
<br />
<br />Love is truly the most beautiful race in life,
<br />
<br /><br /><br />George Levy
