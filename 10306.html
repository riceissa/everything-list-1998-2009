Bruno,
<br />
<br />I liked what George Levy wrote (19 July 2006):
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  As a mathematician you are trying to compose a theory of everything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; using mathematics, this is understandable, and you came up with COMP
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which is strongly rooted in mathematics and logic.&lt;
</em><br />
A bit lesser the continuation:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I came up independently with my own concept involving a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generalization of relativity to information theory ( my background is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; engineering/physics) and somehow we seem to agree on many points.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Unfortunately I do not have the background and the time to give my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ideas a formal background. It is just an engineering product and it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; feels right.&lt;
</em><br />
because engineering and physics (as we know them from past times) are also
<br />
based on mathematical logic - (if not on straightforward math!) and that
<br />
puts George in a similar basket with you (No peiorative tone intended, or
<br />
involved!)
<br />
To your advice to seek a mathematician (as gossip has it: Einstein relied on
<br />
the math-help of Goedel): it would serve to &quot;anchor&quot; George into YOUR basket
<br />
(sorry George, I believe you are way above such fallibilities as to be
<br />
'anchored').
<br />
Why not consult (and not just educate into YOUR ways) somebody with a
<br />
different view (background thinking?) from the rigorous mathematical
<br />
concepts?
<br />
I still believe that there is more than just 'numbers' and processes in the
<br />
existence with different basis than just comp.
<br />
<br />I don't believe you can &quot;PROVE&quot; that there is nothing else but
<br />
&quot;math-numbers-comp&quot;, unless you call &quot;all other possibilities&quot; with such
<br />
NAMES.  Name-calling is futile. &quot;I can arrive there in a 'little zillion'
<br />
steps&quot; is fairy tale - without at least  some details on the 'HOWs'. (Old
<br />
cliche: the validity of a legal argument).
<br />
<br />I still wait impatiently for your 'roadmap' communications and preserve my
<br />
mind to accept it as maybe proving me wrong. I hope I will not miss them in
<br />
the maze of posts now swarming this list - really beyond my reading
<br />
capabilities. I would love to watch (and find) a 'subject' preserved for
<br />
YOUR line eg as: &quot;ROADMAP&quot; with nobody just clicking 'Reply' to make posts
<br />
as the same subject 350 times.
<br />
<br />Grandmotherishly yours
<br />

<br />
You should perhaps try to find a mathematician in your neighborhood for
<br />
helping you to formalize a bit your approach. I can give you book
<br />
advices on information theory if you are interested. Unfortunately the
<br />
relation between information theory and logic are not so easy. I know
<br />
that Abramski works on it, and Devlin wrote a book on information in
<br />
some logician sense (this is not yet standard), you could search
<br />
&quot;Devlin&quot; on Amazon for the reference.
<br />
In this setting quantum information theory is also hard to avoid. There
<br />
are many good books too.
<br />
&lt;-  Skipped:  Copied above  -&gt;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I believe that what you are saying is right, however I am having
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some trouble following you, just like Norman Samish said. It would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; help if you outlined a roadmap. Then we would be able to follow the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; roadmap without having to stop and admire the mathematical scenery at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; every turn even though it is very beautiful to the initiated, I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sure. For example you could use several levels of explanation: a first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; level would be as if your were talking to your grandmother; a second
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; level, talking to your kids (if they listen); a last level, talking to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your colleagues.
</em><br />
BM:
<br />
Like I just said to Stathis, I have some difficulties. But this is
<br />
really because I want that roadmap post to be comprehensible by the
<br />
grandmother.
<br />
<br />Thanks for being patient,
<br />
<br />Bruno
