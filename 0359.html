<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The one way I can make sense of this is a rather weak reading: if all

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious entities try to draw a conclusion based on the assumption
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that they are randomly selected from among all conscious entities,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then most of them would be right.  Suppose it turns out, for example,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that most conscious entities exist in groups near others, rather than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in isolation.  Then for most conscious entities, the conclusion that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;I am near others&quot; would be true.
</em><br />
<br />The way I see it, the premise should not be used to draw conclusions, but
<br />
rather serves as an explanation. Because you already know you are a human
<br />
being named Hal Finney, it no longer matters that you are a random sample
<br />
of all beings. However, the premise helps explain why you are Hal Finney
<br />
and not some bug-eyed alien, namely that Hal has a larger measure than the
<br />
alien (assuming that is actually true). 
<br />
<br />Here's an analogy: suppose you have just been dealt a hand in a card game. 
<br />
Since you know what cards you have, the distribution from which they were
<br />
chosen no longer matters and won't help you play, but that distribution
<br />
helps explain why you got the cards you did. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If we could show that among instances of me, most were in lawful
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universes, that would be a good first step.  It would not show why I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existed in the first place, but it would give me reason to conclude that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the apparent lawfulness of the universe was not an illusion.
</em><br />
<br />But I am not seeking a justification for believing that the universe is
<br />
really lawful. I'm seeking an explanation for why it appears lawful. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The doomsday argument has a large amount of literature on it.  Nick
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bostrom has a page at <a href="http://www.anthropic-principle.com/preprints.html">http://www.anthropic-principle.com/preprints.html</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with several links to it.  These people have spent a lot more time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thinking about it than I have, and if there is an error, no one seems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to agree on it.  Nick and Robin Hanson had a long debate about the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subject on the extropians list a few months ago, but were not able to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; come to agreement.  (They seemed to bog down on the issue of the proper
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reference class, whether it made sense to say that I might have been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a rock.  That was what I got out of the debate, anyway.)
</em><br />
<br />The typical setup for a DA is two possible universes with some a priori
<br />
probability for one of them being the real one. It doesn't seem to apply
<br />
directly to a theory where all objects/universes exist.
