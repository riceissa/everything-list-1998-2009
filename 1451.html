I don't fear White Rabbit, you know. But what about the Snark ?

</em><br />
<br />You are right. I'm used to modelize comp_n not by the consistency 
<br />
but by the consistency of consistency. But this doesn't change 
<br />
the math. In term of Kripke model consistency means there is 
<br />
at least one word I can access. In the drawing (!) T is the
<br />
propositional constant TRUE.

<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The I have trouble interpreting consistency as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;possibility (the \Diamond symbol).
</em><br />
<br />Take a formal theory like PA. To say that a proposition P
<br />
is consistent with PA means that PA does not prove the 
<br />
negation of P. So you can add P to extend consistently PA.
<br />
When the box is interpreted as formal
<br />
provability then consistency of P is NOT BOX NOT P, which is
<br />
DIAMOND P.
<br />
Simple consistency is consistency of the propositional constant TRUE.
<br />
It means that there is an extension of the theory where TRUE is true,
<br />
which is trivial if the theory cannot prove FALSE, i.e if the theory
<br />
is consistent.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 2) The second roots is the duplication part of the UDA. Read the box
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; as 'I can communicate scientifically that'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;How do I do that?
</em><br />
<br />Eh ... When you see &quot;BOX P&quot;, just read ``I can communicate 
<br />
scientifically that P&quot;. You can modelize scientific communication
<br />
by classical formal provability in an axiomatizable theory. It is
<br />
a typical third person theory. Thanks to Solovay such communication
<br />
is entirely formalised by BOX (BOX P -&gt; P) -&gt; BOX P (Lob's formula)
<br />
in a normal system of modal logic.
<br />
Of course there are a lot of systems of modal logics. If you read the
<br />
box as &quot;always&quot;, then you read the diamond as &quot;sometimes&quot; and of 
<br />
course you will need other axioms to formalise that.
<br />
You can even formalize the notion of ``informal proof&quot;. Typically
<br />
you will need an extension of the system S4 (see Chellas).
<br />
In deontic logic the box is read as &quot;obligatory that&quot; and the
<br />
diamond is read as &quot;permitted that&quot;, a typical axiom is
<br />
``BOX A -&gt; DIAMOND A&quot;, because it is unfair to make something 
<br />
obligatory, yet not permitted !
<br />
<br />By a kind of generosity of my part ;-), I have made publicity for the
<br />
book on Modal Logic by Chellas because it is one of the best book
<br />
on modal logic, and I think modal logic can help all everythingers.
<br />
But, as I said sometimes ago, for my thesis, you should read the
<br />
book by Boolos 1993: the logic of provability. If you are lucky
<br />
you can perhaps still find the preceeding book by Boolos, which
<br />
is &quot;The Unprovability of Consistency&quot; which is more readable and
<br />
has a lot of charm. Both books are published by Cambridge University
<br />
Press. There is also the nice complementary book by Smorinski : 
<br />
&quot;Modal Logic and Self-Reference&quot;.
<br />
And remember the delightfull little introduction to the modal logic
<br />
of formal provability by Smullyan: &quot;Forever Undecided&quot;. It exists
<br />
in paperback.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; In that case if I duplicate at some level n a person which does not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; believe in comp_n, then the doppelganger will understand that he will 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; never be able to communicate (scientifically) to the original person 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that `he' has survived the duplication. That is comp_n is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; scientifically communicable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In what sense is it not scientifically communicable? I thought it was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;just done so in your thesis - regardless of whether one believes in it.
</em><br />
<br />You should carefully distinguish between COMP which is that there is a
<br />
level n such that I survive a functionnal substitution made at the level
<br />
n. And COMP_n, which is that I survive at the level n. That distinction
<br />
is important because:
<br />
<br />``BOX(Exists n COMP_n)&quot; does not imply ``Exists n BOX (COMP_n)&quot;. 
<br />
<br />The fact that &quot;I prove there is a level such that I survive a substitution
<br />
at that level&quot; does not entail that &quot;there exists a level such that I 
<br />
can prove I will survive the substitution at that level&quot;. 
<br />
This is because I don't ask 
<br />
the constructivity of the notion of provability (it is *classical* proof 
<br />
theory, not intuitionistic or constructive proof theory). So we cannot 
<br />
in general permutate quantifiers and BOX. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;In hope of finding an understanding of all this stuff...
</em><br />
<br />It is just a question of time and motivation. I think. 
<br />
Perhaps I would like to suggest
<br />
not embarking yourself to quickly in the formal logical approach.
<br />
The meaning of what I try to do really comes from the argument that
<br />
Physics must be a branch of Machine Psychology, i.e. the ``reversal&quot; 
<br />
consequence of the UDA. I admit this is a rather counter-intuitive 
<br />
result. 
<br />
Then the modal tools appears to provide a big help for putting order 
<br />
on what is left after the reversal.
<br />
Of course my chapter 5 is at the intersection of the foundation of QM, the
<br />
Godelian Self-reference logics, philosophy of mind and theoretical
<br />
computer science. It cannot be easy. But the really fundamental 
<br />
step is the UDA (chapter 3) which needs only passive familiarity 
<br />
with numbers and computers, andit provides the motivation for 
<br />
the formal approach.
<br />
...Well UDA needs also a minimal amount of folk-psychology for the needed
<br />
partial understanding of the word &quot;survive&quot;. Then you can look at the 
<br />
chapter 5 as an eventual elimination of that folk-psychology in UDA. In
<br />
the chapter 5 folk-psychology is substitute by the logics (plural) of 
<br />
self-reference.
