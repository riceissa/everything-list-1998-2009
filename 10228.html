<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Do you mean that if we are living in one, then the moral standards of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; its creators are reprehensible (to our way of thinking) or at least
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; opaque?  Would you feel that our believing this puts us in a position
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in any way different from that of deists traditionally trying to fathom
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what the standards or motives of their gods might be? In either case do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you have a view on how this could or should affect our own standards or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conduct within the simulation?
</em><br />
<br />I guess that our simulated universe's creators are deist deities if they are anything, 
<br />
because there is no evidence that they interfere in our affairs once the simulation 
<br />
is underway. If they did, then we might learn something about them, but as it is 
<br />
their motives, moral standards and so on are unknowable. In any case, why would 
<br />
near-omnipotent beings who cannot suffer (as you rise up the path towards 
<br />
omnipotence, surely eliminating the possibility of unpleasant things happening to you or 
<br />
your society would be a priority) have a sense of moral responsibility towards lesser 
<br />
creatures? God's attitude towards us might be like our attitude towards bacteria. If we 
<br />
discovered that bacteria did, after all, have a rudimentary sentience and at the very 
<br />
least did not want to be killed, what would we do about it? What would we do if we 
<br />
could do nothing about it, and understood that we commited mass murder every time 
<br />
we boiled water? I think we would redefine &quot;murder&quot; so that it didn't apply to lesser 
<br />
organisms, but only to our own exalted species. If we can justify killing or enslaving 
<br />
humans with a different skin colour to our own, or other mammalian species, how much 
<br />
easier would it be for near-omnipotent beings to be indifferent to the suffering of mere 
<br />
computer software?
<br />
<br />As for how knowledge of our creators should affect us, aside from the enormous scientific 
<br />
interest it would create I don't see that it should make any difference to how we live our 
<br />
lives. I think even those religious people who base their morality on laws they believe to 
<br />
be handed down from God would continue, for the most part, living their lives the same 
<br />
way if they realised that this was a fiction (although no doubt most of them would continue 
<br />
with their previous faith no matter what evidence they were presented with).

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; I don't know whether these issues have been given an airing here, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; I have a couple of thoughts about whether we're really 'in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Matrix', a la Nick Bostrom.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Firstly, a moral issue. At least at the level of public debate, in our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; (apparent?) reality there is considerable sensitivity to interfering
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; with fundamental issues of human freedom and dignity, and of avoiding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; where possible the infliction of unnecessary suffering, either to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; humans or other sentient organisms.  It seems to me that if we are to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; take seriously the idea that significant numbers of advanced
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; civilisations would 'simulate' us in the 'feelingful' way we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; (or at least I) experience, that significant moral issues are raised.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; These are not dissimilar to the paradoxes raised by the juxtaposition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; of an all-loving and omnipotent God.  None of this is to claim a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; knock-down argument, but nevertheless it places a constraint on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; kind of 'civilisation' that might undertake such an exercise,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; especially in those scenarios that take it to be some sort of game or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; entertainment.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You're holding the beings running the simulation to awfully high standards.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Humans have always persecuted their own kind, let alone other species,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and have always managed to find rationalisations to explain why it isn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; really &quot;bad&quot;. Even if technologically superior alien societies have similar
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ethics to our own, by no means a given, what if our universe is being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; simulated by their equivalent of a psychopath, or even a teenager in his
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; bedroom?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Secondly, what sort of role are 'we' supposed to playing?  On the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; one hand, we may simply be required to play a part 'intelligently',
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; or at least predictably, for the benefit of the 'real' players.  In
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; this case, would they need to go to the trouble of making us
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; 'sentient'?  Or can we take this as evidence that the complexity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; required for 'intelligence' simply gives rise to such sentience?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I'd say that our sentience is a side-effect of our intelligence. Even if we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; are part of the simulation, the simulation seems to consistently follow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; evolutionary theory, and how or why would sentience develop if it were
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; possible to have the same behaviour without it? I think this is a convincing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; argument against the existence of intelligent zombies.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Thirdly, is part of the point that 'they' share 'our'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; experiences?  If so, what does this say about the supposedly privileged
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; relation between an individual and her experience?  Or is it just that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; they get a third-party 'read-out' of our experiences?  Well, again,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; would it then be necessary for us to go through the whole messy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; business 'consciously' for such reporting to occur?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Another reason why it appears that consciousness is a necessary side-effect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of human level intelligent behaviour.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; It seems to me that the above, and similar, considerations may act to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; constrain the likelihood of there being such simulations, their nature,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; or our 'actually' being in one, but I'm unable to say to what degree.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Perhaps it says something about the nature of the simulation's creators,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; but I don't see that it says anything about the probability that we are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; living in one.
