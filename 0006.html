<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think there would be a mapping between mathematical structures and TM

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; system, we could have a TM start writing out theorems in that system.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In the other direction, we could create a mathematical description of

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any given TM.
</em><br />
<br />But there are some mathematical strctures that can't be described as a
<br />
formal system. For example the set of all true statements about integers,
<br />
or a universe that contains an oracle for the halting problem. One can
<br />
even argue that most mathematical structures can not be described as
<br />
formal systems, since the set of all mathematical structures is not
<br />
countable. (Isn't every real number a mathematical structure? How about
<br />
every function on the real numbers?)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Using Schmidhuber's mapping, the universe states would be 0, 1, 10, 11,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 100, 101, 110, 111, ....  I don't see any simple mapping which would make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this look at all like the universe we live in.  For example, one of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; characteristics of this kind of counting is that there is a lot of change
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at the right hand side and very little at the left, and we don't really
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; see that kind of behavior in our universe, which is somewhat homogeneous.
</em><br />
<br />This argument doesn't work because we can't directly observe the state of
<br />
the universe and its evolution, so we can't say that it is not changing
<br />
only at the right hand side. If we accept Schmidhuber's interpretation,
<br />
there is no way to rule out the possibility that we're living in the
<br />
counting universe because everything eventually appears in it during its
<br />
evolution, including us. If we were living in the counting universe, of
<br />
course all of our memories and perceptions would have no basis in reality. 
<br />
So my problem with Schmidhuber's interpretation is even ignoring the
<br />
mapping problem, I don't see how it would assign a low probability to us
<br />
being in the counting universe. Perhaps he would comment if I'm
<br />
misunderstanding him.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, maybe there could be some more complex mapping, where bits in this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; counting string get mapped sparsely throughout the universe in some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; complicated way.  This mapping problem is one which AI philosophers face
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as well: there is a mapping between the thermal motions of the atoms of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a stone and the neuron firing patterns of a brain.  I think the solution
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is that in some sense the mapping has to be simple, or else the mapping
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is doing all the work.
</em><br />
<br />I think the solution to the mapping problem is to assume no mapping. A
<br />
Turing machine is a universe, and its output given some region as input IS
<br />
the content of that region, not merely the encoding of the content of that
<br />
region. Otherwise, as you point out, you could hide arbitrary amount of
<br />
complexity in the encoding function.
<br />
<br />The interpretation I gave earlier already implicitly assumes no mapping,
<br />
so I don't think it suffers from the mapping problem.
