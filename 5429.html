Hi Stephen and Bruno:
<br />
<br />I only managed to jump into the list and read the last two posting on this 
<br />
subject so I hope this effort to contribute is of interest in areas such as:
<br />
<br />[Cut and pasted out of context:]
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2"> &gt; &gt;[SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt; &gt;     I agree with most of your premises and conclusions but I do not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt; &gt;understand how it is that we can coherently get to the case where a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt; &gt;classical computer can generate the simulation of a finite world that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt; &gt;implies QM aspects (or an ensemble of such), for more than one observer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt; &gt;including you and I, without at least accounting for the appearance of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt; &gt;implementation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely, but &quot;all computational histories&quot; requires at least one step to
<br />
be produced. In Platonia, there is not Time, there is not any way to &quot;take
<br />
that one step&quot;. There is merely a Timeless Existence. How do you propose
<br />
that we recover our experience of time from this? Perhaps I need to learn
<br />
French...
<br />
<br /><br />As Alastair indicated awhile back, he and I are having a discussion in the 
<br />
&quot;Agreed Fundamentals Project&quot; re something/nothing.
<br />
<br />The following is a rework of my most recent response in that 
<br />
discussion.  Definitions extracted from the module are below.
<br />
<br />xxxxxxx
<br />
<br />Here is sort of a very short form of the module.
<br />
<br />There are, it seems, three information content possibilities for the system 
<br />
that could be the basis of our universe and these are:
<br />
<br />1) The system contains no information.
<br />
2) The system contains some information.
<br />
3) The system contains all information.
<br />
<br />The second seems unsatisfactory since you could tune the information 
<br />
content to fit your purpose.
<br />
<br />All I really do is to assume what is actually (I think) a bundle of no 
<br />
information - my &quot;Nothing (N)&quot; or #1 in the above list, and a bundle of all 
<br />
information - i.e. all complete sets of cf-counterfactuals - i.e. my 
<br />
&quot;Everything (E)&quot; or #3 in the above list simultaneously.
<br />
<br />I then show - I think - that they are fundamentally not independent.  I now 
<br />
call such interdependence an example of a definitional pair.  [ Whenever a 
<br />
definition is made there are actually definitions of two things being 
<br />
forged simultaneously - Whatever the thing you are defining is and and 
<br />
another thing that is all that is left over.]
<br />
<br />If &quot;all complete sets of cf-counterfactuals&quot; is the same as all bit 
<br />
strings, then as I see it the above is the same as saying that &quot;N&quot; contains 
<br />
no number at all and that &quot;E&quot; contains a &quot;normal&quot; real number.
<br />
<br />Further if all information is equivalent to having no information then &quot;all 
<br />
sets of cf-counterfactuals&quot; results in &quot;no potential to divide&quot; i.e. no 
<br />
cf-information.  So we note an odd thing: we have a definitional pair that 
<br />
define two forms of the same thing - the net absence of a potential to 
<br />
divide - no cf-information.
<br />
<br />The dynamic I develop in the module [from: only cf-counterfactuals allowed 
<br />
in &quot;E&quot;] says that any such pair can not be static or have a fixed 
<br />
evolution.  In other words the boundary - no number opposed to a particular 
<br />
normal real number - between the two must be dynamic and therefore 
<br />
represent a sequence where &quot;E&quot; contains a series of normal real numbers in 
<br />
random order.  And because of this dynamic our universe's current state 
<br />
which is a particular decode [interpretation] of a particular string in 
<br />
that number will always be present and will eventually come into proper 
<br />
juxtaposition [also necessarily a dynamic] with all those strings that 
<br />
represent encoded possible next states - evolutionary trees - during the 
<br />
dynamic.
<br />
<br />Now the final point I have interest in in the module is: Can there be a 
<br />
fixed number of these evolutionary trees [all, some fixed fraction, none] 
<br />
that have at least one path that is free of external true noise?   No 
<br />
because any such number would represent a cf-factual not a 
<br />
cf-counterfactual.  Therefore all paths eventually experience an external 
<br />
noise event since &quot;none&quot; must randomly be the right number.
<br />
<br />One view of the dynamic is a computer [Turing?] moving along an infinite 
<br />
string as data and outputing the original string and a computed new string 
<br />
as it went.  Behind that would be two more and behind each of those two 
<br />
more etc.  These computers would all have randomly constructed rules and be 
<br />
asynchronous [the external true noise].  The result to me seems to be a 
<br />
dynamic of all possible universes evolving to all possible next states.
<br />
<br />--------------- From the module - more or less 
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />I see no difference between cf-information [a term defined in the module - 
<br />
see below] and the usual idea of information and intend none.
<br />
<br />[1def] cf-Information: The potential to divide as with a boundary.  An 
<br />
Example: The information in a Formal Axiomatic System [FAS] divides true 
<br />
statements from not true statements [relevant to that FAS].
<br />
<br />[2def] cf-Factual: A particular potential to divide.  Used as a noun.  An 
<br />
example: The FAS known as Arithmetic.
<br />
<br />[4def] cf-Counterfactual: A cf-factual [cf-factual B] that to some degree 
<br />
influences the potential to divide or actual division of another cf-factual 
<br />
[cf-factual A].  Used as a noun.  Note that a cf-factual that has a 
<br />
cf-counterfactual is itself a cf-counterfactual.
<br />
<br />[5def] cf-Effect: An all inclusive range of influences between cf-factuals 
<br />
that establish a cf-counterfactual relationship between two or more 
<br />
them.  One type of influence between cf-counterfactuals could be where 
<br />
&quot;existence&quot; encompasses two logic systems such that in one the statement 
<br />
&quot;A&quot; is true and in the other the statement &quot;Not A&quot; is true. Taken together 
<br />
the two logic systems influence each other's division of statement A with 
<br />
regard to truth by making it indeterminate at the level of 
<br />
&quot;existence&quot;.  This influence may be far narrower than the range of 
<br />
influences that may be necessarily encompassed in the cf-effect.  The 
<br />
possible added range may be relevant if there are more than two 
<br />
cf-counterfactuals in the relationship.  A rough example is provided by the 
<br />
way in which red, green, and blue can be combined to produce any color 
<br />
including shades of gray.
<br />
<br />[6def] Complete set of cf-counterfactuals: A collection of 
<br />
cf-counterfactuals that leaves no member without a cf-effect [a countering 
<br />
influence] to any of its aspects by some other member or combination of 
<br />
members of the same set.  The word &quot;set&quot; has no other connotation.
