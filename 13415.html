<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I came across a reference to Boltzmann brains in a recent issue of New
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Scientist.
</em><br />
<br />Coincidentally (or not) I was reading all about this last night, from
<br />
the fqxi.org web site Max Tegmark mentioned a few weeks ago.  The new
<br />
blog entry by Anthony Aguirre discusses this issue and some related ones
<br />
regarding multiverses, the Doomsday paradox, etc.  I ended up reading
<br />
several papers by Don Page and others.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The piece, quoted in full is:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Spikes in space-time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is another way to think about why our universe began in a highly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ordered or &quot;low entropy&quot; state. In 2002, a group of physicists led by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Leonard Susskind at Stanford University in California proposed that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entities capable of observing the universe could arise via random
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thermal fluctuations, as opposed to the big bang, galaxy formation and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evolution. This idea has been explored by others, including Don Page
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada. Some researchers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argue that under certain conditions, self-aware entities in the form
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of disembodied spikes in space-time - &quot;Boltzmann brains&quot; - are more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; likely to emerge than complex life forms.
</em><br />
<br />The reference to Susskind is a paper we discussed here back
<br />
in Aug 2002, Disturbing Implications of a Cosmological Constant,
<br />
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0208013">http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0208013</a> .  The authors argued that in current
<br />
cosmological models the universe dies a heat death and falls into a steady
<br />
state of exponential expansion which goes on forever.  In that state,
<br />
quantum gravity fluctuations will eventually cause macroscopic objects
<br />
to appear.  This is extremely rare but still with infinite time to work
<br />
with, every object will appear an infinite number of times.  That includes
<br />
disembodied brains, the so-called Boltzmann brains, as well as planets and
<br />
whole universes.  But the smaller objects are vastly more common, hence it
<br />
is most likely that our experiences are due to us being a Boltzmann brain.
<br />
<br />This has a few bad implications; one is that our perceptions should end
<br />
and not continue (but they do continue) and another is that brains would
<br />
be just as likely to (falsely) remember chaotic universes as lawful ones
<br />
(but we only remember lawful ones).  So this model is not considered
<br />
consistent with our experiences.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Because they depend on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fluctuations of particles, Boltzmann brains would be more common in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; regions of high entropy than low entropy. If the universe had started
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; out in a state of high entropy, it would be more likely to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; populated by Boltzmann brains than life forms like us, which suggests
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the entropy of our early universe had to be low. As a low-entropy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; initial state is unlikely, though, this also implies that there are a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; huge number of other universes out there that are unsuitable for us.
</em><br />
<br />I don't think this reasoning makes sense, for two reasons.  First, even
<br />
though the universe did apparently start out in a low-entropy state,
<br />
hence giving an opportunity for non-Boltzmann (ie not disembodied)
<br />
brains like ours to form, still as argued above eventually it gets into
<br />
a high-entropy state and you then still have the problem of an infinite
<br />
number of Boltzmann brains.  The choice then is between a universe that
<br />
starts high-entropy and has only Boltzmann brains, and one that starts
<br />
low-entropy and has a finite number of &quot;normal&quot; brains and an infinite
<br />
number of Boltzmann brains.  It's not clear that the latter choice really
<br />
explains and justifies why we are non-Boltzmann.
<br />
<br />Second, even if so, as it says these ideas are usually applied in the
<br />
context of multiverse theories, so there would be an infinite number of
<br />
universes, some starting in low entropy and some in high entropy states.
<br />
Again we would have an infinite number of Boltzmann brains in the
<br />
multiverse compared with only a finite number of non-Boltzmann brains,
<br />
so we haven't really explained why we find ourselves in one of the
<br />
universes which has normal non-Boltzmann brains.
<br />
<br />I would suggest two ways out of the dilemma.  The first is from physics.
<br />
One of the things I learned in my reading last night is that this
<br />
model of an infinite expanding universe may not actually work.  This
<br />
so-called de Sitter state does not have a consistent quantum explanation.
<br />
The theory suggests that the de Sitter state may be inherently unstable
<br />
and will somehow decay, perhaps by tunnelling into another vacuum state.
<br />
This could happen fast enough that the total expected number of Boltzmann
<br />
brains is finite, potentially resolving the paradox.
<br />
<br />The other is from our measure-based reasoning.  For various reasons we
<br />
might argue that the measure of brains existing in the extremely far
<br />
future is less than that of brains existing today.  Such brains are much
<br />
smaller spatially in comparison to the universe as a whole than our brains
<br />
are today, for one thing, so perhaps they deserve a lesser share of the
<br />
universe's total measure.  Also, the amount of information to specify
<br />
the location of such a brain in terms of Planck moments since the Big
<br />
Bang would be vastly greater than for brains like ours existing in the
<br />
relative youth of the universe.  A measure concept related to information
<br />
might therefore reduce the measure of such brains to insignificance.
