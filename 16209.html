Bruno, List,
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; in awaked state. Yet I do distinguish dying and forgetting.
</em><br />
<br />Let us say that we have a measure of continuation (of psychological)
<br />
identity from 1 to 0, where 1=full continuation and 0=death, and we 
<br />
apply this measure from one OM to the next.
<br />
<br />Then forgetting would be everything between 0 and 1. O, extreme
<br />
forgetting, is death.
<br />
<br />Oliver Sacks's book &quot;The Man who mistook his wife for a hat&quot; comes to 
<br />
mind, where he also describes a patient, Jimmie, who has severe 
<br />
retrograde amnesia which started when he was around 60 or so and which 
<br />
&quot;erased&quot; his memories up to 40 years prior.
<br />
<br />An especially chilling episode occurs in the book when Sacks mentions 
<br />
that, on the first interview with the patient, he gives him a mirror 
<br />
(which Sacks regrets) and the patient gets a panic attack, because he 
<br />
sees a 65 year old when he expects to be 19. Fortunately, he forgets a 
<br />
few moments later. He lives in an &quot;eternal now&quot; being reset every few 
<br />
minutes, because (through alcohol abuse) he can't develop new memories 
<br />
(and in his severe case many past ones where erased).
<br />
<br />This person has lived up to 65, but, through losing his memories, from 
<br />
65 onwards one could say that he &quot;died&quot; with 19 (relative to his 65+ 
<br />
states).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I think &quot;I&quot; is a logical construction (we will come back on this).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Memories have a big values, but &quot;I&quot; don't put it in my identity, nor
</em><br />
<br />Hmm, I do think that memories constitutes your identity (in the wide 
<br />
sense, also muscle memory as Brent mentioned). If not that,
<br />
what then?
<br />
<br />Drescher (in Good and Real, 2006, MIT Press) for instance likens qualia
<br />
to gensyms in LISP

QUOTE:
<br />
Creating Symbols
<br />
<br />These functions create unique symbols, typically for use as temporary
<br />
variables.
<br />
<br />Function: gensym &amp;optional x
<br />
This function creates a new, uninterned symbol (using make-symbol) with
<br />
a unique name.
<br />
ENDQUOTE
<br />
<br />I am not so sure about qualia, but I think the &quot;I&quot; symbol fits this
<br />
description nicely: a unique symbol for use as temporary variable,
<br />
around which memories (filters on histories) gather. This &quot;I&quot; variable 
<br />
is not really essential, what is essential is the memories (relating one 
<br />
to the world). Indeed, Susan Blackmore (english naturalist 
<br />
philosopher/psychologist) describes having eliminating any feeling of 
<br />
&quot;I&quot; through meditation. To be more precise, I think she has simply 
<br />
eliminated the I symbol but it is still present subsymbolically as an 
<br />
anchor for memories (see also papers by Aaron Sloman and John Pollock 
<br />
describing persons as virtual machines).
<br />
<br />Plotinus Universal Soul (less mystically: the first person view) could
<br />
never die (as in: there will always be an experience in Platonia,
<br />
somewhere, somewhen (better: nowhere, nowhen); but your _personal
<br />
identity_ here on Earth in this Universe etc. ceases to exist without
<br />
your memories.
<br />
<br />Less and less memories -&gt; means more and more histories pass through you 
<br />
(assuming COMP), until, when you have lost all memories (including the 
<br />
&quot;memory&quot; of your brain organization which leads you to be able to 
<br />
process visual stimuli, same holds for other senses) which equals death 
<br />
all histories pass through that state, and as Russell nicely points out 
<br />
in his book (he uses bitstrings) all histories are as good as no 
<br />
histories - all differences get lost, there is no person left to 
<br />
appreciate (that is then indeed the true view from nowhen and nowhere - 
<br />
nothing).
<br />
<br />To put up the above paragraph another way: you need memories to _be_ 
<br />
_someone_. To be someone is to be someone relatively to possible 
<br />
histories, which gets mediated by memories.
<br />
<br />Best Wishes,
<br />
Günther
