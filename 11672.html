<br />Yes, that's my point! I'm trying to argue that the brain has actually
<br />
come up with a solution to this in order to account for what we
<br />
experience.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; For that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter, it's as much a problem for a computer that gets teleported around in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; course of its calculations. If the teleportation time slices are of femtosecond
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; duration, then there is nothing within a particular slice to mark it as part of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; calculation 5464*2342. Yet a computer strobing in and out of existence like this,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; technical problems aside, will still come up with the right answer. Indeed, if the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computer only materialised in the final femtosecond it would have the right answer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and if a log were kept, evidence of how it arrived at the answer. Do you believe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that there must be some super-computation information in each femtosecond slice
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that binds them all together?
</em><br />
<br />No, this is irrelevant. The calculation example is disanalogous,
<br />
because what is relevant to this is simply the 3-person process that
<br />
results in the right answer: this *entirely constitutes* the
<br />
calculation. We don't seek to make claims about any putative
<br />
'temporally-extended pov' that the computer might possess while
<br />
performing it. What is at issue in these thought experiments, by
<br />
contrast, is *precisely* the pov - of apparently real temporal
<br />
dimension and dynamic character - that we wish to claim would be
<br />
experienced from the perspective of a given 'time-slice', however
<br />
arbitrarily fine-grained.
<br />
<br />With respect to this pov, we seem to have two alternatives:
<br />
<br />1) It is supported and constrained *entirely* by whatever structure and
<br />
information is to be found within an individual time-slice (i.e. the
<br />
'time capsule').
<br />
<br />2) Structure and information external to the individual time-slice is
<br />
in fact required to generate it (i.e. the individual slice is not a
<br />
'time capsule').
<br />
<br />Per alternative 1), any slice containing the requisite structure and
<br />
information content can potentially support a coherent 'temporally
<br />
extended' conscious experience. Per alternative 2) AFAICS this can't be
<br />
the case.
<br />
<br />I'm not sure that you're seeing my point here. I'm not denying that the
<br />
pov is maintained in the chopped-up version, I'm supporting this view.
<br />
But given the information constraint, I'm saying that any mechanisms
<br />
that produce conscious experiences of apparent temporal duration *must*
<br />
consequently (and counter-intuitively) depend on *instantaneously*
<br />
present structure and information. These non-sequential issues are not
<br />
relevant for 'calculation', hence the disanalogy. This leads to an
<br />
empirical claim about brain mechanism, driven by the analysis. If we
<br />
don't concede this, then AFAICS we're left with the alternative of
<br />
giving up the information constraint. That is, the apparent temporal
<br />
extension available in experience *from the pov of an individual
<br />
infinitessimal time-slice* must somehow depend on information to be
<br />
found only in other time-slices. But this then renders any notion of
<br />
slicing irrelevant and the thought experiment collapses.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I think we're in agreement, Stathis, but I'm trying to focus on a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; problem, and what I think is a non-trivial aspect of evolved brain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; functionality that would be required to overcome it. Of course, I agree
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; with you that each aspect of the experience '.....falls perfectly into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; position in each case by virtue of its content alone' - it's precisely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; what I've been arguing. But there's a subtler point here also, I think,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that leads to the problem. Let's take the 'cat sat on the mat': now
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'cat' starts at t1 and 'mat' ends at t2. Let's subdivide t1t2 into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; occasions o1-o1000, and let teleportation occur between each. Each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; occasion o1-o1000 is as informationally closed as OMt1t2 (the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'teleportation' is of course inserted precisely to make this point),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; but now it has become implausible to believe that any individual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; occasion, say o492, is of sufficient extent to recover any coherent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; component whatsoever of the conscious thought 'the cat sat on the mat'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; And yet, we know that we *are* in fact able to routinely recover such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; components, corresponding loosely to a 'specious present' of some 1.5
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; seconds extent.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Now comes the problem: how do we account for our manifest ability to do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; this without invoking some form of illicit 'continuity' between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; informationally separated occasions of arbitrarily fine granularity? No
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; individual occasion apparently contains all the necessary information,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and it seems that we almost can't stop ourselves imaginatively invoking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; some sort of continuity over multiple occasions, in order that coherent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; experiences can somehow be recovered by summing over the sequence.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I think, if true, this would be a real problem in reconciling our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; experience with the facts, and I think therefore that it requires a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; real solution (actually an aspect of Barbour's time capsule theory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; which I'm extrapolating a bit further). Simply, if what I'm arguing is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; valid, it must follow that my assumption about individual occasions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'not containing the necessary information' *must be wrong*.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Consequently, sufficient information to recover 'speciously present'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; dynamic experiences *must* in fact be *simultaneously* represented by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the brain - be present on one occasion - and that this simultaneous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'dynamic' presentation must be the engine that renders both the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; duration and the dynamism of the experience. And, to complete the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (evolutionary) circularity, this would be precisely *why* the brain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; would possess this capability - because without it, extended, dynamic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; environmental presentations would simply be *unavailable* to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; organism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Does this make sense?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think I see what you mean, but it's as much a problem for the intact and
</em><br />
