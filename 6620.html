<br />
Norman, your review is commendable.
<br />
I try to look at things from another aspect and these remarks come from
<br />
there: not argumentatively, just representing another view. Or call it a
<br />
belief-system (as eg. the physical/mathematical thinking, or the creationist
<br />
vs.
<br />
religiously(!) scientific  ways). You wrote:
<br />
&quot;some hold that there is an identity between physical and mathematical
<br />
existence &quot;
<br />
- I think they are one-way, both the figments of human
<br />
explanations for observing whatever comes into the reach of our (quite
<br />
different) minds. As Bohm stated: there are no numbers in nature (until
<br />
WE've invented them) and human logic is also our artifact. The one way means
<br />
that physicists &quot;apply&quot; the results of math, why mathematicians (at lest
<br />
some friends of mine) feel quite happy with &quot;I don't know physics&quot;. The
<br />
&quot;applied&quot; math is different from the &quot;pure(?)&quot; kind because it serves for
<br />
equationing models identified as physical objects/phenomena quantized in our
<br />
system (again humanly devised) by their limited &quot;model&quot; content. Those
<br />
models are incomplete and the equations require some manipulation to fit in
<br />
spite of the quantitative inaccuracy of the models.
<br />
In the past 3 millennia human science did an incredible job to balance out
<br />
such a model-based edifice of the scientific view about the world. Which
<br />
does not mean that it is true.
<br />
Truth - if any - lies in the 'inaccessible', from which certain details are
<br />
discovered by our epistemic development. So Leahy may be right or may be
<br />
wrong.
<br />
<br />It is perfectly stated in your post, omitting my above stance
<br />
on our anthropomorphized mindset: &quot;(Answer:  Because such existence is a
<br />
logical necessity&quot;.) In human logic.
<br />
Stephen puts it well: an explainable existence would be deterministic to
<br />
&quot;beyond existence&quot; factors. Which again would only extend the limits of what
<br />
we call existence. If someone invokes &quot;god&quot;, that would merge into pantheism
<br />
if consequently applied (ie extending the existence to god). Just a step
<br />
further into the unknown.
<br />
*
<br />
The answer to (even the causative) WHY is fiction. I see no difference
<br />
between the 'infinite existence', God's dreation, a quantum fluctuation, or
<br />
any other (random or unexplained) origination of the &quot;first steps&quot;.
<br />
*
<br />
To Stephen's &quot;asymmetries&quot;: they are 'local' in a finite system. Infinity
<br />
may render them symmetrical in their repeated occurrence - at such
<br />
(infinite) level.
<br />
Infinite distribution inadvertently includes asymmetries by the (unexcluded)
<br />
occurrences of grouping identicals in the otherwise invariant variety.
<br />
(This is my startup for the universes in my cosmologic narrative. My unkown
<br />
is an invariant infinite Plenitude).
<br />
*
<br />
I would add to Patrick's points the anthropomorphism in the 'logical' and in
<br />
fashioning the universes according to our so-far formulated discoveries on
<br />
OUR universe ( e.g. immortality, life, etc.) As if we knew what we don't.
<br />
*
<br />
In Bruno's quoted arguments:
<br />
<br />&quot;physical existence emerges from mathematical existence&quot;
<br />
&quot;you attach consciousness...&quot;  AND &quot; individuated bodies&quot; -
<br />
are all figments of explaining our model-observations. Also:
<br />
<br />&quot;Also, it is possible to explain why we cannot explain
<br />
where our belief in natural numbers come from...&quot;
<br />
<br />is within our consciousness/thinking 'bootstrap' syndrome (Russell's
<br />
preferred naming) using our mind to explain our mind in a world we are
<br />
intrinsic part of.
<br />
<br />I wonder if the list finds any merit in such views?
<br />
