<br />If you don't like my somewhat rambling ideas on the subject, below, perhaps try
<br />
A book by Steven Pinker called &quot;How the Mind Works&quot;. It's supposed to be pretty
<br />
good. I've got it but haven't read it yet.

<br />
-----------------------------
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />
What does a mind do?
<br />
<br />A mind in an intelligent animal, such as ourselves, does the following:
<br />
<br />1. Interprets sense-data and symbolically represents the objects, relationships, processes,
<br />
and more generally, situations that occur in its environment.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extra buzzwords: segmentation, individuation,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;cutting the world with a knife into this and not-this&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(paraphrased from Zen &amp; The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance)
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
2. Creates both specific models of specific situations and their constituents,
<br />
and abstracted, generalized models of important classes of situations and situation
<br />
constituents, using techniques such as cluster analysis, logical induction and abduction,
<br />
bayesian inference (or effectively equivalent processes).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extra buzzwords: &quot;structure pump&quot;, &quot;concept formation&quot;, &quot;episodic memory&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />3. Recognizes new situations, objects, relationships, processes as being instances
<br />
of already represented specific or generalized situations, objects, relationships, 
<br />
processes. 
<br />
<br />The details of the recognition processes vary across sensory domains, but probably
<br />
commonly use things like: matching at multiple levels of abstraction with feedback
<br />
between levels, massively parallel matching processes, abstraction lattices.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extra buzzwords: patterns, pattern-matching, neural net algorithms, 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;constraint-logic-programming, associative recall
<br />
<br /><br />4. Builds up, through sense-experience, representation, and recognition processes, 
<br />
over time, an associatively interrelated &quot;library of symbolic+probabilistic models or 
<br />
micro-theories&quot; about contexts in the environment.
<br />
<br />5. Holds micro-theories in degrees of belief. That is, in degrees of being considered
<br />
a good &quot;simple, corresponding, explanatory, successfully predictive&quot; model of some
<br />
aspect of the environment.
<br />
<br />6. Adjusts degrees of belief through a continual process of theory extension,
<br />
hypothesis testing against new observations, incremental theory revision, assessment of
<br />
competing extended theories etc. In short, performs a mini, personalized equivalent
<br />
of &quot;the history of science forming the evolving set of well-accepted scientific 
<br />
theories&quot;.
<br />
<br />Degree of belief in each micro-theory is influenced by factors such as: 
<br />
<br />a. Repeated success of theory at prediction under trial against new observations
<br />
<br />b. Internal logical consistency of theory.
<br />
<br />c. Lack of inconsistency with new observations and with other micro-theories of possibly
<br />
identical or constituent-sharing contexts.
<br />
<br />d. Generation of large numbers of general and specific propositions which are
<br />
deductively derived from the assumptions of the theory, and which are independently
<br />
verified as being &quot;corresponding&quot; to observations. 
<br />
<br />e. Depth and longevity of embedding of the theory in the knowledge base. i.e.
<br />
the extent to which repeated successful reasoning from the theory has resulted in the 
<br />
theory becoming a &quot;basis theory&quot; or &quot;theory justifying other extended or analogous 
<br />
theories&quot; in the knowledge base. 
<br />
<br /><br />7. Creates alternative possible world models (counterfactuals or hypotheticals),
<br />
by combining abstracted models with episodic models but with variations generated
<br />
through the use of substitution of altered or alternative constituent entities,
<br />
sequences of events, etc.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extra buzzwords: Counterfactuals, possible worlds, modal logic, dreaming 
<br />
<br />8. Generates, and ranks for likelihood, extensions of episodic models into the future,
<br />
using stereotyped abstract situation models with associated probabilities to predict
<br />
the next likely sequences of events, given the part of the situation that has
<br />
been observed to unfold so far.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
9. Uses the extended and altered models, (hypotheticals, counterfactuals), as a context
<br />
in which to create and pre-evaluate through simulation the likely effectiveness of 
<br />
plans of action designed to alter the course of future events to the material 
<br />
advantage of the animal.
<br />
<br />10. Chooses a plan. Acts on the world according to the plan, either indirectly, 
<br />
through communication with other motivated intelligent agents, or directly by 
<br />
controlling its own body and using tools.
<br />
<br />10a. Communicates with other motivated intelligent agents to assist it in carrying
<br />
out plans to affect the environment:
<br />
Aspects of the communication process:
<br />
- Model (represent and simulate) the knowledge, motivations and reasoning processes of
<br />
the other agents,
<br />
- Communicate to the other agents, using conventional symbols.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Subjects of communication:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-specific and general knowledge about the environment and its relevant non-optimalities,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-suggested specific courses of action to remedy non-optimality, 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with logical justifications, and motivational explanations of likely mutual benefits.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Evolutionary side effect of need to model the cognition and action planning process of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assistant agents: The development of ability to reflect on one's own
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thinking process. i.e. some of what consciousness is)
<br />
<br />11. Assesses the effects of planned actions, corrects, reassesses, remodels,
<br />
plans again, acts again.
<br />
<br />12. Prioritizes cognition to meet real-time understanding and planning deadlines,
<br />
via techniques such as: 
<br />
a. Parallel exploration and testing of alternative hypotheses, 
<br />
b. Parallel associative recall processes
<br />
c. Periodic assessment of relative promise of the parallel alternative lines of 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reasoning and different directions of associative recall exploration of memory,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and pruning of less promising directions to allow redirection of the finitely
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resourced search processes to deeper exploration of more promising directions.
<br />
d. Emotion-tagging of episodic memories of &quot;survival-important&quot; aspects of situations,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and carry-over of the emotion-tags to abstracted general rules. These emotion
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tags serve as a prioritization on all-directions associative recall and on 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all-directions inference during exploration of recalled theories and situations
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and current situation. i.e. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- If it could kill you now, recall it fast and don't think about anything else. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Similarly if it could get you an opportunity to pass on your genes.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- If it could kill you slowly (hunger, lack of shelter), or make your world safer 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and more comfortable (food, shelter, friends and helpers, money), 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;think about it with relatively high priority, and probably quite often. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- If it is new and unknown, it could kill you now, so think a lot about it now until 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you can learn enough to assure yourself that that is not the case.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- If it is same old same old, and not one of the above categories, muse on it
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if you have the time. You might learn something new of benefit by mixing it with
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some old thought to generate an important realization.
<br />

<br />
<br />What is a mind?
<br />
Something that does all of the above, and undoubtedly more.
<br />
<br />How does it work? F****ed if I know.
