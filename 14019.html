<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; OK. You know I like your little book as an introduction to the field,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; but, as you have already acknowledge, there is some lack in rigor in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; it, and it is not even clear if eventually you are of the ASSA type or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; RSSA type, or if you accept comp or not. Use of Bayes and Prior, for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I am clearly on the record, both in the book and also in the list
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; archives as an &quot;RSSA type&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I do not pretend the contrary. Only that it is not clear. (We have a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem of communcation I think, not more)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />Sure - but on this point I have always been clear :)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; As far as comp is concerned, I do not assume it, but accept it as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; model of what's going on. See page 79 of my book.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This does not help, unless you take some conseq of comp as granted, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like the reversal physics/number-theology, or a form of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematicalism, etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />I do take the reversal, but not as granted. It is essentially a
<br />
consequence of any ensemble theory of everything with a 1-3
<br />
distinction. This is most clearly enunciated from within a
<br />
computationalist position, which is why I think your UDA is so
<br />
important, (to convince the doubters) but in fact the result is much
<br />
more general, and computationalism per se is not needed.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I do consider that the discovery (by Babbage, Post, Church, Turing, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ...) of the Universal Machine is a major discovery of our time which 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; changes almost all what has been thought about machine up to then. This 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is reflected in the computability theory, and I exploit those 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theoretical consequences.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />Of course. But I also put Darwinian evolution up there with that
<br />
(variation/selection is a powerful theory).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; example, is a symptom of ASSA type reasoning. Distinction between 1 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; 3 person points of view is symptom of the RSSA type of reasoning, (and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; favored with comp).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Not if the prior were actually given by the observer erself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ?
</em><br />
<br />As is stated in &quot;Why Occams Razor&quot;, and made more explicit in
<br />
&quot;Importance of the Observer&quot; and &quot;Theory of Nothing&quot;, what is the U
<br />
used in computing the universal prior? It can be nothing other than
<br />
the observer. U needn't even be a machine, any partition of the
<br />
strings into measurable subsets suffices.
<br />
<br />And this identification turns an essentially 3rd person account into a
<br />
1st person account. To talk about ASSA or RSSA one has to introduce
<br />
some notion of time, or at least successor states.
<br />
<br />...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Stronger in what sense?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In the syntactical, or proof-theoretical sense. A theory A is stronger 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than a theory B if A proves all theorems of B.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The set of theorems of B is included in the set of theorems of A. For 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; example PA is stronger (in that sense) than ROBINSON. (ROBINSON is PA 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; without the induction axioms).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Another example: QM + physical collapse is stronger than pure QM.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Caution: if a theory A is syntactically stronger than B, then B is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; semantically stronger than A. Given that A has more axioms, it will 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have less models. It is like in algebra: a big set of equations has 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; less solution than a little one. Syntax (theory+proof) and Semantics 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (mathematical models) are in a sort of Galois correspondence: the more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you have axioms (the richer in theorems your theory is), the less you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have models.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />As I have said, I have been taking David Deutsch's idea seriously, of
<br />
combining a many universes ontology, with information theory and
<br />
Darwinian evolution. (David also suggests Popperian epistemology as a
<br />
fourth strand, but I consider this to be a special case of evolution).
<br />
<br />In order to do this, I need to assume whatever is needed to even make
<br />
sense of these concepts. At a minimum it would seem to include some of
<br />
set theory, of measure theory and classical logic, but maybe it can
<br />
pared down to a more spartan set of axioms. The point is I
<br />
don't really care what is involved, but someone else will bother themselves
<br />
with these details. That is why I say I'm acting like a physicist.
<br />
<br />One way of connecting with what you do is to say that I assume the
<br />
existence of UD*, without concerning myself about the existence of the
<br />
UD. The CT thesis comes into play to justify the use of information
<br />
theory. Regardless of what is really out there, all that we can know
<br />
about it must come to us in the form of strings, and so we can just
<br />
start with considering sets of strings. Hence computationalism is not
<br />
assumed, but your universal dovetailer provides a computationalist
<br />
model. It remains to be seen whether computationalism is the only
<br />
possible model (I suspect not, but I don't know).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I have only assumed just enough to make sense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of the notion of complexity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I still don't know if you take &quot;all the strings&quot; in some first order 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logical setting (in which case it will be not enough for defining a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; notion of complexity) or if you take &quot;all the strings&quot; in some larger 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (second order, mathematical instead of logical, etc.) sense, in which 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; case you take far too much.
</em><br />
<br />I don't know either. It will be up to someone else better grounded in
<br />
logic theory to work this one out. I suspect it is highly nontrivial.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Given the relation between &quot;all the strings&quot; and the set of subsets of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; N, sometimes it seems to me you are just formulating (in some awkward 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way, with all my respect) some acceptation of classical logic (boolean 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; algbra) pertaining on the natural numbers. In that case, your 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumption would be arithmetical realism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />Perhaps. But it is not clear.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Its not so much that, but in how you interpret the logical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; results. Calling G*/G an angel for instance might be colourful
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; rhetoric, but it doesn't really mean much to me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Rhaaaa.... You talk like John, now!
</em><br />
<br />Oh no! Heaven forbid! Sorry, John. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK I say a bit more. First you are an old participant in the list, so 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you remember surely that I have first presented G and G* as &quot;the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine-itself&quot; and &quot;the guardian angel of the machine&quot;. This was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mainly in honor of Judson Webb who is the first to clearly realised 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that Godel's incompleteness results were protecting mechanist 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; philosophy against all possible diagonalization à-la LUcas (-Penrose): 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and Judson call Godel's result the guardian angel of mechanism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But more recently, perhaps because I have introduced the term 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;theology&quot;, I have introduced the term &quot;angels, Gods, Supergods ...&quot;, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but then I did define them. By angel I really mean any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-refrentially correct entity which is NOT turing emulable. The 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simple angels corresponds to the arithmetical (and analytical) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hierarchy in computability theory. They are the main object of study of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computability theory (alias &quot;recursion theory&quot;); Gods, supergods, are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just higher in such or similar hierachies. They corresponds often (but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not always) with machine in company of the so-called (by Turing) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Oracles.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Note: the term &quot;angel&quot; is never used by Plotinus, nor the term 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;theology&quot;. Proclus uses the term &quot;theology&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />I wasn't trying to criticise your use of terms. Mathematics has a long
<br />
tradition of borrowing terms from everyday language to label
<br />
mathematical concepts. Sometimes the terms might approximate the
<br />
everyday term in some sense - eg a &quot;ball&quot; really is a ball in the 3D
<br />
case, but other can be quite fanciful, just convenient labels for
<br />
remembering stuff that is otherwise a hard to remember formula, and
<br />
harder to pronounce. Guardian angel would seem to fit into this latter
<br />
category. I have no problem with the use of colourful rhetoric like
<br />
this, but I have enough mathematical training to know that it simply
<br />
refers to that which is true but not provable, and not something of
<br />
greater significance.
<br />
<br />Let's consider a non-Brunotheological case. Your hypostases for
<br />
instance. I don't understand what makes some of them 1st person, and
<br />
others 3rd person. As I understand it, they're axioms for systems of
<br />
logical statements. The axioms proscribe what can and can't be stated
<br />
for the given system.
<br />
<br />But what does any of that have to do with experience? What is the
<br />
connection with the dovetailer of the UDA? I understand that some of
<br />
the systems admit a representation in terms of Kripke frames, but
<br />
again what does that have to do with time? I can understand that some
<br />
of the systems might also be used to model a multiverse of observer
<br />
moments, but I don't see the connection between logical statement and
<br />
observer moments. So many questions, I know. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; It might seem like such uncountable sets are too much to assume, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; in fact it is the simplest possible object. It has precisely zero
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; information.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Zero information. Zero justification. Occam razor ... I do agree with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; these major motivations for the everything idea, but I disagree with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; the proposition saying that the the set of strings needs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; zero-information. Why not the infinite strings on both right and left
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; (coding the integers), or infinite many-dimensional lattices fit with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; zero and one on the vertex, or etc. ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Information theory is defined on one-sided strings. It would be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; possible to redefine complexity to use two-sided strings, or subsets
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of N, or real numbers, but you just end up with an isometric theory,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; it wouldn't be saying anything different/
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />Sorry a brain-freeze occurred. I meant isomorphic. In the sense of
<br />
category theory.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; There is just a lack of enough precise definition so as to verify your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; statements that strings needs zero-information, and as I say above,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; from some standard and traditional view points, infinite strings needs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; a lot of information to be define.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; No countable set has this property.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Why?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; For finite sets, one has the objection - why that finite number? For
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; infinite countable sets, can one even define a measure?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We can put many measures on all sets, finite, infinite countable, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; infinite uncountable, and beyond.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Only when there is some extra-structure, making the set a vectorial 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; topological space for example, can we find in the lucky case some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unique measure theorems.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />I suppose you are right. Consider the rationals - one can impose a
<br />
uniform measure on these such that the set of all rationals between
<br />
m/n and p/q has measure m=|m/n-p/q|. Then the information content can be
<br />
defined by the usual logarithm C=-log m over all subsets of rationals
<br />
in [0,1]. It would be interesting to know if this has any affect on
<br />
the rest - eg the quantum structure.
<br />
<br />Intuitively, though to restrict the set of strings according to some
<br />
pattern (bit expansions of rationals, computable sequences, etc.)
<br />
seems like adding information (not quite zero information), but this
<br />
may be prejudice.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Obviously I'm departing from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Schmidhuber at that point, and whilst in &quot;Why Occam's Razor&quot; I use
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; term Schmidhuber ensemble to refer to this, in my book I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; distinguish
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; between Schmidhuber's Great Programmer idea
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (which you confuse some time with the UD, I think).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; He does actually dovetail,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; We have discuss this. In the first paper the &quot;great programmer&quot; is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; a dovetailer, and indeed there is nothing in the ASSA approach for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; which dovetailing could play a role.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; No the great programmer writes and runs a dovetailer on er great 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; computer.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ? (what is a great computer? A Macintosh, a PC?, a concrete machine, an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; abstract one ??)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />In Schmidhuber's case, it appears to be concrete. At least that is how
<br />
I read it. Obviously by CT, it matters not whether it is a Mac, PC or
<br />
Univac 1100.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I missed the dovetailer on my first reading, as indeed it doesn't seem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; too important. I suspect the Scvmidhuber intended the dovetailer to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;breathe fire&quot; into the ensemble.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I'm not sure that Schmidhuber accepts arithmetical realism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ? (I have no doubt he accepts it; for example he studies computation in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the limit, he accepts Church thesis, etc.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />AR is not necessary for this. One can manipulate symbols without
<br />
believing they stand for anything. I can use real numbers without
<br />
believing that real numbers actually exist in the world.
<br />
<br />Anyway - if Juergen is still lurking, maybe he can comment. Its too
<br />
hard to suppose exactly what other people implicitly assume.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; His
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ontology is that the great programmer exists, whatever e may be.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; GP is not necessarily a machine, or an arithmetical formula.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That's correct, and that is why the notion of dovetailing does not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; apply to his way of working (and this is a major departure between us).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Well, I hope you are not referring to the notion of &quot;ensemble&quot; as it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; occurs in physical statistics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Not at all! Ensemble is usually used in mathematical terms to refer to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a collection that need not satisfy set axioms.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You mean a set from naïve set theory? Given that we have never 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mentionned even just one axiom of set theory, distinguishing set and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ensemble would be a 1004 fallacy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />We started the ensemble &quot;habit&quot; back when someone pointed out that
<br />
Russell's paradox would apply to a collection of everything, that must
<br />
indeed include itself and all subcollections. Tegmark uses ensemble in
<br />
his '97 paper for instance. I was merely pointing out that my ensemble
<br />
was actually a true set, and the only significance of this is that
<br />
sets are required to apply information theory as it is currently
<br />
formulated. 
<br />
<br />...
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is it a good idea? Should you not say something like &quot;Nothing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Physical&quot;? Saying that &quot;all the strings = nothing&quot; looks like a play 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with words.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There are as many theories of nothing than there are theories of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things. The quantum nothing, to take a famous example, is everything 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but nothing, but can be called a (quantum) nothingness because it has 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an average energy value of zero (well, this is typically false but I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; guess you see my point).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />That idea is more correctly called a vacuum. I agree partially that
<br />
the way I use Nothing is a play on words. One could more accurately
<br />
say say it is a &quot;no-information-thing&quot;, but I would argue that since
<br />
the only things we can sense are &quot;information-things&quot;, dropping the
<br />
the &quot;information&quot; part is justifiable.
<br />
<br />The only other nothing idea I'm aware of is the empty set, which is
<br />
actually related by a dual relationship.
<br />
<br />Of course there are plenty of nonscientific ideas of nothing - but I'd
<br />
prefer to leave those to literature.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Sure there is a lot of confusion on the subject of emergence, so it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; not surprising if there are people &quot;reaching for the gun&quot; when hearing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the term. However, the term actually is quite well defined, and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; way I use it is pretty consistent with what other recent thinkers have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; written, such as Bedau, or Ronald, or Fromm.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes. And personally I prefer when you use &quot;emergence&quot; instead of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; semantiics, which is more involved and has more pecise connatation in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical logic or computer science.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />Does the term &quot;semantic level&quot; (or &quot;semantic layer&quot;) have a meaning in
<br />
semantics? I wasn't aware of one, but I haven't studied semantic
<br />
analysis too much.
<br />
<br />...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I have actually read quite a lot of literature on the subject, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; there aren't any accepted terms for describing the levels of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; description in emergence. I'm trying to propose the semantic/syntactic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; level labels, but you know its a market of ideas out there.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes. Instead of using already known terms, in front of new ideas, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; please  just create your own new terms. Or just use periphrase like 
</em><br />
<br />The point is that the idea is still new enough that there aren't any
<br />
well-known terms.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;the levels of description of emergence&quot;. In fine, if you define 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; clearly your terms, then you can use any terms you want, in principle. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It helps the outside reader if those terms have some known 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; connotations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />Indeed. I do define the terms, and use them consistently. If there
<br />
were well-known terms for the concepts, I would use those instead.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If your theory is 100% scientifically clean, it should work with *any* 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; term (using &quot;coffee&quot; instead of ensemble, &quot;tea&quot; instead of &quot;infinite&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I can do that for string theory (oops, not your strings, but those of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; superstring theory by the physicists), or &quot;my theory&quot; (I mean the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory of the lobian machine, etc. OK this is hard to get, so take this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; remark with a grain of salt .... for a while .... (you can ask me to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explain how to do that in the case of &quot;my theory&quot; or in the case of a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical physical theory (like strings).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now that I am thinking about that the term &quot;string&quot; in the search of a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; TOE is also a quasi copyright type of problem given that you string 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have nothing to do (a priori) with the &quot;bosonic string&quot; or the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; superstring physical theories ....
</em><br />
<br />Indeed. However, my preferred term &quot;description&quot; seemed to cause even
<br />
more problems :(.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Another point where your fuzziness does not help is that you are not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; clear on the comp hyp.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I never assume the comp hyp. I believe comp is consistent with what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I've developed, and note that you can pretty much get the consequences
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of the UDA from a more general functionalist position.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This can be made clear with the UDA and after with the AUDA, where the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reasoning extends to a vast class of non turing emulable (non machine) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entities. The real key here is the notion of self-referential 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correctness. To derive physics from functionalism is an interesting 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; idea, but this is different from deriving the necessity of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; immaterialism from an hypothesis in the cognitive science. I do suspect 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you have something interesting to say (which makes more frustrating 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your incautious use of vocabulary).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Schmidhuber is clear on comp, even if he has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; disagreed when discussing online in the list with the consequences I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; derive from it. But the disagreement comes not from what comp means,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; but from the 1/3 distinction, which Schmidhuber does not consider.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Tegmark does introduce an embryo of 1/3 distinction (but quite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; different from mines (see below)), but Tegmark still uses some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; identity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; thesis implicitly for making observer belonging to universe, and minds
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; to brain. Such identities have just no meaning at all once you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; postulate the comp hyp (or even strong weakening of it btw). OK? (by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; UDA). Yes?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Yes, but there is still some reason tying the observer to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; universe.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In this context &quot;universe&quot; has no non ambiguous meaning at all.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />True, but I usually use it to refer to &quot;what-is-observed&quot;. It would be
<br />
a sequence of observer moments, or a history in other contexts.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Otherwise you get the Occam catastrophe. (again my term, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; others have called it differently) I do not know what that reason is,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; but suspect self-awareness has something to do with it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You really should elaborate.
</em><br />
<br />From my book:
<br />
<br />Whilst in one sense the Anthropic Principle seems obvious, it is
<br />
actually profoundly mysterious. There is no doubt that the Anthropic
<br />
Principle works, and it has passed all experimental tests to date.
<br />
However, one could imagine being born into a virtual reality
<br />
simulator,\index{virtual reality} in the style of the movie {\em
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Matrix},\index{Matrix (the movie)} such that you had no knowledge
<br />
whatsoever of the outside world containing your body\footnote{We might
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;imagine that a ``shunt'' was placed in your spinal column so that no
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;proprioceptive sensations is received by your brain}, nor there
<br />
being any representation of your body within the reality simulated by
<br />
the simulator. In this case, observed reality is not constrained to be
<br />
compatible with your existence. The Anthropic Principle will not apply
<br />
in such worlds.
<br />
<br />By reason of the Occam's razor\index{Occam!razor} theorem
<br />
\S\ref{occam}, we should be born into the simplest possible world, a
<br />
world that would be utterly boring and lifeless. The Anthropic
<br />
Principle prevents this catastrophe (which I call the {\em Occam
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;catastrophe})\index{Occam!catastrophe} by requiring that the world
<br />
be sufficiently complex to support conscious life. Clearly the
<br />
Anthropic Principle is necessary, but why?
<br />
<br />\begin{sloppypar}
<br />
David Deutsch\cite{Deutsch97}\index{Deutsch, David} argues an
<br />
observer\index{observer} trapped within such a virtual
<br />
reality\index{virtual reality} would eventually notice inconsistencies
<br />
in how that reality operates, and thus deduce the existence of a
<br />
larger reality within which the observer is actually situated. John
<br />
Barrow\index{Barrow, John} makes a similar point in his New Scientist
<br />
article {\em Glitch!}\cite{Barrow03}, as does Daniel
<br />
Dennett\index{Dennett, Daniel} in {\em Consciousness
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Explained}\cite{Dennett91}. Considering the case of a virtual
<br />
reality which does not contain the observer, one in which there is no
<br />
supervenience\index{supervenience} of the mind on any physical thing,
<br />
just how might the observer deduce the e was really in a larger
<br />
invisible external reality?
<br />
<br />The only answer it seems to me is self awareness. Descartes said ``I
<br />
think, therefore I am''.\index{Descartes, Ren\'e}\index{I think, therefore I
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;am}\index{Cogito ergo sum} From being aware of one's own mind, one
<br />
can deduce the existence of something outside of the impoverished
<br />
virtual reality of one's experience, be it an immaterial mind, or an
<br />
actual brain for that mind to supervene, assuming supervenience.
<br />
\end{sloppypar}
<br />
<br />We may therefore postulate that self-awareness\index{self-awareness|emph}
<br />
is a necessary property of consciousness.\index{consciousness} This is
<br />
a prediction, potentially falsifiable in the event of a fuller theory
<br />
of consciousness being developed.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Russell, I am just mentioning &quot;vocabulary problems&quot; which could prevent 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; progress for those who want to take computer science /mathematical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logic as a tools, like we have to do once we postulate explicitly comp. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I have realised in Siena that even such a thing as the mundane 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; classical &quot;Church thesis&quot; is not so easy even for logicians, so I know 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that I have to explain that (and probably to write some more papers 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ...).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am just telling that your use of vocabulary will not help to bridge 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the gap between the physicist (not the &quot;physician&quot; 'course (thanks to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Brent)) and the logicians. I hope you manage my short and frank but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; undiplomatical way of being direct.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />I do appreciate your comments, and I'm not in the slightest offended
<br />
by your frankness. Vocabulary differences are indeed a problem,
<br />
particularly when many of the concepts are still new, or not well
<br />
known. Inevitably my terms are flavoured by physics, blending into
<br />
maths and computer science. I do try to be clear in my definitions,
<br />
but if I accidently pick a term that has a well-known meaning in a
<br />
subject I know little about then that can cause problems. I had hoped
<br />
that the wiki project might sort some of these out.
<br />
<br />However, be thankful we're all on the science side of the 2 cultures
<br />
divide. I found it virtually impossible to discuss these ideas with
<br />
someone steeped in the humanties.
<br />
<br />Plus - my main motivation in life is not the &quot;theory of everything&quot; at
<br />
all, but artificial creative processes. In essence I believe in  hard
<br />
ALife and work towards making it a reality. Some of these issues spin
<br />
off into the everything ensemble idea, and so I try to communicate
<br />
them.
<br />
<br />Cheers
