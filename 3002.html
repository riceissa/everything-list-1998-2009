<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; See <a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m2793.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m2793.html</a> for a universal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dovetailer written in LISP. Among the LISP programs you have all the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simulation of Fortran programs, Joel's minimal cellular automata,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; etc.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, this is true.  But (of course :) I would like to argue in favor of
<br />
cellular automata over Turing Machines and even the Universal Dovetailer.
<br />
Somehow, though I can't fully express the idea in my head, they seem more
<br />
&quot;natural&quot; to me... and perhaps more &quot;obvious&quot; to other sentient entities.
<br />
<br />Some of my reasons are as follows...
<br />
<br />Turing Machines usually require many internal states, while CA need only
<br />
two.  TMs also contain a *moving* part - the read/write head, and it's not
<br />
exactly clear how to implement such a gizmo outside of physics, or justify
<br />
such complexity when simpler machines exist.  (Depending on your idea of
<br />
simplicity of course!)
<br />
<br />You could imagine, for example, a cellular automaton that could run a Turing
<br />
Machine with a real read-write head that moved and everything - but with no
<br />
moving parts.  Yes, I know these things are all equivalent, but to me, CA
<br />
require fewer assumptions or explanations.
<br />
<br />Furthermore, Turing Machines tend to slow down as the size of the universe
<br />
grows larger, while cellular automata may be made arbitrarily fast, once the
<br />
synchronization problem is addressed.  (Plamen showed me how this is not too
<br />
difficult to do actually.)
<br />
<br />Finally, CA require no (3rd person) interpretation as to the special
<br />
relationships between bit patterns.  They are represented naturally in the
<br />
geometric cellular space.
<br />
<br />All of this may seem academic really, since we all know that any universal
<br />
computer is as good as any other.  It's kindof like arguing about the kind
<br />
of wood God's stool is made out of!  But there MAY be some reasons to want
<br />
to know exactly which algorithm is really being run on the bottom...
<br />
<br />Because all of these implementations have slight differences as to the core
<br />
informational process they represent.  Yes, they all do the same thing in
<br />
the long run, but the order in which they do things may be different.  And
<br />
if we are anywhere near the &quot;bottom&quot; of it all, then we may be able to take
<br />
advantage of knowing that order.
<br />
<br />For example, suppose we run my cellular automaton and find certain core
<br />
particle interactions that are extremely common.  We might then recognize
<br />
these in a laboratory and better understand conventional physics.
<br />
<br />Ok, that's a really weak argument, since I also believe that this world is
<br />
made up and that its physics is rather arbitrary.
<br />
<br />But.... if it IS made up, and we are SUPPOSED to figure out the workings of
<br />
the automaton, then MAYBE ... the simulation would be made to resemble the
<br />
workings of the machine down below.
<br />
<br />Ok, I'm rambling.  I'll stop.
<br />
<br />Joel
