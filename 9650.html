<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have cut out some of your detailed response to my post where I think we basically agree. There
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; remain some differences, and some failings on my part to understand more technical aspects of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your work.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Memories of our past are generally more vivid and hold more information than writing, film
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; etc., but there may come a time when people directly share memories with each other as easily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; as they now share mp3 files.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Selling, buying, sharing memories belongs to the future of applied bio-information science, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; guess. But still, despite infinite possible progress in that matter, what will always really be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; shared will be numbers and partially similar decoding and interpreting procedures. For example,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the mp3 files contains binary digits, and people share indeed the same first level decoding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; machinery (a Mac, a PC, an ipod, etc.). They does not share the personal experience (ex: for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; one the music will makes him/she recall nice memories, for someone else: only bad memories).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Now you make one step further and share the good/bad memories. This can only partially be done,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and then it will be similar to number-mp3 sharing. To share the first person experience
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; completely you will have to erase memories for maintaining enough (self-) consistency, and you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; will actually fuse the persons. The quantum analog is quantum erasure of information which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; allows interference effects (and thus history-fusion) to (re)appear. The first person itself is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; not first person-self-definable (I will come back on this, but those following the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; diagonalization post can already smell this phenomenon: the collection of all computable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; functions from N to N cannot be enumerated by a computable function).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, sharing the memory is *not* the same as having the original experience, but this applies to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recalling one's own past as well. You may argue that recalling our past is different because we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have just the right brain structure, other associated memories and so on to put it all in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; context, but in principle all of these might be lacking due to illness or the passage of time, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; might be duplicated in a very good simulation made for someone else to experience. The only way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to unambiguously define a first person experience is to make it once only; perfect recollection
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would be indistinguishable from the original experience, and it would be impossible for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiencer to either know that he was recalling a memory or to know how close to the original
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the recollection was. The postulate of a first person entity persisting through time violates the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1st person/ 3rd person distinction, since it assumes that I-now can have 1st person knowledge of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I-yesterday or I-tomorrow, when in fact such knowledge is impossible except in a 3rd person way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I believe it is this confusion which leads to the apparent anomaly of 1st person indeterminacy in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the face of 3rd person determinacy in duplication experiments. Let us assume as little as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible and make our theories as simple as possible. I *have* to accept that there is something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; special about my experiences at the moment which distinguish them from everyone else's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiences: this is the difference between the 1st person POV and the 3rd person POV. It is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tempting to say that my 1st person POV extends into the future and the past as well, explaining
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; why I think of myself as a person persisting through time. However, this latter hypothesis is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unnecessary. It is enough to say that the 1st person POV is valid only in the present, and when I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consider my future and past that is only 3rd person extrapolation. 
</em><br />
<br />Well said!  I agree completely.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;What I consider myself to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as a person is then explained as the set of 1st person experiences related in a particular way,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such as believing themselves to be moments in the life of a single individual, having memories or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quasi-memories in common, and so on. 
</em><br />
<br /><br />But what can that &quot;related in a particular way&quot; be?  It is certainly not the case that I, at every
<br />
moment am experiencing a belief that I'm a single individual.  I cannot think of any 1st person
<br />
experience that is connecting my 1st person moments.  Rather it is something unconscious which I
<br />
&quot;experience&quot; only on reflection, i.e. in a 3rd person way.
<br />
<br />I think this poses a difficulty for a world model consisting only of &quot;observer moments&quot;.  There's
<br />
nothing to connect them.  A model in which there is an external substrate, either the physical world
<br />
or a computer simulation, avoids this problem by providing the unexperienced connection.  Julian
<br />
Barbour proposes a similar model in which the world consists of &quot;time capsules&quot;; each capsule is a
<br />
moment in time.  But these capsules contain much more than a conscious thought; they contain
<br />
something like a state of the world and so they provide enough information to be well ordered.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;If I split into two that presents no problem for the 3rd
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person POV (there are two instantiations of Stathis extant where before there was one) nor for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the 1st person POV (each instantiation knows it is experiencing what it is experiencing as it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiencing it). A problem does arise when I anticipate the split (which one will I become?) or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; look back at the split (*I* was the original!); there is no correct answer in these cases because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it is based on 3rd person extrapolation of the 1st person POV, which in addition to its other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; failings assumes only a single entity can be extant at any one time (only a single 1st person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exists by definition, but multiple 3rd persons can exist at the one time). This is not to say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that my mind can or should overcome [Lee Corbin disagrees on the &quot;should&quot;] the deeply ingrained
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; belief or illusion that I am a unique, one-track individual living my life from start to finish,
</em><br />
<br />It's only an illusion if you assume the &quot;observer moment&quot; model is reality.  In a sense all models
<br />
are &quot;illusions&quot;, but some are better than others and at any given time we might as well tentatively
<br />
take our best model as a representation of reality.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; which is why in symmetrical duplication experiments I anticipate that I will become one of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; duplicates with equal probability. In asymmetrical duplication experiments with partial memory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; loss or merging, it becomes very difficult to know what to expect.
</em><br />
<br />Here you've slipped back into a persisting 1st person view.  It's easy to know what to expect from a
<br />
3rd person view.  The reason the duplication is hard to talk about is that it supposes a view that
<br />
is neither 1st nor 3rd person - we might call it 2nd person.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; It can only be made unambiguous by introducing the third person POV because the &quot;I&quot; refers to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; different tokens/instantiations depending on the stage of the teleportation process: the idea
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; that there is a single &quot;I&quot; persisting through time is an illusion, involving looking at one's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; future or past as if from the 1st person POV when in fact the 1st person POV is necessarily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; tied to a single token/instantiation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; All right then. Except that I am not sure I really agree with the idea that the persisting &quot;I&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is an illusion. Here, it is hard for me not taking account of the main UDA conclusion: the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; reversal physics/bio/compscience/theology/numbers. So let me tell you what I believe, accepting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; comp and the UDA reasoning: The persisting &quot;I&quot; is not an illusion, or is less an illusion than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; its body or time itself. What could also be an illusion is the feeling that &quot;I&quot; and &quot;you&quot; are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  absolutely different, when the difference is only relative.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; See above. Perhaps &quot;illusion&quot; is not the right word. Is a motion picture an illusion? It is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; series of still pictures presented in a particular way giving the effect of motion from the POV
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of a human observer; better to be descriptive than use words like illusion and delusion.
</em><br />
<br />Generally a frame of a motion picture film (including the sound track) has enough information that
<br />
it could be put in order - but not necessarily.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; This is why I say that &quot;I&quot; live only transiently when I am interested in being rigorous,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; while in everyday life I use the pronoun &quot;I&quot; to mean what most people mean by it, and what my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; human-standard psychological makeup tells me it means.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; This is hard matter and I don't expect we will settle this in few posts. I think I see what you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; mean, and at the same time I believe comp forces us to believe in the contrary (but I know this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is strongly counter-intuitive for those who thinks a lot on personal identity and does keep
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; some form of naturalism). The reason is that eventually the first persons will appear to be the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; time and space constructors, and that the first person &quot;I&quot; does not even exists transiently (it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; needs at least two instants!). So here, comp could come back toward common sense: &quot;you&quot; are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; really defining partially and locally a past and a future (or many possible futures) like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; everyday life suggests. Identity is attached (partially) to connected memories, and all what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; matters consists in keeping that connection through the construction of time for consistency
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; purpose. We are not allow to get others' experiences for the same consistency reason, so &quot;I&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; remains invariant to &quot;my&quot; continuous or computable changes, and actually this is what allows us
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  to be teleported or duplicated through comp, with giving the right for all my doppelgangers to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; say consistently that they are all &quot;me&quot;, persisting through those experience/experiments, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; being just accidentally and relatively (in W or M for example) disconnected. I think that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; people, like Lee Corbin, who insists that the W and M doppelgangers are really himself, should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; accept the possibility, at least, that all of us are already the same self, produced by many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; many duplications and multiplications made through our biological history. We are unable to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; recognize ourself as our selves due to other evolutionary factors which apparently did bet on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; some competition among us. Another is some hidden part of oneself, in this setting. It is known
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that hiding information can be a key to learning behavior.
</em><br />
<br />Or it is because our feeling of self is a physical process in our brain and the world really is
<br />
continuous over time (or at least has enough information to be well ordered).
