Dear David,
<br />
(see below.. I left your original text here...
<br />
=====================================================
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4) Belief in 'magical emergence' .... qualitative novelty of a kind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; utterly unrelated to the componentry.
</em><br />
<br />Hi Colin
<br />
<br />I think there's a link here with the dialogue in the 'Asifism' thread
<br />
between Bruno and me. I've been reading Galen Strawson's
<br />
&quot;Consciousness and its place in Nature&quot;, which has re-ignited some of
<br />
the old hoo-hah over 'panpsychism', with the usual attendant
<br />
embarrassment and name-calling. It motivated me to try to unpack the
<br />
basic semantic components that are difficult to pin down in these
<br />
debates, and for this reason tend to lead to mutual incomprehension.
<br />
<br />Strawson refers to the 'magical emergence' you mention, and what is in
<br />
his view (and mine) the disanalogy of 'emergent' accounts of
<br />
consciousness with, say, how 'liquidity' supervenes on molecular
<br />
behaviour. So I started from the question: what would have to be the
<br />
case at the 'component' level for such 'emergence' to make sense (and
<br />
I'm aiming at the semantics here, not 'ultimate truth', whatever that
<br />
might be). My answer is simply that for 'sensing' and 'acting' to
<br />
'emerge' (i.e. supervene on) some lower level, that lower level must
<br />
itself 'sense' and 'act' (or 'grasp', a word that can carry the
<br />
meaning of both).
<br />
<br />What sense does it make to say that, for example, sub-atomic
<br />
particles, strings, or even Bruno's numbers, 'grasp' each other?
<br />
Well, semantically, the alternative would be that they would shun and
<br />
ignore each other, and we wouldn't get very far on that basis. They
<br />
clearly seem to relate according to certain 'rules', but we're not so
<br />
naive (are we?) as to suppose that these are actually 'laws' handily
<br />
supplied from some 'external' domain. Since we're talking 'primitives
<br />
here', then such relating, such mutual 'grasping', must just *be*.
<br />
There's nothing wrong conceptually here, we always need an axiomatic
<br />
base, the question is simply where to situate it, and semantically IMO
<br />
the buck stops here or somewhere closely adjacent.
<br />
<br />The cool thing about this is, that if we start from such primitive
<br />
'grasping', then higher-level emergent forms of full sense-action can
<br />
now emerge organically by (now entirely valid) analogy with purely
<br />
action-related accounts such as liquidity, or for that matter, the
<br />
emergence of living behaviour from 'dead matter'. And the obvious
<br />
complexity of the relation between, say quantum mechanics and, say,
<br />
the life cycle of the sphex wasp, should alert us to an equivalent
<br />
complexity in the relationship between primitive 'grasp' and its fully
<br />
qualitative (read: participatory) emergents - so please let's have no
<br />
(oh-so-embarrassing) 'conscious electrons' here.
<br />
<br />Further, it shows us in what way 'software consciousness' is
<br />
disanalogous with the evolved kind. A computer, or a rock for that
<br />
matter, is of course also a natural emergent from primitive grasping,
<br />
and this brings with it sense-action, but in the case of these objects
<br />
more action than sense at the emergent level. The software level of
<br />
description, however, is merely an imputation, supplied externally
<br />
(i.e. by us) and imposed as an interpretation (one of infinitely many)
<br />
on the fundamental grasped relations of the substrate components. By
<br />
contrast, the brain (and here comes the research programme) must have
<br />
evolved (crucially) to deploy a supremely complex set of 'mirroring'
<br />
processes that is (per evolution) genuinely emergent from the
<br />
primitive 'grasp' of the component level.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From this comes (possibly) the coolest consequence of these semantics:
</em><br />
our intrinsic 'grasp' of our own motivation (i.e. will, whether 'free'
<br />
or not), our participative qualitative modalities, the relation of our
<br />
suffering to subsequent action, and so forth, emerge as indeed
<br />
'something like' the primitive roots from which they inherit these
<br />
characteristics. This is *real* emergence, not magical, and at one
<br />
stroke demolishes epiphenomenalism, zombies, uploading fantasies and
<br />
all the other illusory consequences of confusing the 'external
<br />
world' (i.e. a projection) with the participatory one in which we are
<br />
included.
<br />
<br />===========================================
<br />
Methinks you 'get it'. You are far more eloquent than I am, but we talk of
<br />
the same thing..
<br />
<br />Liquidity is to H2O
<br />
as
<br />
&lt;&lt;&lt;???&gt;&gt;&gt; is to consciousness (qualia)
<br />
<br />where I identify &lt;&lt;&lt;???&gt;&gt;&gt; as a &quot;necessary primitive&quot; and comment that
<br />
'computation' or 'information' or 'complexity' have only the vaguest of an
<br />
arm waving grip on any claim to such a specific role. Such is the 'magical
<br />
emergence' genre.
<br />
<br />I have a viable candidate for the 'necessary primitive' of the kind you
<br />
seek. Note that regardless of what anyone's suggestion  for such a thing
<br />
might be, the process of declaring it valid must arise in the form of (as
<br />
you intuit above) an axiom. That is, it must come in the form of a
<br />
statement such as
<br />
<br />X = &quot;It is a fundamental principle of the natural world that &lt;&lt;&lt; such and
<br />
such a thing&gt;&gt; is the ultimate necessary primitive state of affairs that
<br />
must be the case for consciousness to a) deliver a faculty of observation
<br />
at all and then b) for biological delivery that, when observing its own
<br />
processes delivering observation, looks like brain material when that it
<br />
is happening and NOT when it isn't&quot;
<br />
<br />This is the generic form of the kind of 'fundamental principle' that
<br />
Chalmers called for in his 1996 book. You cannot escape the reality of
<br />
some form of X, regardless of &lt;&lt;&lt;such and such a thing&gt;&gt;. In terms of X:
<br />
<br />liquidity is to H2O
<br />
as
<br />
The property X  is to consciousness (qualia)
<br />
<br />Such a statement, in one fell swoop, eliminates the
<br />
circularity/self-fulfilment of the magical emergence kind...that which I
<br />
have been at pains to point out (dialog with Russel) is inherent at
<br />
multiple levels in the 'computationalist' or 'eliminativist' or
<br />
'functionalist' or 'representationalist' flavours of magical emergence. A
<br />
principle of the kind X must exist or we wouldn't be having this
<br />
discussion. There is no way to characterise explanation through magical
<br />
emergence that enables empirical testing. Not even in principle. They are
<br />
impotent at all prediction. You adopt the position and the whole job is
<br />
done and is a matter of belief = NOT SCIENCE.
<br />
<br />Remaining at the 'meta' level of general discussion of statements of the
<br />
kind X, we can make a couple of important observations:
<br />
1) X must be consistent with all empirical (neuroscience/cognitive) evidence.
<br />
2) X must at least in principle be able to make verifiable novel
<br />
predictions of the natural world critically dependent on X being the case.
<br />
<br />If it cannot do this then it is not viable. If it can make even ONE then
<br />
it is a better proposition than magical emergence.
<br />
<br />Note there is a unique character to X that is unlike anything science has
<br />
ever encountered. Direct evidence for X is not any specific observation.
<br />
It is the cause of the mere possibility of any observation at all. As I
<br />
have said in previous posts.... &quot;that which is seen (contents of
<br />
consciousness) is our traditional demanded source of explicit scientific
<br />
evidence. However...&quot;Seeing&quot; (any observation/consciousness at all) is
<br />
intrinsic/implicit evidence of the existence of circumstances that
<br />
necessarily exist or no explicit observation would exist. Every explicit
<br />
act of scientific observation also delivers implicit evidence of an
<br />
ability to observe. In other words evidence of the lack of qualia is the
<br />
failure to observe.
<br />
<br />The only third party verifyable circumstance where failure to observe can
<br />
be counted as evidence is in the failure of the scientific act. Hence my
<br />
insistence that science and the scientific act be the evidentiary
<br />
circumstances of a viable empirical science directed at proving X.
<br />
<br />Other than this strangeness (scientists themselves are evidence), the
<br />
process is just like any other scientific process. Business as usual.
<br />
<br />If Galen Strawson is setting fire to the magical emergence camp....GOOD!
<br />
<br />I have an X proposition that delivers what looks like panpsychism, but
<br />
isn't actually....well... if X is a principle that applies universally
<br />
(something that exists at all spatial scales... inherent in the whole
<br />
universe) and is intrinsic, logically unavoidable and implicit...then does
<br />
that count as panpsychism? I don't know. Frankly I don't care!...X is a
<br />
member of the class &quot;Law of Physics&quot;. Where it fits philosophically is
<br />
someone else's problem. Not such characterisation has any impact on the
<br />
empirical work... and I am fiendishly empirical to the bitter end...
<br />
<br />Before I re-deliver my X... I'd like to leave the discussion at the META-X
<br />
level (about any X or about all possible Xs)....over to you....
<br />
<br />cheers
