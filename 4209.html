The correspondent with that mystical name touched an interesting problem
<br />
(earlier appearing in Hale's and Tim's posts): emergence.
<br />
Colin Hales:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Our main gripe is the issue of emergent behaviour and the &gt;mathematical
</em><br />
treatment thereof? Yes?&lt;
<br />
(Tim's post see below).
<br />
<br />I have an indecent opinion of this concept: it is &quot;human ignorance&quot;.
<br />
Let me explain.
<br />
As long as we cannot qualify the steps in a 'process' leading to the
<br />
&quot;emerged&quot; new, we call it emergence, later we call it process.
<br />
Just look back into the cultural past, how many emergence-mystiques
<br />
(miracles included) changed into regular quotidien processes, simply by
<br />
developing &quot;more&quot; information about them.
<br />
I did not say: &quot;the&quot; information.  Some.
<br />
<br />The world as we know about it, consists of models which the mind
<br />
(who's-ever or what's-ever) was capable to construct at a given level of the
<br />
development.
<br />
The natural systems are unconscionably broader and the undisclosed
<br />
(undetected, or just not included) effects play roles in the processes.
<br />
Reductionism closes her limiting/ed eye on such unwanted and
<br />
ununderstandable side-shows and their mathematical treatment as well, since
<br />
the latter is slanted towards the same level of development as is the
<br />
construction of the models considered.
<br />
<br />Why can we not deduce an emergence from our known preriquisites?
<br />
There are  two sides to the reasons:
<br />
<br />Principally:
<br />
Becuase the happenings in nature (I use the word in its broadest sense, like
<br />
existence, or multiverse) are inductive and by deductive thinking we cannot
<br />
reach an induction.
<br />
Practically:
<br />
By churning reasults from the cut-off parts we included into our model we
<br />
cannot reach 'conclusions' including the &quot;rest of it&quot;.
<br />
So we call it emergence with awe.
<br />
<br />In Tim's example the watch is a mechanism, made from just that many parts
<br />
for a designed function included in its manufacturing purpose.
<br />
The cell? similarly a mechanism, but under the influence of more than we can
<br />
calculate. Biology cuts its interest to a domain so far studied and
<br />
discovered. From time to time new information occurs and the image changes.
<br />
Who can predict such &quot;emergences&quot; of the coming centuries in the human
<br />
epistemic enrichment?
<br />
Evolution follows the environmental influences (called pressures) of a wider
<br />
involvement than what our 'present' cognitive inventory can cover . (Any
<br />
'present' of course).
<br />
All kinds of variations occur instead of repetitions and selectively
<br />
survive.
<br />
So do societal changes in organizations, human and other (biosphere,
<br />
body/health, cosmic history, etc. etc.).
<br />
<br />I wonder if mathematics can 'predict' the outcome of such 'emergences' which
<br />
are subject to unlimited variables unknown and their interchanging
<br />
influential efficiency upon a substrate, the total extent of which is also
<br />
unknown, way beyond (the known limitations of) the model we talk about.
<br />
Of course, a TOE may calculate this, but only a &quot;real&quot; one which includes
<br />
and handles all these (limitless) unknown I/O factors in its organized
<br />
mathematical performance.

Subject: emergence
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hi all. in a recent msg I talked about emergence as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a theme for the algorithmic revolution &amp; CH zooms in &amp; comments on that,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; spurring some more of my thoughts.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this is a very tricky idea that I feel I definitely have not wrapped
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my own brain around, nor has anyone else. but, imho, its a genuinely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; new idea. &quot;emergence&quot; as a buzzword does seem to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be a key element of a new TOE &amp; the algorithmic revolution.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; flash: &quot;emergence&quot; is the opposite of reductionism. just as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the 20th century and most of all prior science is about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reductionism, we can now study emergence. perhaps that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will be a key theme of 21st century science, physics, etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the algorithm/computer is the breakthrough new tool that allows
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; us to study emergence.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emergence &lt;=&gt; reductionism are not mutually exclusive.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; its a feedback loop, a dichotomy, a bohrian complementarity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the forest versus the trees.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematics underlies both, but in a different sense. the approaches
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &amp; techniques are different. emergence tends to be a more qualitative
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than quantitative picture, rules or equations that one can write down
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but not so easily derive from the basic principles of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; system.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; also, the clockwork universe theme seems to encourage reductionism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whereas maybe the algorithmical metaphor encourages &quot;emergencism&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what is emergence? its a very loaded word. we all pretty much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; feel we understand &quot;reductionism&quot; probably, but emergence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is a new concept. I would argue its being defined as we speak
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &amp; that science is coming to grips with an accurate definition.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perhaps people here will contribute to that definition.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my favorite examples of emergence that Ive noticed recently
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &amp; can expand on if there is interest.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - I have a web site that catalogs over 4000 known gliders for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the game of life. **breathtaking**. can you predict these given
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the life rules? or how about, find a theory that predicts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the gliders from a given set of rules?? this ties in with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a brilliant proof that rule 110 is a universal TM, mentioned
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in wolframs book, which is very much oriented around glider
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics of the rule.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - oscillons. emergent behavior from many particles. a picture
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is worth a thousand words. check em out. still under the radar
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of just about everyone, but a quite exquisitely beautiful
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; example. I believe it will be shown to predict all particle
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dynamics in the not-too-distant future.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - fractals. another good metaphor for emergence. who would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; predict the equation z &lt;- z^2 + c could lead to such incredible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; artwork &amp; tapestries. cosmic.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - robotics. imagine the aibo software, and then how that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; software animates the bot. and imagine putting aibos together.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the behavior is emergent, unpredictable, intelligent, dynamic.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - the cyberspace web. thriving, pulsing, growing, changing,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constantly. all built out of basic building blocks like HTML,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; HTTP, apache servers, microsoft, whatever.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - biology. ecosystems. parasites &lt;=&gt; hosts. predator &lt;=&gt; prey
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; etcetera. biologists are just now starting to get an idea
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of how the whole fabric is woven together. a zillion interactions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unexpected findings.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - graph theory is now starting to study &quot;small world graphs&quot; which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have many extraordinary properties entailing emergence (&quot;six degrees
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of separation&quot;). several new books on the subject.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a buzzword in the making.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and so on!! so I am out of ideas at the moment
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; until someone else says something else..
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
