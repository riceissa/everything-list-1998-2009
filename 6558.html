I was using the term &quot;information&quot; loosely, to include what is commonly 
<br />
termed qualia, subjective experience etc. I agree that if a physical system 
<br />
is fully specified, then that is all you need in order to duplicate or 
<br />
emulate the system. The new system will do everything the original one did, 
<br />
including have conscious experiences. It's worth stressing this point again: 
<br />
you don't need any special, non-physical information to emulate or duplicate 
<br />
a conscious system; you don't need God to provide it with a soul, you don't 
<br />
need to purchase a mind-body interface kit, you don't need to meditate and 
<br />
wave quartz crystals around, and you don't need to have 1st person knowledge 
<br />
of its subjective experiences. All you need is a few kilograms of raw 
<br />
materials, a molecular assembler mechanism, and the data which indicates 
<br />
where each bit goes. Once the job is finished, you automatically have a 
<br />
system which talks, eats, and is conscious. Psychology and biology have been 
<br />
reduced to physics and chemistry. Consciousness has been shown to be just be 
<br />
an emergent phenomenon in a particular type of biological computer. Agree so 
<br />
far? OK: having said all that, and assuming at this point that we know the 
<br />
position and function of every atom in this newly created system, I *still* 
<br />
would wonder what it feels like to actually *be* this system. My curiosity 
<br />
could only be satisfied if I were in fact the duplicated system myself; 
<br />
perhaps this could be achieved if I &quot;became one&quot; with the
<br />
new system by direct neural interface. I don't have to go to such lengths to 
<br />
learn about the new system's mass, volume, behaviour, or any other property, 
<br />
and in *this* consists the essential difference between 1st person and 3rd 
<br />
person experience. You can minimise it and say it doesn't really make much 
<br />
practical difference, but I don't think you can deny it.

<br />--Stathis Papaioannou
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From Lee Corbin:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Jonathan contrasts descriptions and what the descriptions describe:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Stathis: Your post suggests to me a neat way to define what is special
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; about first person experience: it is the gap in information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; between what can be known from a description of an object and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; what can be known from being the object itself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But how can &quot;being an object&quot; provide any extra information? I don't see
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that information or knowledge has much to do with it. How can &quot;being an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; apple&quot; provide any extra information about the apple?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Let's remember some naive answers here. First, for a fixed physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;object, there exist infinitely many descriptions. It's a common
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;belief that beyond a certain amount of accuracy, differences don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;really matter. For example, one ought to be quite happy to teleport
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;even if there is one atomic error for every 10^20 atoms.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Second, a common interpretation of QM asserts that beyond a certain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;accuracy, there is *no* additional information to be had whatsoever.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;That is, that there exists some finite bit string that contains
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;*all* an object's information (cf. Bekenstein bound).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Still, the naive answer is that a description (or even a set of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;descriptions) of a physical object is different from the physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;object itself: a physical object is a process, and a set of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;descriptions is merely a set of bits frozen in time (and here
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;we are back again, you know where).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;However, I hold with these &quot;naive&quot; answers, as do a lot of people.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;And so therefore I proceed to answer the above question thusly:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;Being an apple&quot; provides *no* information beyond that which would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be provided by a sufficiently rich description. Even if an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;emulation of a person appreciating the sublime, or agonizing to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a truly horrific extent, or whatever----no information obtains
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;anywhere that is not in principle available to the experimenters,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;i.e., available from the third-person.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;You could make the experimenter *hurt*, and then say, &quot;now you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;know what it feels like&quot;, and given today's techniques, that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;might very well be true. But this is only a limitation on what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is known and knowable today; it says nothing about what might be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;knowable about a human subject of 20th century complexity to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;entities living a thousand years from now.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(We ignore the possible effects on the experimenter's value
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;system, or possible effects on his incentives: we are just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;talking about information as bit-strings, here.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Obviously there is a difference between *an apple* and *a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; description of an apple*, in the same way there is a difference
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; between *a person* and *a description of a person*, but the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; difference is one of physical existence, not information.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Yeah, that's the way it seems to me too.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
