I don't know what could be more enjoyable than exploring an ensemble
<br />
theory or aggregate model of the Universe. I just want to point out that
<br />
it may not be necessary to consider all conceivable mathematical or
<br />
physical systems.

&lt;&lt;  We can find ourselves ONLY in those structures that obey physical

rational beings (SAS). The assumption that worlds with (rational)
<br />
physical laws are  more more numerous than those without is therefore
<br />
unwarranted.  In fact I would believe in the opposite. That the worlds
<br />
without rational physical laws, (if these could be called worlds at
<br />
all), are more numerous than those with rational physical laws.
<br />
<br />I just would add that there may not be more than one set of rational
<br />
physical laws which apply everywhere. I would not expect multiple
<br />
mathematical systems distinct or separate from a single aggregate
<br />
mathematical system of nature. Existence I expect has a math itself and
<br />
any system, mathematical, physical, or temporal, is sub-content of that
<br />
one system or nature.
<br />
<br />We might consider the possibility that an extension of mathematical
<br />
logic and a sort of extended reality emerges inside unique temporal
<br />
frameworks, creating reason or consistency, subject to how each temporal
<br />
framework is configured. Still, all such worlds share a common
<br />
foundation by existing.
<br />
<br />Someone mentioned Descartes, I think therefore I am. Within many ways we
<br />
can interpret the phrase, such as the meaning of 'I think' or 'I am', is
<br />
the simple recognition that 'something exists'. Any mathematical system,
<br />
any set of physical laws, is subject to whatever natural laws govern
<br />
basic existence, i.e. the nature of the Universe of universes.
<br />
<br />Ultimately I believe the solution is to recognize that what is possible
<br />
defines what is actual, or even, what is possible 'is' what is actual. I
<br />
would expect those involved in this group to be thinking along those
<br />
lines already. So my question is, can there be subsystems where what is
<br />
real or where physical laws break the laws of another system? If the
<br />
most basic construction or foundational elements of the system are
<br />
changed, (i.e. mass, density, number of spatial dimensions in our
<br />
system) then systems would only relate in what is common to both. Laws
<br />
would change accordingly, as each exists in one ultimate system.

<br />One of the biggest problems is that in Relativity, there is no well

one's frame of reference.
<br />
<br />You've probably seen where Tegmark maps spatial and temporal dimensions
<br />
to consider which are possible real systems. Fascinating objective, to
<br />
recognize how space-time relates to the set of all possible worlds.
<br />
Perhaps, as we remove ourselves from our position in time, working
<br />
toward a God's eye view, we need to suspend thinking of time as an
<br />
elementary dimension. Said another way, see the universe as if  there is
<br />
one common moment of &quot;now&quot; for everyone and everything.
<br />
<br />So I personally prefer to abandon time and use mass or density as a
<br />
dimension. Please let me know, anyone, a good reason not to consider an
<br />
ensemble theory, a description of all possible states or worlds, first,
<br />
without time as a dimension.
<br />
<br />Anyone can imagine the first three dimensions of space without time.
<br />
Consider a model of possible states by adding density into each
<br />
dimension. Along a plane, or in ONE dimension, the range of value for
<br />
density is from zero to infinite (the values of an ordinary mathematical
<br />
plane).
<br />
<br />Notice two extreme states, infinite density and zero density. There
<br />
should be no objection to zero density if you suspend time.
<br />
<br />In TWO dimensions we have to keep in mind we are modeling all that is
<br />
possible of density and space. Adding a second dimension of space
<br />
creates a 2D spectrum of patterns. The diagram below will help:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.everythingforever.com/F-TIME.GIF">http://www.everythingforever.com/F-TIME.GIF</a>
<br />
<br />At either ends of the spectrum there remains isolated extremes, singular
<br />
possible states of infinite and zero density, but at every other measure
<br />
of density there is more than one possible pattern or configuration. The
<br />
number of states actually diverges away from infinite density, gets fat,
<br />
and then it converges toward zero, the two singular patterns.
<br />
<br />It might help to imagine a flat network of lights. There are
<br />
configurations of 'all on', 'all off', and an infinite number of
<br />
variations if the individual lights are variable in intensity. So the
<br />
set of all possible 2D patterns is infinite yet bordered by extremes.
<br />
<br />Adding a third dimension only further expands the cardinal measure of
<br />
unique possible patterns. The model of possible states itself becomes 3D
<br />
and is still given shape by two extremes, zero and infinite. This is why
<br />
I claim that the set of all possibilities is infinite yet bordered by
<br />
extremes.
<br />
<br />The next step would be to consider that such spaces actually exist. And
<br />
also recognize that within such a set exists all the patterns from which
<br />
any possible temporal world would necessarily utilize or possibly even
<br />
be constructed from. Any temporal system would be secondary to a
<br />
non-temporal existence, that is, if all possible worlds exist.
<br />
<br />I myself believe time is actually space, 4D space, or a series of space
<br />
worlds, and I believe quantum mechanics is purely the side effect of our
<br />
passing through many static spaces as what we call time progresses.
<br />
Feynman described time as a direction in space. I describe time as a
<br />
direction through spaces. The model reflects this similar to Tegmarks
<br />
diagram of possible space/time dimensions.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.everythingforever.com/4Dspace.jpg">http://www.everythingforever.com/4Dspace.jpg</a>
<br />
<br />Its not really difficult to imagine 4D space. We can imagine all the
<br />
directions possible in a 3D space. With a little imagination we can
<br />
think of a 3D series of spaces that are bonded together to produce an
<br />
added dimension of directions called time (consider that we use frames
<br />
or static images in film work to imitate time). As I understand this
<br />
aggregate set of spaces, each space is individually defined (finite)
<br />
simply existing in nature, yet the set is not otherwise divided apart.
<br />
thus there exists a fourth dimension of directions, within each space,
<br />
directions that pass through the aggregate set creating time as we know
<br />
it. I expect the idea is new to everyone, but the justification for the
<br />
theory honestly adds up.
<br />
<br />I propose three other related theories, such as a mathematical system
<br />
where positive and negative values combine rather than cancel, and a
<br />
theory that there isn't simply order and disorder along an axis, but
<br />
rather two kinds of order in nature, (relating to infinite density and
<br />
zero density) and I show that the order of one is the disorder of the
<br />
other.
