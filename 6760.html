<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why pick any other measure? Well, suppose y = x^2. Then y is also between

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 0 and 1. But if we pick a uniform measure for x, the measure on y is

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non-uniform (y is more likely to be less than 0.5). If you pick a uniform 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure on y, then x = sqrt(y) also has a non-uniform measure (more likely 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to be &gt; 0.5).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A measure like this works for the continuum but not for the naturals 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because you can map the continuum onto a finite segment of the real line.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In m6511 Russell Standish describes how a measure can be applied to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; naturals which can't be converted into a probability. I must say, I'm not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; completely sure what that would be good for.
</em><br />
<br />I think it still makes sense to take limits over the integers.
<br />
The fraction of integers less than n that is prime has a limit of 0
<br />
as n goes to infinity.  The fraction that are even has a limit of 1/2.
<br />
And so on.
<br />
<br />When you apply a measure to the whole real line, it has to be non-uniform
<br />
and has to go asymptotically to zero as you go out to infinity.
<br />
This happens implicitly when you map it to (0,1) even before you put
<br />
a measure on that segment.  The same thing can be done to integers.
<br />
The universal distribution assigns probability to every integer such
<br />
that they all add to 1.  The probability of an integer is based on the
<br />
length of the smallest program in a given Universal Turing Machine which
<br />
outputs that integer.  Specifically it equals the sum of 1/2^l where
<br />
l is the length of each program that outputs the integer in question.
<br />
Generally this will give higher measure to smaller numbers, although a few
<br />
big numbers will have relatively high measure if they have small programs
<br />
(i.e. if they are &quot;simple&quot;).  Of course this measure is non-uniform and
<br />
goes asymptotically to zero, as any probability measure must.
<br />
<br />One problem with the UD is that the probability that an integer is even
<br />
is not 1/2, and that it is prime is not zero.  Probabilities in general
<br />
will not equal those defined based on limits as in the earlier paragraph.
<br />
It's not clear which is the correct one to use.
<br />
<br />Going back to Alistair's example, suppose we lived in a spatially infinite
<br />
universe, Tegmark's &quot;level 1&quot; multiverse.  Of course our entire Hubble
<br />
bubble is replicated an infinite number of times, to any desired degree
<br />
of precision.  Hence we have an infinite number of counterparts.
<br />
<br />Do you see a problem in drawing probabilistic conclusions from this?
<br />
Would it make a difference if physics were ultimately discrete and all
<br />
spatial positions could be described as integers, versus ultimately
<br />
continuous, requiring real numbers to describe positions?
<br />
<br />Note that in this case we can't really use the UD or a line-segment
<br />
measure because there is no natural starting point which distinguishes the
<br />
&quot;origin&quot; of space.  We can't have a non-uniform measure in a homogeneous
<br />
space, unless we just pick an origin arbitrarily.  So in this case the
<br />
probability-limit concept seems most appropriate.
