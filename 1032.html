<br />
One of the problems with interpreting Sherlock Holmes as real is how to
<br />
do so in a quantitative way.
<br />
<br />We can agree that Sherlock Holmes and other fictional characters exist
<br />
in some universe.  However, the universe in which they exist is probably
<br />
a rather unlikely one, more so than our own.  Although sometimes people
<br />
say &quot;truth is stranger than fiction&quot;, I think the opposite is true.
<br />
Fictional worlds are often stranger and less lawful than our own.
<br />
<br />In this particular case, it would be very difficult for a person to
<br />
have the range of knowledge and deductive skills of a Sherlock Holmes.
<br />
He leaps to conclusions that very often turn out to be correct, with
<br />
what seems to be insufficient data.  He turns out to be an expert on
<br />
a variety of minutia which is perfectly relevant to the cases he needs
<br />
to solve.  He is simply an unlikely character, and he therefore lives
<br />
in an unlikely universe.
<br />
<br />The problem arises when we want to say that he lives, to some extent,
<br />
in our own universe as well.  By creating these fictions about Holmes
<br />
(or even, presumably, by simply thinking about Holmes and other unlikely
<br />
characters), Hans seems to say that they thereby come to exist in our
<br />
universe too, in some sense.
<br />
<br />The question is whether this makes Sherlock Holmes a more likely character
<br />
in the context of the multiple-universe model.  And specifically, in the
<br />
context of the Self-Selection Assumption, would it make it more likely
<br />
that someone might find themself to be Sherlock Holmes.
<br />
<br />Without this possibility, we would say that the chance of finding oneself
<br />
to be Sherlock Holmes, or any character who lives in a universe whose
<br />
rules and laws are as weak as in fantastic fiction, is very small.
<br />
We could in theory enumerate the many loopholes and exceptions which
<br />
would have to be embedded in the universe description in order to allow
<br />
the necessary bizarre events to happen to this character, and this would
<br />
give an idea of just how small the likelihood is.
<br />
<br />But if Holmes also exists in our universe, to some extent, then we
<br />
need to give a boost to the probability of finding oneself as Holmes.
<br />
And more generally, we need to give a boost to the probability of finding
<br />
oneself in a relatively lawless universe, if any fictional consideration
<br />
of such a universe in a high-probability, simple, lawful universe gives
<br />
additional measure to the fictional one.  We would need to know what kind
<br />
of quantitative enhancement was appropriate when this kind of fictional
<br />
enactment occurs.  So any theory along these lines needs to be made more
<br />
specific before we can consider it as in any sense testable.
<br />
<br />It might be that fictional considerations of characters like Holmes add
<br />
only an infinitisimal amount to his overall presence in the multiverse,
<br />
even though our universe is a relatively high-probability one.  But if
<br />
we were to say that Holmes' life as described in the corpus of books
<br />
about him is sufficiently detailed as to make him &quot;almost real&quot;, then
<br />
we have a harder time explaining why we all don't find ourselves as
<br />
Holmes-like characters.  It makes a difference in our understanding and
<br />
explanation of why the universe seems lawful.
<br />
