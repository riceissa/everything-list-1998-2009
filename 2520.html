<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     I disagree on two counts.  First, I don't consider self-consistency

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;honest, I consider a goal reasonable only if it is not too different from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;my own goals.  It is only this type of goal that I am interested in.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;That's fine, but when most people say &quot;reasonable&quot; the *reason* is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;just similarity to one's own beliefs.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I disagree.  This is an empirical question - what *do most people* mean 
<br />
- so we would need to take some kind of survey to find out.  And it would 
<br />
have to be carefully done, because while they might claim not to mean it if 
<br />
just asked, I believe that they secretly will mean exactly that.  I am just 
<br />
more honest about it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     Second, there is no way of knowing whether you are in a so called 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;real world&quot; or in a &quot;virtual world&quot;.  So if I don't care about &quot;virtual&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;people, I don't even know whether or not I care about myself.  That doesn't 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;seem reasonable to me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;That's right, you don't know which world you are in. The proposal I made 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;was to consider your actions to affect all worlds that you can be in. But 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you may not care about some of those worlds, in which case you just don't 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;take the effects of your actions on them into account when making your 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;decisions.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it remains the case that you don't know whether or not you care 
<br />
about yourself, and that doesn't seem reasonable to me.  Shall we go to your 
<br />
&quot;most people&quot; standard on this one as well?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     &quot;Evolution&quot; is just the process that leads to the measure 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;distribution. (Conversely, those who don't believe in an absolute measure 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;distribution have no reason to expect Darwin to appear in their world to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have been correct.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I do believe in an absolute measure distribution, but my point is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;evolution probably does not favor those whose utility function are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;just functions on the measure distribution.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I think it does.  To find out, we're going to need to simulate 1000 
<br />
Earth-like planets at the subatomic level.  Who's got a big computer?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     Also, I disagree that caring about others (regardless of who they 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are) is not likely to be &quot;popular&quot;.  In my speculation, it's likely to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;occur in intelligent species that divide into groups, and then merge back 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;into one group peacefully.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Soon we may have AIs or uploaded human minds (i.e. human minds scanned and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;then simulated in computers). It seems to me that those who don't care 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;about simulated thoughts would have an advantage in exploiting these beings 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;more effectively. I'm not saying that is a good thing, of course.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You're assuming that the AIs couldn't fight back.  With technology 
<br />
improving, they might be exploiting us soon.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think that, 150 years ago, white people who didn't care about 
<br />
blacks had an evolutionary advantage?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I also value knowledge as an end in itself, but the problems is how do you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;know what is true knowledge? If you don't judge knowledge by how effective 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it is in directing your actions, what do you judge it by,
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Occam's razor.  It's effective in directing actions, but that's really 
<br />
just a side effect.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Also, there's no way to judge how effective something is in directing 
<br />
actions, unless you already have some means of judging what the truth is!)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's also possible that just because something is effective, it doesn't 
<br />
mean it's true!  For example, people usually ascribe human-like emotions to 
<br />
dogs.  This leads to an ability to predict dog behavior.  Yet many experts 
<br />
believe that dog owners are often fooling themselves, and the predictions 
<br />
work for other reasons.  Dog reasons.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;and how do you defend those criteria against others who would use different 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;criteria?
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luckily, it is effective, so those who depart too much tend to die off.  
<br />
That still leaves a large group of semi-Occamites who use it selectively 
<br />
only.  These you just have to make fun of.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a postulate, sure.  All foundational beliefs are unprovable and 
<br />
ultimately come down to the brain's intuition.  If a=b, and b=c, then a=c is 
<br />
an example.  For those who don't believe it, I can offer no argument (other 
<br />
than repeating the word &quot;obvious&quot; over and over).  That doesn't mean I'm 
<br />
going to stop believing it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Even if you study science only out of curiousity, you can still choose
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;what to believe based on how theoretically effective it would be in making 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;decisions.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, and neither could you do so ever for any reason.  (Since you'd first 
<br />
need to know how to judge effectiveness.  I guess you could postulate some 
<br />
arbritrary method for that, though.  No joke; some people on this list think 
<br />
that quantum suicide is useful, remember?)  It's all based on Occam's razor 
<br />
(and other postulates, like the a=b=c thing).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, you'd need a lot of data to judge the effectiveness of a 
<br />
belief (even with Occam's razor).  No one has that much in most cases unless 
<br />
they also can just use Occam's razor directly.  I'd like to see a 
<br />
counterexample; I doubt one is possible.
