<br /><br />I am not sure what do you mean exactly.
<br />
Today, the concrete universal machines are still very primitive, if  
<br />
not already too much enslaved (full of non universal programs).
<br />
<br />So the existing &quot;interview&quot; is still part of mathematical logic  
<br />
exclusively. It is known today as the logic of provability, or the  
<br />
logic of consistency, or the logic of self-reference.
<br />
The notion of self-reference is the natural third person notion of  
<br />
self-reference as defined by Gödel in his 1931 paper. It applies to  
<br />
very general notions of self-referential entity, not just machine. But  
<br />
I I limit myself on correct machines.
<br />
May be you could study the second part of the sane04 paper, and help  
<br />
yourself with an introductory book on the subject like the book by  
<br />
Raymond Smullyan &quot;Forever Undecided&quot;, but you may need some taste in  
<br />
logic.
<br />
<br />Textbooks exist like Boolos 1979 (which has been reedited), Boolos  
<br />
1993, and Smorynski 1985. You will find the reference in my Lille PhD  
<br />
thesis. Those books assumed some knowledge of mathematical logic. Good  
<br />
books are Elliot Mendelson (many editions), or the book by Boolos,  
<br />
Burgess and Jeffrey.
<br />
<br />Have you follow the seventh step series, or the older but recent UDA  
<br />
and MGA threads? I am actually explaining the math from scratch needed  
<br />
to understand the seventh step, which is the step where the Universal  
<br />
Dovetailer appears.
<br />
The understanding of the notion of Universal Dovetailer requires the  
<br />
notion Universal machine, which requires the notion of computable  
<br />
functions, which requires the notion of functions and related  
<br />
elementary set theory.
<br />
<br /><br />UDA shows this: &quot;if I am a machine&quot; then &quot;correct physical prediction  
<br />
= a sum on self-consistent extensions&quot;.
<br />
<br />This transforms a part of the mind body problem into a tremendously  
<br />
hard mathematical body problem.
<br />
<br />That was the goal: to show that the comp hyp reduces, if only  
<br />
partially, the mind body problem into a computer science/mathematical  
<br />
logico problem.
<br />
<br />Now at first sight you get an infinite sum of infinite things, so it  
<br />
could seem UDA is just a refutation of comp.
<br />
<br />Now UDA shows *and illustrate* that machines which introspect  
<br />
themselves can see that physics is the head, so to speak. So instead  
<br />
of using computer science to look at the sum on self-consistent  
<br />
extension, it is simpler, conceptually to directly study what a  
<br />
correct universal machine can see by introspecting herself. We know  
<br />
she must see the &quot;physics&quot; in her &quot;head&quot;, OK? And that is what Gödel  
<br />
did for correct machines known by logicians as (sufficiently rich)  
<br />
axiomatic theories. This has given the logic of self-reference.
<br />
<br />I give an exemple: Gödel shows that (arithmetical or above) axiomatic  
<br />
theories can talk (prove) propositions about themselves. The  
<br />
&quot;themselves&quot; is a third person self-reference, so that the machine is  
<br />
talking in the manner of a scientific about her body, in a third  
<br />
person way.
<br />
<br />Examples
<br />
- An incompleteness theorem: it asserts that the correct machine  
<br />
machine cannot prove its own consistency (own based on that third  
<br />
person self-reference). This can be written ~B(~Bf) (it is not  
<br />
provable that the false is not provable).
<br />
- *the* incompleteness theorem: if &quot;I&quot; am consistent then &quot;I&quot; cannot  
<br />
prove &quot;my&quot; own consistency (&quot;I&quot;, and &quot;me&quot; = 3-self).
<br />
This can be written ~Bf -&gt; ~B(~Bf ). First person reference are more  
<br />
tricky to define, and requires Theaetetus.
<br />
<br />Now, some machine believes this, they believes in the natural numbers.  
<br />
For example, they believe in Ex (x = 0), (it exists a number x equal  
<br />
to the 0). and also, they believe in Ex (x = s(0)),  i.e. it exists a  
<br />
number x equal to the 0), and so one with s(s(0)), s(s(s(0))), etc.
<br />
But they believe also in all the induction formula:
<br />
<br />[p(0) and Ax(p(x) -&gt; p(s(x))] -&gt; Ax p(x)
<br />
<br />I translate (read the colonne vertically):
<br />
<br />p(0)    the property p is true for zero
<br />
and    and
<br />
Ax       for all number x we have that
<br />
(p(x) -&gt; p(s(x)) the truth of p for x entails the truth of p for the  
<br />
successor of x
<br />
<br />-&gt;      all what precedes entails the truth of what follows
<br />
<br />The induction formula gives an enormous power of probability. To  
<br />
believe in addition and multiplication makes you already universal. To  
<br />
believe in addition, multiplication and in the induction formula makes  
<br />
you Löbian, and this makes you know, in a sense, that you are  
<br />
universal. At the propositional level the logic has been axiomatized  
<br />
soundly and completely by Solovay, and with the mathematical decor  
<br />
(the so called normal modal logic) they are entirely characterized by  
<br />
the formula B(Bp-&gt;p)-&gt;Bp. A formula related to a theorem by Löb.
<br />
<br />Oops I must go. We were beginning the AUDA. It could be premature,  
<br />
given that we are just at the seventh step of UDA in another thread.
<br />
Let me be short and hopefully not too much discouraging. If you want  
<br />
to take part in the interview, you have to learn theoretical computer  
<br />
science, math and logic. You may have an opportunity, given that I  
<br />
like to teach those matter especially when people are motivated by  
<br />
deep questions.
<br />
