<br />For the record, how would you contrast this with Chalmers' property

dualism and his programme for 'psycho-physical laws'? Presumably his
<br />
'conceivability' of structure (ll) without appearance (l) is sheer
<br />
'3rd-person cultism' from your perspective. This is where I part
<br />
company from him. My conceivability apparatus just can't come up with
<br />
this. For me a situation that isn't self-revealing needs a mediator
<br />
(little observer) to do the revealing for it, and we know where that
<br />
leads...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Qualia(appearances) are only intractible because we keep insisting on &amp;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; trying to use qualia (appearances, our scientific evidence) to explain

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; qualia&quot;, a science of _our evidence system_!!, that the evidence system
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; breaks down?
</em><br />
<br />Can you say more about how a structure (ll) science approaches this?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; FYI
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ['unsituated' means that the scientist is, despite the observer dependence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; characterised by quantum mechanics, surgically excised from the universe

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; science puts the scientist back inside the universe with the studied

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; items. Note that science only needs OBJECTIVITY (a behaviour) not a real
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'objective view' to construct correlations of type I (above). Dual aspect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; science disposes of the cultish need for a delusion of a 3rd person view ]
</em><br />
<br />Yes, this is broadly what I was aiming at with '1st-person primacy',
<br />
using words like 'embedded', 'present', etc. - but 'situated' is good,
<br />
I'll adopt it.
<br />
<br />There's another aspect, which I've been musing about again since my
<br />
most recent exchanges with Peter. This is that if one takes seriously
<br />
(and I do) 'structural' or 'block' views such as MWI, then it seems to
<br />
me that whatever is behaving 'perceivingly', 1st-personally', or
<br />
'subjectly' (gawd!) is the gestalt, not any particular abstraction
<br />
therefrom. It seems to me that this is necessary to yield from an
<br />
infinity of recursively nested structure:
<br />
<br />1) The unnameability of the 1st-person (i.e. 'this observer situation')
<br />
2) The consequential validity (?) of any probability calculus of
<br />
observer situations
<br />
3) 'Time' as the tension of structure and gestalt - i.e. sensing
<br />
situations dynamically
<br />
4) 'Coherent observer histories' - i.e. sensing 'meta-situationally'
<br />
(is this an adverb?)
<br />
<br />Any thoughts on this?
<br />

<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; David Nyman&quot; &lt;david.nyman.domain.name.hidden&gt;:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Yes, and I despair (almost) of remedying this, even if I knew how. My
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; own attempts at linguistic 'clarity' seemed destined only to muddy the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; waters further, especially as I'm really trying to translate from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; personal modes that are often more visual/ kinaesthetic than verbal,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; gestalt than analytic.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have these very same difficulties and I try my very hardest to use the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; minimal number of most-accessible words in their popular mode. Not always
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; successfully...but you have to start somewhere. My origins are as an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; engineer immersed in the natural (electrical) world. Thousands of hours of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; waiting during commissioning, thinking for a couple of decades.... to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; surface and try to describe what you have seen after this...is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; challenge.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; That said, I rather like your 'adverbial' mode, which I think has also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cropped up in other contexts (didn't Whitehead attempt something of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sort with his process view?) Nominalisation/ reification creates
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conceptual confusions, embedded assumptions spawn others, as in all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; language to do with time, which is already loaded with the assumption of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiential dynamism, and hence can do nothing to help explain it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ================================================
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ASIDE, for the record, dual aspect science (from the previous post).  I)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; APPEARANCE ASPECT. Depictions (statistics) of regularity (correlations of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; agreed 'objects' within) in appearances
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; II) STRUCTURE ASPECT. Depictions (Statistics) of structure of an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; underlying natural world based on organisations of one or more posited
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structural primitives.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Both have equal access to qualia as evidence. Qualia are evidence for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; both. Whatever the structure is, scientists are made of it and it must
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simultaneously a) deliver qualia and all the rest of the structure in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe(II) and b) deliver the contents of qualia (appearances) that

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; result in our correlations of appearances that we think of as empirical

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; laws(I). This is a complete consistent set of natural laws, none of which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; literally 'are' the universe but are merely 'about' it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ================================================
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; back to David's words re language...'adverbial' descriptions:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Nicholas Rescher has wrested process thought from the Whitehead
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sequestration of it. Rescher uses the adverbial mode quite convincingly in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; his latest works. Thank goodness...far too much religious/cultish detritus
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; smattered throughout the Whitehead camp. They have no right to 'own' the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; process view. I hope those days are over now.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The adverbial depiction is very apt as it stops us being deluded into the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumption of 'nouns' and 'things'. In day to day life nouns and things
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are very very useful, but the assumption that just because our language
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has them and we have agreed to their presence in the universe's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appearance...does not mean that the language tokens are actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instantiated!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Adverbial descriptions are far more general in that they easily unify all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; natural world behaviour as a single process that can deal with 'verby
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things' like rainstorms, that are inherently processual and apparent lumpy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things (like lions) that behave 'nounly'. Qualia naturally fit into this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; idea. There is no thing 'red' in your head. The universe is behaving
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; red-ly in your head. NOTE: An ideal object 'red' may be said to exist in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'platonia'. But so what! This is about _our_ universe, not some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; abstraction.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; My own hastily contrived usages were an attempt to expose the implicit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (and hence generally conceptually invisible) holding of the world 'at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arm's length' by the objectifying effect of 3rd person language, which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simultaneusly relegates 1st-person to a subsidiary role, to the extent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that some even feel impelled to deny its existence, or resort to bizarre
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ontolgies in an attempt to 'reintroduce' it. Where McGinn and Chomsky hold
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that it is the analytic/ synthetic modes of language that puts 1st person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; beyond our ability to conceptualise, I feel that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unacknowledged consensual projection of an 'objective model' as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'reality' has more to do with it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; My belief has been that restoring 1st person to some sort of centrality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would be part of the antidote, and I haven't yet (quite) lost hope on this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; score. I look forward to the fruits of your own efforts in this regard.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; David
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Your plea has not gone unheard. V.S. Ramachandran said &quot;...the need to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reconcile the first and third person accounts of the universe...is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; single most important problem in science.&quot; (Phantoms in the Brain .229)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and there's McGinn in 'the mysterious flame' where he makes a convincing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; case for us having a profoundly inadequate view of matter. I agree! I'd
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; say there isn't any such 'thing'! :-)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Note Ramachandran is not saying 'physics' or 'neuroscience' or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'consciousness studies' is affected but SCIENCE, all of it. He is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; absolutely right. Qualia are our entire source of scientific evidence. We
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have nothing else. They are an appearance (as a measurement supplied to us
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inside our heads by the action of brain material). To say that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe is literally constructed of these appearances is a) illogical and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; b) does not align with the modern empirical evidence of brain material.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a) be completely dependent on 1st person data for scientific evidence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (even though we linguistically extract an apparent objective agreed view
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; out of it, without qualia we have no appearances to do that with!)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; b) demand that this 1st person data be used as evidence on pain of being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; declared 'unscientific'. (If you can't experience it, you are not doing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; science).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; c) To believe that the abstractions we get by correlating the appearances
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are structural/causal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and worse then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; d) to deny the existence qualia/declare the ficticious third person view
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as the only valid view
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in spite of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; d) glaring anomalous data presentation in brain material.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is a recipe for a science that I'm not too sure has any other status than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some sort of &quot;cult of the objective view&quot;. Do we really want to have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; historians look back at us and cringe? The dual-aspect penny has to drop
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at some stage.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Qualia(appearances) are only intractible because we keep insisting on &amp;
</em><br />

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; qualia&quot;, a science of _our evidence system_!!, that the evidence system
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; breaks down?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If I had to categorise the situation I'd say that science is currently
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;single aspect, unsituated&quot; as opposed to &quot;dual-aspect, situated&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; FYI

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'd be very interested in the group's view on this. I feel like I'm the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only one who can see something broken here (science). If anyone can say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that a dual-aspect approach cannot be used for any other reason than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dogmatic clinging to the way it is,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a) I'd like to hear it.. (I challenge anyone/everyone to do this. I can't!)
