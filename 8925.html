<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi.  I've been reading the postings of this group
<br />
for
<br />
awhile but haven't yet posted anything on my own. 
<br />
However,
<br />
the question of &quot;Why is there something rather than
<br />
nothing?&quot; is of interest to me, so, if you're
<br />
interested
<br />
here are my thoughts.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, my answer to the question of &quot;why is
<br />
there
<br />
something rather than nothing?&quot; is that something and
<br />
nothing are really one and same thing, just seen from
<br />
different perspectives.  The perspective that sees
<br />
nothing
<br />
as nothing is the one where we're thinking of
<br />
nothingness in our
<br />
minds.  The perspective in which nothing is the same
<br />
as
<br />
something is the one in which all things, including
<br />
our
<br />
minds are gone.  I came to that conclusion by two
<br />
different
<br />
arguments:
<br />
<br />1. If we ask why is there something than nothing,
<br />
there seem
<br />
to be 2 choices:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. Something has always been here.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B. Something has not always been here.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While choice A is possible, it doesn't offer any
<br />
real
<br />
explanation.  So, in exploring choice B, if something
<br />
has
<br />
not always been here, that means that nothing was here
<br />
before it.  So, this means that nothing was there
<br />
then, but
<br />
now there's something.  When there was nothing (ie, no
<br />
thing, ideas, numbers, matter, energy, volume, etc.
<br />
exists), there would be no mechanism that exists to
<br />
turn
<br />
this nothing into something else called something. 
<br />
Assuming
<br />
there is something now, the only possible choice is
<br />
that
<br />
nothing and something are one and the same.
<br />
<br />2. I first considered the question of why anything
<br />
exists
<br />
at all and then tried to apply that to &quot;nothing&quot; to
<br />
see if
<br />
it exists.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. What I came up with is that something exists if
<br />
it is
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a whole, an entirety, etc.  By this, I mean is
<br />
it
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;completely defined as to what is in the thing? 
<br />
Wholes
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have edges defining what exactly is in the
<br />
whole.  The
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;edge isn't a separate structure; it's just the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wholeness, the complete grouping or complete
<br />
definition
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;itself.  Edges give something substance, and
<br />
this is
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;why we think of wholes as existing.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B. I then arbitarilly defined things that exist
<br />
(ie,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;space, time, matter, energy, ideas, volume,
<br />
minds,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;etc.) as occupying volume.  It doesn't matter
<br />
whether
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you use volume or some other word, I just wanted
<br />
to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;put a name to this.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C. Non-existence is the lack of all things, or, in
<br />
other
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;words, the lack of all volume, or zero volume. 
<br />
With
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;non-existence, even our minds that are
<br />
considering
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;non-existence would be gone.  Because of this
<br />
point,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one can never prove anything about
<br />
non-existence, but
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we can at least try to think of what properties
<br />
it
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;might have.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D. I then tried to think if zero volume meets the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;definition of a whole.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Are there any things missing?  No.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Does zero volume include all?  Yes.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Is zero  volume completely defined as to what
<br />
it is?  Yes.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This then suggests that zero volume is a whole,
<br />
and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this wholeness is the same as an edge or
<br />
boundary
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;defining an existent state, ie, the existent
<br />
state of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;non-existence.
<br />
<br />We have trouble considering non-existence as something
<br />
that
<br />
exists because we can only think of non-existence from
<br />
the
<br />
perspectives of our minds, which exist.  Only once all
<br />
things are gone, including our minds, does zero-volume
<br />
become the all, completely defined and, therefore, a
<br />
whole
<br />
and something that exists.  In other words, in our
<br />
minds, we
<br />
must consider zero-volume/non-existence based on the
<br />
pre-existing concept of existence.  But, non-existence
<br />
itself, not our minds' visualization of non-existence,
<br />
does
<br />
not have this restriction.  It meets the definition of
<br />
a
<br />
whole on its own, separate from our minds'
<br />
restrictions.
<br />
For this and many other problems, I think it's very
<br />
important to separate our minds' conceptions of
<br />
something from the thing itself.  They're two
<br />
different
<br />
things.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you've read this far, I appreciate your
<br />
listening!
<br />
Those are my crazy ideas.  If you're interested, more
<br />
