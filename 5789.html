I'll have to look more closely at those papers, but I have a couple
<br />
of quick comments.
<br />
<br />Jeff Bone, &lt;jbone.domain.name.hidden&gt;, writes:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Stumbled across an interesting if tangential paper that has something 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to say about this.  First some terminology:  let's call events that are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; highly improbable &quot;white rabbits&quot; and universes in which such events 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happen frequently (or universes with entirely inscrutable laws of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics) &quot;white rabbit worlds.&quot;
</em><br />
<br />I think this is an unfortunate terminology choice, although it is true
<br />
that we have occasionally used it here.  The truth is, there is nothing
<br />
remarkable about white rabbits.  Our world is full of white rabbits.
<br />
Using the term to refer to worlds which are utterly improbable is
<br />
confusing.  I think we got into it by reference to Alice in Wonderland,
<br />
where the White Rabbit character walks, talks and wears clothes, but
<br />
by itself, especially without capitals, the term white rabbit does not
<br />
connote improbability.  I would prefer &quot;flying rabbit&quot; or just &quot;magical&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let's further adopt the term &quot;djinni&quot; or (to follow Gott's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nomenclature) &quot;jinni&quot; to refer to closed time-like (causally cyclic) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; curves, and &quot;jinn worlds&quot; as worlds (n-dimensional &quot;spacetime&quot; slices 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the higher-order spacetime, or rather n-m dimensional phase-space 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; volumes where n is the total dimensionality of the phase space) that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contain such causal cycles.
</em><br />
<br />It's not clear to me that causality and time are inherent properties
<br />
of worlds.  I include worlds which can be thought of as n-dimensional
<br />
cells that satisfy some constraints.  Among those constraints could be
<br />
ones which induce the effects we identify as causality and time.  For
<br />
example, a two-dimensional cell where C[i,j] == C[i-1,j] XOR C[i-1,j-1].
<br />
This particular definition has the property that C[i,.] depends only on
<br />
C[i-1,.], which lets us identify i as time, and introduce a notion of
<br />
causality where conditions at time i depend on conditions at time i-1.
<br />
<br />But we could just as easily create a cell system where there was no
<br />
natural definition of time, where C[i,j] depended on i+1, i-1, j+1
<br />
and j-1.  You could still imaging satisfying this via some constraint
<br />
satisfaction algorithm.
<br />
<br />Now these jinni worlds are ones which mostly have these conditions we
<br />
identify as time and causality, but which locally, or perhaps rarely,
<br />
do not satisfy such rules.  Seen in this perspective, there is a full
<br />
range of possibilities, from fully causal worlds, to ones which are
<br />
99.999% causal and only .0001% noncausal, to ones which are 50-50, to
<br />
ones for which no meaningful concept of causality can be defined.
<br />
<br />Your perspective seems to be that those worlds which are very, very
<br />
slightly non-causal are particularly interesting.  If all you thought
<br />
existed were causal worlds, then opening the door to slight non-causality
<br />
may seem like a big step.  But from my perspective, causality is not
<br />
that significant, it is merely an accidental property of some worlds,
<br />
so it is no big deal to imagine non-causal universes of varying degrees.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; David G. Boulware of the University of Washington published this paper 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in PRD:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9207054">http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9207054</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ...in which he studies the behavior of quantum fields in spaces with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; closed time-like curves.  What he finds is that probabilities are not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;conserved&quot;, i.e. not unitary, in such spaces.  That is, the Feynman 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sum-over-histories approach always yields precisely 1 --- except when 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; space contains one or more jinn.  In such cases, there are quantum 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; events that simply cannot occur.
</em><br />
<br />I'll have to look at this.  It doesn't sound quite right.  If
<br />
probabilities are non-unitary that violates the fundamental rules of QM,
<br />
which would suggest that jinns and QM cannot exist, or in other words,
<br />
that if QM describes our universe, we have no jinns.
<br />
<br />Now, I do recall some earlier famous papers by Novikov in which he found
<br />
consistent solutions for closed timelike paths, which were presumably
<br />
unitary.  So I will have to look more closely and see how these results
<br />
compare.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So:  jinn defeat white rabbits.  If any world-line through the phase 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; space is cyclic / allowed to self-intersect, the overall phase-space is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constrained, presumably to those set of configurations which are of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; higher probability.  The very existence of such causal cycles may 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indeed be --- meta-paradoxically ;-) --- essential in stabilizing the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; overall structure of the phase space.  It would seem that these cycles 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; act as a kind of strange attractor around which probable configurations 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (universes) coalesce.
</em><br />
<br />I think you're getting awfully speculative here.  I don't know where
<br />
all this is coming from, why you think that jinn would particularly make
<br />
unlikely events even less likely to occur.
<br />
<br />[skipping]
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So that's all well and good for physics, but what about the more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; algorithmic cosmologies?  One school of thought regarding the COMP 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hypothesis is that it is easier to simulate all possible worlds than it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is to simulate any subset of them.  (Cf. previously-discussed 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Champernowne machine / &quot;everything&quot; algorithm.)  But what if the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dynamics of the simulation are such that these jinni exist as a priori 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structural parameters, &quot;roots&quot; if you will of the computation?  In such 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an environment, &quot;every computable universe&quot; is NOT every possible 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe.
</em><br />
<br />It sounds like you are suggesting that it would be simpler to suppose
<br />
that &quot;all universes exist which contain jinn&quot; than &quot;all universes exist&quot;.
<br />
That doesn't seem at all plausble to me.  My heuristic is that any rule
<br />
of the form &quot;all universes exist except X&quot; is going to be more complicated
<br />
than one of the form &quot;all universes exist&quot;.
