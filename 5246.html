I browsed through recent postings and hope
<br />
this delayed but self-contained message can clarify
<br />
a few things about probabilities and measures
<br />
and predictability etc.
<br />
<br />What is the probability of an integer being, say,
<br />
a square? This question does not make sense without
<br />
a prior probability distribution on the integers.
<br />
<br />This prior cannot be uniform. Try to find one!
<br />
Under _any_ distribution some integers must be
<br />
more likely than others.
<br />
<br />Which prior is good?  Is there a `best' or
<br />
`universal' prior? Yes, there is. It assigns to
<br />
each integer n as much probability as any other
<br />
computable prior, save for a constant factor that
<br />
does not depend on n.  (A computable prior can be
<br />
encoded as a program that takes n as input and
<br />
outputs n's probability, e.g., a program that
<br />
implements Bernoulli's formula, etc.)
<br />
<br />Given a set of priors, a universal prior is
<br />
essentially a weighted sum of all priors in the
<br />
set. For example, Solomonoff's famous weighted sum
<br />
of all enumerable priors will assign at least as
<br />
much probability to any square integer as any
<br />
other computable prior, save for a constant
<br />
machine-dependent factor that becomes less and
<br />
less relevant as the integers get larger and
<br />
larger.
<br />
<br />Now let us talk about all computable universe
<br />
histories. Some are finite, some infinite. Each
<br />
has at least one program that computes it. Again
<br />
there is _no_ way of assigning equal probability
<br />
to all of them! Many are tempted to assume a
<br />
uniform distribution without thinking much about
<br />
it, but there is _no_ such thing as a uniform
<br />
distribution on all computable universes, or on
<br />
all axiomatic mathematical structures, or on
<br />
all logically possible worlds, etc!
<br />
(Side note: There only is a uniform _measure_ on
<br />
the finitely many possible history _beginnings_
<br />
of a given size, each standing for an uncountable
<br />
_set_ of possible futures. Probabilities
<br />
refer to single objects, measures to sets.)
<br />
<br />It turns out that we can easily build universal
<br />
priors using Levin's important concept of self-
<br />
delimiting programs. Such programs may
<br />
occasionally execute the instruction &quot;request new
<br />
input bit&quot;; the bit is chosen randomly and will
<br />
remain fixed thereafter. Then the probability of
<br />
some universe history is the probability of guessing
<br />
a program for it. This probability is `universal'
<br />
as it does not depend much on the computer (whose
<br />
negligible influence can be buried in a constant
<br />
universe-independent factor). Some programs halt or
<br />
go in an infinite loop without ever requesting
<br />
additional input bits. Universes with at least one
<br />
such short self-delimiting program are more probable
<br />
than others.
<br />
<br />To make predictions about some universe, say,
<br />
ours, we need a prior as well. For instance,
<br />
most people would predict that next Tuesday it
<br />
won't rain on the moon, although there are
<br />
computable universes where it does. The anthropic
<br />
principle is an _insufficient_ prior that does not
<br />
explain the absence of rain on the moon - it does
<br />
assign cumulative probability 1.0 to the set of all
<br />
universes where we exist, and 0.0 to all the other
<br />
universes, but humans could still exist if it did
<br />
rain on the moon occasionally. Still, many tend to
<br />
consider the probability of such universes as small,
<br />
which actually says something about their prior.
<br />
<br />We do not know yet the true prior from which
<br />
our universe is sampled - Schroedinger's wave
<br />
function may be an approximation thereof. But it
<br />
turns out that if the true prior is computable
<br />
at all, then we can in principle already predict
<br />
near-optimally, using the universal prior instead:

<br />
Many really smart physicists do not know this
<br />
yet. Technical issues and limits of computable
<br />
universes are discussed in papers available at:
<br />

<br />
Even stronger predictions using a prior based
<br />
on the fastest programs (not the shortest):
