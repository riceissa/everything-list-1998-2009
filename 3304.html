George Levy
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Yes but Einstein was still confusing the methodological evacuation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of the subject with the idea that the subject cannot be handled
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; scientifically.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I don't understand. Do you mean the &quot;methodological evaluation of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;subject...&quot;? Which subject was Einstein evaluating or believed could not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be handled scientifically? 
</em><br />
<br /><br />Evacuation. Nagel has written a paper about that. The idea that
<br />
science should talk only on 3-person propositions. Those are verifiable,
<br />
refutable like &quot;if you look in that direction with a telescope 
<br />
you will see a planet&quot; or like &quot;there is no biggest prime&quot;, etc.
<br />
<br />I agree science should *use* on 3-propositions, but this does not prevent
<br />
science on talking on
<br />
*on* 1-propositions, once you got a 3-theory about the 1-propositions.
<br />
<br />Ultimately what remains are the arithmetical 3-theory. The 3-physics
<br />
is transformed into a 1-psychology of number.
<br />
<br />Einstein like most physicist talk only on 3-propositions, but Galileo
<br />
Einstein and Everett have deepened the perspectival role of the
<br />
observer, but still abstracting the 1-person away.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; And I guess you forget I am using comp, and this include that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the set of provable arithmetical truth is a 3-person sharable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; objective set.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I guess this is the crux of the difference between us. Your starting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;point is axiomatic and logical/mathematical and you believe that the set
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of provable arithmetical truty is a 3-person sharable objective set. My
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;starting point is relativistic and I feel comfortable with a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;relativistic generalization of the first/third person concept. It would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be nice if we could bridge that gap.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I limit myself intentionaly to a &quot;scientific&quot; dialog with the machine.
<br />
I oblige her to prove in a verifiable formal sort of way any of her
<br />
assertion. (it is 3-person by construction).
<br />
<br />As a mathematician I limit myself to dialogs with sound (correct) machine,
<br />
although I have no algorithm for distinguishing a priori correct machine
<br />
from uncorrect one. Still I can study the *mathematical* logics of the
<br />
discourse of the correct machine. Here appears the logics G and G*.
<br />
<br />Only *then* I use G and G* (and Platon) to define in those (meta)logics
<br />
the notion of 1-discours.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I guess one way to begin is to specify what are the axiomatic logical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;constraints A for a set of provable arithmetical truth to be 3-person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sharable.
</em><br />
<br />They are easily sharable. Even between us and any program emulating
<br />
an algorithmic extension on Peano Arithmetic or Zermelo Fraenkel theories.
<br />
The truth of the theorem are not sharable, but the theoremhood is sharable
<br />
by definition of &quot;provable&quot;.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Second question is: Are there several logical modes of A for which this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;set is sharable. 
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes. (by mode I understand modal variation of provability).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;If yes, then each mode corresponds to a &quot;frame of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reference.&quot; 
</em><br />
<br />Mmh ... does not fit my interpretation of mode. Still for each
<br />
mode I have a Kripke frame. So perhaps ...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Observers possessing identical logical modes would belong to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the same frame of reference and would experinece the same arithmetic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;truths. Observers in different logical modes would experience different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;loogical truths.
</em><br />
<br />In my modal variation, the set of provable arithmetical proposition
<br />
does not vary, G* says but G ignore, so the machine obeys to different
<br />
logic in different mode, although the base proposition are the same.
<br />
That is true but unprovable by the machine.
<br />
<br />G* proves ([0]p &lt;-&gt; [1]p)
<br />
G* proves -[0]([0]p &lt;-&gt; [1]p)  and G* proves -[1]([0]p &lt;-&gt; [1]p)
<br />
<br />with for exemple [0]p = provable (p) and [1]p = (provable(p) &amp; p), the
<br />
simplest Thaetetic mode variant of the provability, my first defintion
<br />
of first person (the knower).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;If three such modes can be demonstrated, then the first/third person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;concept becomes insufficient to express the relationships between the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observers. We may have to fall back on a relativistic concept.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Those mode are abstract and help to characterize the logic invariant
<br />
for any solitary observers. Your relativity would need in my framework
<br />
multimodal logic. I'm afraid that will be for later. You can look
<br />
to bimodal logic (two mode at once) in Boolos 93.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I am fascinated by the parallelism between social systems and axiomatic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;systems. Please allow me some poetic license. Each social system becomes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;inconsistent given certain conditions. For example, Ghandi showed that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the British system could not possibly be &quot;civilized&quot; and deal with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;non-violent protest in a &quot;civilized&quot; non-violent manner. By
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;demonstrating that the British presence in India was inconsistent, he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;was able to kick the British out. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It may be that the rise of christianity in ancient Rome happened when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;judaism monotheism exposed the inconsistency of the Roman religious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;beliefs.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Modern terrorists take advantage of our freedoms (economic, legal,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;etc..) to perform their evil acts. These may be our inconsistencies.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The big question is this: is it possible to expose the inconsistencies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of terrorists and terrorist organizations? What are their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;inconsistencies? What methods should we use to get rid of them, that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;will remain consistent with our own system?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Well, a typical G*-like answer would be: we will get rid of terrorism
<br />
when we will stop trying to get rid of terrorism.
<br />
This is also in the spirit of Alan Watts &quot;The Wisdom of Insecurity&quot;.
<br />
Terrorist are not inconsistent (although some of their beliefs can be 
<br />
inconsistent with our beliefs), but they indeed prove some inherent
<br />
and intrinsical possibility of inconsistency of our democraties. But,
<br />
that &quot;possibility of inconsistency&quot; is what we must learn to live with.
<br />
For the same &quot;deep&quot; reason we can expect there will never be universal
<br />
vaccin in medecine.
<br />
<br />We can perhaps hope to temperate the nuisance of terrorism, and diseases.
<br />
We can sublimise (if it is english) those thinks (I wish!).
<br />
<br />Also, I agree with your sentence to Charles Goodwin. But be careful,
<br />
because such sentence are often misunderstood (my experience).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;In summary, I think that someone can believe in evolution, can believe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that God did &quot;nothing&quot; and yet be intensely mystical and believe in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;higher God.
</em><br />
