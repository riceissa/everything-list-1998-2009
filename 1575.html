<em class="quotelev1">&gt;course.  For example, semantics may be an OR feature of syntax, which is

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;itself an OR feature of the physical world.

<br />I don't understand &quot;(-(p&amp;-p)) --&gt; (s(P)(OI)), for s(P) = OI/OR&quot;
<br />
I don't understand &quot;s(P)&quot;. If P is a property do you mean P(s), i.e.
<br />
s has property P ?
<br />
If you could be a little more specific here, it could help me.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Do you mean that the correct *application* of this distinction is itself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observer-relative for some P,  where this observer-relativity is somehow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;comparable to e.g. the relativity of simultaneity in Relativity theory?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Not that I really understand how this analogy might be possible. 
</em><br />
<br />It is a little more like Everett's Relative States. But Everett is still
<br />
somehow naive with the observer. He modelises the first-person by what the
<br />
first person writes in his diary book, in fact it is the results of the 
<br />
measurements he does. The problem with comp is that there is definitely
<br />
no way for the observer to put a line between itself and the possible
<br />
environment. The MWI solves this problem in the QM realm, but with
<br />
comp it is far less &quot;easy&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I make no claim to understand your metaphysics, which to me (a diehard
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;external realist) appears exotic in an interesting way.  Shall take a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;look on your thesis soon.
</em><br />
<br />I would be relieved if you find a fatal error! Sometimes I don't believe
<br />
in &quot;my&quot; metaphysics too. The problem is that I derive it from some
<br />
at least plausible philosophical assumptions (and this in two independent
<br />
ways).
<br />
Note that I'm not the first who realise the incompatibility between
<br />
computationnalism and materialism (even in the doubly---dualist---
<br />
Cartesian form). Maudlin discovers that too. We discuss that before in the
<br />
list (see &quot;Maudlin&quot; or &quot;crackpot proof&quot; in the archive).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Second thought:  Just possibly we need to distinguish the case of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(i) [s = reality as a whole] from (ii) those of [s = any element of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reality], so that for (ii) but not (i) it is in some sense OR whether s(P)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is OR or OI.  
</em><br />
<br />What are you trying to say here?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;But I have no clear idea of what exactly this sense might
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be.  This deserves some hard thought (*damn*).
</em><br />
<br />I guess so!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;You take &quot;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; molecular structure&quot; as intrinsic and I will tell you below why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I don't. It seems you take the notion of &quot;physical things&quot; as granted,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; but I don't. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Right.  My point here is that even you must assume _some_ intrisic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;features of reality.  The metaphysical bucket must stop somewhere.
</em><br />
<br />I agree. This is a fundamental point.
<br />
The metaphysical bucket stops, with comp, with the Arithmetical Truth.
<br />
Three reasons for that.
<br />
1) We don't need more;
<br />
2) With more we will be falling in the delicate problem of choosing a
<br />
&nbsp;univoquial mathematical reality.
<br />
3) With less we will never retrieved arithmetical truth. This follows
<br />
from Godel or Lowenheim-Skolem theorems.
<br />
Then, by fixing an arbitrary Universal Turing Machine and by using Godel's
<br />
arithmetisation technic we can put a mathematical structure on the 
<br />
possible discourse of the (self-referentially correct machines), and go
<br />
searching for the &quot;physical&quot; discourse. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But even if there were intrinsic features of physical reality, it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; hard for me to understand how consciousness would rely on it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; What in the brain/body/universe do you think to be intrinsically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; necessary for consciousness ?  Sodium ions? Carbon atoms? Quark?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Quantum phenomena in microtubules?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;To the naturalist, this is a poorly understood empirical question:  The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;inclusive disjunction of causal requirements simply isn't known by any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;member of this species (and will probably never be, because of the limited
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;light cone).
</em><br />
<br />But how could *any* empirical discovery help here?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; All we know at present is that certain sorts of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;electrochemical pulses in certain sorts of carbonbased neural tissue are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;jointly sufficient for certain sorts of consciousness.
</em><br />
<br />Let us say we bet on it. It is reasonable, but we can hardly say
<br />
we *know* that. At least, not *for sure*.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;As I see it, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;case for the computationalist hypothesis is weaker then the case for, say,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the possibility of zero point propulsion, which seems at least predicted
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;by QM.  I.e.,  it makes good SciFi, which is no mean thing.  (It can't be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;said about the microtubule speculations, for example).
</em><br />
<br />Here too I would be glad if you have the time to be a little more
<br />
specific.  I hope you mean by &quot;weaker&quot; &quot;less demanding&quot;. I agree then.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (Searle's comparison between aware-thinking and photosynthesis is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; really a philosophical category mistake, I think).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Yeah, so it would presumably seem to a computationalist;  but can it be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;shown to be so on logical grounds?
</em><br />
<br />Searle seems to agree there is a consciousness problem. There is
<br />
no equivalent &quot;photosynthesis&quot; problem. As Nagel put it clearly,
<br />
the consciousness problem is that there seem to be no exhaustive
<br />
set of third person description capable of explaining the
<br />
very private and quasi-incorrigible feature of the first person
<br />
experience. Nowhere in biology can we find something equivalent,
<br />
with the notable exception of the question &quot;what is matter?&quot;.
<br />
I do thing that this can be shown on logical+arithmetical ground
<br />
once we assume comp. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;On the observer-relativity of computation:  When a brain computes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;some function or other, that process is observer-independent as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it does not depend on how anything _outside_ that physical system treats
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;or interprets it.  But if one somehow uses an electronic device, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;surface of a soap-bubble, or an elephants' trunk to the same end, then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;there is only a brute physical process unless a computational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interpretation is assigned to it by some transformation function.  This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;OR, however, does not imply what Searle would call epistemic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;subjectivity (ES):  The truth value of a computational result R is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;determined by individual attitudes to R.  More on mathematical epistemic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;objectivity (EO) below.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;How, then, does the _brain_ compute anything?  Clearly there is no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;conscious interpretation of non-intentional neuronics?  I guess the brain 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;simulates a subset of the relations between a subset of abstract patterns
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;by means of its symbolic capability:  It uses its unique physical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ability to treat certain physical objects (inks on paper, wrinkles on an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;elephant's trunk, or even mental pics) *as* something else (patterns and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;metapatterns).  A special case of this special case of toolusing is what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computation boils down to for the naturalist, I suppose.
</em><br />
<br />Interesting remarks, but astonishing also when there are made by someone
<br />
accepting the downward causation theory of free-will.
<br />
Note that I do not pretend having a solution of those questions, except
<br />
in the sense that I show why some &quot;self-referentially correct&quot; 
<br />
computations
<br />
must lead machines to similar questions.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;3) a minimal amount of arithmetical platonism. I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; guess this is maybe unnatural for a biological naturalist. It is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; nevertheless the simple idea that arithmetical truth is independant of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; me. For exemple the idea that the statement &quot;there is an infinite 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; number of primes&quot; is true independently of me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It is indeed, and that is not so unnatural.  As suggested above, math
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;objects must be seen as the class of possible patterns and relations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;between those, some of which are physically implemented (or all, according
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to the everything idea.)  I don't think we disagree here.  As to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;location of non-implemented abstract patterns:  I don't agonize so much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;over this, but I guess it adds to the attraction of the everything idea.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, indeed. It is amazing that you agree here. In general &quot;naturalist&quot;
<br />
inclined people are willing to drop out any form of mathematical
<br />
platonism. I guess this explain perhaps your presence in the list.
<br />
Could you tell me for further reference what do you thing about
<br />
the Many World interpretation of QM ?
<br />
<br />Happy Christmas and All That Sort of Things,
