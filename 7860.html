Hi Godfrey, Bruno
<br />
<br />&nbsp;The &quot;I&quot; that I consider consists of a logical system that defines and 
<br />
coincides with the physical system that the &quot;I&quot; inhabits. Thus the world 
<br />
(the slice of the plenitude that we can observe) is anthropically 
<br />
constrained by the &quot;I.&quot;
<br />
<br />[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;So the &quot;I&quot; is (1) a logical system (2) a physical system inhabited (1) 
<br />
and (3) the set of anthropic constraints which delimits
<br />
&nbsp;the whole of the (non-&quot;I&quot;) universe (?) where (I am guessing) (1) and 
<br />
(2) find themselves! Is this what you are saying?
<br />
<br />[GL]
<br />
I am sorry I was sloppy in my explanation. Let me try to be clearer. &quot;I&quot; 
<br />
is the kernel of consciousness. It does not include memories which are 
<br />
different for everyone and change as a person ages. I agree with you 
<br />
that since &quot;I&quot; is based on a logical system it must follow Goedel's 
<br />
theorem, perhaps at the border between incompleteness and inconsistency. 
<br />
It seems that is precisely what consciousness &quot;feels&quot; like.
<br />
<br />I am not saying that &quot;I&quot; is a physical system or is the world. Rather 
<br />
that the world that &quot;I&quot; perceive is anthropically constrained by the &quot;I&quot; 
<br />
and that the physical laws have the same limitations as the &quot;I&quot; 
<br />
including the incompleteness/inconsistency requirement.
<br />
<br />[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;Hold on there! If all physics is reducible to &quot;a logical system&quot; why 
<br />
would there need be physics at all ? Why would you have
<br />
&nbsp;to be the one answering Enstein's quandary? Wouldn't his &quot;I&quot;, being the 
<br />
same as yours be able to answer himself?
<br />
&nbsp;In other words: maybe your explanation of knowledge is incapable of 
<br />
explaining... ignorance?
<br />
<br />I think that a TOE would have to include an explanation of 
<br />
consciousness. In explaining the world we'll have to explain ourselves.
<br />
<br />[GL]
<br />
&nbsp;Objective reality is an illusion that disappears when observers differ 
<br />
in their frame of reference. In this particular case, it does not exist 
<br />
when observers operate according to different but entirely consistent 
<br />
fundamental logics. In fact, such observers would have a lot of 
<br />
difficulty communicating since their worlds would be different slices of 
<br />
the plenitude.
<br />
<br />[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;the &quot;strangeness&quot; of relativistic physics
<br />
&nbsp;is that observers can actually compare and agree on their observations 
<br />
even when they have entirely different deployments
<br />
&nbsp;in their different frames of reference!
<br />
<br />[GL]
<br />
Before relativity, one might have argued that different observers 
<br />
experienced different laws of physics. For example, I might experience a 
<br />
gravitational field while you may experience an acceleration. Relativity 
<br />
is a set of far ranging laws that unified under the same umbrella what 
<br />
were deemed smaller ranging laws experienced by different observers. I 
<br />
am saying exactly the same thing. Different frames of reference will 
<br />
generate different perceived laws. Since the frames of reference I am 
<br />
discussing include logical systems, the perceived worlds will be different.
<br />
<br />[GL]
<br />

I would say, almost like a physicalist, that &quot;objective reality&quot; is what 
<br />
is common to all frame of reference. I would even say that &quot;the physical 
<br />
laws&quot; are exactly what is true in all observer-moment, relative 
<br />
state/worlds, etc.
<br />
<br />[GL]
<br />
Einstein has demonstrated that under different state of motion and 
<br />
acceleration the old objective reality breaks down and a new objective 
<br />
reality must take its place. Objective reality depends on the range of 
<br />
the laws. Newton's laws are not true in all frame of reference in 
<br />
various kinds of motion, but Relativity provides unified laws that cover 
<br />
all frames of reference that differ according to their motion and their 
<br />
acceleration.  QT/MWI offers a different kind of relativism. Shannon 
<br />
offers yet another kind of relativism. Why not just go all the way - no 
<br />
more objective reality. Each &quot;I&quot; has his own reality. If your accept 
<br />
this as a law then we have objective reality. :-)
<br />
<br />[BM]
<br />
I could challenge you for giving me two entirely consistent logics 
<br />
having nothing in common, and sufficiently rich to keep natural numbers 
<br />
(but perhaps you don't put weight on arithmetical truth, in which case I 
<br />
could imagine some solution in a non comp framework)
<br />
<br />[GL
<br />
I am not sure what you mean by your statement in parenthesis. Bruno, I 
<br />
am not an expert in logic. Perhaps you can help. Is it possible that  
<br />
&quot;I&quot; (and the anthropically derived world) may include all the (logical) 
<br />
systems &quot;I&quot; can imagine, and therefore it would be impossible for &quot;I&quot; to 
<br />
provide you with a system that &quot;I&quot; cannot imagine? So it is impossible 
<br />
for us to see beyond our slice of the plenitude.
<br />
<br />George
