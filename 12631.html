<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I say, the essence of evil is the act of treating other persons
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as things.
<br />
<br /><br />I so agree with you. And then, with Church thesis (less than comp, thus) 
<br />
you can understand the reason why even some (relative) machine and some 
<br />
(relative) numbers should not be confused with any of their third person 
<br />
description. &quot;
<br />
<br />MP: There is too much packed in this for me to be clear of the scope.
<br />
For example: by 'machine' do you mean, generically, any hypothetical 
<br />
self-referencing, sufficiently complex device - or virtual emulation of 
<br />
such - smart enough to think it knows who it is?
<br />
and
<br />
Which numbers have anything BUT a third person description?
<br />
I am of course very ignorant about higher mathematics, so the way I use 
<br />
words is that a number is a mathematical object that has/is a [or of a] 
<br />
particular value. I guess that means that a number, for me anyway, is a 
<br />
thing not a process. People use processes to generate, define and 
<br />
compare numbers. These processes are to mathematica what verbs, adverbs, 
<br />
adjectives, complex nouns and all the phrases [noun phr, adjectival phr, 
<br />
etc.] are to natural languages. Because of the precise specifications 
<br />
required for such mathematical processes, which I suppose means their 
<br />
algorithmic qualities, many of them are mathematical objects in their 
<br />
own right, so they do what they do and not anything else.
<br />
<br />Bruno [quote continued]:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot; On another tack: it seems to me the extent and scope of suffering
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the world is one of the most powerful arguments in favour of the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;total irrelevance of the concept of G/god/s. However it is not for
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me to go around telling those who believe in some G/god/s that they
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are deluded.
<br />
<br /><br />Do you agree that those who believe in a primitive physical universe 
<br />
could be deluded in the same manner than those who believe in some 
<br />
notion of God. Perhaps even in a worse manner, because many people 
<br />
believe that the existence of a primitive material universe is a 
<br />
&quot;scientific fact&quot;. Of course not. At least in many theological text, the 
<br />
word &quot;God&quot; is used in a more axiomatic way than &quot;Matter&quot; is by some 
<br />
scientist (at lunch or during the week-end). Most religious people will 
<br />
never say that the existence of God is a scientific fact, and in that 
<br />
sense are less deluded than many materialist. &quot;
<br />
<br />MP: I don't see how people who believe in 'some notion of God' can 
<br />
honestly get past the intelligent child's question of 'Well alright, 
<br />
where did G/god/s come from then'. It is a simple question without an 
<br />
answer except something like: 'Shut up you little smart a*se!' or 
<br />
'BLASPHEMY!! Thou deservest to be burnt at the stake!'
<br />
<br />For me a very important aspect of this latter issue is that any 
<br />
purported supernatural being cannot have a coherent explanation in terms 
<br />
of natural science and, if taken of itself to be an explanation for any 
<br />
of that which is and/or that which transpires, it disempowers the 
<br />
believers concerned and any of those in their care. Why? Because, as I 
<br />
think I said before, one of the several Earth shaking things that the 
<br />
advent of scientific method has brought to the human race is the 
<br />
objective demonstration that no publicly stated belief or public 
<br />
assertion of the nature of things is immune from sceptical examination 
<br />
which is conducted in an ethical manner.
<br />
<br />That said, I can now return to the deeper question which is: Is it 
<br />
coherent to assert that there is no universe? In common sense, plain 
<br />
English terms that is pretty much like saying that 'Nothing really 
<br />
exists!' ... which Does not compute! Like dividing or multiplying by 
<br />
zero, you either lock up your system or get no useful extra result. It 
<br />
is therefore necessary to accept that one exists, with the bookmarked 
<br />
proviso that 'exists' needs further research, and accept that for the 
<br />
time being there is no really coherent substitute for taking as /given/ 
<br />
one's own existence in a world of some sort. In fact as I said somewhere 
<br />
else it is one of only two completely free things in life. [The other if 
<br />
you remember is the benefits which come from saying 'Think positive, it 
<br />
is better for you' and acting as if you believe it.]
<br />
<br />My point in harping on in this way is simply so as to point out that:
<br />
whilst it IS necessary to assert an assumption of existence beyond 
<br />
oneself, and to be ethical it is necessary to acknowledge the 
<br />
independent existence of the other people one meets, there is no such 
<br />
more-or-less a priori reason for positing the existence of supernatural 
<br />
beings of any sort whatever. The assertion of the existence of G/god/s 
<br />
is gratuitous, and the very concept is characteristically pre-scientific.
<br />
<br />Furthermore, the very concept of an omniscient being, never mind 
<br />
omnipotent, depends for its credibility upon the acceptance of some kind 
<br />
of naive realism. That is to say, the truth concerning the types of 
<br />
awareness we actually experience and for which credible sceptically 
<br />
proficient observation has been made, always entails a very limited, 
<br />
circumscribed apprehension of self and world. This is consistent with 
<br />
the most reasonable conceptions of consciousness and sentience which 
<br />
entail the absolutely necessary activity of some kind of neural network, 
<br />
however instantiated. In other words, the only real evidence we have 
<br />
that stands up to reasonable scrutiny, supports only the idea that 
<br />
consciousness is either embodied or it doesn't exist!  I will go yet 
<br />
further and assert that not only is embodiment essential for the 
<br />
occurrence of consciousness but the process REQUIRES the representation 
<br />
in some form of both the observer and the observed plus representation 
<br />
of the current salient relationships between them. When this occurs 
<br />
then, and only then, is there something [or a somethinggoingon, for the 
<br />
purists] which can be 'like being something', as opposed to simply being 
<br />
it without knowing it.
<br />
<br />The radical and apple cart damaging entailment of this is that by the 
<br />
very nature of the process - by definition if you like - the subjective 
<br />
experience which occurs cannot possibly be all of simply being the 
<br />
entity in question. The process is one of construction, in fact I think 
<br />
the word 'updating' has an important place here too, and this process 
<br />
involves overheads, in the form of structures and processes which must 
<br />
be and occur just to keep the system running, adapting to its 
<br />
environment and repairing itself. From this it follows that even the 
<br />
biggest brains in the universe, wherever they may be and however old, 
<br />
will share with us the limitations of not being able to see the backs of 
<br />
our own eyeballs or, as George Gurdjieff put it: they too cannot jump 
<br />
over their own knees!   :-)     Who needs G/god/s like that!
<br />
