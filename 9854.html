</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno, I reviewed the archive and found no reply.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I will repeat it again, hoping for your thoughts:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from July 2, 2006 (lightly amended and then addended)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have found myself in this lifetime to be a staunch
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OP-ponent and challenger to Godel's incompleteness theorems.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Are they other math theorems you are opposed too?
<br />
To be frank, I could imagine that you believe having find an error. If 
<br />
that is the case let me know or try to publish it. I doubt it of 
<br />
course. Until now I have been able to find the error of all those who 
<br />
have pretended to me having finding such an error.
<br />
Sometimes people does not challenge Godel's proof, but some 
<br />
interpretation of it. That is a different matter, and obviously less 
<br />
simple.
<br />
Did you realize that I have, just last week, give an astonishingly 
<br />
simple proof, based on Church thesis,  of a stronger form of Godel's 
<br />
incompleteness? Did you try to follow it?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In the way that they are structured - with the premises
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Godel preset: of initial boundaries for what he was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about to design by 'proof' - his theorems -are- both
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sufficiently closed and constituently -accurate- in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; their conclusion and notions.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK you are cautious. So you criticize an interpretation of Godel's 
<br />
theorem.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; _But_ what I find disturbing about them is that they are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; RELIANT on a more formative -presumption-, which presumption
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; enables an analyst to draw quite a -contrary result- to what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Godel announced. A self-discontinuity _within_ his theorems,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as it were.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Clearly, this:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; He tacitly identifies any information resident -outside- any that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; current/known, as -eventually accessible, connectible, relatable-;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even if it means restructuring known-information in regard to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; alternative/new criteria and standards definitions, descriptions,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; statements.   A presumption/definition of universal information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; compatibility - of all information - whether known or unknown.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You could say this about my proof, or about Emil Post's one, or about 
<br />
some simplified version of it. But it is 99% unfair to say Godel made 
<br />
those presumptions. You could argue like that a little bit by invoking 
<br />
its use of the omega-consistency notion, but then that case is closed 
<br />
after Rosser's amelioration of Godel's proof. The Godel-Rosser proof 
<br />
does not rely in any way on any semantical notion, not even AR.
<br />
Godel's proof is even constructive and completely acceptable, even for 
<br />
an intuitionist.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is through this process of &quot;add then re-evaluate&quot; that new
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; paradigms are achieved.  But, it is dependent on the compatibility
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the -whole- scope of all the information present at that moment of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evaluation; and the eventual capacity to coordinate statements with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all content addressable by statements.
</em><br />
<br /><br />That is a little vague for me.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So, his thesis that at any given moment in time,
</em><br />
<br /><br />The only paper where Godel mentionned time is his general relativity 
<br />
paper about its rotating universes. Its goal was to convince Einstein 
<br />
that &quot;time&quot; could not be a serious primary concept of physics.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; not all information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is present or gathered, and that this makes for limited statement
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; making, where some evaluation statements in the data-set may instead
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be reliant on future/other yet-to-be-included information .. is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; worthy logical notion.   A closed system may not completely evaluate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; itself -- some evaluations are indeterminant.
</em><br />
<br /><br />In that vague sense I could agree with you, but we are lingering on 
<br />
many ambiguities.
<br />
It is no more clear why you say you challenge Godel, at this stage.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But, instead of focusing on the random evaluation moment, think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about what that presumption of 'eventual includability' dictates:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It heavily defines that we -can- (right now) state -something specific
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and projective- about the qualia and nature of knowledge and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; -- currently -beyond- the bounds of actual experience and encounter and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; access.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You jump from mathematical logic into the cognitive field. For this you 
<br />
need to say exactly how you do that.  What are your bridges? (I show 
<br />
comp makes such an endeavor possible, but I agree that in the 
<br />
literature such a step is most of the time made in an wrong way ... We 
<br />
need to be very careful here.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It also asserts:   information 'unknown' is compatible with and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; eventually relatable with information 'known'.
</em><br />
<br />Godel just says that: IF a proposition p is undecidable  in a theory T, 
<br />
then you can add p, or add ~p, as possible new axioms for T without 
<br />
making the new theory inconsistent.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The first foundation of Godel's '&quot;I can't decide about that&quot; Theorems'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is the contrary moot statement: 'I -can- decide about -everything- and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; here's why';  -- which is a contradiction of logic.
</em><br />
<br />The negation of ~Bp is Bp  (not B~p).   (Bp abbreviating I can prove p).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  That is:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The &quot;limited&quot; set can make true-false statement about the -totality-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of existence (internal and external to its bounded known-ness); but,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it cannot guarantee it's own true-false statements (without some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; added 'external' information, made eventually internal to a boundary).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; At which point, some/all old non-decidables would be rendered 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; decidable,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and, -new- undecidables would arise, apparently.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would say, the logic of future science and knowledge is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; -incorrectly- contrained and defined by current interpretion
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of Godel's Incompleteness Theorems.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Frankly this will depend strongly on hypotheses in fields which are
<br />
outside mathematics.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Rather, the logic of future science and knowledge
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is premised in Information and Performance Holism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The unitary interactional and information accessible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quality of Existence.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Too vague too me, sorry.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Which fundamental notion is what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Godel ignores and rejects and tries to discredit.
</em><br />
<br />?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Where, we CAN in fact make DECISIVE STATEMENTS -about that which-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the incompleteness theorems 'conclude': we should not be able
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to say -anything- at all.
</em><br />
<br />Too vague. A pity, because it looks like a point I make which is that 
<br />
on some question the first and third persons will remain mute ...
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You can absolutely place me in the community of thinkers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; who do not &quot;swallow the incompleteness phenomena&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Not really. I was thinking to mathematicians who just did not take the 
<br />
time to study it and to think of its consequence for the natural 
<br />
science once they postulate comp (like many materialist 
<br />
mathematicians).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my statements/logic are not incorrect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and they do identify the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; flaw/weakness/incorrectness in Godel.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; He used not a tautology but a self-contradictory tautology logic.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         If A then not-A ; if not-A, then never an inclusive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         (A &amp; not A) as long as not-A exists; and since not-A
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         always exists then A is not accessible to evaluate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         not-A, or perfectly assess itself, (A); HOWEVER, A -can-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         assert (A&amp;notA) and assess (A&amp;notA) which includes (not-A).
</em><br />
<br /><br />Concerning your use of the word &quot;proposition&quot;, I don't understand 
<br />
exactly what you mean by the words &quot;exists&quot; &quot;accessible&quot; &quot;perfectly 
<br />
accessible&quot;, .... The whole sentence is rather hard to follow.
<br />
Godel used this:
<br />
&nbsp;From A -&gt; B and A -&gt; ~B, infer ~A.
<br />
<br />Godel did not really use the non intuitionist principle (but readily 
<br />
accepted by arithmetical platonist):
<br />
&nbsp;From A -&gt; B and A -&gt; ~B, infer ~A.
<br />
<br />Of course Godel was platonist (even set-platonist), but he did it to 
<br />
satisfy as much as possible the finititary requirement imposed by its 
<br />
goal to solve (negatively) Hilbert's problem.
<br />
Of course with Church thesis, all this is made much simpler.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; All Godel did was give a validation for information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hiding and manipulation -- something useful to politicians
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and economic manipulators and spiritual advocates: You can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; keep people trapped and powerless by limiting their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; access to added (ostensibly important) information,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that would otherwise allow them to make decisions, which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an outer-heirarchy might not want them to make.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You are very unfair to what Godel did.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Godel's Incompleteness Theorems didn't do Science or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Math or Logic any favors.
</em><br />
<br /><br />?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Nor the societal future for that matter.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The first order rule of 'universality' is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; requisite non-excludable compatibility and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consistency.  Even if subset incompatibilities
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are conditionally allowed, (say matter and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anti-matter mutual anihilation)
</em><br />
<br /><br />How do you hope to convince anyone in any fields when you jump from one 
<br />
field to another one without giving some bridge(s). Well even when you 
<br />
give the bridges, it is hard to get scientist really listening to 
<br />
interdisciplinary stuff..., but without the bridges it is akin to 
<br />
nonsense, and this can add to the (relatively) sane skepticism of 
<br />
scientists in front of interdiscisplinarity .... You don't help me or 
<br />
us!
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  the fact that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they interact at all indicates they -share-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'reaction' parameters; they may not survive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interaction but they are 'interactionable'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; due to shared scope of qualia.
</em><br />
<br />?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The most extreme form of universality is forms
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that 'exist' but cannot even communicate (interact);
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The possibility of co-existing in the same domain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but perfectly non-interactive.  &quot;Universality&quot; allows
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this -and- by doing so completes perfect self-definition.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Non-information transferability is umbrellaed in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'the universal' and affirms that there is an ultimate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; holistic compatibility state for all extancy of any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sort or non-sort.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The ultimate/absolute &quot;invariance rule&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; After this, partitioning gets you to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mini-rules (like the Godel Incmp Thms).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But first and foremost: nothing exists absent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of co-existence or 'environment'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; With the corrolary: nothing is perfectly self-definied -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; companion existence is included even if sufficiently
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distanced to be functionally disregarded for local purposes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Which then leads to the logical deduction that no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'clone' or -seemingly- &quot;duplicate&quot; can ever be.
</em><br />
<br /><br />?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; No 'perfect replicate' persona is possible -- without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the perfect replication (without ANY variance) of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entire rest of the universe as well.  No matter how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; uncannily close in replication, each individual must of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; needs, be its -own persona-.
</em><br />
<br /><br />?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But the first order of business is to clean
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; house and get out from under Godel's mis-leading
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; authority &amp; ideas.  !
</em><br />
<br /><br />Godel was a modest researcher who solved one of the most hard question 
<br />
by Hilbert.
<br />
He was so modest that although a high percentage of its writing is 
<br />
philosophical, he will rarely publish them because he was not 
<br />
personally satisfied.
<br />
Godel's theorems in logic has been very fertile, a big part of 
<br />
mathematical logic borrows from Godel ideas.
<br />
His incompleteness 1931 paper is still today one of the better 
<br />
presentation of its first incompleteness theorem.
<br />
As a mathematician, he has been a giant, even if you forget its 
<br />
&quot;incompleteness&quot; contribution.
<br />
How can you make so big statement?
<br />
<br />Have you read any book by Hao Wang? It is a very good expert on Godel's 
<br />
life and work.
<br />
Do you know the work of Judson Webb?        [ref in my thesis]
