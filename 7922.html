Hi Godfrey,
<br />
<br />Le 18-août-05, à 20:27, kurtleegod.domain.name.hidden a écrit :
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [BM]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  OK. Now I agree with Lee, and many on the FOR and the Everything 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lists that Everett (many-worlds + decoherence already) constitutes a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;solution of the measurement problem&quot;. All measurements are just 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interaction, and then all states are relative. As I said, it seems to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; me that this is even more clear in the integral formulation of QM 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where F = ma can be deduced from the &quot;sum on all histories&quot;. But this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is going a little bit out of topics, and is not needed to understand 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the comp derivation. We can come back on this latter.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [GK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Here we part company. MWI (I prefer to call it Everett's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Interpretation or EQM) is NOT a solution to the measurement
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  problem of QM but an Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics that does 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not lead to that problem! It does however have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  a tripartite problem of its own that, in my opinion, is just the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measurement problem blown up. In any case what you say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  afterwords does not follow (from EQM or QM). There are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non-interactive measurements that people have been looking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  into for a while now (Dicke, Elitzur-Vaidman, etc...). I am sure you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; guys touched on these sometime ago...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  But all of this is irrelevant for my purpose at hand which is for you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to commit to the proposition that &quot;No-YD: no Bruno&quot;!
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />We agree it is not relevant for our purpose! Just two words: As a 
<br />
logician I don't consider Everett proposed a new interpretation of 
<br />
quantum mechanics, but a new formulation of quantum mechanics. It is 
<br />
really SWE + comp. (as opposed to the Copenhagen formulation which is 
<br />
SWE + &quot;an unintelligible dualist theory of mind&quot;. Then what I say can 
<br />
be sum up like this: Everett theory is redundant: SWE follows from 
<br />
comp. But this is another thread, and we can come back on Everett 
<br />
later.
<br />
&quot;No YD, no Bruno&quot;!?!   You make me anxious :)
<br />
<br />SWE : Schroedinger Wave Equation
<br />
YD: Saying Yes to a doctor who propose you an artificial digital 
<br />
&quot;generalized brain&quot;. First axiom of comp.
<br />
(Some people complains out-of-line for the acronyms, so I repeat them 
<br />
once by mail).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  It seems to me that you are weaseling out of it but I don't quite 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; care if you take refuge in another Everett World.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  would be a cop out and I am sure you know it. I want you and I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; digitised IN THIS WORLD! I don't care for copies!
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Well: not of copies IN THIS WORLD, I guess. Giving that that is really 
<br />
the by-product of saying YES to the DOCTOR (YD).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [GK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I don't much care what you can deduce from COMP, Bruno. I care that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; COMP=YD+CT+AR and that shooting down YD would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  shoot down COMP. You could very well deduce from COMP my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non-existence if YD is false.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Only if YD is *proved*  false!!! (I could deduce your inexistence from 
<br />
the SWE if any TOE (theory of everything) which supposed SWE true, if 
<br />
SWE is false!). You are saying something very general here!
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  BM: Ouh la la. You are close to the 1004 fallacy (asking for more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; precise definition than the reasoning itself). At the start you can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; use the term &quot;axioms&quot;, &quot;postulates&quot;, &quot;theses&quot;, &quot;premises&quot;, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;assumptions&quot;, &quot;hypotheses&quot;, etc.. in a similar way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [GK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I think you get my point. I am not asking for precision at all. I am 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pointing out that thesis and doctrines are not hypotheses
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  tout court. These three &quot;assumptions&quot; do not have the same epistemic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; status and it is misleading to call them the same.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  If you don't like it, than acknowledge my pragmatics: if your 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point-of-view is falsifiable it should be so without compromising 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; either CT and AR which stand very well on their own as you underscore 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; below:
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Mmhhh... This is your opinion, and perhaps mine. But not of most people 
<br />
to which my proof is addressed (computer scientist).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [GK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Agreed, than . In any case one unassailable counterexample would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shoot down CT, deep and &quot; Kleene&quot; as it is (:-)
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Exactly!
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [BM]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Well, I have decided to put it explicitly, because, in front of my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reasoning, some people cop out simply by saying &quot;Ah, but you are a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; platonist!&quot;. So I prefer to say it at once. I agree with you it is a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sort of &quot;cop out&quot;. Now, although 99,99999999 % of the mathematician 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are platonist during the week, most like to pretends they are not (the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; week-end!).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [GK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ditto.
</em><br />
<br />Hope you are not serious!
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (skiip)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (1) YD is obviously independent from CT and AR
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'course.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [GK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Good!
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Well, you will perhaps accuse me of weaseling out again, but thinking 
<br />
twice, I believe I have answer too quickly in the sense that for saying 
<br />
yes for an artificial *digital* brain to a Doctor you need to know a 
<br />
bit what &quot;digital&quot; means, and for this you need CT (Church Thesis), and 
<br />
for this, I think, you need AR (Arithmetical Realism). But as you say, 
<br />
CT and AR are mainly bodyguards of YD.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; (2) GK: CT and AR stand no chance of being falsified empirically 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (or we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; both like them that way, which is the same).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [BM]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I give the opportunity to make comp false in more than one way. If 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you read the Maudlin paper, you will see that he consider the YD 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doctor (or equivalent) as tautologically true (unlike the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; functionnalist hypothesis). This is due to the fact that, unlike many 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; older computationalist or mechanist, I put no bound on the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; low-levelness of the substitution level.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I can say yes to the doctor provided that he simulates my brain at 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the chromodynamical level, including all partiocles having interacted 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with any other particles in the past (in which case my brain is the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;physical universe&quot; itself. My brain could be a quantum computer, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; without violating comp. The no-cloning theorem does not interfere.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [GK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  That is actually where it gets interesting. I will have to sharpen up 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a bit of your YD but in ways that would not invalidate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your general use of it. More about that later.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; (3) No one that we know has been able to extract conclusions such as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; yours from CT &amp; AR without YD (right)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  This is a subtle question. The *necessity* of the reversal is hardly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understandable without the YD assumption. But once you grasp the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessity of the reversal, then the very derivation of natural science 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from computer science does not use it at all. Indeed the cognitive 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; science's &quot;grand-mother&quot; is completely substituted by the Lobian 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Machine at this stage. So, with OCCAM razor, once enough of physics is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; derived, you can eliminate the grand-mother and the whole YD 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumption. Some mathematician asked me to put the UDA argument under 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the form: motivation&quot;, and to state that my real &quot;scientific&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hypothesis are CT and AR. I find that dishonest and misleading, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because, without understanding the necessity of the reversal, the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interview of the Lobian machine would resemble to nothing but a little 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; piece of pure mathematics, especially given that I have until now 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; extracted to few real physics to really call OCCAM. All my papers 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; introduce the grandmother (and YD), and then translate the argument in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Lobian language.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  But then if the logics of the observables that I have derived from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comp (at the necessary place) appears to be von Neumann Quantum 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logics, I know people will eliminate the grandmother and the YD, for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bad reasons (They want pure math, they hate cognitive science, etc.). 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My fear is that people take the epistemological elimination of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; grand-mother (and the YD assumtion) as an ontological elimination of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the first person, and nothing could be more wrong than that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; See the footnote 3. in the SANE paper, and the text
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [GK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Bruno, you are weaseling out again, here! Let me ask you this in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; clear terms again:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Can you, Yes or No, derive your whole &quot;grand manege&quot; from CT and AR 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; alone?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Because if it is a &quot;yes&quot; here I will give you the Oscar (and the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Nobel) and let you go. I can than concentrate on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  being a good machine for the rest of my existence since I don't want 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to loose my platonic allegiances or my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; heuristic acquiescence to CT.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />If by &quot;grand manege&quot; you mean the physical laws: the answer is YES ! 
<br />
(Thanks for the Oscar and Nobel :).
<br />
If by &quot;grand manege&quot; you mean deriving the physical laws and 
<br />
understanding why it is necessarily so, the answer is probably NO. (Nor 
<br />
could Everett derive the Wave Collapse appearance without something 
<br />
equivalent to the YD).
<br />
<br /><br /><br />[skip]
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [GK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Thanks for the vote of confidence (;-) If I may add a personal note: 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno, I am sure more knowledgeable people than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  myself have pointed out that it is hard to get accross to you because 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you seem so wrapped up in your &quot;demonstration&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  that you express yourself in the language you develop to devise it !
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />With the YD, perhaps. But then that is why I take 20 years to translate 
<br />
the argument in pure arithmetics and I have use that translation to 
<br />
show that comp is 100% testable.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is one of the reasons I would rather take you up
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  on your premise rather than having to read and judge the rest of your 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; paper which I am not even confident I could. I think this is a more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constructive use of my  time and your patience.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />But this is just fair!  For refuting a proof in applied logic it is 
<br />
sufficient to show the inconsistency of the premises. If you succeed 
<br />
not only you really don't need to follow the UDA steps (UDA= Universal 
<br />
Dovetalier Argument), but nobody will ever need to do that!
<br />
Actually the two or three first steps of UDA are just there to make the 
<br />
premises clearer.
<br />
Please note that in the UDA I generally add supplementary hypotheses 
<br />
which I eliminate later with the Universal Dovetailer.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What I would like to do next is the following:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  1) State the YD hypothesis in a way that is both consistent with your 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; statement and useful for my purposes. I will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  do that in a separate thread shortly. I need you to agree on that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; version, of course.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Careful: your statement should not just be consistent with YD, but 
<br />
equivalent to it or at least imply by it to derive something ...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  2) Once you agree I will tell you a little parable (allegory is more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; platonic, I guess) that illustrates the strict use of that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; statement and the contradition that obtains from it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  3) After that I will tell you what that contradiction may be useful 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in settling a certain dispute on the question of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whether QM has anything to say about consciousness or not.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK?  What do you say?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I am very interested, Godfrey. Please go and shoot comp. You would be 
<br />
the first.
<br />
But remember that in YD there is a use of folk-psychology or 
<br />
grand-mother psychology (a fundamental concept of theoretical cognitive 
<br />
science/philosophy of mind), and then I translate the argument in 
<br />
arithmetic, and the grandmother will be substituted by the 
<br />
introspective universal machine (which I call also the &quot;Lobian Machine&quot; 
<br />
in honor of Lob).
<br />
<br />Bruno
