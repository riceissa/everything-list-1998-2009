<br />Thanks for the article, it is beautifully presented
<br />
and re-presented good entertainment for me. 
<br />
<br />Brought back memories from Tegmark's child-age, when I
<br />
joined the chorus: &quot;the Big Bang that never happened&quot; 
<br />
and I formulated my version of why?: the retroactive
<br />
vision of Hubble's ingenious idea of an expanding
<br />
universe (because the redshift brought the acoustic
<br />
Dopler phenomenon to his mind in 1921) - it followed a
<br />
reverse route of a linear (d)evolution of the universe
<br />
from 'today's state' as our reductionist model shows
<br />
it from classical physics through QM - QED to even
<br />
postQ visions. The universe evolved non-linearly (some
<br />
like still to use the word: 'chaotically') so a
<br />
retrograde linearity is at best misconstrued. Then it
<br />
was assumed that all the 'physical laws' of our
<br />
presently observed model were fully applicable in
<br />
systems incredibly different from the present status -
<br />
sometimes with corrections I have to admit. It led to
<br />
a 'date' of the BB and a close date showed a sizable
<br />
universe in the calculations, so it must have inflated
<br />
(somehow - oh, that darn word!).
<br />
Tegmark does not ask: is there any real background for
<br />
such an inflationary belief? he asked &quot;How can &quot;THE&quot;
<br />
inflation tested&quot;? I have a conciliant mind and said:
<br />
Inflation? so be it. Ideationally, of course, because
<br />
we cannot know a word about 'how was that stage of
<br />
affairs THEN? My solution includes the 'change' in the
<br />
'consciousness' of the universe inside view when the
<br />
Space - Time ordering occurred (after a Big Bang which
<br />
I made in my narrative logically acceptable and quite
<br />
inevitable, pushing the 'unknown' one step backwards).
<br />
When the system changed from &quot;no space&quot; into &quot;space&quot;
<br />
it signified a 'huge' inflation from zero to big.
<br />
Similarly the marvels of the fractions of the &quot;1st
<br />
sec&quot; to introduce the physical narratives into that
<br />
starting universe of ours are natural, when the
<br />
a-temporal has changed into time-ordered, all right at
<br />
the beginning.
<br />
Now I imagined the instant of the ordering, but the
<br />
physicists like to measure and so they needed a
<br />
timespan, short enough to be negligible. (1^-43sec?).
<br />
<br />Then, when 
<br />
Tegmar finished high school, I retired and worked out
<br />
a narrative of 'that' plenitude which gave rise
<br />
inevitably to the flash-wise fulgurations of
<br />
groupings, complexity-nods which (from the inside
<br />
view) are ALL universes (infinite number and
<br />
unrestricted qualities of them). That was my
<br />
Multiverse in an atemporal, aspatial plenitude,
<br />
dissipating as they formed, back, into the infinite
<br />
invariance, but allowing in their (universal?) inside
<br />
histories extended to a possible time-factor if such
<br />
developed in a particular universe.
<br />
I called such fulgurational occurrences BigBangs (one
<br />
word) and differentiated the 'inside view' - call it
<br />
physical etc. system, from the plenitude-view which
<br />
did not even notice them.
<br />
So the quewtion: where did we all come from? is not so
<br />
exciting in the views of my narrative.
<br />
<br />Thanks again for the URL, it was an interesting
<br />
lecture.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Tegmark's essay was not well received (perhaps

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; How did it all begin?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Authors: Max Tegmark
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Comments: 6 pages, 6 figs, essay for 2005 Young
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Scholars Competition in

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; How did it all begin? Although this question has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; undoubtedly lingered for as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; long as humans have walked the Earth, the answer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; still eludes us. Yet since
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my grandparents were born, scientists have been able
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to refine this question
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to a degree I find truly remarkable. In this brief
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; essay, I describe some of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my own past and ongoing work on this topic,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; centering on cosmological
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inflation. I focus on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (1) observationally testing whether this picture is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correct and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (2) working out implications for the nature of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical reality (e.g., the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; global structure of spacetime, dark energy and our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cosmic future, parallel
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universes and fundamental versus environmental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical laws).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (2) clearly requires (1) to determine whether to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; believe the conclusions. I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argue that (1) also requires (2), since it affects
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the probability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; calculations for inflation's observational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; predictions.
