<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From: Wei Dai &lt;weidai.domain.name.hidden&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The selection of the proper reference class is a serious problem for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;anthropic reasoning.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, though there have been suggestions about it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;But perhaps anthropic reasoning is not necessary to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;take advantage of a theory of everything.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Consider how an non-sentient being (excluded by most proposals for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reference class) can use a TOE. Imagine a non-sentient oracle that was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;built to accomplish some goal (for example to maximize some definition of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;social welfare) by answering questions people send it.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any reasonable goal will, like social welfare, involve a function of the 
<br />
(unnormalized) measure distribution of conscious thoughts.  What else would 
<br />
social welfare mean?  For example, it could be to maximize the number of 
<br />
thoughts with a &quot;happiness&quot; property greater than &quot;life sucks&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The oracle could work by first locating all instances of itself with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;significant measure which are about the answer the question it's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;considering (by simulating all possible worlds and looking for itself in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the simulations).
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you also bring in measure that way.  By the way, this is a bad idea: 
<br />
if the simulations are too perfect, they will give rise to conscious 
<br />
thoughts of their own!  So, you should be careful with it.  The very act of 
<br />
using the oracle could create a peculiar multiverse, when you just want to 
<br />
know if you should buy one can of veggies or two.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Then for every potential answer, it computes the approximate consequences 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;for the meta-universe if all of its instances were to give that answer.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Finally it gives the answer that would maximize the value function.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm glad you said approximate.  Of course Godel's theorem implies that 
<br />
it will never be able to exactly model a system containing itself.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Sentient beings can follow the same decision procedure used by the oracle.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Suppose you are faced with a bet involving a tossed coin. There is no need 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to consider probabilistic questions like &quot;what is the probability that the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;coin landed heads?&quot; which would involve anthropic reasoning.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;You know that there are worlds where it landed heads and worlds where it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;landed tails, and that there are instances of you in all of these worlds 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;which are indistinguishable from each other from the first-person 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;perspective.  You can make the decision by considering the consequences of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;each choice if all instances of you were to make that choice.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You need to know which type of thought has greater measure, &quot;I saw 
<br />
heads, and ...&quot; or &quot;I saw tails, and ...&quot;.  I call the measure of one, 
<br />
divided by the total measure, the *effective* probability, since it 
<br />
(roughly) plays the role of the probability for decision theory.  But you 
<br />
have a point in a way ...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decision theory is not exactly the same as anthropic reasoning.  In 
<br />
decision theory, you want to do something to maximize some utility function. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;By contrast, anthropic reasoning is used when you want to find out some 
<br />
information.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This difference could be important in terms of the concern over the 
<br />
reference class: while the reference class for anthropic reasoning may leave 
<br />
out all thoughts that don't employ anthropic reasoning, there is no reason 
<br />
that the utility function shouldn't depend on *all* thoughts.  (It could 
<br />
also depend on other things, but any sane person will mainly care about 
<br />
thoughts.)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, suppose if I choose A I will be more likely to later think 
<br />
about anthropic reasoning than if I choose B.  This will affect my guess as 
<br />
to how likely I am to choose A, but it will not affect my decision unless I 
<br />
place a special utility on (or have a special dislike of) thinking about it.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the reference class issue has another component that does still come 
<br />
into play.  How am I to evaluate my utility function, unless I know how to 
<br />
identify and measure conscious thoughts in the math model?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the way, I don't think you should say &quot;first-person perspective&quot;.  
<br />
Some people on this list think it means something other than just saying you 
<br />
look at all instances of a particular class of thoughts, but it doesn't.  
<br />
But that's for another post and another day.  (I guess I'll have to 
<br />
partially back up James Higgo.)
