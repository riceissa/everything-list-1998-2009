<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You find yourself in a locked room with no windows, and no memory of how you

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; got there. The room is sparsely furnished: a chair, a desk, pen and paper, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and in one corner a light. The light is currently red, but in the time you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have been in the room you have observed that it alternates between red and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; green every 10 minutes. Other than the coloured light, nothing in the room 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seems to change. Opening one of the desk drawers, you find a piece of paper 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with incredibly neat handwriting. It turns out to be a letter from God, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; revealing that you have been placed in the room as part of a philosophical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiment. Every 10 minutes, the system alternates between two states. One 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; state consists of you alone in your room. The other state consists of 10^100 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exact copies of you, their minds perfectly synchronised with your mind, each 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; copy isolated from all the others in a room just like yours. Whenever the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; light changes colour, it means that God is either instantaneously creating 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (10^100 - 1) copies, or instantaneously destroying all but one randomly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; chosen copy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Your task is to guess which colour of the light corresponds with which state 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and write it down. Then God will send you home.
</em><br />
<br />Let me make a few comments about this experiment.  I would find it quite
<br />
alarming to be experiencing these conditions.  When the light changes
<br />
and I go from the high to the low measure state, I would expect to die.
<br />
When it goes from the low to the high measure state, I would expect that
<br />
my next moment is in a brand new consciousness (that shares memories
<br />
with the old).  Although the near-certainty of death is balanced by the
<br />
near-certainty of birth, it is to such an extreme degree that it seems
<br />
utterly bizarre.  Conscious observers should not be created and destroyed
<br />
so cavalierly, not if they know about it.
<br />
<br />Suppose you stepped out of a duplicating booth, and a guy walked up with
<br />
a gun, aimed it at you, pulled the trigger and killed you.  Would you
<br />
say, oh, well, I'm only losing two seconds of memories, my counterpart
<br />
will go on anyway?  I don't think so, I think you would be extremely
<br />
alarmed and upset at the prospect of your death.  The existence of
<br />
your counterpart would be small comfort.  I am speaking specifically
<br />
of your views, Stathis, because I think you have already expressed your
<br />
disinterest in your copies.
<br />
<br />God is basically putting you in this situation, but to an enormously,
<br />
unimaginably vaster degree.  He is literally &quot;playing God&quot; with your
<br />
consciousness.  I would say it's a very bad thing to do.
<br />
<br />And what happens at the end?  Suppose I guess right, all 10^100 of me?
<br />
How do we all go home?  Does God create 10^100 copies of entire
<br />
universes for all my copies to go home to as a reward?  I doubt it!
<br />
Somehow I think the old guy is going to kill me off again, all but one
<br />
infinitesimal fraction of me, and let this tiny little piece go home.
<br />
<br />Well, so what?  What good is that?  Why do I care, given that I am
<br />
going to die, what happens to the one in 10^100 part of me?  That's an
<br />
inconceivably small fraction.
<br />
<br />In fact, I might actually prefer to have that tiny fraction stay in the
<br />
room so I can be reborn.  Having 10^100 copies 50% of the time gives me
<br />
a lot higher measure than just being one person.  I know I just finished
<br />
complaining about the ethical problems of putting a conscious entity in
<br />
this situation, but maybe there are reasons to think it's good.
<br />
<br />So I don't necessarily see that I am motivated to follow God's
<br />
instructions and try to guess.  I might just want to sit there.
<br />
And in any case, the reward from guessing right seems pretty slim
<br />
and unmotivating.  Congratulations, you get to die.  Whoopie.
<br />
<br />Hal Finney
