<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; An excellent essay.  I agree with almost everything you wrote; and you put it very well.  Would you mind if I cross posted it to Vic Stenger's AVOID-L mailing list.  You can check out the list here: <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/">http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/</a>

<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Although Victor Stenger doesn't use the word &quot;anti-natural&quot;, the

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; following equation is what he is assuming in his atheistic arguments:

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; supernatural = anti-natural.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Therefore he thinks that a proof of theism would amount to finding a

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; violation of natural law.  Since he finds no such violation (which I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; would argue is a circular argument based on the definition of natural)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; he claim this proves atheism beyond a reasonable doubt (what is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; measure of certainty/uncertainty?).
</em><br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; In terms of Bruno's provability, this is akin to saying that a proof of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the existence of a non-trivial G*/G can be obtained by finding an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; inconsistency in G.  This does not make sense.  This is like saying the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; only god that can exist is an inconsistent god.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; A theist God (as opposed to a deist God) is one who intervenes in the natural order, i.e. does miracles.  Stenger will readily admit that his argument does not apply to a deist God.

<br />The problem (or challenge :) is that the meaning of &quot;natural order&quot;
<br />
is open to much debate, especially here on the Everything List.
<br />
Everything is up for grabs, so much so that it can be a challenge to
<br />
figure out where any order comes from, resulting in problems such as
<br />
white rabbits.  When we start with Everything, the problem is not just
<br />
&quot;How can anything interesting happen (like life, not to mention our
<br />
stereotypical 'miracles'?&quot; (the something-from-nothing question),
<br />
but also &quot;How can any order be birthed out of the plenitudinous sea
<br />
of disorder?&quot;  So in this Everything context, not having the whole
<br />
picture of what the &quot;natural order&quot; is implies a lack of knowledge
<br />
of what it would be to &quot;intervene&quot; on the natural order.
<br />
<br />Of course if we're talking about theism, then the nature of
<br />
&quot;intervention&quot; is limited by certain parameters related to whatever
<br />
god is supposedly intervening.  These parameters are a function of
<br />
contingent aspects, such as, in the case of the biblical God's
<br />
universe, the presence of evil and sacrificial love.  But such facts
<br />
are probably considered too contingent for a List like this, where
<br />
Everything is supposed to be impersonal.  (Is it?) Unfortunately, as
<br />
Blaise Pascal noted, if the solution to the problem of evil is based on
<br />
contingent facts, then staying at a general metaphysical (Everything)
<br />
level is not going to get us in contact with the solution.    One
<br />
possible insight that we can get from Everything-level discussion, if
<br />
the thinker is willing to accept it, is to realize that a solution
<br />
based on contingent facts in history is not ruled out by general
<br />
philosophical thought about Everything.  Another insight is to realize
<br />
that there is no solution to the problem of evil (or the mind-body
<br />
problem...) at the (non-contingent) Everything level.  And if there's
<br />
no solution to a problem that is part of the universe, then perhaps the
<br />
(impersonal) Everything approach is not sufficient for dealing with
<br />
everything.
<br />
<br />Getting back to the more impersonal question, as has been observed on
<br />
this List multiple times, there is a problem with discerning the source
<br />
of order in the universe.  Where does this natural order come from that
<br />
we can make laws about it, and predict nature's actions fairly
<br />
accurately, at least for our purposes?  Why is it that we aren't
<br />
destroyed by savage white rabbits out of nowhere?  Proposed
<br />
explanations include the use of ideas such as the Anthropic Principle,
<br />
Occam's Razor, some kind of &quot;measure&quot;, numbers, local order at
<br />
the expense of disorder somewhere else far away, etc.  So again, in the
<br />
light of this lack of understanding, it seems pretty presumptuous for
<br />
us to say that there must not be interventions in the natural order
<br />
simply because we don't see any as we've defined them. (Then we
<br />
trap ourselves even more when we attach the label &quot;natural order&quot;
<br />
to Everything we observe, whether we can explain it &quot;naturally&quot; or
<br />
not.)  Perhaps the following analogy will help to open up the
<br />
possibilities (not probabilities!) in our brains.  This is from C.S.
<br />
Lewis as he put it in his book &quot;Miracles&quot;.
<br />
<br />Tom
<br />
<br />&quot;Let us suppose a race of people whose peculiar mental limitation
<br />
compels them to regard a painting as something made up of little
<br />
coloured dots which have been put together like a mosaic.  Studying the
<br />
brushwork of a great painting through their magnifying glasses, they
<br />
discover more and more complicated relations between the dots, and sort
<br />
these relations out, with great toil, into certain regularities.  Their
<br />
labour will not be in vain.  These regularities will in fact
<br />
&quot;work&quot;; they will cover most of the facts.  But if they go on to
<br />
conclude that any departure from them would be unworthy of the painter,
<br />
and an arbitrary breaking of his own rules, they will be far astray.
<br />
For the regularities they have observed never were the rule the painter
<br />
was following.  What they painfully reconstruct from a million dots,
<br />
arranged in an agonizing complexity, he really produced with a single
<br />
lightning-quick turn of the wrist, his eye meanwhile taking in the
<br />
canvass as a whole and his mind obeying laws of composition which the
<br />
observers, counting their dots, have not yet come within sight of, and
<br />
perhaps never will.  I do not say that the normalities of Nature are
<br />
unreal.  The living fountain of divine energy, solidified for purposes
<br />
of this spatio-temporal Nature into bodies moving in space and time,
<br />
and thence, by our abstract thought, turned into mathematical formula,
<br />
does in fact, for us, commonly fall into such and such patterns. But to
<br />
think that a disturbance of them would constitute a breach of the
<br />
living rule and organic unity whereby God, from his own point of view,
<br />
works, is a mistake. If miracles do occur then we may be sure that not
<br />
to have wrought them would be the real inconsistency.&quot;
