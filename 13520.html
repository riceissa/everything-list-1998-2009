</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I don't believe that people in this list would take consciousness as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; primary reality, except perhaps those who singles out the third
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;universal soul&quot; hypostasis (the first person, alias the one described
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; by Bp &amp; p in the lobian interview) like George Levy, David, etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Since my name has popped up I'll stop lurking and come clean!  I've
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; been thinking about this again since reading Galen Strawson's recent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; defence of 'panpsychism' in &quot;Consciousness and its place in Nature&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; His view is that any 'emergent' phenomenon must supervene on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fundamental properties of the same type - e.g. 'liquidity' is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; characteristic behaviour of a fluid that simply supervenes on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; objective characteristics of its constituent molecules, which in turn
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; supervenes on quantum-level phenomena and so on down to superstrings
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or whatever.  But there is no analogous narrative in which it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correspondingly obvious that 1st-person *experience* should ever
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'emerge' from any objective or 3rd-person description, in his view.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Also in mine.  Reviewing some of my earlier posts on this subject, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would now say that my view is that our 1st-person experience is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; privileged direct evidence (i.e. the *only* direct evidence we have)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that we, and all phenomena of which we are aware, emerge through
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; differentiation of a subjective existential field. Such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; differentiation may be termed 'sense-action', because it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simultaneously the self-sensing relationships of (what Strawson terms)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'ultimates' (e.g. vibrational strings) that emerge through
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; differentiation, and the source of all action and structure.  We
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; abstract our notion of 'physical law' from the inter-relations of such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ultimates, but it is crucial that we do not concretise such 'law' as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some real superadded influence introjected from 'outside' the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existential field.  Rather, we take the field for what it is, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; accept that it feels and does as we find it.  This is simply wielding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Occam's razor with precision to prevent an infinite regress of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'explanation'. Ultimately, to preserve the appearances, existence must
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessarily be self-actualising , self-motivating, and self-sensing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; By rooting sense-action in the ultimates, we can now embed our own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intuitive sensing and motivation firmly where it needs to be in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ultimate reality.  Fundamentally, we do what we do for (something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like) the reasons we believe, and we feel what we feel because that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (something like) how reality ultimately feels about it.  Our actions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emerge from ultimate action, and our sensing emerges from ultimate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sensing.  This is crucial for questions of 'free will' and suffering
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (which I do not put in scare quotes).  Our 'will' is a complex
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emergent of ultimate will-to-action, and our painful experiences are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; directly inherited from underlying layers of sense-action that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simultaneously motivate our consequential actions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; By contrast, the 'non-conscious' zombie is existentially and causally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; disconnected - as postulated, it is abstracted from sense-action; it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cannot see, hear, or feel and hence cannot enact (except in *our*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; imagination).  No self-sensing = no relationship = no action.  The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; poor creature is a free-standing 'physical abstraction' - the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; uninhabited husk of a self-actualised subject.  It's the notion you're
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; left with when you posit an 'externalised world' (i.e. a model) in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pure intellectual abstraction from concrete self-actualisation.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Up to here comp basically agree (modulo misunderstanding of my part, 
<br />
sure).
<br />
I mean that what you say is not just consistent with comp (which is not 
<br />
a lot after Godel: even inconsistency is consistent with comp!) but 
<br />
probably near truth.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; With comp neither matter nor mind can be taken as primitive or primary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; reality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My approach proposes something like a fundamental subjective field as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'primitive' (in an Occamish way).  Such a field is not yet mind nor
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter, but both 'mind' and 'matter' emerge from it through
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; differentiation, with characteristics that supervene naturally on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; those proposed as primitive.  That is: its fundamental action is self-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; motivated and self-sensing, and consequently all complex emergents are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experienced as self-motivated and self-sensing.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Well, perhaps OK, unless by field you assume geometry at the start. 
<br />
(Geometry like physics is secondary with comp).
<br />
You could perhaps elaborate of what you mean by field.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If valid, this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; approach is a knock-down argument against the equation of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness with computation.
</em><br />
<br />Careful: comp cannot equate consciousness and computation. It can only 
<br />
&quot;equate&quot; consciousness with higher order emergent modality (emergent on 
<br />
a continuum of computations).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The reason is that computational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'causation' depends on the introjection of 'rules' from a context
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; external to the computed 'world',
</em><br />
<br /><br />I don't see why.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and hence loses contact both with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intrinsic causal self-motivation and the fundamental linkage of felt-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense and action.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You are quick here ...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hence any felt-sense a computer may possess as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concrete object must necessarily be independent of whatever purely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; programmed 'actions' it may be instantiating.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I do agree here. It fits comp ...
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Also, the notion of,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; say, a rock implementing any computation, and hence potentially any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attached consciousness, is likewise struck down by the lack of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; coordination between ultimate sense-action and the notional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computational content.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree, but this remains to be verified with comp. Indeed it is part 
<br />
of what makes comp testable empirically.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I've written the above fairly quickly and it's probably not very well
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; expressed, but if anyone's interested I'd be happy to debate and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; enlarge.  But it expresses why I think Torgny's position is absolutely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; untenable.
</em><br />
<br /><br />We do agree on that (although with comp Torgny's position is, like 
<br />
first person solipsism, quasi undecidable).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If he were 'unconscious' as he claims he would be a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; zombie, and hence, abstracted from the reality of sense-action, he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would exist only in our imaginations.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I see your point and tend to agree. BTW, note that the Bohm 
<br />
intepretation of QM is full of zombie of that kind. Without comp, 
<br />
sorry, but I would much less agree with you on this point.
<br />
<br />After Godel, Lob, .... I do think that comp is the best we can hope to 
<br />
&quot;save&quot; the notion of consciousness, free will, responsibility, qualia, 
<br />
(first)-persons, and many notions like that.  Tthe &quot;only&quot; price: the 
<br />
notion of matter looses is fundamental character, and we have to 
<br />
explain matter without postulating it as usual ...). We have to come 
<br />
back (assuming comp) to Plato, or better Plotinus, Proclus, ...
<br />
<br />But I realize that few people really swallow Godel, Lob ... and 
<br />
mathematical logic (except mathematical logicians). I guess that is 
<br />
perhaps the real difficulty here.
