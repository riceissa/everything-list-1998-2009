Eric,
<br />
<br />your proposal sounds like: &quot;here I am and here is my mind&quot; .
<br />
What gave you the idea that &quot;the two&quot; can be thought of as separate
<br />
entities?
<br />
The fact that we differentiate between a bowel movement and a thinking
<br />
process in philosophy and constructed separate noumena for 'mental' and
<br />
'bodily' aspects (call it res extensa and res cogitans, soul/body,
<br />
mind/flesh or whatever is your actual distaste) does not MAKE them separate
<br />
entities. The ONE complexity 'human' (part of the whole, anyway) has aspects
<br />
we more, or less observe, and in primitive thinking we personnify them into
<br />
'units', called by stupid names. And then write smart - awardwinning? -
<br />
books on them.
<br />
<br />Happy New Year
<br />
<br />John Mikes

&gt; What does a mind do?
&gt;
&gt; A mind in an intelligent animal, such as ourselves, does the following:
&gt;
&gt; 1. Interprets sense-data and symbolically represents the objects,
relationships, processes,
&gt; and more generally, situations that occur in its environment.
&gt;
&gt;       Extra buzzwords: segmentation, individuation,
&gt;                        &quot;cutting the world with a knife into this and
not-this&quot;
&gt;                        (paraphrased from Zen &amp; The Art of Motorcycle
Maintenance)
&gt;
&gt; 2. Creates both specific models of specific situations and their
constituents,
&gt; and abstracted, generalized models of important classes of situations and
situation
&gt; constituents, using techniques such as cluster analysis, logical induction
and abduction,
&gt; bayesian inference (or effectively equivalent processes).
&gt;
&gt;       Extra buzzwords: &quot;structure pump&quot;, &quot;concept formation&quot;, &quot;episodic
memory&quot;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; 3. Recognizes new situations, objects, relationships, processes as being
instances
&gt; of already represented specific or generalized situations, objects,
relationships,
&gt; processes.
&gt;
&gt; The details of the recognition processes vary across sensory domains, but
probably
&gt; commonly use things like: matching at multiple levels of abstraction with
feedback
&gt; between levels, massively parallel matching processes, abstraction
lattices.
&gt;
&gt;     Extra buzzwords: patterns, pattern-matching, neural net algorithms,
&gt;                      constraint-logic-programming, associative recall
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; 4. Builds up, through sense-experience, representation, and recognition
processes,
&gt; over time, an associatively interrelated &quot;library of
symbolic+probabilistic models or
&gt; micro-theories&quot; about contexts in the environment.
&gt;
&gt; 5. Holds micro-theories in degrees of belief. That is, in degrees of being
considered
&gt; a good &quot;simple, corresponding, explanatory, successfully predictive&quot; model
of some
&gt; aspect of the environment.
&gt;
&gt; 6. Adjusts degrees of belief through a continual process of theory
extension,
&gt; hypothesis testing against new observations, incremental theory revision,
assessment of
&gt; competing extended theories etc. In short, performs a mini, personalized
equivalent
&gt; of &quot;the history of science forming the evolving set of well-accepted
scientific
&gt; theories&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; Degree of belief in each micro-theory is influenced by factors such as:
&gt;
&gt; a. Repeated success of theory at prediction under trial against new observ
ations
&gt;
&gt; b. Internal logical consistency of theory.
&gt;
&gt; c. Lack of inconsistency with new observations and with other
micro-theories of possibly
&gt; identical or constituent-sharing contexts.
&gt;
&gt; d. Generation of large numbers of general and specific propositions which
are
&gt; deductively derived from the assumptions of the theory, and which are
independently
&gt; verified as being &quot;corresponding&quot; to observations.
&gt;
&gt; e. Depth and longevity of embedding of the theory in the knowledge base.
i.e.
&gt; the extent to which repeated successful reasoning from the theory has
resulted in the
&gt; theory becoming a &quot;basis theory&quot; or &quot;theory justifying other extended or
analogous
&gt; theories&quot; in the knowledge base.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; 7. Creates alternative possible world models (counterfactuals or
hypotheticals),
&gt; by combining abstracted models with episodic models but with variations
generated
&gt; through the use of substitution of altered or alternative constituent
entities,
&gt; sequences of events, etc.
&gt;
&gt;          Extra buzzwords: Counterfactuals, possible worlds, modal logic,
dreaming
&gt;
&gt; 8. Generates, and ranks for likelihood, extensions of episodic models into
the future,
&gt; using stereotyped abstract situation models with associated probabilities
to predict
&gt; the next likely sequences of events, given the part of the situation that
has
&gt; been observed to unfold so far.
&gt;
&gt; 9. Uses the extended and altered models, (hypotheticals, counterfactuals),
as a context
&gt; in which to create and pre-evaluate through simulation the likely
effectiveness of
&gt; plans of action designed to alter the course of future events to the
material
&gt; advantage of the animal.
&gt;
&gt; 10. Chooses a plan. Acts on the world according to the plan, either
indirectly,
&gt; through communication with other motivated intelligent agents, or directly
by
&gt; controlling its own body and using tools.
&gt;
&gt; 10a. Communicates with other motivated intelligent agents to assist it in
carrying
&gt; out plans to affect the environment:
&gt; Aspects of the communication process:
&gt; - Model (represent and simulate) the knowledge, motivations and reasoning
processes of
&gt; the other agents,
&gt; - Communicate to the other agents, using conventional symbols.
&gt;   Subjects of communication:
&gt;      -specific and general knowledge about the environment and its
relevant non-optimalities,
&gt;      -suggested specific courses of action to remedy non-optimality,
&gt;       with logical justifications, and motivational explanations of likely
mutual benefits.
&gt;
&gt;     (Evolutionary side effect of need to model the cognition and action
planning process of
&gt;      assistant agents: The development of ability to reflect on one's own
&gt;      thinking process. i.e. some of what consciousness is)
&gt;
&gt; 11. Assesses the effects of planned actions, corrects, reassesses,
remodels,
&gt; plans again, acts again.
&gt;
&gt; 12. Prioritizes cognition to meet real-time understanding and planning
deadlines,
&gt; via techniques such as:
&gt; a. Parallel exploration and testing of alternative hypotheses,
&gt; b. Parallel associative recall processes
&gt; c. Periodic assessment of relative promise of the parallel alternative
lines of
&gt;    reasoning and different directions of associative recall exploration of
memory,
&gt;    and pruning of less promising directions to allow redirection of the
finitely
&gt;    resourced search processes to deeper exploration of more promising
directions.
&gt; d. Emotion-tagging of episodic memories of &quot;survival-important&quot; aspects of
situations,
&gt;    and carry-over of the emotion-tags to abstracted general rules. These
emotion
&gt;    tags serve as a prioritization on all-directions associative recall and
on
&gt;    all-directions inference during exploration of recalled theories and
situations
&gt;    and current situation. i.e.
&gt;    - If it could kill you now, recall it fast and don't think about
anything else.
&gt;    - Similarly if it could get you an opportunity to pass on your genes.
&gt;    - If it could kill you slowly (hunger, lack of shelter), or make your
world safer
&gt;    and more comfortable (food, shelter, friends and helpers, money),
&gt;    think about it with relatively high priority, and probably quite often.
&gt;    - If it is new and unknown, it could kill you now, so think a lot about
it now until
&gt;    you can learn enough to assure yourself that that is not the case.
&gt;    - If it is same old same old, and not one of the above categories, muse
on it
&gt;    if you have the time. You might learn something new of benefit by
mixing it with
&gt;    some old thought to generate an important realization.
&gt;
&gt;

&gt;
&gt; What is a mind?
&gt; Something that does all of the above, and undoubtedly more.
&gt;
&gt; How does it work? F****ed if I know.
