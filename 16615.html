Hi Jesse,

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Olympia *is*  &quot;Pre-Olympia&quot; + Klara (the inert (for the computation

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But what do you mean when you say the isomorphism vanishes? Do you  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mean that the causal structure of pre-Olympia would *not* be  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; isomorphic to the causal structure of the original Turing machine  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that pre-Olympia was supposed to imitate (according to the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definition of causal structure in terms of logical relations between  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; propositions about the system's state at different moments)?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes. When I assume physical supervenience, for the benefit of the  
<br />
refutation. Olympia, relatively to me, implements Alice (or PI), Pre- 
<br />
Olypia does not. I would say yes to a doctor if he gives me an Olympia  
<br />
brain, no if he gives me pre-Olympia! That is what I mean by the  
<br />
vansihing of the &quot;causal&quot; isomorphism. Of course my goal, when I say  
<br />
yes to the doctor, is to preserve my consciousness, and my ability to  
<br />
manifest it in the &quot;normal&quot; (most probable) histories. My  
<br />
consciousness is already in &quot;plato heaven&quot;, so what I need &quot;here&quot; are  
<br />
the right dispositional devices.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If so, that would mean that regular Olympia (pre-Olympia + Klara)  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wouldn't have a causal structure isomorphic to the Turing machine  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; either, since I was defining causal structure solely in terms of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; propositions about events that *do* occur in the system's history,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaning the extra counterfactual conditions provided by Klara are  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; irrelevant to Olympia's causal structure, so Olympia's causal  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure would be the same as pre-Olympia's.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Right. But Maudlin manages to show that Olympia can have an empty  
<br />
causal structure, and that you have to say yes to the doctor when he  
<br />
proposes to substitute your brain by nothing. Personally I conceive  
<br />
propositions only in a net of related propositions by theories or  
<br />
models. The causal structure is mainly given by axioms and inference  
<br />
or computation rules, or by a (mathematical) semantics (model). You  
<br />
can't separate a proposition from other propositions like you can't  
<br />
separate a number from the other numbers.
<br />
I guess you would say that the movie-graph (the movie of the filmed  
<br />
active boolean graph corresponding to Alice's dream) would vehiculate  
<br />
Alice's dream. I can agree if you call the causal structure the  
<br />
computation corresponding to the local events lending to that graph,  
<br />
but then you have abandon the &quot;real time&quot; physical supervenience  
<br />
thesis already (or comp).
<br />
It is a very subtle and complex point here, we can go back on this  
<br />
later.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If that's the case, why can't we postulate that consciousness  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; supervenes on causal structure, since causal structure is after all  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; part of the physical world?
</em><br />
<br /><br />The point is that you can realize any computation with any causal  
<br />
structure in that sense. Maudlin's construction explains well that the  
<br />
Klaras, or the *material* for the counterfactuals are a read herring  
<br />
as far as giving a role in the logical relations describing a  
<br />
computation. And not just the material one! Any choice of a particular  
<br />
universal system cannot work, you have to take them all. You can then  
<br />
choose the simplest one (+ and *) to retrieve those who define  
<br />
observable realities from the point of view of universal machines.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In fact one could say that physics is *only* concerned with  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;causality&quot; in the sense of lawlike relations between propositions  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about observations, since the laws of physics tell us nothing about  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what particles or fields or wavefunctions &quot;really are&quot;, only about  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; how they interact with one another and how they can be used to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; predict the outcomes measurements. So if we say consciousness  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; supervenes on causal structure, then Olympia would not qualify as an  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instantiation of the observer-moments that the original Turing  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine instantiated, in much the same way that a lookup table  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wouldn't qualify.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I don't see that at all. Olympia is just a &quot;crazy&quot; implementation of  
<br />
an algorithm, but it is correct on all inputs. Its resemblance with a  
<br />
look-up table is local, finite, and does not change Olympia's  
<br />
semantics. If such a change makes a change, I would no more say yes to  
<br />
a doctor. My consciousness would depend on the nature of the  
<br />
implementation.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't have a problem with the idea that a giant lookup table is  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just a sort of &quot;zombie&quot;,
</em><br />
<br />Look-up table contains the counterfactuals. I am not sure that a giant  
<br />
look-up up table can be considered as a zombie. The problem is that  
<br />
such a look-up table would be gigantic and hard to address. Also, its  
<br />
origin, relatively to me, would need a strange &quot;history&quot;. But if that  
<br />
exist I could say yes to a doctor providing me with that lookup table.  
<br />
Very practical: let us look what I am answering to Jesse today :)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; since after all the way you'd create a lookup table for a given  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; algorithmic mind would be to run a huge series of actual simulations  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of that mind with all possible inputs, creating a huge archive of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;recordings&quot; so that later if anyone supplies the lookup table with  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a given input, the table just looks up the recording of the occasion  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in which the original simulated mind was supplied with that exact  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; input in the past, and plays it back. Why should merely replaying a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recording of something that happened to a simulated observer in the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; past contribute to the measure of that observer-moment? I don't  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; believe that playing a videotape of me being happy or sad in the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; past will increase the measure of happy or sad observer-moments  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; involving me, after all.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Unless in some story you survive during a period. The problem of the  
<br />
lookup table is that to manage the counterfactual it has to run all  
<br />
your future as well. The problem comes from the physical supervenience  
<br />
only. You try to select one notion of causality, when with comp  
<br />
consciousness supervene on all notion of all relatively probable  
<br />
notions of causality.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And Olympia seems to be somewhat similar to a lookup table in that  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the only way to construct &quot;her&quot; would be to have already run the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; regular Turing machine program that she is supposed to emulate, so  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that you know in advance the order that the Turing machine's read/ 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; write head visits different cells, and then you can rearrange the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; positions of those cells so Olympia will visit them in the correct  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; order just by going from one cell to the next in line over and over  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; again.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So: why can't the idea of consciousness supervening on causal  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure be a possible strategy for avoiding the problem you talk  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about in step 08 of your UDA argument (if I am understanding it  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correctly), namely the idea that even if there was a physical  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe it wouldn't be able to tell us anything about the measure  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of different computations? If we talk about the causal structure of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a given computation, why can't we look at how frequently sets of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical events with an isomorphic causal structure occur in the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical universe, and derive a measure on physical implementations  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of computations in this way?
</em><br />
<br />Because any consciousness will be attached to any &quot;causal structure&quot;  
<br />
in your sense. Your propositional interpretation of the causal  
<br />
structure needs the counterfactuals and all the conditional theorems  
<br />
in the theories which defines your &quot;true and probable&quot; theorem. If you  
<br />
want to singularize consciousness through the choice of a particular  
<br />
machine, this one will have to be actually infinite.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not that I personally would favor this approach to a philosophical  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;theory of everything&quot;, but would you say it isn't even a coherent  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possibility?
</em><br />
<br />I don't think so, for the reason allude above.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Are you saying that a notion similar to my definition of &quot;causal  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure&quot; is already made use of in the areas of mathematics you're  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; talking about, or when you say &quot;the history of a particular Turing  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine computation&quot; are you talking about something unrelated to my  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definition of the computation's causal structure?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />You should give a more precise definition of what you mean by &quot;causal  
<br />
structure&quot;. If you postulate a physical world (or any particular  
<br />
universal machine) and define causality the truth of some propositions  
<br />
(theorems, conjecture) I can follow you only insofar that you realize  
<br />
we have to justify the &quot;physicals laws from an average based on that&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I also wonder if anything similar to this notion of causal structure  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could be found in category theory, since in some layman's summaries  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I've read that category theory defines mathematics in a purely  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relational way, where any mathematical object (or proposition?) is  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; defined entirely in its relationships to other objects.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You are right. Category provides genuine information about those  
<br />
things. But it is an investment, and it is a bit labyrinthine. Also,  
<br />
in computer-land, most objects are only partially defined, and it is  
<br />
hard to just find the &quot;good&quot; morphism in between objects. The very  
<br />
fact that you mention category theory, which has nothing physical per  
<br />
se, for your causal structure, makes me think that you don't take too  
<br />
much seriously that such causality has to be based on a notion of  
<br />
substance, or primary matter. That's all what the movie-graph try to  
<br />
convey.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; When you say &quot;that approach&quot;, are you talking specifically about  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; looking at isomorphisms between 1) logical relations among  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; propositions about arithmetic, and 2) logical relations among  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; propositions about the history of a Turing machine computation?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Always proposition about numbers.  (or combinators, etc.). Remember  
<br />
that we can translate the logical metamathematics in term of relations  
<br />
between numbers.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Or were you saying that UDA takes an approach that is similar in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some broader fashion?
</em><br />
<br /><br />UDA was originally just an argument to explain that the mind-body  
<br />
problem is not yet solved, and that assuming comp, it can be pertially  
<br />
reduce in the problem of justifying physics from computer science/ 
<br />
number theory. What you ask me could depend of what you mean by  
<br />
&quot;causal structure&quot;. Should such a structure defined in term of physics  
<br />
or in term of logic+number (or logic+combinators, etc.).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; since I'm suggesting some kind of absolute measure on all causal  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structures, and if you identify particular causal structures with  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OMs that would correspond to the ASSA, but you have said that your  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; approach only uses the RSSA.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;There is no absolute measure on all &quot;causal structures&quot; , still  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; less on OM, right! I would ba an ants or a bacteria in two seconds!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I guess it would depend on how the measure was defined.
</em><br />
<br />Sure. that is what I like with comp, the measure is immediately  
<br />
relative and indexically defined. that is why we can, and are forced,  
<br />
to use the logic of self-reference at some point.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It might not just be in terms of the numerical frequency that a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; given causal structure appears in the world, but also in terms of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things like how many other causal structures &quot;remember&quot; that causal  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure in some sense (contain detailed information about it).  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That could perhaps give a measure which was biased towards more  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; complex causal structures like human minds even though ants are much  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more common numerically.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You are right. It is a reason for being a bit skeptical about  
<br />
&quot;absolute measure&quot; here.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, I didn't mean to sugest that your ideas are vague, only that  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my own notions of a connection between causal structure and measure  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; were rather ill-defined...
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK.  I would be pleased if you try to define causal structure, or just  
<br />
tell me if it is based on physics. Even accepting the primacy of  
<br />
physics, it is a complex notion. Comp get rid of it, or &quot;relegate&quot; it  
<br />
at the higher epistemological level, like consciousness,  
<br />
responsibility, free will, etc. The proposition that machine x on y  
<br />
will output z, can be defined entirely in term of addition and  
<br />
multiplication of numbers, with the usual logic. Even much less thanks  
<br />
to Matiyazevitch.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; there'd be a lot more math I'd need to learn if I wanted to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seriously try to develop these ideas, or to really understand the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; details of your own ideas. By the way, do you have a bibliography  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; somewhere of books you think someone could use to self-teach  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; themselves enough math to understand the details of your AUDA  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argument?
</em><br />
<br /><br />I think that Günther has put some biblio in the everything list  
<br />
documentation (look for AUDA). Two excellent books are the Boolos,  
<br />
Burgess and Jeffrey book, and the book by Epstein and Carnielli. They  
<br />
give the most genuine, with respect to UDA-7 and AUDA, balance of  
<br />
logic and theoretical computer science.
<br />
For AUDA and the logic of self-reference, Boolos 1979, Boolos 1993,  
<br />
and Smorynski 1985 are very good. Or look at the reference of my  
<br />
french thesis:
