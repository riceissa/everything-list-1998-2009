Mitch Haegel  is an observer of the Everything list. He sent me this post. I
<br />
thought that sharing my response with the group may be appropriate.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; across in your readings that would indicate that the universe has the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; capability to store and retain &quot;quantum states&quot;, also known as information?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This of course would be the information of the past, that somehow gets

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instantly, recorded such as Unix does with its FORK command, or RAID-5 does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with Microsoft networking, or the mirror-imaging done on IBM systems. This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indeed is a computationalist approach, but it has always seemed worth
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exploring to me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; When I think upon it, there must be a singular band of universes, that set
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the model, of which all other universes are spun off of.  This band or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aggregate would have all the nominal characteristics that would propagate all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; variations of other 'world-lines' I would imagine. Hence, this seems a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possibly fruitful area to look at.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />You are asking interesting questions. I am far from being an expert.  I would be
<br />
nice if there was such a recorder. I haven't heard of anything like that. All I
<br />
can do is conjecture.From the quantum theory point of view nothing is impossible
<br />
provided it falls within the quantum indeterminacy window. Thus virtual particles
<br />
continuously pop in and out of the vacuum, violating the laws of conservation in
<br />
doing so, albeit for very short times. Thus the probability that such a recorder
<br />
exists is not zero. The question is what is its probability given our specific
<br />
point of view of the uinverse. Our specific point of view (anthropic constraint)
<br />
rules out any one performing this recording, that can be detected by means of a
<br />
small given number of photons. That rules out the neighbor next door, in fact any
<br />
one within the orbit of the moon or even further. It does not mean that this
<br />
recording cannot be done by someone made of dark matter for example.
<br />
<br />WHOLE NEW PHYSICS WOULD HAVE TO BE INVENTED, CONSISTENT WITH OUR CURRENT PHYSICS
<br />
to explain this recording. Maybe this is what magic is. CONJURING THINGS UP BY
<br />
INVENTING THEM IN A CONSISTENT WAY. (This is also what engineers do!!!) How much
<br />
leeway do we have in this invention process? My guess is that the laws of physics
<br />
themselves will be found to be indeterminate at some basic level. Basic physical
<br />
constants such as e will have associated with them fundamental indeterminacy.
<br />
This may allow virtual physics to exist and all kinds of worlds, with all their
<br />
associated creatures and demons to be invoked. Clearly, a condition for their
<br />
existence is that the coupling from their world to our world would have to be
<br />
extremely weak since we haven't discovered them yet, but the coupling from our
<br />
world to their world would have to be strong for the recording to occur.
<br />
<br />Therefore the process for working with these worlds is:
<br />
<br />1) Defining the requirements for a world X
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- recording from our world by world X
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- consistency of world X with current observation
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- assume that a &quot;back door&quot; exist (method of control consistent with current
<br />
physics but not ruled out by observations yet)
<br />
<br />2) Working out the consequences
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Weak coupling from world X to ours (They cannot control us - We cannot
<br />
observe them)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Strong coupling from our world to world X (We can control them - They can
<br />
observe us)
<br />
<br />3) Working out the physics of World X
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Left as an exercise to the reader)
<br />
<br />4) Use the back door to control world X
<br />
<br />Now world X will have a recording of our world in any arbitrary resolution
<br />
desired.
<br />
<br /><br />A similar technique could be used to create magic implements. We have to invent
<br />
worlds which we can control and observe,  and which can control and observe us
<br />
but in which controllability and observability are KEYED or ENCRYPTED. Then only
<br />
the owner of the correct key will be able to use those worlds. The method for
<br />
invoking/creating these worlds is similar to the one explained above.
<br />
<br />1) Defining the requirements of world Y
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Encrypted observability and controllability
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- consistency of world Y with current observation
<br />
<br />2) Working out the consistent consequences
<br />
<br />3) Working out the Physics for world Y
<br />
(Left as an exercise to the reader)
<br />
<br />4) Use the keys to invoke and control objects/creatures in world Y which
<br />
ultimately control objects/people in our world.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of Reality List?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is based on David Deutsch's book The Fabric of Reality, and he is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; himself a frequent contributor. There is also at least two people from Wei
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dai's Everything-List that participate there.
