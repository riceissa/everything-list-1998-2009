<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I believe this assumes that your thinking is not a QM phenomena, i.e. that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you have a soul or mind with 'free-will' independent of physics.
</em><br />
<br />Why do you say that? A similar experiment can be done without the need for 
<br />
any human decisions once it is underway:
<br />
<br />A computer generates random binary digits at one second intervals, so that 
<br />
Pr(1) = Pr(0) = 1/2. (The computer has to use a true random number 
<br />
generator, such as one based on an environmental variable, for this 
<br />
experiment to work.) Your role is to sit in front of the screen watching the 
<br />
digits whilst attached to a device that may deliver instant death with 
<br />
probability 1/x the moment a &quot;0&quot; is generated but does nothing if a &quot;1&quot; is 
<br />
generated. After n seconds the experiment stops and you tally up the 1's and 
<br />
0's. The idea is that at each step, 1 in x of your copies in parallel 
<br />
branches of the multiverse who get a &quot;0&quot; on their computer screen will be 
<br />
eliminated, thereby leaving a slight excess of copies who get a &quot;1&quot;. Given 
<br />
enough trials, statistical analysis of the results should be able to show up 
<br />
this anomaly, and thus provide you with evidence that those parallel worlds 
<br />
do in fact exist. Hopefully, with a large enough x, this result will be 
<br />
obtained with minimum risk that 3rd person observers will have to cope with 
<br />
finding your dead body, which is the main practical disadvantage of the 
<br />
Tegmark quantum suicide experiment.
<br />
<br />I have done some rough calculations to see what sort of values of x and n 
<br />
are needed to attain statistical significance. The experimental results 
<br />
follow a binomial distribution, which for large n can be approximated by a 
<br />
normal distribution with mean = np and standard deviation = (npp')^(1/2), 
<br />
where p = Pr(1) and p' = 1-p = Pr(0). With the suicide device on, p 
<br />
increases from 1/2 to 1/(2-1/x). Aiming for the mean number of 1s with the 
<br />
suicide device on to be 2 standard deviations higher than the mean without 
<br />
the device, assuming x = 1000, n is calculated as 1.6*10^7. This is 
<br />
terrible: you will almost certainly suffer 3rd person death in any given 
<br />
branch if you could sit through that many trials. Setting  n = 1000, x is 
<br />
calculated as 8.9, which is also almost certain to result in 3rd person 
<br />
death.
<br />
<br />The above results are a bit disappointing, not really any improvement on the 
<br />
Tegmark experiment as far as saving your from 3rd person death goes. I'll 
<br />
try some other numbers... but I'm getting the feeling that nature means to 
<br />
make us pay before revealing her secrets in this case.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;I think I can rephrase Kim's suggestion as follows. Rewards usually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;reflect risks, people performing death-defying acts tend to be paid
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;handsomely, young males performing risky acts earn the admiration of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;females (the James Dean stereotype), suicide bombers getting to spend
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;time with heavenly virgins and so on. Therefore, given QTI gives us
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;some guarantee that we won't experience death, then doesn't this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;encourage QTI followers to do risky things?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;The trouble with the notion of QTI suggesting we should all do risky 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;things
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;is much the same as the argument I give against quantum suicide as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;way of winning the lottery in my book. Most of the avenues of survival
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;from risky actions are in fact at considerable cost to health, social
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;standing etc. Only if these costs were outweighed by the benefits
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;accrued by the risky action is it worth doing. In fact the decision
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;procedure is not all that different to if QTI were not true - if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;anything it make risky actions somewhat less favourable, since QTI
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;guarantees that you experience negative outcomes from some failed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;action rather than having death as a way out.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Here is a variation on the idea of linking gambling with quantum suicide 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;(it may have been discussed before in the earlier years of this list, but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I don't recall reading about it). You build an easily concealed device 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;which will allow you to quickly and surely kill yourself when activated; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;for example, a ring of plastic explosive around your neck which will 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;detonate and decapitate you when you press a button hidden in your pocket. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;With this device in place, you go to the gambling venue of choice and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;place a bet, all the while with your finger on the button and the thought 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;in mind that if you lose the bet, you will press it. Now, whatever you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;think of QTI, you're not crazy, and you are unlikely to go ahead and blow 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;your head off if you lose. But however cautious and squeamish a person you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;might be, the fact that you are thinking about killing yourself and are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;able to do so instantly must mean that there is a non-zero probability you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;will do so if you lose the bet. In the MWI, this means that in some small 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;proportion of the branches in which you lose the bet, you die. The result 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;is that from the first person perspective, since you don't experience 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;those branches where you die, you have managed to skew the probability of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;winning slightly in your favour. It may not be enough to beat the house 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;(unless you are a gambler down to his last few dollars planning to end it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;all anyway), but it should be possible by statistical analysis after a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;sufficiently large number of bets to show that something other than pure 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;chance is at work, and thus to prove (to yourself) the same thing as the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;QS experiment purports to prove, in a much less messy way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Another variation on this theme is to watch some natural random event, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;like the path of a fly walking up a wall. While wearing your suicide 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;device, you stare intensely at the fly and think: &quot;Go to the right! If you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;don't go to the right, I'll kill myself!&quot; It should seem to you that you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;can thereby influence which way the fly walks just by thinking about it.
