Le 11-juil.-06, &#x2c6; 21:06, 1Z a &#x17d;crit :
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And mathematical MWI *would* be in the same happy position *if*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it could find a justification for MWI or classical measure.
</em><br />
<br />See my work and this list for some path toward it.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; To have material existence is to have non-zero measure,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and vice-versa.
</em><br />
<br /><br />So, in the space {0,1}* (that is: the space of functions from N to  
<br />
{0,1}, or the space of infinite sequence of &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot;) together with  
<br />
some reasonable topology)  the set of random sequences, just because it  
<br />
has non-zero measure, has a material existence ?!?!?!.
<br />
<br />Well, why not, if that is your definition. I understand better why you  
<br />
say you could introduce &quot;matter&quot; in Platonia. Plato would have disagree  
<br />
in the sense that &quot;matter&quot; is the shadow of the ideal intelligible  
<br />
reality. Note the &quot;intelligible&quot;, which will be developped by Plotinus  
<br />
(notably), taking then &quot;ontology&quot; in &quot;my&quot; sense (or Jesse one, or as I  
<br />
and Jesse are suspecting: the common current one).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Platonists about mathematical objects claim that the theorems of our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical theories - sentences like '3 is prime' (a theorem of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arithmetic) and 'There are infinitely many transfinite cardinal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; numbers' (a theorem of set theory) - are literally true and that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the only plausible view of such sentences is that they are ABOUT
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ABSTRACT OBJECTS
</em><br />
<br />I agree, (although in some context it helps to consider mathematical  
<br />
objects like numbers and strings, turing machine's computation as  
<br />
concrete, to better appreciate the non concreteness of &quot;variables and  
<br />
functions&quot;, but this should not be relevant here).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Some do. In any case, if numbers don't exist at all -- even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; platonically --
</em><br />
<br />I am just saying that the truth value of the sentence &quot;there is a prime  
<br />
number&quot; does not depend on me ...
<br />
I don't understand what you mean by &quot;numbers don't exist at all&quot;.  
<br />
Numbers exists in Platonia in the sense that the classical proposition  
<br />
&quot;4356667654090987890111 is prime or 4356667654090987890111 is not  
<br />
prime&quot; is true there.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; they they cannot even produce the mere appearance of a physical world,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as Bruno requires.
</em><br />
<br />Why? With Church thesis all computations, as defined in computer  
<br />
science (not in physics), exists in Platonia, exactly in the same sense  
<br />
that for the prime numbers above.
<br />
And I do provide evidence that &quot;rational unitary transform&quot; could be  
<br />
the mathematical computations winning the measure-battle in Platonia.  
<br />
This would explain not only the existence of computations with  
<br />
self-aware observers, but also they relative stability.-AT_SYMBOL-
<br />
But MUCH more can be said, from Solovay theorem (justifying the modal  
<br />
logics G and G* for the provable and non provable by a machine/entity  
<br />
self-referential truth) I get not only an arithmetical quantization  
<br />
justifying the quanta, I get a larger theory divided into sharable and  
<br />
non sharable measurement results. This means I get one mathematical  
<br />
structure explaining not only the appearance of a physical world (the  
<br />
quanta), but explaining why such quanta are accompanied by non  
<br />
communicable personal truth (like the qualia experienced by the  
<br />
physicist at the moment where he look at the needle of his/her  
<br />
measuring apparatus). In *that* precise sense, the comp-physics is in  
<br />
advance on the &quot;materialist hypo based physics&quot;.
<br />
<br />Now when you say in another post:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I cant address your anti-materialism arguments directly since
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you idn't state them, only alluding to them.
</em><br />
<br />I think you have a memory problem. See my URL for my papers. Search in  
<br />
Science-direct Elsevier for my last one.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Insamuch as you claim that COMP is your only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumption, CT and AR are *not* assumed explicitly.
</em><br />
<br />I defined in this list comp by &quot;yes doctor&quot;+ CT + AR. In my Brussel's  
<br />
thesis  &quot;conscience et m&#x17d;canisme&quot; I call it digital mechanism. CT is  
<br />
explicitly assumed for giving a univocal sense to the words  
<br />
computations or digital machine, and AR is made explicit for clarity.  
<br />
That comp entails immateriality (in the sense that the observable must  
<br />
be justified by computer science exclusively) is just a result (not  
<br />
obvious at all).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Brains are material. Computers are material.
</em><br />
<br />Ah. If you say so. Perhaps you are right,  but then they are actual  
<br />
material realities, not emulable at all by any turing machine. It is up  
<br />
to you to find the mistake in the UDA, if you still believe that comp  
<br />
does not entail the reversal between physics and number theory (large  
<br />
sense like in the book of Manin on Number Theory).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Comp is about the behaviour of the brain as a material system.
</em><br />
<br />This is the naturalist preconception of comp. If you want it is comp  
<br />
before I get the proof that comp entails immateriality. But perhaps you  
<br />
agree now, giving that you gave us an immaerial definition of matter:  
<br />
measure ­ 0. (But elsewhere you gave another: casually capable of  
<br />
interacting with you: so I am not sure).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Why should I prove my assumptions?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You could at least state them.
</em><br />
<br />I do it in all paper on this subject, and I have done it at nauseam in  
<br />
this list. It is computationalism: the doctrine according to which  
<br />
there is a level of substitution such that I survive a digital graft  
<br />
made correctly at that level. (+ CT + AR for giving univocal sense to  
<br />
word like &quot;number&quot; and (discrete) computation&quot;).  Just go there:
