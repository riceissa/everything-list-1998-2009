<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So what are your thoughts on my question as to whether abstract
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concepts other than numbers also exist in a platonic sense?  For
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; example, the idea of &quot;red&quot;?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Numbers are not enough. Even assuming first order logic.
<br />
<br />Then assuming &quot;we&quot; are digitalizable machine, this can be proved:
<br />
<br />Numbers are not enough.
<br />
Numbers together with addition and multiplication are enough, and it  
<br />
is &quot;absolutely&quot; undecidable (for us, and us = any universal machine/ 
<br />
number) if there is any richer ontology.
<br />
<br />Numbers and addition + multiplication is a structure already &quot;Turing  
<br />
universal&quot;. With addition and multiplication (and logic) you can  
<br />
already define the computational states and the pieces of histories  
<br />
going through them.
<br />
<br />You can understand that if you assume comp, all the computations going  
<br />
through the state of self-introspecting agent  imagining &quot;red&quot; already  
<br />
exists as much as numbers. All the proposition of the shape &quot;the  
<br />
machine i goes through states S&quot; are, when true, elementary theorem of  
<br />
arithmetic, and they are accompagnying by &quot;dense sets of proofs or  
<br />
relative realisations&quot;).
<br />
<br />In the arithmetical Platonia, you already have all universal machines,  
<br />
and all their computations, which makes already place for big amount  
<br />
of &quot;abstract concept&quot; existing &quot;platonically&quot; (= like the numbers).
<br />
<br />And then you can define the modalities or point of view of those  
<br />
machines, by realizing that they will be aware (they have access too)  
<br />
the gap between platonist truth and what they can prove, and ...
<br />
<br />You may read the paper on Plotinus here, i.e. click on &quot;pdf&quot; on the  
<br />
right of &quot;A purely arithmetical, yet empirically falsifiable,  
<br />
intepretation of Plotinus&quot; on my url
<br />
<br /><a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/</a>
<br />
<br />You can see, well, not my thought on the subject, but the thought of  
<br />
the universal platonist machine. A machine is platonist when she  
<br />
believes, proves, asserts, the instanciations of the principle of  
<br />
excluded middle principle.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So obviously we can cast everything as numbers and say, &quot;In this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; program, 0xff000000 represents red&quot;.  But RED is what we're really
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; talking about here, and 0xff000000 is just a place holder...a symbol
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for what actually exists.
</em><br />
<br />Probably so.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In your view, Bruno (or David, or anyone else who has an opinion),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what kinds of things actually &quot;exist&quot;?  What does it mean to say that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something &quot;exists&quot;?
</em><br />
<br />Assuming comp, something S exists ontologically when you can prove  
<br />
that S exists in Robinson Arithmetic (a very weak, yet universal,  
<br />
theory),
<br />
<br />And something S exists epistemologically when, let us say, you can  
<br />
prove in Robinson Arithmetic that there is a universal machine  
<br />
mentioning S.
<br />
<br />Technically it is far more elegant and sophisticate. See the eight  
<br />
hypostases (points of view) in the plotinus paper (or look for  
<br />
Plotinus or hypostases in the archive of the list).
<br />
<br />Instead of Robinson Arithmetic, you can take any first order  
<br />
specification of any universal system, machine or lnaguage (be it  
<br />
Conway's Game of Life, FORTRAN, LISP, prolog, Basic, c++,  ... up to  
<br />
modular functor from quantum topology or knot theory, or number theory  
<br />
itself.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It seems to me that maybe consciousness is actually very simple.  It
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is just a group of platonic ideals, like red, that are related to each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other by a point of view:  &quot;I like red&quot;, or &quot;I see a red sphere.&quot;
</em><br />
<br />Yes.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maybe what is complicated is constructing or identifying a causal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure (e.g., a machine, a brain, a program, etc) whose evolving
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; state can be interpreted as representing a series of &quot;connected&quot; or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;related&quot; instances of consciousness.
</em><br />
<br />Yes. The difficulty is that consciousness, from its internal view, can  
<br />
only be related to an infinity of states belonging to high infinities  
<br />
of infinite computations. Third person consciousness, like the  
<br />
consciousness of my friend, is locally attachable (by guess) to a  
<br />
brain. &quot;My consciousness&quot; is not &quot;attachable to a brain, only to an  
<br />
enumerable infinity of brains/machines/numbers weighted by non  
<br />
enumerable infinite histories.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But the machine (physical or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; otherwise) is NOT that consciousness, the machine just represents that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness.
</em><br />
<br />Indeed.
<br />
The machine can represent 3-consciousness, like my identity cart can  
<br />
represent myself.
<br />
1-consciousness is related to a continuum of machines. This follows  
<br />
form the UDA.
<br />
1-consciousness is ignorant which &quot;places&quot; it occupies among continuum  
<br />
of histories.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In this view, consciousness itself consists directly of the abstract
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; platonic ideals that form the contents of a given moment of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness.
</em><br />
<br />Not directly. It needs a self-reference, that is no more than two  
<br />
diagonalisations. Computer science suggests, and arguably forces  
<br />
entities to relate to themselves relatively to most probable local  
<br />
universal history. This needs already virtual substitutions. Purely  
<br />
arithmetical one do the job very well.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It remains to explain the relative stability of that illusion. How  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; why some dreams glue, in a way sufficiently precise for making
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; predictions about them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maybe unstable illusions exist, but, being unstable, don't ponder such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; questions?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Obviously we have such conscious beings here in this world, with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; schizophrenics and the like.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So your questions about &quot;why are my perceptions so orderly&quot;, would NOT
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be universally valid questions, because there are conscious entities
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whose perceptions are NOT orderly.
</em><br />
<br />Nice try!
<br />
See UDA for making this precise in term of relative probabilities. And  
<br />
we have to recover the &quot;observable probabilities&quot;.
<br />
We can come back on this, but I cannot explain all this is any shorter  
<br />
way than what is in the papers.
<br />
(Your intuition is correct, and I am perhaps playing with the  
<br />
flexibility of &quot;NOT orderly&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And I would say that even my perceptions are not consistently orderly,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as when I dream I often experience strange scenarios.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To say that dreaming and hallucinating are special cases I think is to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; make an unfounded assumption.  It would seem to me that orderly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perceptions are the special case, and dream-logic realities would be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the norm.
</em><br />
<br />At first sight! This is akin to the white rabbit problem.  So we have  
<br />
to justify the &quot;norm&quot; from the structure of Platonia.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If consciousness is in some way a result of computation, then a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; program that generates all possible mind-simulations will surely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; result in the vast majority of resulting minds experiencing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dream-logic realities, not &quot;law-and-order&quot; realities like ours.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You are close to the UDA, which we discuss since years here ...
<br />
All the problem is there.
<br />
But once you look closely, you can see the beginning of the reason why  
<br />
&quot;law-and-order&quot; realities win against &quot;dream-logic&quot; realities. This is  
<br />
eventually coming from the fact that numbers TOGETHER with addition  
<br />
and multiplication give already a very rich, complex (even non  
<br />
axiomatizable) reality, with a strong tendency to repeat itself in an  
<br />
universal dovetailing way. Look at the youtube videos on the  
<br />
Mandelbrot set (M) to see a &quot;platonic simple sequence of arithmetical  
<br />
objects illustrating a similar (perhaps equivalent) multiplication of  
<br />
itself and variants. It is a simple object because the definition of M  
<br />
is not much longer than the definition of the circle. The sequences  
<br />
are simple too, because their are just successive enlargements (zooms)  
<br />
in different places)
<br />
<br />Examples:

<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think Sean Carroll (who I'm reasonably sure would disagree with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everything I've proposed above, but still) had a pretty good point on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such &quot;counter-intuitive&quot; predictions:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;The same logic applies, for example, to the highly contentious case
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the multiverse. The multiverse isn’t, by itself, a theory; it’s a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prediction of a certain class of theories. If the idea were simply
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; “Hey, we don’t know what happens outside our observable universe, so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; maybe all sorts of crazy things happen,” it would be laughably
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; uninteresting. By scientific standards, it would fall woefully short.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But the point is that various theoretical attempts to explain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; phenomena that we directly observe right in front of us — like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; gravity, and quantum field theory — lead us to predict that our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe should be one of many, and subsequently suggest that we take
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that situation seriously when we talk about the “naturalness” of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; various features of our local environment. The point, at the moment,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is not whether there really is or is not a multiverse; it’s that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way we think about it and reach conclusions about its plausibility is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; through exactly the same kind of scientific reasoning we’ve been using
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for a long time now. Science doesn’t pass judgment on phenomena; it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; passes judgment on theories.&quot;
</em><br />
<br />Well, yeah, OK.
<br />
It is already true for the theory saying: there is 00 physical  
<br />
universes, 1, 2, ..., infinity, bigger infinities ... of physical  
<br />
universes.
<br />
Comp seems to go in the direction 0 physical universes, 01 local  
<br />
(apparent) multiverses. It is too early to really say.
<br />
Scientist don't commit themselves ontologically, and many theories  
<br />
does the same, yet most assume numbers, or any universal frame.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So, I could continue further and go into a lengthy defense of why I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think this supports what I'm saying, BUT maybe you'll come to the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conclusion I have and I can save myself a lot of typing!  So, I'll
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just try that approach first.
</em><br />
<br />I basically agree with all what you say, and I hope you will take as  
<br />
good news that the classical (platonist) universal machine agrees too,  
<br />
and even can justify all this, and makes those things sufficiently  
<br />
precise so that we can test it.
<br />
And retrospectively, the quantum facts, as understood by Everett  &amp;  
<br />
Al. in Physics, saves the Classical Machine discourses from a too easy  
<br />
refutation (given that comp predicts huge self-multiplication  
<br />
indirectly observable when we look at ourself below our common  
<br />
substitution level).
<br />
<br />I will be a bit slowed down this week, due to work, but I intend to be  
<br />
able to explain what is a universal function, what are universal  
<br />
numbers, and what are computations, and how they exist in the tiniest  
<br />
part of math where actually classical (platonist) mathematicans and  
<br />
intuitionist (non classical) mathematicians understand themselves very  
<br />
well.
<br />
<br />I did not comment your other post because I rarely comment post where  
<br />
I tend to agree completely.
