Hi Everythingers,
<br />
<br />Though I am new to the list I have been reading your fascinating posts 
<br />
on this troubling issue of &quot;reality&quot; and subjectivity
<br />
so please pardon if I skip the protocol and delve into the discussion 
<br />
right away.  I have a background in computer
<br />
and  cognitive science if you want to know,  but little chance to 
<br />
engage in exchanges on philosophical matters
<br />
such as the ones in which you guys are involved in.  Forgive me if I 
<br />
misunderstand some of the finer details (yes I know,
<br />
the devil is there...)

Subject: Re: subjective reality
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi Lee ,
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt; It was just a figure of speech. You are free, of course, to use
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; the word &quot;reality&quot; any way you want. I'm not comfortable for using
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; it to describes one's subjective impressions, feelings, etc.
</em><br />
<br />Bruno says:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;But I am not using the word &quot;reality&quot; to *describe* one's subjective 
<br />
impression, it seems to me I am just acknowledging the existence of 
<br />
those subjective impression in many persons.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;To acknowledge something is to admit that something has some kind of 
<br />
&quot;reality&quot;, it seems to me.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And it seems you did acknowledge those experiences too). To describe 
<br />
them, in the limit, I can only point you to great poets and artists, 
<br />
and they will hardly mention the word &quot;reality&quot;.
<br />
<br />[GK]
<br />
Well, astists will probably argue that they are quite concerned with 
<br />
reality in their own way. You don't want to confuse your
<br />
subjective impressions (qualia) with the fact that you have them or 
<br />
report them. The later are the subject of scientific inquiry while the 
<br />
former may not qualify. Scientific Reality is definitely more specific 
<br />
than reality in general.  There is also much that
<br />
one can aknowledge without admiting to its reality. I have heard of, 
<br />
say, alien abductions but would not swear to their reality,
<br />
though others may differ.
<br />
<br />[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;You just seems to want those experiences are just an unnecessary 
<br />
epiphenomenon, and you would like that science never adresses what they 
<br />
really are and where they came from.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;For you it looks like &quot;consciousness&quot; is just a sort of subjective 
<br />
mirror partially reflecting an objective third person describable 
<br />
reality in which we are embedded. And science should never leave the 
<br />
third person discourse. All right?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, please understand that I agree (100%) with the last sentences: 
<br />
science should never leave the third person discourse.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;But this does not prohibit science of looking to herself, and to try 
<br />
theories (hypotheses) about third person discourses, and even to 
<br />
*discover* sort of first person discourse canonically associated to 
<br />
some mathematical object.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;By taking the comp hyp enough seriously it just happens that 
<br />
&quot;consciousness&quot;, or just the &quot;ability to guess the existence of one (at 
<br />
least) world&quot; is not a little detail. Or it is a little detail but then 
<br />
remember that the devil is hidden in the little details. Why? Because 
<br />
if I am correct in my derivation it makes the physical law emerging 
<br />
from number theory.
<br />
<br />[GK]
<br />
I would argue that numbers are rather objective, perhaps even more than 
<br />
physical laws and surely so if you are right, no?
<br />
If that derivation is just a piece of your subjectivity that may dash 
<br />
your hopes to convey it to others...
<br />
<br />There is also an &quot;animal&quot; called *self-delusion* that inhabits this 
<br />
realm between the subjective and the objective and amounts
<br />
to taking for real what isn't quite so.  But why bring it into this 
<br />
already confusing and confused exchanged.
<br />
<br />[LC]
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; So you say. And I confess I haven't the energy (and probably not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; the preparation) to study your thesis. So I'll wait for the experts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; to acclaim you. No one will cheer louder: &quot;I knew him *before*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; the world saw the truth to COMP! He even knows who I am!&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart appreciates very much. My poor brain, or some reasoner who 
<br />
appears to succeed to manifest himself through it, relatively to you, 
<br />
is a little bit astonished: you are amazingly honest and confess you 
<br />
could give a weight to authoritative argument. Ah la la.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it would be better to get the understanding by yourself, then 
<br />
you could say &quot; I thought it&quot;, but perhaps you do get some 
<br />
understanding, I think :-)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually my work is &quot;the work&quot; which people should understand by 
<br />
themselves, if only to understand the second part where they must 
<br />
understand that machine can understand it by themselves, in some 
<br />
precise sense.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;You could also be disappointed. Although the conclusion is startling, 
<br />
technically my contribution is modest and leads quickly to soluble but 
<br />
intractable questions.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;A paper entitled &quot;Theoretical Computer Science and the Natural 
<br />
Sciences&quot; should appear soon, though.
<br />
<br />[GK]
<br />
Oh, it seems you agree than!  &quot;The Work&quot; goes well with your 
<br />
theological inclinations,  seems to me though I am as hopeless
<br />
about understandiing it as Lee is...
<br />
<br />[LC]
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; My friends and I (and probably Daniel Dennett and so on) believe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; that people who demand a 1st person &quot;account of the world&quot; (e.g.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; Chalmers) will never get anywhere.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, this is one of the main point where I differ from George 
<br />
Levy (OK George?), although I could make sense of it. The point is, and 
<br />
Dennett agrees on this, that, in cognitive *science*, we need to 
<br />
develop some third person discourse on the first person discourses.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;OK, strictly speaking the quantum and physical discourses appears at 
<br />
some first person (plural) level.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Chalmers is not getting anywhere(*), ok. Perhaps we agree on this.
<br />
<br />[GK]
<br />
Dennett might have evolved in his position but the whole effort behind 
<br />
cognitive science has long been that of &quot;unpacking&quot;
<br />
the notion of &quot;qualia&quot; out of the philosophical discourse. But that is 
<br />
hardly the same as explaining the 1st person discourse in
<br />
3rd person language.  Explaining what elation or sadness correspond to 
<br />
in terms of neural processes does not help me find
<br />
out why I am elated today and sad tomorrow. Usually those experience 
<br />
are much easier to explain and  in objective terms.
<br />
<br />[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;(*) Using Everett to defend dualism! See the quite good explanation 
<br />
how Everett is deeply monist in the book:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;PRIMAS H., 1981, Chemistry, Quantum Mechanics and Reductionism, 
<br />
Springer-Verlag, Berlin (second, corrected edition : 1983)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt; That the &quot;hard problem&quot; or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; whatever is just a horrible consequence of the way sense impressions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; traveling on neurons give rise to people thinking that their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; own perceptions are a sort of reality independent of the physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; reality. We think that this is a sort of delusion, although the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; very #?!&amp;$-AT_SYMBOL-! structure of our language hideously leads from that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; to &quot;who or what is being deluded?&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;Mmhh....
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt; This might be a good time to ask what is meant by that word you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; just used. Hal explained &quot;computationalist hypothesis&quot; as used
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; by philosophers, e.g., that a robot (that was just CPU driven)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; could be conscious.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually this is the strong AI thesis. Logically comp is stronger, 
<br />
because comp is the thesis that &quot;I&quot; am a machine (I, You, ...). Comp is 
<br />
stronger because the fact that machine could think does not entails 
<br />
that only machine could think! (despite Occam!).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now comp is weaker than most functionalism in the philosophy of mind, 
<br />
because comp asserts only the existence of a level of substitution at 
<br />
which we are Turing-emulable. Functionalist reason like if the level 
<br />
was known, but that's impossible.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt; have believed that since 1966 when I used
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; to argue about it with people in high school. *Lots* of people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; believe that. I have taken &quot;COMP&quot; to be Bruno's Thesis, in which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; practically everything can be derived fundamentally from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; integers alone, using Gödel's results, and other rather recently
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; discovered truths.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;No no. That's the theorem. Comp is precisely the conjonction of Church 
<br />
Thesis, of some amount of belief in arithmetic, + the act of faith 
<br />
saying &quot;yes&quot; to *some* digitalist surgeon.
<br />
&nbsp;All what I say, I derive it (hopefully correctly) from comp.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also different from Schmidhuber (and many others) who makes the 
<br />
thesis that there is a &quot;physical universe&quot; and that it is computable 
<br />
(programmable). I think that comp is quasi-incompatible with this.
<br />
<br />[GK]
<br />
Quasi-incompatible, indeed!  Thanks for clearing this out. It is 
<br />
understandable why you need a 1st person belief statement
<br />
if your hypothesis is that You (Bruno) are a machine. I will grant you 
<br />
that straight away, as it occurred to me already while
<br />
noticing that most of your interventions &quot;loop&quot; around that COMP thing. 
<br />
You, Bruno Machinal are a machine! I will even grant
<br />
you that I am a machine and will say &quot;yes&quot; to your digitalist, if he 
<br />
hasn't replaced all my parts yet.  But let me ask you: doesn't 
<br />
everybody have to believe you for your hypothesis to be true? And if 
<br />
everyone does so, doesn't it automatically cease to
<br />
be an hypothesis and become the universal religion of happy machines?
<br />
<br />Mmmmmh!
<br />
<br />[LC]
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; So I dismiss the 1st person, remarking that it's &quot;existence&quot; is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; but only to be expected. If an ape or a parrot could talk, it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; could yak on about it's impressions. And they'd be of little
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; but therapeutic value.
</em><br />
<br />[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for acknowledging the therapy! With comp, this would mean the 
<br />
appearance of the physical world originates in some intrinsic universal 
<br />
machine self-therapy. It makes sense...
<br />
<br />...
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I must go now. Apology for not having respected the order of your 
<br />
paragraphs, but my computer take some initiative apparently!
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;Best regards,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Bruno

Funny, mine just did the same!!! It erased something about Bip Bip or 
<br />
some such thing. Oh well...  It  may just need some
<br />
good self-therapy. God knows what will come out of that...
