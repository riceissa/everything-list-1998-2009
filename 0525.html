<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Gilles, you are the only person I have met who does not believe in Turing,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;i.e. 'COMP' - you really need some very good arguments to deny one of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;fundamental precepts of modern science and introduce a spirit, which is what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you are doing.
</em><br />
<br />James I am afraid that you misunderstood me if you think that I am
<br />
introducing a &quot;spirit&quot; which would be different from what constitutes the
<br />
whole Universe (matter or whatever it is). I am just saying that our
<br />
behaviour is so peculiar that I can see no way to reproduce it without
<br />
respecting our detailed molecular structure. Here are what I think to be my
<br />
&quot;very good arguments&quot;.
<br />
<br />We could start by a simpler system. Imagine that you built an &quot;ordinary&quot;
<br />
computer but using some special magnetic material for its memory chips.
<br />
This material has a Curie temperature around 30°C (86 °F). When the
<br />
temperature exceeds locally this value, the bits demagnetize, which the
<br />
computer interprets as a 0. When it falls again down this value, it takes
<br />
randomly the value 1 or 0, depending in an unknown way on the detailed spin
<br />
distribution of the memory cell. (I assume the processor itself and its
<br />
&quot;program&quot; are more robust and do not change in the usual conditions). The
<br />
temperature depends on a complex manner of the internal heat dissipation
<br />
AND the external conditions, temperature, wind etc...
<br />
Do you think you have built a system equivalent to a Turing machine? Of
<br />
course if the temperature never exceeds that Turing point, you have a
<br />
regular computer perfectly reproducible and equivalent to a Turing machine.
<br />
But what if the temperature raise above this point? Now to predict the
<br />
behaviour of the machine you have to know much more precisely its internal
<br />
structure to know which part of the memory will demagnetize. You may have
<br />
to know its atomic structure to know the value of the bits after
<br />
remagnitizing. Worse, if the processor drives some mechanical device that
<br />
could perturb the atmosphere like a fan, taking into account the &quot;butterfly
<br />
effect&quot; you may be lead to simulate the whole atmosphere, including the
<br />
whole Earth surface, to know if the weather is going to be cold or warm,
<br />
with all the uncomfortable features of chaotic systems.. This is obviously
<br />
a much more formidable task than simply reproduce a computer. Furthermore
<br />
if you try to really simulate that, you will have to build a huge computer
<br />
which will provoke its own dissipation and perturb strongly the atmosphere,
<br />
and so also your first machine...Already with such a simple device, you
<br />
have built something which is &quot;computer like&quot; but which cannot be
<br />
reproduced exactly. You don't need any spirit.
<br />
<br />Now for me it's obvious that we are much more like this &quot;computer of the
<br />
second kind&quot; that like the &quot;theoretical&quot; computers (Turing machines).
<br />
Ironically our computers ARE also of this kind because their REAL behaviour
<br />
can be perturbed by external physical conditions. However, they are so
<br />
primary that exceeding the allowed temperature simply results in a crash.
<br />
Not very interesting and easily excluded by computer theory. We are a
<br />
little bit more sophisticated: we react to a larger (but not very large
<br />
indeed) range of physical conditions by adapting our behaviour, before
<br />
crashing when the temperature is really to hot, or in the absence of air,
<br />
food or water. But withing this range, the external conditions do not act
<br />
like perturbations of a &quot;normal&quot; state. They determine our life, our
<br />
representations, in some sense our &quot;spirit&quot;. You cannot imagine a human
<br />
being that would never be hungry, dursty, without sexual desire, who would
<br />
not fear diseases and death : it would simply not be human.
<br />
So if you think you could reproduce a human being (in Bruno's sense, that
<br />
is an exact copy that you could consider as another version of yourself),
<br />
for example with a silicium-based computer, tell me please how you would
<br />
implement these functionalities:
<br />
* taste a new meal and tell if it tastes good or not.
<br />
* experiment a new narcotic
<br />
* react to a new virus
<br />
* meet a girl(boy) and try to charm her(him) , (all these being still
<br />
unknown when you build it!).
<br />
<br />I need very good argument to think it is feasible without duplicating our
<br />
physical structure, or to convince me that all this is not essential to our
<br />
&quot;humanity&quot;.
<br />
<br />Cheers
<br />
<br />Gilles
