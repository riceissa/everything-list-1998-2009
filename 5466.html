On 24 April 2004 Kory Heath wrote (in response to Bruno Marchal's post of 13 
<br />
April 2004):
<br />
<br />QUOTE-
<br />
Platonia contains every possible computational state that represents a 
<br />
self-aware structure, and for each such state there are X number of 
<br />
next-possible-states, which also exist in Platonia. The chances of one 
<br />
self-aware state &quot;jumping&quot; (I know my terminology is dangerously loose here) 
<br />
to any particular next state is 1 / X, where X is the total number of 
<br />
next-possible-states for the state in question. Any regularities which 
<br />
emerge out of this indeterminate traversal from state to state will be 
<br />
perceived as local &quot;laws of physics&quot;...The real question is, what reason do 
<br />
we have to believe that any regularities actually emerge? In other words, 
<br />
how do we *know* that most of my &quot;next-possible-states&quot; do in fact contain 
<br />
stars and galaxies?
<br />
-ENDQUOTE
<br />
<br />Does the fact that we never find ourselves in one of the bizarre, 
<br />
inconsistent worlds that are postulated to exist in Platonia cast doubt on 
<br />
the reality of these worlds and the validity of the underlying theory? 
<br />
Consider this thought experiment:
<br />
<br />You are living in a time when humanity has colonised other planets in the 
<br />
solar system and teleportation is commonplace. For your vacation, you buy a 
<br />
ticket that allows you to be destructively scanned and teleported to one 
<br />
thousand fabulous destinations around the solar system. The machine also 
<br />
sends a copy of you to a receiving station next door, on Earth (it's the 
<br />
rules). You enter the sending station, press the red button, and a second 
<br />
later find yourself in slightly altered surroundings. When you get out of 
<br />
the machine, you realise that you are still on Earth. Disappointed, you buy 
<br />
another ticket on the spot and go through the same procedure again, hoping 
<br />
for a better result. Again, however, you walk out and see that you are still 
<br />
on Earth. This time, you are angry. The probability that you finish up the 
<br />
stay-home copy twice is less than one in one million! You suspect on this 
<br />
basis that the company running the teleporter has cheated you, and did not 
<br />
send copies to the holiday destinations at all. You demand a refund.
<br />
<br />The confusion here arises from using the pronoun &quot;you&quot; in the traditional 
<br />
way: as if there can only be one &quot;you&quot; in existence at any one time. 
<br />
&quot;Stay-home-you&quot; imagines he has missed out on seeing Jupiter from its moons, 
<br />
because, obviously, he is here and not there. This is valid reasoning when a 
<br />
person cannot be in two places at once, but in this case we are starting 
<br />
with the premise that a person can be in at least 1001 places at once!
<br />
<br />In a similar vein, if the existence of multiple versions of me branching out 
<br />
from the present moment in Platonia/Multiverse is allowed, the fact that 
<br />
&quot;I-typing&quot; do not experience, say, my laptop computer turning into a 
<br />
kangaroo and hopping away does not mean that it doesn't happen.
<br />
<br />(The above discussion brings up the old arguments about personal identity, 
<br />
but I will refrain from starting a thread on that topic unless others are 
<br />
interested.)
<br />
<br />Stathis Papaioannou.
