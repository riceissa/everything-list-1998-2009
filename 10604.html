<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; movie!

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Likewise, the computationalist is not required to believe that an unexecuted
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; programme is sentient (even though it has, theoretically, the counterfactuals).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; No-one would believe that a brain-scan, however detailed, is conscious, so  not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; computationalist, however ardent, is required to believe that a progamme

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; gathering udston a shelf is sentient, however good a piece of AI code it is.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Leave aside for the moment the computer running in Platonia and consider a real
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computer. You say that a computer program is defined in part by its ability to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; handle counterfactuals, distinguishing it from a mere recording, but it is this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distinction with which I have difficulties. The characters in a film are not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious because the film only simulates external appearance, not because it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lacks if-then statements. A film obviously does handle if-then statements, because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if the patterns on the film are different the projection on the screen would also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be different. 
</em><br />
<br />That's not a proper example though.  It would imply to a rock - it would be different 
<br />
if it weren't a rock.  To be intelligent (much less conscious) the if-then must be 
<br />
inresponse to different environmental inputs.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;A computer program basically does the same thing: it consistently
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; produces a certain output for a certain input. 
</em><br />
<br />That's why you can't tell whether a program is intelligent by giving it a &quot;certain 
<br />
input&quot;.  There must be a variety of inputs and the response will in general be 
<br />
different depending on their order (smart programs have memory).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;In the MWI of QM a computer program
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or human mind may have more luxuriant branchings than a recording, 
</em><br />
<br />This seems to reify the branches as part of the program.  They are part of the 
<br />
*process of running* the program.  The branches arise from different inputs.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;but that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just a matter of degree, and in any case there is no reason to suppose that a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; program is any less valid or less conscious because of the presence or absence of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; near-copies segregated in parallel universes. In the CI of QM it would be possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to introduce true randomness into a computer program but the same could be done
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for a recording, and again there is no reason to suppose that a program is any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; less valid or less conscious because it isn't random. Randomness and/or parallel
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; processes are not a prerequisite for a classical computer to function.
</em><br />
<br />I agree with that.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You might say that a computer program has a two-way interaction with its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; environment while a recording does not, but it is easy to imagine a situation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where this can be perfectly reproduced by a recording. In run no. 1, you start up
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the computer program and have a conversation with it. In run no. 2 you start up
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the computer program and play it the recording of your voice from run no. 1. As
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; far as the program is aware, it receives exactly the same inputs and goes through
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exactly the same responses on both runs, but one is a recording and the other is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not. Run no. 2 is exactly analogous to a film: a fixed input resulting in a fixed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; output, even though if the input had been different the output would also have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; been different. I don't see how you could say that the computer is conscious in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; run no. 1 but not in run no. 2.
</em><br />
<br />If the program is intelligent it'll be bored by 2. :-)  You seem to mixing questions 
<br />
of discovering whether a program is intelligent, with what it means for it to be 
<br />
intelligent.
