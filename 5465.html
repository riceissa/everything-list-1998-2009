Bruno -
<br />
<br />Thanks very much for your clarifications. I clearly misunderstood the 
<br />
intent of your point 8. I thought you were arguing that, if we analyze the 
<br />
structure of all possible 1st-person histories of all possible 
<br />
self-aware-subsystems in Platonia, we would find that histories that 
<br />
exhibit the basic elements of what we commonly think of as our &quot;laws of 
<br />
physics&quot; - say, light, gravity, etc. - have a greater measure than those 
<br />
histories that contain (say) &quot;srats and gilixas&quot;, and that therefore our 
<br />
&quot;local laws&quot; are the most common ones in Platonia. I find this position 
<br />
highly dubious, but I no longer think that's what you were saying.
<br />
<br />My new interpretation of what you're saying (and correct me if I'm wrong 
<br />
again) is that if you were to examine the entire ensemble of 
<br />
&quot;next-possible-states&quot; of *me* (Kory Heath) at this moment, you would find 
<br />
that (as a mathematical fact, part of the basic structure of Platonia) most 
<br />
of them contain galaxies and stars, etc. Therefore, the regularities I see 
<br />
around me are simply the emergent effect of my &quot;first person indeterminacy 
<br />
domain&quot;. If we imagine some other computational state that represents a SAS 
<br />
with a personality, memories of growing up in a world that contains &quot;srats 
<br />
and gilixas&quot;, etc., most of that SAS's next-possible-states would contain 
<br />
srats and gilixas, so a very different set of stable &quot;local laws&quot; would 
<br />
emerge from that SAS's &quot;first person indeterminacy domain&quot;. (We can imagine 
<br />
that the resulting regularities resemble a 4+1D cellular automata, which 
<br />
contains nothing like our gravity, light, etc.).
<br />
<br />I'm still confused by some parts of your post. I don't see why the 
<br />
assumption that most of my &quot;next-possible-states&quot; do in fact contain stars 
<br />
and galaxies necessarily follows from points 1-7. Here's a very rough 
<br />
sketch of what I think points 1-7 *do* imply:
<br />
<br />Platonia contains every possible computational state that represents a 
<br />
self-aware structure, and for each such state there are X number of 
<br />
next-possible-states, which also exist in Platonia. The chances of one 
<br />
self-aware state &quot;jumping&quot; (I know my terminology is dangerously loose 
<br />
here) to any particular next state is 1 / X, where X is the total number of 
<br />
next-possible-states for the state in question. Any regularities which 
<br />
emerge out of this indeterminate traversal from state to state will be 
<br />
perceived as local &quot;laws of physics&quot;.
<br />
<br />Now, you say: &quot;Let us (re)define the laws of physics as the laws we can 
<br />
always predict and verify consistently (if any!). Now, having accepted the 
<br />
1-7 points, the occurrence of such laws must have a measure 1, so the laws 
<br />
of physics must be derivable from what has measure 1 relatively to the 
<br />
measure on the computational histories.&quot; I agree with this, but to me it 
<br />
seems like a simple tautology - another statement of my above paragraph. It 
<br />
sounds to me like you're saying that the (local) laws of physics are 
<br />
whatever regularities emerge when we examine the entire ensemble of 
<br />
next-possible-states from my current state (and the ensemble of all the 
<br />
next-possible-states from each of those possible-states, and so on). This 
<br />
is tautologically true - &quot;whatever emerges, emerges&quot;. The real question is, 
<br />
what reason do we have to believe that any regularities actually emerge? In 
<br />
other words, how do we *know* that most of my &quot;next-possible-states&quot; do in 
<br />
fact contain stars and galaxies? This idea doesn't necessarily follow from 
<br />
anything in points 1-7.
<br />
<br />Perhaps you're arguing the following: we do in fact perceive a world filled 
<br />
with regularities, which we have codified into our local &quot;laws of physics&quot;. 
<br />
Therefore, *if* points 1-7 are true - that is, if &quot;comp&quot; is true - then it 
<br />
must be the case that most of my &quot;next-possible-states&quot; do in fact contain 
<br />
stars and galaxies and gravity and light. If I were (somehow) able to 
<br />
completely mathematically analyze one of my computational states and all of 
<br />
its next-possible-states, and if I then determined that the probabilities 
<br />
in this ensemble of next-possible-states *didn't* match the regularities I 
<br />
actually perceive, then I should conclude that comp is false. If this is 
<br />
your argument, then it might be helpful to add another point - lets call it 
<br />
Point 7.5 - which states that &quot;we do in fact perceive regularities that we 
<br />
codify into (local) laws of physics&quot;. Then your argument can run: if points 
<br />
1-7.5 are all true, then it must be true that most of my 
<br />
next-possible-states contain stars and galaxies.
<br />
<br />This argument implies a constraint on comp - which is good, because it 
<br />
means that comp is falsifiable - but it doesn't give me any clue how to 
<br />
show mathematically that most of Kory Heath's next-possible-states actually 
<br />
do contain stars and galaxies - i.e. that most of Kory Heath's 
<br />
next-possible-states match the laws of physics, or at least exhibit some 
<br />
kind of probabilistic bias that would result in perceived regularities. I 
<br />
suppose that this is what you mean when you say that we need to &quot;&quot;modelize&quot; 
<br />
or better &quot;identify&quot; a platonistic observer by a sound modest
<br />
(lobian) universal church-turing-post-markov-fortran-lisp-java-whatever 
<br />
machine (including quantum one)&quot;, and to &quot;interview it about those relative 
<br />
consistent extensions and its inferable platonistic geometries and what is 
<br />
stable in their discourses.&quot; I have to confess that I don't have a very 
<br />
clear picture of what results you've derived from all of that.
<br />
<br />I'm also somewhat confused by the following statement:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;But &quot;platonistically&quot; it remains that if comp is true
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the actual physical invariant must emerge as an average
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;on ALL the maximal consistent extensions relative to our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;actual states (worlds, observer-moments, whatever ...).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Although that can be proved useless for actually predicting the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;behavior of the chalk, it is enough for deriving physics.
</em><br />
<br />If this is enough for &quot;deriving physics&quot;, why isn't it enough to predict 
<br />
the behavior of falling chalk, since gravity is one of the most basic 
<br />
elements of our physics? Or are you referring to something different than 
<br />
the &quot;local geographical laws&quot; that we call physics?
<br />
