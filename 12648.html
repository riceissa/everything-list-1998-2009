<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Bruno:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  &quot; 4) Mark Peaty wrote (to Brent):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; As I say, the essence of evil is the act of treating other persons as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; things.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I so agree with you. And then, with Church thesis (less than comp, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thus) you can understand the reason why even some (relative) machine 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and some (relative) numbers should not be confused with any of their 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; third person description. &quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  MP: There is too much packed in this for me to be clear of the scope.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  For example: by 'machine' do you mean, generically, any hypothetical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-referencing, sufficiently complex device - or virtual emulation 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of such - smart enough to think it knows who it is?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Which numbers have anything BUT a third person description?
</em><br />
<br /><br />I can explain (see UDA) why if you assume comp, numbers get private 
<br />
first person relation with respect to other numbers or with unameable, 
<br />
from their point of view, set of numbers. I have to use the Wi and Fi 
<br />
to explain this. I do identify machine and their godel numbers (or any 
<br />
finite description of the machine) at some point.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I am of course very ignorant about higher mathematics, so the way I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; use words is that a number is a mathematical object that has/is a [or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of a] particular value. I guess that means that a number, for me 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anyway, is a thing not a process. People use processes to generate, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; define and compare numbers. These processes are to mathematica what 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; verbs, adverbs, adjectives, complex nouns and all the phrases [noun 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; phr, adjectival phr, etc.] are to natural languages. Because of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; precise specifications required for such mathematical processes, which 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I suppose means their algorithmic qualities, many of them are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical objects in their own right,
</em><br />
<br />All right.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; so they do what they do and not anything else.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Universal machine can mirror all machine, and nobody can built a theory 
<br />
predicting, for any of their inputs, what they will or can do.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Bruno [quote continued]:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Do you agree that those who believe in a primitive physical universe 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could be deluded in the same manner than those who believe in some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; notion of God. Perhaps even in a worse manner, because many people 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; believe that the existence of a primitive material universe is a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;scientific fact&quot;. Of course not. At least in many theological text, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the word &quot;God&quot; is used in a more axiomatic way than &quot;Matter&quot; is by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some scientist (at lunch or during the week-end). Most religious 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; people will never say that the existence of God is a scientific fact, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and in that sense are less deluded than many materialist. &quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  MP: I don't see how people who believe in 'some notion of God' can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; honestly get past the intelligent child's question of 'Well alright, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where did G/god/s come from then'. It is a simple question without an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; answer except something like: 'Shut up you little smart a*se!' or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'BLASPHEMY!! Thou deservest to be burnt at the stake!'
</em><br />
<br /><br />I don't see how people who believe in 'some notion of Primary Matter' 
<br />
can honestly get past the child's question of &quot;Well all right, where 
<br />
did that Physical Matter come from then' It is a simple question 
<br />
without an answer except something like: 'Shut up you little smart, 
<br />
...&quot;.
<br />
<br />Mark, what I say is that if someone say &quot;the physical universe exists 
<br />
in some primitive sense&quot; I call it a theologian. If he acknowledge it 
<br />
is an assumption, I call it &quot;honest theologian&quot;, dishonest, if not.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  For me a very important aspect of this latter issue is that any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; purported supernatural being cannot have a coherent explanation in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; terms of natural science and,
</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree there is no need for assuming supernatural. But pretending 
<br />
&quot;Matter&quot; *is* primitive, makes Matter and Nature already supernatural.
<br />
It is an extrapolation from our most old animals instinctive guess.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; if taken of itself to be an explanation for any of that which is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and/or that which transpires, it disempowers the believers concerned 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and any of those in their care.
</em><br />
<br />I think we agree, at some level.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why? Because, as I think I said before, one of the several Earth 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shaking things that the advent of scientific method has brought to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; human race is the objective demonstration that no publicly stated 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; belief or public assertion of the nature of things is immune from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sceptical examination which is conducted in an ethical manner.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK. I prefer not to believe in science but in scientific attitude (this 
<br />
is field independent). To say &quot;science has prove the existence of a 
<br />
physical universe&quot; can only come from an unscientific attitude.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  That said, I can now return to the deeper question which is: Is it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; coherent to assert that there is no universe?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Actually it could be, according to the lobian machine, but ok, it would 
<br />
be not really interesting. But primarily physical or not, it is an 
<br />
assumption, at some level.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  In common sense, plain English terms that is pretty much like saying 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that 'Nothing really exists!'
</em><br />
<br />You know I believe in many things. The point is just that if comp is 
<br />
true then physics has to be derived from number theory. It is a 
<br />
technical point, not a personal opinion.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; ... which Does not compute!
</em><br />
<br /><br />No. Comp entails that not only uncomputable things exists, but that 
<br />
uncomputable things interfere in a verifiable way with &quot;me&quot;, assuming 
<br />
&quot;me&quot; is locally computable.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Like dividing or multiplying by zero, you either lock up your system 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or get no useful extra result. It is therefore necessary to accept 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that one exists, with the bookmarked proviso that 'exists' needs 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; further research, and accept that for the time being there is no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; really coherent substitute for taking as given one's own existence in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a world of some sort.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree 100%. But many concludes for this that PRIMARY MATTER exists. 
<br />
Like if we knew Aristotle correct and Plato wrong. It is prematured to 
<br />
say the least.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In fact as I said somewhere else it is one of only two completely free 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things in life. [The other if you remember is the benefits which come 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from saying 'Think positive, it is better for you' and acting as if 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you believe it.]
</em><br />
<br />I agree. Actually I can prove to you that somehow &quot;lobianity&quot; is a form 
<br />
of self-positive thinking.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  My point in harping on in this way is simply so as to point out that:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  whilst it IS necessary to assert an assumption of existence beyond 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; oneself, and to be ethical it is necessary to acknowledge the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; independent existence of the other people one meets, ...
</em><br />
<br />OK,
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; ... there is no such more-or-less a priori reason for positing the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence of supernatural beings of any sort whatever.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree. Completely. That is why I do not posit &quot;nature&quot; which in many 
<br />
philosophical text play the role of the old &quot;supernature&quot;.
<br />
As scientist we have to be agnostic on things like GOD, PRIMITIVE 
<br />
REALITY, PRIMARY MATTER, etc.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The assertion of the existence of G/god/s is gratuitous, and the very 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concept is characteristically pre-scientific.
</em><br />
<br />Well, it all depends what you intend to mean with &quot;universe&quot;, God&quot; etc. 
<br />
With comp, Plotinus's God is more coherent with the facts, that the 
<br />
Aristotelian primary matter.
<br />
If we decide to keep the scientific mind/attitude, let us not stop on 
<br />
the half of it.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Furthermore, the very concept of an omniscient being, never mind 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; omnipotent, depends for its credibility upon the acceptance of some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; kind of naive realism.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Right.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is to say, the truth concerning the types of awareness we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; actually experience and for which credible sceptically proficient 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observation has been made, always entails a very limited, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; circumscribed apprehension of self and world.
</em><br />
<br /><br />... relative to some theories.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is consistent with the most reasonable conceptions of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness and sentience which entail the absolutely necessary 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; activity of some kind of neural network, however instantiated.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I do agree with this. I am interested in the question &quot;where does those 
<br />
neural things come from?&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In other words, the only real evidence we have that stands up to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reasonable scrutiny, supports only the idea that consciousness is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; either embodied or it doesn't exist! 
</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree. Completely. Consciousness is mainly (instinctive) belief in a 
<br />
reality. It needs a &quot;body&quot;, which means a relative interpretation. It 
<br />
does not mean neural nets have an eventually real substrate. That would 
<br />
be a non rational jump.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I will go yet further and assert that not only is embodiment essential 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for the occurrence of consciousness but the process REQUIRES the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; representation in some form of both the observer and the observed plus 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; representation of the current salient relationships between them.
</em><br />
<br />Yes. But machine cannot specify which machine they are, still less 
<br />
which computational story they belong to. This entails some testable 
<br />
indeterminacy.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; When this occurs then, and only then, is there something [or a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; somethinggoingon, for the purists] which can be 'like being 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something', as opposed to simply being it without knowing it.
</em><br />
<br />Yes.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  The radical and apple cart damaging entailment of this is that by the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very nature of the process - by definition if you like - the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subjective experience which occurs cannot possibly be all of simply 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being the entity in question.
</em><br />
<br />That is the essence of not confusing the third person description of a 
<br />
machine, and her personal first person view the machine can have about 
<br />
herself.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  The process is one of construction,
</em><br />
<br /><br />Exactly. This is what the lobian machine can prove about some third 
<br />
person description of the notion of first person.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  in fact I think the word 'updating' has an important place here too, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and this process involves overheads, in the form of structures and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; processes which must be and occur just to keep the system running, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; adapting to its environment and repairing itself.
</em><br />
<br /><br />As far as you don't reify the environment (which with comp is just the 
<br />
most probable mathematical computational history), I continue to agree.
<br />
Well said!
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; From this it follows that even the biggest brains in the universe, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wherever they may be and however old, will share with us the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; limitations of not being able to see the backs of our own eyeballs or, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as George Gurdjieff put it: they too cannot jump over their own 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; knees!   :-)     Who needs G/god/s like that!
</em><br />
<br /><br />To be sure the lobian machine-itself (G), here, is mute. But its 
<br />
guardian angels (G*) says something like that. The machine can say: as 
<br />
far as I am consistent I will share those limitations of not being able 
<br />
to see the backs of our own eyeballs. But the machine says more; she 
<br />
says she can see the border of the blind spot, and that if comp is 
<br />
correct the physical laws emerge there, even in a arithmetical sort of 
<br />
darwinian way, and actually in a completely verifiable way.
