<br />
I have begun reading the book Wei recommended, Foundations of Causal
<br />
Decision Theory, by James Joyce.  I have a few comments and questions
<br />
to see if I should finish it.  I'm at about page 100 of about 250 pages.
<br />
<br />I didn't know what decision theory was before starting this book.
<br />
In fact it seemed trivial: pick the best outcome!  How can you build a
<br />
theory around what is essentially the &quot;maximum&quot; function?
<br />
<br />It seems that the point of decision theory is to justify this kind of
<br />
reasoning based on more elementary axioms.  These axioms try to capture
<br />
notions of what we mean by rationality.  In this respect the book is
<br />
as much philosophy as mathematics.  It draws fine distinctions: for
<br />
example, when we make a decision to take an action, that is different
<br />
from actually taking the action (it comes before taking the action).
<br />
And preferring one alternative to another is different from simply
<br />
saying that we would choose the first alternative over the second;
<br />
it is a matter of dispositions and feelings, rather than behavior.
<br />
<br />Another very surprising aspect relates to the word &quot;causal&quot;
<br />
in the title.  Apparently the world of decision theorists has
<br />
undergone a schism based on some seemingly obscure issues relating
<br />
to Newcomb's Paradox.  A sample page describing this paradox is at
<br />
<a href="http://members.aol.com/kiekeben/newcomb.html">http://members.aol.com/kiekeben/newcomb.html</a>.
<br />
<br />In the paradox, you can take one box or two.  Deciding to take one
<br />
box gives you reason to believe that there is more money in the box.
<br />
This is the preference of &quot;evidentiary&quot; decision theory; by making this
<br />
decision, you gain evidence that the world is such that the outcome
<br />
will be beneficial.  But the other argument is that the money is in
<br />
the boxes already, so taking both boxes will directly cause you to get
<br />
more money than taking one.  This is the preference of &quot;causal&quot; decision
<br />
theory, where your actions are analyzed in terms of their direct causes.
<br />
This book is about causal decision theory in this sense.
<br />
<br />The author argues that causal decision theory is correct and specifically
<br />
that in the Newcomb paradox one should take both boxes, even though he
<br />
concedes that under the terms of the paradox you get less money that way.
<br />
I have always been a take-one-box guy but I will admit that he makes a
<br />
pretty good case for it being rational to take both boxes.  In fact the
<br />
author claims that his side has essentially won among decision theorists,
<br />
with only a few holdouts still clinging to the other side.  No doubt he
<br />
is somewhat biased in making this claim, but if even partially true it
<br />
is quite surprising and interesting.
<br />
<br />Causal decision theory is apparently a little more difficult to set
<br />
up mathematically, because you have to distinguish outcomes which are
<br />
directly caused by your actions from those where your actions lead
<br />
more generally to a positive outcome.  Much of the point of this book
<br />
is to show a sound axiomatic formulation for causal decision theory.
<br />
This requires bringing in notions of causality and setting up probability
<br />
distributions based on &quot;caused&quot; outcomes rather than just the outcomes
<br />
themselves.
<br />
<br />I have looked ahead a little bit at this part of the book, and
<br />
unfortunately it appears that the discussion of causality is rather
<br />
abbreviated and mostly brings in some rather complex results from the
<br />
literature.  The philosophical literature on causality is quite large
<br />
in itself and probably some familiarity with that would help to see how
<br />
it relates to decision theory.
<br />
<br />Overall I am not sure how to relate the ideas in this book to the issues
<br />
we deal with.  One connection is that the causal aspect sheds light on
<br />
soem of the paradoxes we have discussed, such as the paradox of Adam
<br />
and Eve which Nick Bostrom covers in his thesis.  In this situation
<br />
Adam wants a deer to come along so he can eat it, and to arrange this
<br />
he plans never to mate with Eve if that happens.  If the deer doesn't
<br />
come along then he will mate with Eve and create the whole human race,
<br />
in which case it is highly unlikely that his particular observer-moments
<br />
would be chosen.  So he reasons that from his perspective, since he is
<br />
in fact experiencing his observer-moments, it is likely that no large
<br />
human race will be produced and hence that the deer will come along.
<br />
<br />There are various resolutions to this seeming paradox, but based on this
<br />
book I can see it as a Newcomb problem.  Adam is giving himself evidence
<br />
that the deer will come, he is not causing the deer to come.  So from
<br />
the perspective of causal decision theory, he is wrong to try this plan.
<br />
However this reasoning does require you to accept the causal prescription
<br />
in all Newcomb problems, which may be a harder nut to swallow than other
<br />
solutions to the Adam and Eve paradox.
<br />
<br />More directly, the book provides various proposed axioms for rationality
<br />
and choice.  I have tried to consider how they might relate to the
<br />
existence of multiple universes, but I don't see much connection.
<br />
It seems that one is still faced with the simple prescription of choosing
<br />
the outcome that maximizes the expected utility, with considerable
<br />
freedom for the utility functions.
<br />
<br />One question is whether we can restrict or limit the decisions people make
<br />
in some of the paradoxes of copying.  I am going to have some duplicates
<br />
made, and then they will have some experiences, and then some of those
<br />
duplicates get further duplicated, etc.  Can we constrain the decisions
<br />
a rational person will make in these experiments?  For example, if he
<br />
is given a chance to be duplicated to two people, and one will have
<br />
something good happen and one will have something bad, can we argue that
<br />
he should agree to this based on a 50% mixture of the utilities of the
<br />
two experiences?  If we can make these kinds of statements, or even some
<br />
weaker ones, then I think this theory may be helpful in shedding light
<br />
on the issues we have dealt with.
