<br />
This is an attempt to save baysianism in the face of the coin-toss copying
<br />
paradox. There are two parts to this solution:
<br />
<br />1. Statements which use the word &quot;I&quot;, &quot;me&quot;, or &quot;my&quot; do not count as well
<br />
defined hypotheses. They are not assigned probabilities.
<br />
2. There is only one real universe. (The One Universe Hypothesis or 1UH)
<br />
<br />The justification for 1 is that the word &quot;I&quot; is being used to refer to
<br />
different objects in different statements, so what appears to be
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P(AB|C) &lt;&gt; P(A|BC)P(B|C)
<br />
is actually
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P(AB|C) &lt;&gt; P(A|DC)P(D|C)
<br />
which is not interesting. Instead of &quot;I&quot;, we need to be more specific. For
<br />
example, &quot;I will perceive X at time t&quot; should be replaced with &quot;Everyone
<br />
at time t who remembers being in mind state M will perceive X&quot; or &quot;At
<br />
least one person at time t who remembers being in mind state M will
<br />
perceive X&quot;.
<br />
<br />Now if we accept 1 and the AUH, then every hypothesis would have a
<br />
probability of either 1 or 0. That is why 2 is also needed.
<br />
<br />This approach solves several related paradoxes. First recall the single
<br />
coin-toss copying paradox. In this experiment there are two possible
<br />
universes. In universe A the experimenter (t=1) tosses a coin, (t=2)
<br />
observes heads, and (t=3) is duplicated. In universe B the experimenter
<br />
(t=1) tosses a coin, (t=2) observes tails, (t=3) is not duplicated. The
<br />
paradox is that 
<br />
<br />P(I will observe heads at t=3|I am at t=1) = 2/3, 
<br />
P(I will observe heads at t=2|I am at t=1) = 1/2, and 
<br />
P(I will observe heads at t=3|I will observe heads at t=2) = 1 
<br />
<br />are not consistent with each other. Under the proposed solution, these
<br />
statements will be restated as well defined hypotheses. Let M be the
<br />
experimenter's mind state at t=1. 
<br />
<br />&quot;I will observe heads at t=3&quot; becomes R = &quot;Everyone at t=3 who remembers
<br />
being in state M will observe heads.&quot;
<br />
&quot;I will observe heads at t=2&quot; becomes S = &quot;Everyone at t=2 who remembers
<br />
being in state M will observe heads.&quot;
<br />
&quot;I am at t=1&quot; becomes T = &quot;The real universe contains a person with mind
<br />
state M at t=1.&quot;
<br />
<br />The relevant probabilities then become:
<br />
<br />P(R|T) = 1/2
<br />
P(S|T) = 1/2
<br />
P(R|S) = 1
<br />
<br />and the paradox is solved.
<br />
<br />This solution takes care of the Doomsday Argument as well. (See Nick's
<br />
paper for a description of the DA.) Consider two possible universes.
<br />
Universe A ends after the 100th birth. Universe B ends after the 200th
<br />
birth. Suppose someone in one of these universes has not yet learned his
<br />
birth rank, and denote his mind state as M. His P(universe A is real) =
<br />
P(universe B is real) = 1/2. Now suppose someone tells him that his birth
<br />
rank is 40. Since &quot;My birth rank is 40&quot; is not a well defined hypothesis,
<br />
he restates that as E = &quot;At least one person with mind state M has birth
<br />
rank 40.&quot; Since P(E | universe A is real) = P(E | universe B is real) = 1,
<br />
this knowledge does not change his beliefs about which universe is real.
<br />
<br />Finally consider the infinite births paradox. In this paradox there is
<br />
only one possible universe. This universe is infinite in time and has an
<br />
infinite number of births. Each person is born conscious and is told his
<br />
birth rank after a day. The paradox is P(My birth rank is n|I was just
<br />
born) = 0 for all n. This can now be restated as P(At least one person
<br />
with mind state M has birth rank n|There exist a person with mind state M)
<br />
= 1 where M is the mind state of everyone who was just born (we assume
<br />
they all have identical mind states).
<br />
<br />So a solution to the copying paradox and various other paradoxes is
<br />
available, but it requires a specific denial of the AUH. I believe solving
<br />
these paradoxes within AUH is possible, but more difficult, because it
<br />
would require a new decision theory.
