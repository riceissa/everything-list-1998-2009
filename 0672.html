<em class="quotelev1">&gt; else is therefore irrelevant to the calculation and to the definition.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The way I have seen this calculation justified is to consider that you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are randomly chosen from among all possible observers who are consistent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with what you are experiencing here/now.  This is more limited than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the SSA because the reference set is just those observers who share
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; identical mental states.  Each person does his probability calculations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with regard to that reference set.  From his perspective, he is in one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of many possible universes, constrained by what he observes and knows.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But there is no chance that he is a tentacled alien on alpha centauri.
</em><br />
<br />This is what I meant by forgetting the old way of thinking. The above
<br />
paragraph probably would have made sense before I learned about the SSA,
<br />
but now it doesn't. If the reference set is just those observers who share
<br />
identical mental states, then everyone in the reference set must be having
<br />
identical observations, right? Or are you saying the reference set is just
<br />
those observers who are in a similar mental state as my own (e.g. everyone
<br />
who have the same memories as me and are reading a Mathematica output but
<br />
not necessarily &quot;N[Pi]=3.14159&quot;)? This has many problems, but let me make
<br />
sure I understand you first.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Consider the &quot;extra strong&quot; SSA where the reference set is all subsystems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of all universes, not just conscious ones, so that you consider the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possibility that you might have been a rock in your calculations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You will get the same answer for the probability above under this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumption as well as the conventional SSSA, because in both cases we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exclude from consideration any other possibility than that you are you.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So this extra strong SSA should be just as good as the strong SSA in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; terms of defining the conditional probability, so therefore the strong
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; SSA must not be a necessary philosophical underpinning.
</em><br />
<br />Actually you have just set up my next argument for me. The strong SSA does
<br />
not apply to unconscious reasoning machines, so it can't be used as a
<br />
universal principal of reasoning. The extra strong SSA works for conscious
<br />
beings, but also applies to unconscious beings. Furthermore, it eliminates
<br />
the need to define &quot;conscious&quot;, something that we have not shown is even
<br />
possible. 
<br />
<br />The strong SSA (without the SIA) and the extra strong SSA do not have
<br />
identical implications for conscious beings, however. The extra strong SSA
<br />
allows one to draw conclusions from the fact that one is conscious,
<br />
whereas the strong SSA does not. For example, if we can show that the
<br />
truth of a certain mathematical statement implies that the universe
<br />
contains more conscious beings (for whatever definition of &quot;conscious&quot;
<br />
that includes me), then under the extra strong SSA the fact that I am
<br />
conscious is evidence for that statement being true. 
<br />
<br />Interestingly, the extra strong SSA and the strong SSA with the SIA do
<br />
produce identical conclusions for conscious beings. The DA (Doomsday
<br />
Argument), for example, is neutralized by the extra strong SSA as well as
<br />
by the SIA. I think the SIA should really be seen as an implication of the
<br />
extra strong SSA rather than as a fundamental axiom of reasoning.
<br />
<br />(SIA, the Self-Indication Axiom, is defined by Nick Bostrom as: The fact
<br />
that one is an observer gives one some reason to believe that the world
<br />
contains many observers.)
