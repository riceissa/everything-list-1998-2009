<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The problem with generic SAI is the one you brought up: how do you

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one) made the arrow himself.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Hmmm.... It seems to me you are quite quick here.
<br />
<br />Especially after reading Vance novels, as linked by Marc.
<br />
<br />Is God good? Well, according to Plato, accepting the rather natural 
<br />
&quot;theological&quot; interpretation of the Parmenides (like Plotinus), there 
<br />
is a sense to say that God is &quot;good&quot;, but probably not in the Christian 
<br />
sense (if that can be made precise). Indeed, Plato's God is just Truth. 
<br />
And Truth is not good as such, but the awareness of truth, or simply 
<br />
the search of truth,  is, for a Platonist,  a prerequisite for the 
<br />
*possible* development of goodness.
<br />
Truth is necessary for justice, and justice is necessary for goodness. 
<br />
That's the idea. It makes knowledge (and thus truth) a good thing, in 
<br />
principle.
<br />
But Vance's novel rises a doubt. Actually, that doubt can rise through 
<br />
the reading of the first Pythagorean writings, which insist so much on  
<br />
hiding their knowledge to the non-initiated people, making them secret. 
<br />
(according to the legend, their kill a disciple who dares to make 
<br />
public the discovery of the irrationality of the square root of 2). 
<br />
Maimonides also, in his &quot;Guide for the perplexed&quot; insists that 
<br />
fundamental knowledge has to be reserved for the initiated or the elite 
<br />
people.
<br />
<br />Fundamentally I don't know. I know a lot of particular case where 
<br />
knowledge can be bad. But this happens always in &quot;human, too much 
<br />
human&quot; practical circumstances, like during war, illness, etc.  (it is 
<br />
not good that your enemies *knows* where are your missiles; it is not 
<br />
good to tell a bad new to some old dying people, etc. But this never 
<br />
concerns fundamental truth.
<br />
<br />I guess it *is* a question of faith. Of course, something like complete 
<br />
knowledge, would be bad, making life without any purpose (at least it 
<br />
is natural to fear that), but in this case both lobianity, and well, 
<br />
may be things like Christianity, remind us about our finiteness and 
<br />
about the fact that complete knowledge is inconsistent (even for Gods, 
<br />
but not for the Unnameable, making it above thinking (something 
<br />
Plotinus understood, but I am not sure Christians, following here 
<br />
Aristotle theology,  take this seriously into account but then they do 
<br />
have confuse temporal and spiritual power isn't it?).
<br />
<br />Now, Tom, to come back to the present thread, i.e. Wei Dai's question 
<br />
on the meaning of the measure problem with respect to the ASSA 
<br />
philosophy, frankly I am not sure that saying that God is responsible 
<br />
for the indexical &quot;arrow&quot; will put light. It looks a bit like closing 
<br />
even the possibility of progressing, given that God can hardly be 
<br />
invoked in any attempt to scientifically explains something (cf 
<br />
&quot;scientifically&quot; means based on a clear and doubtable (if not 
<br />
refutable) theory). So you would have to elaborate, but as we have 
<br />
already discussed, to use God here would mean that you do have a 
<br />
doubtable and clear theory of God. OK if you are using lobian theology 
<br />
(which is cristal clear I think), but which cannot be related so easily 
<br />
with any human religion without much work on both human and machine and 
<br />
comp, etc. We would quickly been led to propositions far more 
<br />
difficult, not to say controversial, than Wei Dai's original question.
<br />
Of course, here, those who take the primacy of a physical universe for 
<br />
granted, somehow, makes the same mistake than those who take God or a 
<br />
God for granted. Such moves hide the questions through incommunicable 
<br />
(perhaps even false) &quot;certitude&quot;.
<br />
