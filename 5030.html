<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I would be interested in reading the opinions of the participants

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; about that point and about the sense that could be given to the

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; question of what &quot;happens&quot; (in the simulated universe) in any non-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; synchronous simulation &quot;when&quot; the simulation diverges ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'll make two points.  First, you're right that there are other ways of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computing a universe than simply starting with some initial conditions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and evolving &quot;time&quot; forward step by step, computing the state of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe at each subsequent instant.  You list several ways this might
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happen and I agree that this concept makes sense.  We might call this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;non-sequential&quot; or &quot;non-temporal&quot; simulation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But, given the specific temporal structures that exist in our universe,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there are limitations to how this computation can be done.  Specifically,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we are able to construct physical computers in this universe which perform
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; complex calculations.  And among these calculations are those which are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; believed to be inherently sequential and lengthy, calculations for which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the answer cannot be computed without spending a great deal of time from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the initial values.
</em><br />
<br />I'll make two subpoints. First, I don't believe in any way that
<br />
it is possible to simulate our (and probably any) universe within
<br />
itself. I would say that the universe in which we would simulate
<br />
another universe have to be much larger than the simluated one.
<br />
Even if it could be conceived in some compact and general way,
<br />
it could not be expanded within itself.
<br />
<br />Second, I do not share the view that there are things like
<br />
&quot;temporal structures&quot; that place constraints on how computations
<br />
could be done (in other universes or in appropriate mathematical
<br />
structures if the distinction makes sense). I believe this view
<br />
is biased by our anthropomorphic perception of nature and
<br />
sepcifcally of causality (you can refer to my reply to John M. <a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m4962.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m4962.html</a>). I see
<br />
&quot;temporal structures&quot; as emergent properties and not as a basic
<br />
underlying mechanism. The emegence of these properties should
<br />
be simulated as well and not be used in the simulation process
<br />
(possibly making the simulation work much more complicated but
<br />
the alternative appears simplistic and meaningless to me).
<br />
<br />Given a set of equations, we could solve them either using initial
<br />
conditions, using final conditions, or using any appropriate
<br />
possibly much more complicated set of conditions. It is well
<br />
known that tiny variations in initial conditions can lead to
<br />
huge variations at some point later (known as the butterfly wing
<br />
flap effect, possibly a non standard translation of the french
<br />
equivalent). It *might* seem simpler to start with initial
<br />
contitions and to go forward instead of any alternative but it
<br />
is not sure that, if we are to do the computations with the
<br />
appropriate accuracy to get sound result at any time later,
<br />
it well really reduce the complexity or the required execution
<br />
time.
<br />
<br />Intuitively, If we wish to reach a given level of accuracy at
<br />
all &quot;places&quot;, I see the problem equally complex whether we start
<br />
with an initial condition and go forward, we start with a final
<br />
condition and go backward, we use any appropriate combination of
<br />
initial, internal and final conditions or even we use any higher
<br />
level consideradion among which I particularly like that one
<br />
(which has the additional advantage to be consistent with
<br />
Hawging's hypothesis that the universe does not have boundaries):
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the set of rule and equations, choose the solution in
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;which the universe is &quot;as much as possible more ordered on one
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;side than on the other&quot;.
<br />
<br />This might well be a sound additional condition to the set of
<br />
equation/rules to define a limited set of possible universes
<br />
and one would notice at once that this kind of condition is
<br />
very well appropriate to select those in which SASs have a
<br />
chance to emerge. This condition does not seem alone enough
<br />
to define a unique mathematical structure but there might be
<br />
a little number of ways according to which the remaining
<br />
symmetries could be canonically broken.
<br />
<br />I would be interested in knowing whether this idea is original
<br />
and, if not, in getting earlier references.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Given that our universe contains systems like this, it constrains the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; amount of computation which must be done in any kind of non-sequential
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simulation.  Specifically, the non-sequential simulation must do at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; least as much computation in order to produce our universe as the more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; traditional kind of sequential simulation.  This demonstrates a limit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on the power of non-sequential simulation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My second point is with regard to your specific question, what would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happen if we tried to simulate a universe which diverged in some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; space-time region from the conventional physical laws?  This is our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; often-discussed &quot;flying rabbit&quot; paradox (we have other names as well),
</em><br />
<br />The oldest one I know of is about somebody walking on water,
<br />
possibly 2500+ years ago. I always perfer to give credit to
<br />
the more original reference (might be Zoroastre).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; where it seems that if all universes exist, we might as well be living
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in a universe which was lawful everywhere except in some small region,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or up until a certain time, as in one where the laws are truly universal.
</em><br />
<br />I am not sure this would require violation of universal laws.
<br />
Alternatively, it could be something like a &quot;singularity&quot; in
<br />
&quot;boundary conditions&quot;. This involves a distinction between
<br />
truly unisersal (basic) laws and statistically/macroscopically
<br />
emergent laws (like the 2nd law of thermodynamics). Violation
<br />
of the seconds does not imply violation of the firsts. The
<br />
second type of laws seems more relative to boundary conditions
<br />
than to first type of laws. There is not reason for ma than
<br />
&quot;men walking on water&quot; constitute a violation of the first type
<br />
(basic, universal) laws. It could just arise from &quot;biased&quot;
<br />
&quot;boundary conditions&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Your question is whether this concept makes sense in a non-sequential
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simulation, or whether it assumes sequential simulation.
</em><br />
<br />Not exactly. My question was not merely whether &quot;men walking
<br />
on water&quot; happen more or less in sequential than in non-sequential
<br />
simulation but what sense it makes to link that to a *divergence
<br />
of the simulation* in a sense that this view makes a link between
<br />
the time in the computer in which the simulation is carried out
<br />
and &quot;the&quot; time in the universe which is simulated. In other words:
<br />
what sense would it make to postulate that &quot;men walk on water&quot; when
<br />
the simulation reaches a given level of accuracy ?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think it makes just as much sense in the context of non-sequential
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simulation.  The non-sequential simulator is trying to find or create a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe which satisfies certain physical laws.  It may be iteratively
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; solving a differential equation or using some other non-temporal method,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but that is its goal, its mechanism.  The case at hand is simply
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a matter of defining the physical laws to be different in different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; regions of space-time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We could define the physical laws which the non-sequential simulator is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; trying to solve in some such terms.  We'd say, observe these laws in this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; region, but these other laws in that region.  For example, we might say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to observe the true laws of our universe (whatever they turn out to be)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; up to simulated time T, and then to observe other laws after time T.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Or similarly we could have one set of laws up to spatial coordiate X,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and another set of laws on the other side of X.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The non-sequential simulator would have no more difficulty in creating
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a universe which satisfied such non-uniform physical laws than in one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where the laws were the same everywhere.  So I'd say that the issue of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sequential vs non-sequential simulation is irrelevant to the question
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the existence of &quot;flying rabbit&quot; universes and does not shed light
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on the issue.
</em><br />
<br />See above.
