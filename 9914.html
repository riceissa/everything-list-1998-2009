Hi Tom,
<br />
<br />I will comment your (important imo) first and last paragraph, for 
<br />
avoiding making the post too much long and technical.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Le 14-juil.-06, à 12:30, Tom Caylor a écrit :
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But with Church's Thesis how could it be machine or language dependent?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Another way of arguing without the &quot;+ 1&quot; is this:  Define G(n) = Fn(n)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for all n.  If G is in the list of Fi's, then G=Fk for some fixed k.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So Fk(n) = Fn(n) for all n.  Now if all you're thinking of is a matrix
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of numbers Fx(y) (a lookup table if you will) with rows numbered by x,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and columns numbered by y, then this doesn't seem problematic (unless
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you introduce the &quot;+ 1&quot;).  But such a lookup table is infinite and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; therefore is not allowed as the code of a computable function.  You
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; need code for the functions Fi.  Specifically, you need code for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; function Fk (=G).  What does this code look like, even in a universal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense?  Well Fk(n) = G(n) = Fn(n) for all n, so Fk would have to have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some code to compute Fk(1)=F1(1), Fk(2)=F2(2), Fk(3)=F3(3), ...Fk(k)=?,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; How does Fk *ever* know what to compute for Fk(k)?  This is actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rather funny to me.  It's like me being my own grandpa.  It seems that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there already is a case of G(n) not being defined for n=k, even without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the &quot;+ 1&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Remember that the Fi are the partial computable function. You can 
<br />
generate the set of codes, written in some universal language, of all 
<br />
those functions. To fix the idea I choose often the universal language 
<br />
fortran, but choose any of your favorite one.
<br />
<br />Let us then define, like you propose, the diagonal function G by G(n) = 
<br />
Fn(n).
<br />
Now the Fn are fortran generable, and they are partially computable. So 
<br />
it is easy to write a program computing G:
<br />
<br /><br />--------
<br />
Begin
<br />
read x;
<br />
generate (by using the lexicographic order) the code of the Fi up to 
<br />
the code of Fx;
<br />
ouput the result of applying the xth program on x;       (or 
<br />
equivalently compute Fx(x), or just call
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the universal function u(x,x) if you recall it).
<br />
End
<br />
---------
<br />
<br /><br />Now this is a finite fortran program. So it belongs to the list of 
<br />
codes of the program Fi, and you can find that code, so you can find 
<br />
the indice k of the function Fk = G through the explicit program above.
<br />
<br />So, now, you can apply G on k, giving G(k) = Fk(k).
<br />
<br />This does not give any information (unlike with G(x) = Fx(x) + 1 where 
<br />
you get a proof that this G is undefined on its own code). Your G 
<br />
(where G(x) = Fx(x) could be, or not, defined on its own code).
<br />
<br />Yes: it is a little bit like you can be your own grandpa in 
<br />
computerland. If you find this magic, what will you say when I will 
<br />
explain Kleene Second Recursion Theorem. But indeed, what is lovely 
<br />
here is that we start from a very well-founded structure (N), and the 
<br />
comp constraint already forces us to admit some non-well founded 
<br />
substructure. That is why I say often to Stephen that I find it 
<br />
premature to start from some non well-founded set theory, because this 
<br />
is like adding magic at the start, where on the contrary, here we see 
<br />
we cannot avoid it from purely arithmetical reasons. But deeply enough, 
<br />
here, Stephen is right I would say (I mean &quot;comp-right&quot;).
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&lt;snip&gt;
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I get your point, that if you assume Church Thesis, all of these neat
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things are possible &quot;intuitively/mechanically&quot;.  I guess my first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; paragraph of this post reveals that I am uncomfortable with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; vagueness of this &quot;intuitively/mechanically&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><br />That is normal. It is perhaps related to what I have just say today in 
<br />
the &quot;Rép : Infinities, cardinality, diagonalisation post, where I gave 
<br />
a non technical argument showing that we cannot even define what 
<br />
&quot;finite&quot; means. So, it could be hard indeed to *define* what is meant 
<br />
by &quot;computable function from N to N&quot;. It will entirely be based on the 
<br />
intuition of natural (finite) number. Intuitively a function is 
<br />
computable if you can explain (to some &quot;idiot&quot;) in a finite time, or on 
<br />
a finite piece of paper, how to compute that function in a finite time, 
<br />
and this on any (finite) input. This is vague, of course. And this 
<br />
vagueness is what has given to Alonzo Church the motivation for 
<br />
*defining* the computable functions by those definable in LAMBDA(*).
<br />
Now Stephen K. Kleene was not convinced, and tried to refute that 
<br />
&quot;definition&quot;, by finding (by diagonalisation) a computable function not 
<br />
in the list of the LAMBDA functions (showing also that this was more a 
<br />
scientific (refutable) thesis than a definition). It is only when 
<br />
Kleene realized that the list of LAMBDA functions was closed for the 
<br />
diagonalization procedures that he realized that Church's &quot;definition&quot; 
<br />
could be *true*, and he became an ardent defenders of that thesis. He 
<br />
is the one who will make the label &quot;Church's Thesis&quot; (the most commonly 
<br />
used by logicians).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In other words, just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what is a function in the intuitive/mechanical sense?
</em><br />
<br /><br />So I have just said it above, and with Church thesis you can &quot;define&quot; a 
<br />
computable function by &quot;a function programmable in your favorite 
<br />
universal language&quot;.
<br />
For all known universal procedure/system/language/machine it has been 
<br />
*proved* that their are equivalent with respect to the set of 
<br />
computable functions (from N to N). No need of CT to believe that. But 
<br />
CT makes it possible to define get a powerful notion of universality 
<br />
suitable for the comp reasoning.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  How is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; function *implemented* in Platonia?  This sounds like the question
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Stephen was asking on the Existence thread.  We can say OK it's a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mapping from one set of numbers to another.  Say f(3)=17.  Exactly how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is that done?
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK. Let me try a short answer which we can expand later if necessary. 
<br />
Let N be the set of natural numbers {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...}. Let + and * 
<br />
have their usual meanings of addition and multiplication. Somehow I 
<br />
take platonia (here) as the standard mathematical structure &lt;N, +, *, 
<br />
0, 1&gt;. But I allow the use of logical languages (propositional 
<br />
calculus, first order predicate and function symbols together with the 
<br />
quantifier &quot;for all&quot; (A) and &quot;exists&quot; (E)) to write those sentences 
<br />
which I will consider as true or false independently of me.
<br />
For example ExEy(x*x = 2*(y*y)) &quot;asserts&quot; that sqrt(2) is rational, and 
<br />
I will take that such a formula is (provably) false in arithmetical 
<br />
Platonia. The point is that such a falsity is a very primitive truth 
<br />
which does neither depend on me, nor on you,nor or the earth, humanity 
<br />
or whatever.
<br />
All right?
<br />
The next point is that is that such a language can be shown to be 
<br />
enough rich to talk on the Wi and the Fi. A proposition like &quot;Ax(Fi(x) 
<br />
is defined&quot; ( equivalent with AxEy(Fi(x) = y) or with Ax(x belongs-to 
<br />
Wi) can be written using only addition and multiplication and the 
<br />
symbol 0 and 1, and the logical language of course). All the 
<br />
proposition of the form &quot;the universal dovetailer will generate such or 
<br />
such third person definable states&quot; can be translated into a 
<br />
proposition of pure number theory.
<br />
Actually the UD will correspond to a theory known as Robinson 
<br />
Arithmetic, which is very weak, and the rest will emerge from richer 
<br />
(lobian) theory/machine M (like Peano Arithmetic, or ZF set theory) 
<br />
which mainly got powerful induction axioms above Robinson arithmetic 
<br />
(which actually has almost just the definition of addition and 
<br />
multiplication above classical logic) emerging globally (from a first 
<br />
person point of view) once you take all the theorems of Robinson 
<br />
Arithmetic has true independently of you.
<br />
Sorry for that long sentence which I wrote in hurry 'cause I got 
<br />
something else to do. Do this helps?

<br />(*) LAMBDA, or Lambda Calculus. It is a formal language Church invented 
<br />
for that very purpose of defining the computable functions. It is a 
<br />
cousin of the SK-COMBINATORS,  for those who read the combinator posts.
