Hi John:
<br />

<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Hi, Hal:  -  Hopefully without risking strawmanship, a further remark
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;on our humanly limited language (however infiltrating into the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;'meaning' of texts):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;HR:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;...&gt; What I indicated was all paths to completion.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;JM:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;does anything like 'completion' make sense in speaking about an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;unlimited totality?
</em><br />
<br />The idea of completeness in this case is not a matter of an objects 
<br />
size [amount of information within] but rather its ability to resolve 
<br />
any meaningful question about itself.  Low information objects can be 
<br />
complete. The Nothing has too little information within to resolve 
<br />
any such question but such a question exists, so it is 
<br />
incomplete.  Further the duration question is always eventually asked 
<br />
so the Nothing must become a something which answers this particular 
<br />
question.  However, this initial Something may not be able to answer 
<br />
all meaningful questions about itself that in fact get asked.   The 
<br />
Everything is complete but contains multiple answers to at least some 
<br />
meaningful questions so it is inconsistent. Our particular Nothing or 
<br />
origin is now gone but there is an unlimited supply in the Everything.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Furthermore: are 'copies' considerable substantial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;items, or simply our figment of looking from different angles into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;different angles - at the same item?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I try to 'cut' my human incompleteness (didn't claim success) when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;using a totality-vocabulary (way above my head) and all that may be in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it.
</em><br />
<br />The question appears related to: does net information need a physical 
<br />
tablet upon which it is manifest in order to exist.  The Everything 
<br />
has no net information so needs no such tablet.  I suspect that it 
<br />
can not be established that sub components of the Everything 
<br />
containing net information would need one.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;1. If there is  -a- 'nothingness' does it multiply when we in our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;human logic detect &quot;it&quot; again?
</em><br />
<br />This would require observers to have an effect on the amount of 
<br />
content of the Everything.  I see no argument to support this.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;2. Do we assign qualia to nothingness? of course not.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;-  I am inclined to sort nothingness with infinity: we can talk about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it but have no (human) reason-based meaning - understanding - about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;its essence. Georg Cantor tried it for the &quot;infinity&quot; - what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I still consider a mathematical game of details - not the end.
</em><br />
<br />I define Nothing as an object [no physical structure required] that 
<br />
has too little information to answer any meaningful question about 
<br />
itself.  I have such a question and it must be asked thus I conclude 
<br />
that it is incomplete and unstable.  I have no idea how little 
<br />
information is required to answer the least demanding question but 
<br />
the smallest amount above none seems like it might answer some such 
<br />
question so I set the Nothing at no internal information to be a 
<br />
content opposite so to speak of the Everything.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Parlance: nothingness is different from nothing. Saying about a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;construct &quot;there is nothing in it about the storch&quot; does not mean a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;storch-restricted nothingness included as part of the construct.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So if there appears innumerable nothingness-occasions in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;everything - it may be our detection of the ONE - existing there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(=found?) many times over.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Would it jibe with your vocabulary?
</em><br />
<br />The Everything is an ensemble and is a member of itself [The 
<br />
definition of an object is information and equivalent to the object 
<br />
itself in this venue and the Everything contains all information so 
<br />
it contains itself]. As such it is divisible along the boundaries of 
<br />
its members and sets of its members.  The Nothing and all its copies 
<br />
in the &quot;member of itself Everything&quot; are of course members of the 
<br />
ensemble but I see &quot;nothingness&quot; as a multiplicity [or set] of 
<br />
various other members since nothingness can have various sub texts.
<br />
