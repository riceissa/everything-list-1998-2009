<em class="quotelev1">&gt; state it as clearly as I can.  When I imagine an infinity of OMs, as

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it were, co-existing in some atemporal sense, I find I still can't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; satisfactorily answer the question: why am &quot;I&quot; experiencing JUST this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one?
</em><br />
<br />The UD generates, infinitely often, all 3-OMs, all as (universal)  
<br />
machine states, and this through an infinity of computations.
<br />
But the 1-OMs belong to infinities of those &quot;equivalent (by respect of  
<br />
the substitution level) 3-OM. They are not aware, cf UDA step 2, of  
<br />
the fact that in universal dovetailing time (defined by the  
<br />
(mathematical) execution of the UD), some of those 3-OMs will take a  
<br />
*very* long time to be generated.
<br />
Now, the question &quot;why this 1-OM and not that other one&quot;, is like the  
<br />
questions:
<br />
<br />-  &quot;why do I feel myself in W, and not in M&quot; which is very natural for  
<br />
the one going out at W.
<br />
-  &quot;why do I feel myself in M, and not in W&quot; which is very natural for  
<br />
the one going out at M.
<br />
<br />OK?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I don't mean of course, why does this experience possess just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *these* characteristics - this is always determined by the structure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the OM, as per the UD steps.  The issue, rather, is that &quot;I&quot; is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; essentially a global referent that fundamentally applies only to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whole,
</em><br />
<br />Hmm....
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and that the 'part' or 'little me' is thus nothing but the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *viewpoint* of the whole at a given moment
</em><br />
<br />This can be said for the different reason that you are universal  
<br />
yourself (in Post Turing Church sense).
<br />
Here, all what happens is that the 1-OM of that universal machine  
<br />
(fallen in entangled multi-computational histories) has all its  
<br />
immediate expectation based on a set dense in the whole (like  
<br />
fractions are dense in the real numbers). It is not the whole, but it  
<br />
is the infinitely many possible computational histories leading to  
<br />
that 1-OM and to those corresponding 3-OMs.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So under this assumption the real question is: why is the *whole* at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this moment seemingly limited to ONLY this view rather than any - or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indeed all - of the available co-existing alternatives?
</em><br />
<br />For the reason that when your body is duplicated, your soul is not.
<br />
You wake up at M, and only can bet &quot;intellectually&quot; on your  
<br />
doppelganger in W.
<br />
It is the same reason why Everett quantum observer cannot feel the  
<br />
split.
<br />
Amoebas divides, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, each can ask why me, and why here  
<br />
and now.
<br />
But, as Plotinus and others have seen, &quot;we&quot; can somehow experience  
<br />
some inverse path ... 8, 4, 2, 01 and going back to the universal. (But  
<br />
this is not needed for the derivability of physics).
<br />
<br />Here is a nice &quot;inverse path&quot;, btw:
<br />
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lFT4H7E7Ac&amp;feature=channel_page">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lFT4H7E7Ac&amp;feature=channel_page</a>
<br />
Push pause at the beginning, you will see a yellow things with 16  
<br />
little appendices. With good eyes you can guess the 32 more little  
<br />
appendices, and you can see behind the 64 and the balck 128.  So you  
<br />
have at the start
<br />
M... 128 64 32 16.
<br />
Then start the video to see the sequel ... 8, 4, 2, 1, M. (followed  
<br />
by ... M, and zooming in back).   Exercise  :)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  And in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; light of an infinity of co-existing OMs, I can't answer this, because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such a co-existing whole should presumably co-presently see (i.e.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'be') ALL points of view 'at once'.  AFAICS, notions of measure do not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suffice to resolve this.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Well, it has, or comp is false. But I suspect you confuse two  
<br />
different questions (if I may say so to be short).
<br />
- the ability of the soul to remain conscious when getting to the  
<br />
&quot;universal-whole&quot; in the 'conscious way'. This needs work, and typical  
<br />
&quot;let it go&quot; abilities,  detachement, abnegation, amnesia (and is  
<br />
another topic).
<br />
And then the consciousness of your most probable relative situation,  
<br />
which eventually is determined by a measure on the infinity of  
<br />
computations going (arithmetically) through your state.
<br />
And here the mystery is that the apparent physical worlds seem  
<br />
computable. How could a sum on an infinity of computations be  
<br />
computable? (it is the white rabbit problem).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However I have a wacky intuition: despite the platonic criterion of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; co-existence, 1-person experience of the temporal dynamism (i.e.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sequentiality) of the part - i.e. each OM - might reasonably persuade
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; us that sequentiality should also possess, in some ineliminable sense,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a role in the whole.  Consequently, under this assumption, could the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; UD (to reify it only to this degree)
</em><br />
<br />The UD exists, like the number 17 exists. No less, no more.
<br />
(of course the UD is &quot;really&quot; universal if and only if Post-Church- 
<br />
Turing thesis is true).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; be conceived for this purpose to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be 'sequentially resolving' each 'OM-programme-step'?  Indeed my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understanding is that this dovetailed sequentiality is actually a key
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conceptual element of COMP.
</em><br />
<br />Not sure to see what you mean. It is a key to be sure to go through  
<br />
all 3-OMs, with the correct (recursively invariant) redundancy  
<br />
(without which there would indeed be no measure possible).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In this sense - and in this sense only -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could the UD therefore be thought of as temporally instantiating that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OM *uniquely* at each step on behalf of the whole COMP-multiverse, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thus bringing into focus - in effect - its *unique* point of view?
</em><br />
<br />Well, if you name the UD states U1, U2, U3, U4, ..., you go  
<br />
sequentially through all 3-OMs, and this through the right  
<br />
arithmetical relations defining the histories, but your problem  
<br />
reappears at one level above: why &quot;am I&quot; in Um and not in Uw. But that  
<br />
problem makes no sense, for the same reason that &quot;why I am in M and  
<br />
not in W&quot; makes provably no sense in the self-duplication experience.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Then there is the global first person indeterminacy, which appears  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; at step
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 7, although it is &quot;definitely there&quot; with the step 8. It is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; indeterminacy of your immediate subjective future &quot;in front&quot; of a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; never
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ending universal dovetailing. At that step, assuming (or not with  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; step 8) a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; concrete universal dovetailing in the universe (or in arithmetic)  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; you should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; understand that you are duplicated &quot; at each instant&quot;, so that your  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; future
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; subjective instant is determined by an infinity of computations:  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; all those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (existing in the U dovetailing) going through your actual states.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; So, in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; order to attach your mind to a physical appearance, you have to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; justify the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; physical appearances from an infinite set of computational  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; histories. OK?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, I understand as I've said above that I am duplicated at each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instant (what I used to think of as being 'teleported into the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; future').  However, I must press you on your use of the expression
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'going through your actual states'.  I think you mean:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) Your 'actual state' corresponds to some OM (i.e. the one you 'find'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; yourself in).
</em><br />
<br />Well, my mental &quot;RITSIAR&quot; state corresponds to an infinity of  3-OM  
<br />
generated by the DU.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) The UD entails that an infinity of prior and posterior states is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implied by your finding yourself in *this* OM - i.e. they 'go through'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this state.
</em><br />
<br />OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3) Hence the physical appearances you discover in this OM must depend
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on (i.e. be justified by) the totality of these states.
</em><br />
<br />... in this 1-OM. Yes. But instead of &quot;these states&quot;, it is more &quot;the  
<br />
totality of the computations leading to theses states&quot;. The  
<br />
(in)determinacy weight depends on the relative densities of  
<br />
computations.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4) It follows therefore that any association of your mind - as the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; collection of these states - can be correlated only with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *totality* of physical appearances derived from this collection.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is this right?
</em><br />
<br />Not so sure that the phrasing is right.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The physical reality can no more be just a mathematical structure  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; among
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; others. There may or may not exist such a structure, but in any  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; case this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; structure or quasi-structure has to result from the statistical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;interference&quot; of an infinity of computations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Implied by 3) above.
</em><br />
<br />OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; AUDA illustrates the consistency of such an idea, and provides a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; technical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; way to extract already the logic of the observable events. But AUDA  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is far
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; more demanding in logico-mathematical technicalities.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You said it!
</em><br />
<br />Hmm...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; AUDA is UDA, where the &quot;yes doctor&quot; is replaced by a &quot;direct&quot;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; interview of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; correct self-introspecting universal machine.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Somehow, what I am saying in AUDA is that, thanks to the work of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Gödel, Löb,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Solovay, etc., we can already have a talk with the universal  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; machine and ask
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; her opinion, and what &quot;her&quot; physics looks like.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, the 'yes doctor' is an act of faith.  But how much further will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we be able to rely on the machine's opinions on what her physics looks
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like?  Enough to take the leap with certainty, or is there always some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; irresolvable doubt? (I think the answer is yes, because the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; substitution level remains always below the level of introspection.)
</em><br />
<br />And there is the doubt about our own correctness, and even consistency.
<br />
The doubt about the presence of a bug.
<br />
The doubt &quot;am I dreaming?&quot;
<br />
The doubt, as you say, that we have chosen the correct substitution  
<br />
level.
<br />
The doubt about the ability of the surgeon,
<br />
the doubt about the reliability of the artificial brain,
<br />
the doubt &quot;should I take a mac of a pc?&quot;
<br />
That are the eternal doubts of the terrestrial numbers ...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Then it is a rather technical point to show that by adding non  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; computational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; power to such a universal machine will not change the AUDA  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; interview, unless
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; you bring necessarily vague ad hoc &quot;non comp&quot; feature build for  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; changing the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; interview.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So what is consequential on this?  Do you mean that in this case the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine can still derive consistent (though incomplete) opinions on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; her physics and therefore make reasonable bets on her duplicability?
</em><br />
<br />Consistent but false. (not even assuming comp, but assuming elementary  
<br />
arithmetic).
<br />
Perhaps inconsistent.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; If a universal machine bet that God create earth and heaven in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; six days and that she is not duplicable, well, it becomes hard to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; even argue
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; if the AUDA physics will change or not.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And what is consequential on this? Do you mean that her view of her
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics has become such that neither she (by fiat) nor we (per theory)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can make reasonable bets on her duplicability?
</em><br />
<br /><br />We are leaving the topic here. ... of course there is the correct  
<br />
theory of the insane machine. But there is also the insane theory of  
<br />
the insane machine, and a correct theory can exist about that! I let  
<br />
the subject to machine psychoanalysts.
<br />
<br />But all machine are duplicable, I would say by definition.
<br />
.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Hope this &quot;heroic failure&quot; can help the grandma a little bit,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, it helps when we go more slowly and step by step, so that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ignoramus can keep up.
</em><br />
<br />Step by step is my favorite pedagogy, inherited from mathematics. Some  
<br />
mathematicians, like in category theory, will say that global pictures  
<br />
and diagrams are best, and I agree with that. Step by step, but on  
<br />
mail, it is hard to make quickly little drawings. Sigh.
