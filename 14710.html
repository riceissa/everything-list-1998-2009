<br /><br />Yes, I admired the pattern in the visual layout of the non-random as well.
<br />
Thanks.  It reminds me of some sort of infinite logic.  Also, I'm glad I can
<br />
at least cheat to be more verbose than some others here as I often desire to
<br />
maintain quantity as well as quality, whatever quality is.  People can spend
<br />
their whole lives studying quality without knowing how to output quality
<br />
while others do nothing more than put out a high volume of material.
<br />
Neither of those two cases seem to apply to the everything list which is why
<br />
I enjoy it so.  (Presently, I'm -only- thinking of the book Zen and The Art
<br />
of Motorcycle Maintenance which is a chautauqua about someone whose sole
<br />
purpose in life seemed to center around a quest to find out what quality
<br />
is.)
<br />
<br /><br />Interesting that we seem to agree on what random is.  -Perhaps- random
<br />
strings of numbers can -only- be produced by that which is deem-able as
<br />
conscious and/or self-aware, which ties it into Tegmark's SAS theories.  So
<br />
in that event, i.e., if randomness is a trait possessed -only- by that which
<br />
is conscious, then the universe would appear to be conscious in that QM
<br />
events are also deem-able as random.  So then the statement could be this:
<br />
<br />Idea:
<br />
&lt;&lt;If measurements have no detectable pattern [**] then that which led to
<br />
those measurements is (at least a module in the mind of) a conscious being.
<br />
This conscious being may or may not be self aware, i.e., possess the minimum
<br />
requirements of a SAS (self-aware structure).&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />[**]  This means, just for the sake of argument and/or communication, that a
<br />
standardized method of compressing the numeric values into the smallest form
<br />
which is applied, for the purpose of comparison, universally to all sets of
<br />
data and that, according to this standard compression algorithm, such as
<br />
that which is used to compress a data archive, the compression ratio is the
<br />
same, within tolerance, as that which is known to be random such as that of
<br />
QM events.
<br />
<br /><br />Now if I got through that -without- comma splicing, I would be a bit annoyed
<br />
with myself as I strive to be perfectly -imperfect-, whatever perfection and
<br />
non-perfection mean.
<br />
<br />To recapitulate, the statement of the idea is this:
<br />
[1]
<br />
Randomness implies consciousness.
<br />
The converse appears to be false.
<br />
<br />[2]
<br />
SAS implies consciousness.
<br />
The converse appears to be false.  &lt;consider a one-second-old frog, for
<br />
example&gt;
<br />
<br /><br /><br />So if x is a 'thing', let the predicates R( ), C( ), and S( ) denote the
<br />
meaning behind these statements:
<br />
R(x) means x is random.  To elaborate, it should be more like R([x]) where
<br />
[x] is some numeric code associated to x like the Godel number of the wff
<br />
x.  (I know I spelled that name wrong, btw)
<br />
<br />Furthermore, C(x) means x is conscious and S(x) means x is self-aware
<br />
(possibly meaning it is self-referential like Wolpert's self-aware devices).
<br />
<br />Then the trees of implications seems to be this and not reversible
<br />
universally:
<br />
[idea 1]
<br />
R([x]) ==&gt; C(x)
<br />
<br />[idea 2]
<br />
S(x) ==&gt; C(x).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />To re-recap: if x is any utterance, such as a wff,
<br />
R([x]) ==&gt; C(x) &lt;== S(x),
<br />
and convincing examples exist of why those implications are not
<br />
biconditional, i.e., equivalences.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />Cheers
<br />
Brian
