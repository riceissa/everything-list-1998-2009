</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; I think everyone has religious faith...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't think that I could go along with that, at least not in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; strict sense of &quot;religion&quot; -- true enough, religion has, at its core, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; valuings with regard to power and submission, ruling and being ruled, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and also self-governance. But in the strict sense of &quot;religion,&quot; there's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; usually, at the core, some beliefs, some claims, of miracles, magical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; events, etc. Not everybody believes in that sort of thing. Then in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; another sense, but a less strict one, a &quot;religion&quot; can be a set of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; life-shaping beliefs immune to nontrivial revision despite all contrary 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience. I don't think that absolutely everybody has a life-shaping 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; set of such beliefs. Or maybe they all do, but it doesn't seem 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hands-down obvious that they all do.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Most people, however, do have some sort of views, which are or have been 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; significant in their lives, about what are traditionally called 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; metaphysical questions -- God, freedom, immortality, psycho-physical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relationships, etc. Many have one or another kind of metaphysical faith. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It seems increasingly clear to me that Bruno is doing a machine 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; metaphysics, or a computer metaphysics, or a metaphysics of, by, and for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computers or machines (I can't remember why Bruno opts for &quot;machines&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instead of &quot;computers.&quot;). It's a shame that the word &quot;metaphysics&quot; is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ruled out by (if I remember correctly, it was in a post a while back) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reaction of intellectuals in Belgium. Moreover, &quot;machine metaphysics&quot; is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; kind of catchy in its alliterative way. Metaphysics is not religion but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instead a philosophical study of questions which are among the important 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ones in religion. Philosoophy, however, can be applied in living, so the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distinction is not a barrier impenetrable in practice (or, therefore, in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory either).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As to universals, as Brent says they're &quot;ruled out&quot; way too often. it's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that old Saul Steinberg &quot;View of the World From Ninth Avenue&quot; thing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; again. Intellectual foreshortening. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://www.hwscience.com/HWJS/archives/friendrank/friendrank_files/image003.gif">http://www.hwscience.com/HWJS/archives/friendrank/friendrank_files/image003.gif</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Some look at decision-making (&amp; related &quot;ruling arts&quot; aka &quot;governing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arts&quot;) about lives &amp; living, and see the custom-tailored, the singular, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as the goal and object(ive). This is true in the same sense as it is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; true that &quot;know-how,&quot; practical/productive arts, strive not for the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; singular and one-time but the reliable &amp; repeatable, though still the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; somewhat specialized -- not the universal, theoretical, etc. -- and it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is true in the same sense that affective arts tend to strive for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; totalities, universes, worlds in terms of which certain qualities take 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on special and vibrant values -- and it is true in the same sense that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universals are the object of maths &amp; sciences. It's true in those 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; senses, as far as they go, which is not unlimited.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Instead, those senses are limited, and, for instance, it is patently 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; obvious that, in _/subject matters/_, the research disciplines vary 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; every which way in typical scope -- physical, chemical, and life 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sciences have concrete singulars in their unreduced, unabstracted-away 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; idiosyncrasies as their _/subject/_, howsoever universal the _/object/_ 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of such sciences is. And what's more, the disciplines of research vary 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even in the scopes of their elementary objectives.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - The goal of empirical research is to learn more particulars -- _/is/_ 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there a tenth planet, _/is/_ there an earth quake in store for some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; island, _/are/_ there more fossils of intermediates stage between whales 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and land mammals, etc. -- and on a kind of higher level, to learn about 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universals as specially applicable to them. Those universals are no more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interesting to such empirical research than the concreta which they help 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explain and predict, so economically.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - The goal of statistical theory is to draw inductive conclusions from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; samples to _/total populations/_, not universals -- yet, on a kind of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; higher level, to learn about the _/universals/_ which apply to them., 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; across them, etc., in statistical study.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm not sure how best to distinguish these &quot;levels&quot; and they don't seem 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; divided by impenetrable barriers -- last I heard, there's evidence that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lightspeed has changed relative to other fundamental quantities, and so 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lightspeed, though a universal, is seen as a big, developing event -- a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; kind of universal event (which in a sense it always was).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's just a piece of intellectually unjustified but intellectually 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; practiced foreshortening, to hold that all this diversity of typical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scopes is unique to the disciplines of research. Much less are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; disciplines of research concerned only with universals, which is just a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; silly idea. In decision-makings and leadings, in performance and means, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in ends and satisfactions, and in checks and knowledge, and in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; respective disciplines of those things, there are or at least can be the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; full variety of scopes involved some way or other in terms of subject 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter, or some kind of objective, even though each general area has its 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; general, &quot;higher-level&quot; (I'm not sure I even want to call it &quot;higher&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but I just don't know what to call it) tendency to one or another scope 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of object(ive).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'll also reply to Brent here.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt;The serious researcher strains to test his theory, to give it the best 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; chance to fail.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, s/he does that too, most definitely.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; I would say &quot;always&quot;; information always falls short of providing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certainity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That's true. But sometimes it falls a lot shorter than at other times, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and still we must act, or refrain, decisively, some of those times.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; I agree. That's why political leaders like to invoke religion and why 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the professional military are often very religious.  &quot;Jumping to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conclusions&quot; and &quot;having convictions&quot; are just two sides of the same 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; coin.  Scientists tend to make poor political leaders.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;No atheists in foxholes.&quot; I think that I would have a desperate time of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it trying to maintain my agnosticism in such a situation, and little 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time or energy to put into such a maintenance. &quot;Metaphysically,&quot; I'm 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just not particularly committed, but I'm old enough that I'm not about 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to jump onto any particular bandwagon.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; But is the value of logic and evidence inherent or only instrumental?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here you ask some questions which go deep, very deep, so I can only 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ramble. Now, as far as I know, I'm the only person who thinks as I do on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; these subjects.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The value of logic and evidence is neither &quot;inherent&quot; (i.e., an end in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; itself, satisfying, delightful, contenting, pain-alleviating, felicific, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; eudaemonic, etc., etc.) nor instrumental. It's neither means nor end. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The _/valuation/_, the socially institutionalized valuings of logic, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evidence, standards of rigor, evidence, standards of what's worth 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; knowing, etc., etc., are embodied in the disciplines of maths &amp; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sciences, but they are broader in society, as any innocent defendant on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; trial will hope, despite Richard Rorty's vicious nonsense about the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sciences' supposedly have nothing to offer to philosophy (originally 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; love of knowledge) about truth, inquiry, etc. Don't ask me to look it up 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; right now, but I'm sure he said it. Anyway, the basic value of logic and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evidence should be understood in terms of their basic role, which is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that of neither means nor end (which is not to deny that they have added 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; value because they can be means &amp;/or ends, just as ends have because 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they can also be means, and so on).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Instead it's a matter of checks, confirmations, supports, etc. With 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; respect to the checked end the check is not a means, it is not a means 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to that end, it may be a means to some other end but, _/to that end/_, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it is the check, the confirmation or corroboration, etc., the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; expectation-fullfilling side-effect or sign etc. which help to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evidence the achievement of the sought end.  It's simply another 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; category, another flavor, than means and end, and is on a par with means 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and end. One might try to get out of this by saying that it's a means to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pleasure-sensations dependent on external outcomes, the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pleasure-sensations being our &quot;real&quot; ends, our ends per se to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exclusion of anything else, rather than being our often besought 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intelligent appreciation of ends, but these sorts of &quot;anthropo-nomy&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; epicycles cause more conceptual problems than they're worth, unless one 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prefers to view humanity as an elaborate puppet show with the puppeteers 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emerging clearly only in our latest greatest theoretical conceptions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The means-end dichotomy is inexhaustive and inadequate both in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conception and application. 
</em><br />
<br />I didn't refer to &quot;means-ends&quot;, but if you value logic ;-) then &quot;having inherent 
<br />
value&quot; and &quot;not having inherent value&quot; must define an exhaustive dichotomy.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;It's vaguely like conceiving of matter and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; energy while ignoring motions and structures. It's more exactly like 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; talking about middles and endings without considering beginnings and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; checkings (as a middle or continuation is like a staying-begun, a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; checking is like a staying-ended, an entelechy but with the emphasis on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the heldness, the firmness, of the &quot;perfection&quot; rather than, as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Aristotle did it, on the perfection itself. What holds up and is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; supported, firm, is confirmed; vegetables have ends, intelligent animals 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have checks and learn). In typical human affairs such that happiness or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; satisfaction (I don't mean the pure sensations thereof) is generally the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; end and rational work the means, what is the beginning?
</em><br />
<br />Your explication seems to turn on a pun.  &quot;End&quot; as something of value doesn't 
<br />
imply a beginning.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why wouldn't there be a general aspect of beginning in the same sense as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is of ends or means? (I think that the beginning would be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deliberation and trying.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, this is the sort of angle about which only philosophically minded 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; people can care: In applying since at least the Ancient Greeks the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comparison of means and goals with middles/continuations and haltings 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (&quot;ends,&quot; culminations), which seems to occur throughout European 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; languages (I don't know about others but I'd bet the comparison or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; analogy is pretty frequent there too), one has to stop and ask whether 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;everything exists&quot; and whether the comparison or analogy is to be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; extended systematically to the other two terms or &quot;turns&quot; of becoming.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's certainly strange for such a comparison to work so well for two 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; steps and then just be absent for the other two steps. In fact, if it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doesn't persist through all four, there must be something radically 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wrong with it. After these thousands of years, and that seems unlikely. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But only the philosophically minded will care about this angle. I'll get 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more into examples.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; I'm not sure I undestand what you mean by, &quot;valuings and carings in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; regard to the sources, powers, principles whereby one moves and acts.&quot;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Every one has values (things they care about).  They include things like 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; security, companionship, stimulation, children, sex.  But I don't know 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in what sense they care about &quot;source, powers, and principles&quot; except 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perhaps instrumentally.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; They care about the powers in their lives and the ethical, political, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and other principles whereby they act. They care about their virtues, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; strengths, and fortes. They care about their rights and freedoms and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; others' rights and freedoms. 
</em><br />
<br />Sure, people care about (value) all kinds of things; even the words used to 
<br />
describe things - see recent debate over &quot;theology&quot; vs &quot;metaphysics&quot; - some 
<br />
inherently, some instrumentally, and some mixed.  But I'm not sure I'd call 
<br />
those &quot;powers&quot; - I guess you mean something like &quot;motivations&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;They care about their relationship, such as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they believe it to be, their relationship to the power of the universe 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; itself. 
</em><br />
<br />&quot;The power of the universe itself&quot;?  What would that be?  Are you going all 
<br />
mystical on me?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;These are sources, beginnings, leaderships, principles, (Greek) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; _/arches/_. This is not mere instrumentality. Deciding and determining 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is not a mere means, the decider employs means to ends. The decider in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that sense is the beginning, the leader.
</em><br />
<br />Not if no one follows.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; _/Arches kai mesa/_, beginnings/leadings, and means. It's the difference 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between (a) **will &amp; character** and (b) **ability &amp; competence**. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Aristotle wrote his ethical treatises about character in a broader sense 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than exclusively that of morality, and character in that broader sense 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is what it's about. It's a shame that Aristotle didn't also write 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; treatises about ability and competence, _/hikanoteta/_. Now, a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; carpenter, for instance, is not simply a means to carpentry, a means for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; carpented things to actualize themselves. 
</em><br />
<br />Has anyone every suggested such a thing?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The carpenter tries and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deliberates, pursues, chooses or accepts (or rejects), and adheres to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (or renounces) his/her underlying decisions even to do the work at all, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; throughout the process. Is all this volition a &quot;means&quot;? Somebody else's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; means, perhaps; the market's means perhaps, and so on. But it isn't the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; carpenter's means, it's the carpenter's leading, deciding, etc. which, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by means, tools, resources, s/he carries out. This striving and deciding 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is most clearly seen as no mere means in contexts where control is truly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at stake. 
</em><br />
<br />I would suppose that a carpenter has pride of workmanship and so there is 
<br />
inherent pleasure in doing his job well.  His choice of this tool or that is 
<br />
partly instrumental relative to that pleasure.  But he also does carpentry as a 
<br />
means to food, shelter, etc.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;In the carpenter's sawing, hammering, etc., the exercise of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; skills and abilities, control is not really at stake. But in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; carpenter's will and decision-making, control of the situation among 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; various factors in the carpenter is at stake. 
</em><br />
<br />I think I understand the words, but the sentence leaves me blank.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now, one is free to devise 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an epicycle-filled &quot;anthropo-nomy&quot; in order to describe intelligent 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; beings while classing volition and decision-making as mere means, but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it's not particularly useful. 
</em><br />
<br />It's the basis of a whole branch of mathematics called decision theory, a branch 
<br />
which is widely *used*.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Another way to see this is by a set of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; examples comprising an exhaustive set of a certain kind of combinations 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the two.
</em><br />
<br />What two - you seem to introduce a lot more than two things below?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Choice and decision-making with regard to means is the _/economic/_ field.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Choice and decision-making with regard to choice and decision-making 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (deciding who or what gets to decide, etc.) comprise the _/political and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; martial/_ field, also sometimes vis-a-vis nature, e.g., firefighting, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hunting (where it's not purely sport and not safely under control 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (animal husbandry)), etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Means, methods, practices with regard to choice and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; decision-making, comprise the field of _/management, administration, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; compliance/_.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Means, methods, practices with regard to means, methods, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; practices, comprise the field of _/skilled labor, crafts, cooperation, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; etc._/
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sometimes you'll see a renovator having to be the businessman, the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; manager, and the co-worker, all at once in various ways, and sometimes 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; having to be the fighter or politician too. A lot of work!
</em><br />
<br />Or maybe a lot of categories we've invented for the work.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Examples of the differences in terms just of disciplines. Table produced 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; directly in markup (Outlook Express is good for that), no tedious junk code:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Discipline: 	
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ruling/governing arts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (&amp; arts of being ruled,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; governed; arts of self-governance)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Disciplines of deciding and character
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Practical/productive arts/sciences
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Disciplines of means, competencies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Affective arts (lit., music, dance, painting, sculpt., stage, screen, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; etc., etc.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Disciplines of ends, satisfactions, sensibilities
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maths &amp; sciences
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Disciplines of checks and intelligence, knowledge
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Discipline, cultivated cognition regarding _________: 	beginnings, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; _/arches/_
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (decision-making, will, character) 	middles, means, _/mesa/_
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (ability, competence) 	ends, culminations, _/teloi/_ 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (affectivity, sensibility, but again not just the feelings in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; themselves, divorced from the actual; electrode implants would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suffice for that.) 	checks, _/ichnoi/_, _/entelecheiai/_
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (cognition, intelligence, etc.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Scope of &quot;higher&quot; object of said discipline: 	singulars among more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; singulars 	non-universal generals 	totalities, universes, gamuts 	universals
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Level associated with such scope:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (A bit off-off-topic, in order to get back on-topic -- I have to bring 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this back to the Everything _/somehow/_!)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I do think that biggest pictures should fit together.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	Level I 	Level II 	Level III 	Level IV

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Best, Ben Udell

<br />I'm always suspicious of schemes with &quot;Levels&quot;.  Sometimes the schemer invents 
<br />
the levels to put his opinions at the highest (and implicity, the best) level.
