<br />
1) The way in which I described my model in the several posts where I 
<br />
accumulate things did not, upon reflection, explain the comparator approach 
<br />
to my Rj very well so I have fixed this and attach the applicable revised 
<br />
material.
<br />
<br />2) Compatators vs computers:
<br />
<br />Can a computer act as my comparator?
<br />
<br />The comparator examines the current string Uj(i - 1) and forms - by some 
<br />
means - a template with which randomly encountered numbers are tested.  The 
<br />
first encountered number that fits the template is accepted as the next 
<br />
string Uj(i).  If the template allows for more than one number to fit then 
<br />
there is no prior knowledge of the actual complete resulting Uj(i).  This 
<br />
amounts to at least some &quot;true noise&quot; in the sequence Uj(i) as i counts up.
<br />
<br />If the template is such that only one number will fit it then it can be 
<br />
computed and it is equivalent to computing Uj(i).  This is a no &quot;true 
<br />
noise&quot; situation and at best a minor class of comparator.
<br />
<br />3) The consequent of fixed rules:
<br />
<br />In my equation:
<br />
<br />(1)  Pj(i) = {Rj(Pj(i - 1)) + PLj(i)} is the compressed form of Uj(i).
<br />
<br />If Rj is fixed and of course Pj(i - 1) is fixed any new information - the 
<br />
result of &quot;true noise&quot; - in Uj(i) must be represented in PLj(i).  But 
<br />
PLj(i) is just a measure of the length of Pj(i). So  this indicates that Rj 
<br />
runs beyond its data i.e. Pj(i - 1) if there is a &quot;true noise&quot; content in 
<br />
the step Uj(i - 1) to Uj(i).  In my model this is just the addition of more 
<br />
u to complete the formation of Uj(i) from Uj(i - 1).
<br />
<br />4) Thus there are two sources of &quot;true noise&quot; in my approach.  Rj may 
<br />
contribute and the necessary increases in the complexity of the fc-FAS will 
<br />
contribute.
<br />
<br />5) Axioms and alphabets:
<br />
<br />I have said that the necessary ongoing increases in complexity to the 
<br />
underlying fc-FAS take place as additions to its alphabet.  But my equation 
<br />
is highly compressed. These additions can also be viewed as restarting the 
<br />
recursion with a new axiom.
<br />
<br />6) It is my opinion that life exists best in universes that have an Rj that 
<br />
is at least a bit non deterministic.
<br />
<br />--------------------------------
<br />
<br />REVISIONS
<br />
<br /><br />POSTULATE:
<br />
<br />All counting numbers exist with countably infinite copies in a seething 
<br />
foamy fractal.
<br />
<br />Call this fractal Everything or as I prefer to call it the Superverse S.
<br />
<br />In this fractal every universe Uj is isomorphic to a non deterministicly 
<br />
self sorting sequence Uj(i) of these numbers that, upon chance encounters 
<br />
between numbers, they self sort according to:
<br />
<br />(1)  Pj(i) = {Rj(Pj(i - 1)) + PLj(i)} is the compressed form of Uj(i).
<br />
<br />where Rj(Pj(i - 1)) is the fixed rule set of a particular universe acting 
<br />
as a comparator [it may be non deterministic that is a source of &quot;true 
<br />
noise&quot; - also see (2) below] to the previous Uj(i) and the underlying 
<br />
N-bit, finite, consistent FAS [N-bit, fc-FAS} structure is:
<br />
<br />a) It has a single axiom Aj unique to a particular family of universes 
<br />
which is in Pj(1), it serves as Pj(0), it is thus the compressed form of 
<br />
Uj(0) and initiates the recursion.
<br />
<br />b) It has a fixed set of rules = Rj the comparator.
<br />
<br />c) It has an alphabet = differently sequenced strings of bits I call types 
<br />
of &quot;regions&quot;.  Each region type is isomorphic to a physical structure that 
<br />
has existence such that the location of a discrete space point inside a 
<br />
small fixed portion of a grid is coded by each region type.  [In our case I 
<br />
believe the grid to be 3D and most likely Face Centered Cubic.]  The axiom 
<br />
Aj contains the entire initial alphabet for a particular universe.
<br />
<br />So the equation (1) contains the entire N-bit, fc-FAS.
<br />
<br />Uj(i) contains a theorem of this FAS giving a specific arrangement of 
<br />
regions - a configuration of a particular universe.
<br />
<br />(2) Uj(i) grows in length [number of bits] randomly to avoid Chaitin's 
<br />
limit on how much information you can put into an N-bit number.  Since 
<br />
Pj(i) can not yield Pj(i) unless Pj(i -1) is empty and each Pj(i) is 
<br />
clearly longer than Pj(i - 1) the sequence can not stop on a finite 
<br />
number.  To sustain this growth in complexity of Uj(i) the fc-FAS - again 
<br />
as per Chaitin - must also increase in complexity - randomly adding 
<br />
additional alphabet elements - new types of regions.  This is equivalent to 
<br />
&quot;true noise&quot; and to starting the sequence over with a new axiom which is 
<br />
now just Uj(i).
<br />
<br />Thus there are two sources of &quot;true noise&quot; in the model.
<br />
<br />(3) When Uj(i) gets to have a countably infinite number of bits the 
<br />
sequence ends. From Turing [limits to FAS size] and Hilbert [Mathematical 
<br />
existence]- See Tegmark Section II.
<br />
<br />The numbers in the fractal non deterministicly self sort upon encounters 
<br />
because of (1) and (2).   Basically from the perspective of Uj:  Uj(i -1) 
<br />
contains Rj and recognizes any PLj(i) suitably higher valued than its own 
<br />
PLj(i -1) i.e. Uj(i -1) picks the first good number it encounters out of a 
<br />
countably infinite set of potential successors.
<br />
<br />(2) and (3) may not be independent of (1).
<br />
<br />The fractal contains all universes potentially an infinite number of times.
