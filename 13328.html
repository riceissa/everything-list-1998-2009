<br />Non-reductive materialism *doesn't* say that a person's person state

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; did, you are right, it wouldn't be materialism.  In all forms of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; materialism, the person's mental state has to be completely fixed by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the physical state.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What non-reductive materialism *does* say is that high-level
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; properties of a complex system are not completely reducible to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; descriptions in terms of lower level properties.  That is, there exist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; real (objective) high-level properties of a system which cannot be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; replaced by low-level descriptions.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Then it seems to be a matter of semantics. You could say that a pair of peas
<br />
cannot be explained in terms of one pea and another pea because &quot;pair&quot; is a
<br />
higher level property of the system. It's just that in the case of this
<br />
trivial example, our minds easily and intuitively see that the pair really
<br />
is nothing more than the sum of its parts. We might imagine
<br />
super-intelligent beings who could immediately see all sorts of
<br />
fantastically intricate, complex systems for what they really are.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately reductionism appears to *the* modern day dogma of
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; science and it seems to be near impossible to get through to anyone in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the grip of this dogma. 'Eliminative materialism' is all the rage
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; these days aka Daniel Dennett and co who think that consciousness is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'just a fiction' (even though Dennett uses these same-said high level
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cognitive processes to reason his way to his absurd conclusion).
</em><br />
<br /><br />It's obviously crazy to say consciousness is just a fiction; just as it's
<br />
crazy to say a pair of peas is just a fiction. This is not the same as
<br />
saying that the idea of consciousness as a separate ontological entity is
<br />
just a fiction.
<br />
<br />We know for sure (via the argument from indispensability) than there
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exist mathematical concepts (for instance uncomputable numbers and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; infinite sets) which *cannot* be identified with finite physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; processes.  Yet we see great minds desperate to try to deny the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence of uncomputables (J.Schmidhuber on this very list just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; showed up recently and tried to argue that only discrete math is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; real!) - even though in fact Cantor put infinite sets on an infallible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; footing long ago (and Abraham Robinson did the same for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; infinitesimals).  See this link for an artilce I wrote giving a quick
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; demolition of the arguments against infinite sets:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://archives.betterhumans.com/Members/mjgeddes/BlogPost/4710/Default.aspx">http://archives.betterhumans.com/Members/mjgeddes/BlogPost/4710/Default.aspx</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The bottom line is that if infinite sets are real (and they are!)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reductive materialism is false.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I don't see how that follows, even if by &quot;real&quot; you mean physically real as
<br />
opposed to mathematically real.
<br />
<br />But it doesn't stop there:  Science itself (via the notion of 'laws of
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics') uses concepts which are supposed to be *universal* in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scope.  But universals by definition cannot be empirically identified
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with any finite physical concept.  Again the very use of universals
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ('laws of physics') actually falsifies the reductionist claims.
</em><br />
<br /><br />This reminds me of the consternation that the logical positivists
<br />
experienced with the verifiability principle for what was meaningful in
<br />
science - which is not itself subject to the verifiability principle! Still,
<br />
I don't think this has any bearing on reductionism. The scientific method is
<br />
about how we are to go about discovering scientific truths, just as the
<br />
adversarial method in a court of law is about how to decide guilt or
<br />
innocence &quot;beyond reasonable doubt&quot;. But the world is as it is regardless of
<br />
our methods of investigation.
