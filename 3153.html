<br /><br />The full UDA appears at <a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m1726.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m1726.html</a>
<br />
<br />A better more recent version is in the conversation with Joel Dobrzelewski:
<br />
see the main links at <a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m3044.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m3044.html</a>
<br />
(note also that some people on the list seems to arrive independently to
<br />
similar conclusions).
<br />
<br />(The older version in the list was called P-omega experience.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;    I did explain my view, check the archive.  But don't say that I believe 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in what you call &quot;comp&quot;.  I never claimed to believe it, mainly because I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have yet to see a clear definition of it.  I believe in computationalism, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;meaning that computations (effectively) give rise to consciousness.  The 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;word &quot;survive&quot; appears nowhere in any definition of computationalism I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; might give.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You *did* accept my way of presenting &quot;comp&quot; (saying yes to the brain 
<br />
surgeon proposing an artificial digital brain/body made at *some* level of
<br />
description). You *do* give some meaning to survive, if only to prove us
<br />
that comp immortality (QTI) entails that we should find ourself older than
<br />
the expected age common for our species.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;    More precisely, I don't see any 1st person view, other than as a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;description of what an observer-moment experiences.  
</em><br />
<br /><br />That's not too bad, and it is enough for the UDA. (the translation
<br />
of the UDA in the language of a sound machine need a little more
<br />
rigorous definition, possible with G and G*, we will probably 
<br />
come to that later).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;But the set of all such 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;experiences is what the objective (which you might call 3rd person, but I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;don't) view describes.  The objective truth has all the information, which 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;we should guess as best we can.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Both the thought experiences and the incompleteness phenomena can
<br />
be used for explaining why the &quot;objective truth&quot; cannot have all the
<br />
information. This is important and can be made completely precise.
<br />
(something different but related happens in quantum self-reference,
<br />
cf Albert's work).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;You say &quot;me&quot; (and thus, the 1st person concept) can't be defined.  Maybe 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you have some idea of what you mean by it, but if you can't define it, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;there's no way you could ever convey that information to another person.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that case, you might as well stop posting.
</em><br />
<br /><br />First babies cannot define milk but can convey information about
<br />
milk to another person. It is naive to believe we must define
<br />
all the terms of our talk for using them. Second:
<br />
<br />&quot;me&quot; can be *both* interpreted from a 1 and 3 person pov. 
<br />
(pov = point of view).
<br />
<br />&quot;me&quot; can be precisely defined from a 3 pov: through a bet on a level of
<br />
substitution.
<br />
<br />The fact that &quot;me&quot; cannot be defined from a first person pov does not
<br />
entail that &quot;me&quot; cannot be made mathematically precise in a theory
<br />
of the 1 person.
<br />
I agree this is a subtil point (clearly ununderstood by people
<br />
like Penrose or Lucas).
<br />
We will see that the logic S4Grz is able to formalise the notion
<br />
of informal and unformalisable proof!!!  The trick is made simple once
<br />
you realise the gap between truth and provability (captured by the
<br />
gap between G and G* in the modal setting).
<br />
My problem: logic is not very well known, but then I explain all
<br />
details when people asks me so.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I have little doubt that you pull some questionable tricks 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in reaching that conclusion, but here we get into the technical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;part that you have never 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;fully explained on this list, I believe.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Almost fully. The missing part are the non original part of my
<br />
thesis: mainly Godel, Lob, Solovay theorems. I have begin recently
<br />
a path toward such an explanation (diagonalisation 1:
<br />
<a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m3079.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m3079.html</a>).
<br />
I intend to go slowly but surely ...
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;[...]  You have never given a precise definition, but you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;always have the word &quot;survive&quot; in there, so maybe when you translate the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;implications of &quot;comp&quot; into precise mathematics you in effect are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;effectively assuming that conclusion from the start.
</em><br />
<br /><br />At some time I will explain that indeed there is no
<br />
possible precise definition of &quot;survive&quot;. Still the word has a
<br />
folk meaning precise *enough* to understand that comp entails the
<br />
reversal psycho/physics.
<br />
If you don't understand the word &quot;survive&quot; you should remain
<br />
silent about any mortality/immortality question. 
<br />
To believe in mortality = to believe there is an experience x such
<br />
that I don't survive x. To believe in immortality
<br />
is to believe that for all experience I survive x.
<br />
If you don't understand the word &quot;survive&quot; you should be agnostic
<br />
about FIN (your term). 
<br />
<br />Now I agree with you: it can be argued that the immortality is build
<br />
in in comp. No problem with that. You should show then comp being
<br />
false or inconsistent.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;    It's not meant to be comical.  Scientists always doubt that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;they really have the complete right answer, but one the other hand, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it is much more certain to be able to identify a wrong answer.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Newtonian mechanics is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;certainly wrong, but our QM may not be the whole story.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(Yet I have little 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;doubt that QM is basically right, for that matter.)  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;FIN is certainly wrong.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I could understand that &quot;FIN&quot; (comp immortality or Quantum 
<br />
immortality) is vague, weird, counterintuitive, etc.
<br />
<br />But you are the one making the precise proposition &quot;FIN is
<br />
wrong&quot;. You are the one who has to show a precise contradiction
<br />
from it.
<br />
You cannot at this stage just refer to imprecisions, for in that
<br />
case you would have told us that FIN is imprecise.
<br />
<br />You really seems to want FIN wrong. I can understand. Unlike
<br />
George Levy, I am not sure I wish FIN to be true, I don't
<br />
know. The real question is harder with comp than with QM,
<br />
and also there is some sort of possible backtracking if you
<br />
take the amnesia effect into consideration which makes the
<br />
whole things still more difficult, with our current knowledge 
<br />
of comp/QM. What happens clearly,
<br />
through the UDA for instance, is the fact that we loss
<br />
any form of certainty about mortality. That gives us just one
<br />
more doubt forcing us to be a little more humble on those
<br />
sort of questions(°).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Where do I say I definitely haven't solved it?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [...]
</em><br />
<br />I have nowhere pretend I definitely haven't solved
<br />
the prime twins problem in number theory. This does not
<br />
entail I have solved it. I just say I have not found a solution
<br />
of your implementation problem in your web pages, nor in the list.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;    Why?  I will, for purposes of this argument, grant one concession 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;however.  To compare FIN vs. non-FIN, it is not acceptable to make the two 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;categories of possible observations be something like A=&quot;I am younger than 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;N&quot; and B=&quot;I am older than that&quot;, where N = some arbritrary age that may 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(perhaps secretly) be based on my own such as twice my age.  That would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;obviously be cheating to reject the FIN.  I do not cheat.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    On the other hand if a more objective standard is used, like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;A = &quot;I am younger than the 'thermodynamically unlikely' age for my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;species&quot;, or even better like A =&quot;I am young enough to calculate (and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;store) my own age (perhaps normalized so that the typical lifetime of my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; species is set to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;1)&quot;, and B= the opposite, then Bayesian reasoning is perfectly valid and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;appropriate in this context.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    If the FIN were (cough) true, then people using this reasoning would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;usually (100% of the time in fact) be older than that, so it would almost 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;always (100% in fact) work, except for a set of effective probability 0.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  If 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the FIN is not true, it would usually work, but not quite 100%.  So I am 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;erring on the side of letting very old people believe the FIN.  Luckily I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have other arguments against it.
</em><br />
<br />Where?
<br />
<br />The preceding move need a non physical definition of thermodynamics or even
<br />
species, and an explanation how mind is &quot;attached&quot; to &quot;physical&quot; machine.
<br />
For doing that you need to solve your implementation problem.
<br />
Anyway, such ideas does not survive (!) through UDA. Please show me a flaw
<br />
in it. I suggest you follow the &quot;Joel&quot; version which, although a little
<br />
less rigorous, is much simpler and direct than the older one (in the
<br />
archive).  (see links above).
<br />

<br />
<br />(°) I just see Saibal Mitra use the &quot;amnesia&quot; effect. That is ok,
<br />
but use of amnesia effect can make &quot;immortality&quot; trivial in the sense
<br />
that each of us can be any other person, like if there was only one
<br />
person.
<br />
I recall that the &quot;number of 1-person&quot; is still an open problem,
<br />
and probably needs refined definitions of a lot of terms we are using.
<br />
But &quot;comp entails FIN&quot; works with the actual definition, and it is
<br />
unpedagogical to define a term more precisely than it is needed
<br />
in a course of a reasoning.
