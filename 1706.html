<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And as I said, without measure-like concept, without structure on the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  set of observer-moments, I don't see any ways to derive physics.
</em><br />
<br />The concept of measure is tricky. If one insists on an absolute value for 
<br />
measure, (such that measure is lost upon death and gained upon branching) 
<br />
then one gives up the Cosmological Principle that the Universe looks the same 
<br />
from any point (in the Plenitude). In addition, one must come up with a value 
<br />
for that measure, for example 75690339.  Furthermore, one must find a rational
<br />
&nbsp;for this particular value which defeats the nice acausal symmetry provided 
<br />
by the concept of the plenitude. (Laws without laws by Wheeler? I don't know 
<br />
if my quote is correct). This, I guess, is the approach that Jacques is 
<br />
taking.
<br />
<br />On the other hand, if one accepts a relativistic measure, that is if we 
<br />
renormalize the measure at everypoint along the branching process, it almost 
<br />
makes a mockery of the whole concept of measure.
<br />
<br />Almost the same words could have been said about motion before Galileo and 
<br />
also before Einstein..... If motion is absolute then what is the velocity of 
<br />
the Earth? And if it is relative, then any motion measured.... from its own 
<br />
frame of reference.... is always zero....
<br />
<br />This brings us to the concept of 1st person and 3rd person measure. We could 
<br />
view measure in the same way as motion. First person measure is always the 
<br />
same. We could define this value to be unity. Third person measure would then 
<br />
be different. Very low for someone when we observe this someone near death, 
<br />
very high for someone if we - the observers - are ourselves near death.
<br />
<br />This has all sort of implications in Quantum theory. One implication is that 
<br />
the wave function appears different dependent on the 3rd person probability 
<br />
of continuing living.
<br />
<br />One more thing. There is really no such a thing as a single third person with 
<br />
a unique measure and a unique probability of continued life. Each &quot;third 
<br />
person&quot; observer carries with him his own measure and his own probability of 
<br />
continued life.
<br />
Therefore, I think that the &quot;third person&quot; should be replaced by the more 
<br />
general relativistic concept according to which each observer has his own 
<br />
(relativistic) measure and (relativistic) probability of continued life. 
<br />
<br />The problem is to desigh the experiment to test the theory. :-) 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Comp entails some natural measure on the set of observer-moments, why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  not use them?
</em><br />
<br />How can the concept of relative measure be adapted to Bruno's attempt (comp) 
<br />
to explain the laws of Physics from WAP and Turing?
