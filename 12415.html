BM: '
<br />
OK, except I don't see what you mean by on a &quot;number&quot; basis. We know 
<br />
that number have a lot of quantitative interesting relationships, but 
<br />
after Godel, Solovay etc.. we do know that numbers have astonishing 
<br />
qualitative relationship to (like the hypostases to mention it). '
<br />
<br />MP:  No no no, sorry, this is just me being colloquial. Nothing deep or 
<br />
important was intended! :-)  I was responding to a *possible 
<br />
implication* in Stathis's statement about religious fanatics. I thought 
<br />
it was  worth emphasising that, along with the deluded majority who 
<br />
think they are 'doing what is right', there are also those whose 
<br />
motivation is strictly instrumental and manipulative and who find 
<br />
willing collaborators amongst the naive fanatics. This situation is not 
<br />
confined to 'religious' organisations of course but to any sub-culture 
<br />
in which the description of the world has fallen into a closed loop.
<br />
<br />BM: 'Except that Dawking and Dennet fall in their own trap, and 
<br />
perpetuates the myth of a &quot;physical universe&quot; as an explanation. They 
<br />
continue to bury the mind/body problem under the rug.'
<br />
<br />MP: Well I think that we will rapidly reach our 'agree to differ' line 
<br />
with this one. I think physical just means both extended and able to be 
<br />
measured. As such it is fairly close to self-evidently true, in my book. 
<br />
OK, so that is an 'anthropic' outlook but I exist and seem to be some 
<br />
sort of anthropos or whatever [sorry I never studied Greek and only ever 
<br />
achieved 35% in my one year of formal Latin studies :-]. It seems to me 
<br />
that physical is as physical does; as I wrote responding to Stathis, 
<br />
number is theory is just that - theory. It is incredibly useful in all 
<br />
manner of practical applications as well as effective in keeping lots of 
<br />
people off the streets doing amazing logical/arithmetical things for 
<br />
interest and entertainment's sake. I watch with awe and admiration, but 
<br />
I remain careful to acknowledge that a description is a description not 
<br />
the thing it is describing. Existence per se is ultimately mysterious 
<br />
and our experience of being here now is essentially paradoxical: the 
<br />
experience is what it is like to be the updating of a model of self in 
<br />
the world [always 'my' model] but we conflate the experience with 
<br />
actually BEING here now, when the experience is much more limited than 
<br />
that. It would be much truer to say, I think, that this consciousness I 
<br />
take so much for granted is ABOUT my being here now. As much as anything 
<br />
I like to characterise it as: the registration of difference between 
<br />
what my brain predicted for perceiving and doing as opposed to what 
<br />
actually happened.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Just to be clear, I do agree with Stathis here. Completely. I have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; already argue this is even a provable consequence of comp (or the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     MP: I agree with this, saving only that, on a 'numbers' basis,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     there are those whose personal evolution takes them beyond the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     dynamic of 'good' or 'evil' into the domain of power for its own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     sake. This entails complete loss of empathic ability and I think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     it could be argued that such a person is 'legislating' himself out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     of the human species.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     MP: I think a key point with 'irreducible personal belief' is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     the persons in question need to acknowledge the beliefs as such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     and take responsibility for them. I believe we have to point this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     out, whenever we get the opportunity, because generally most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     people are reluctant to engage in analysis of their own beliefs,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     in public anyway. I think part of the reason for this is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     cultural climate [meme-scape?] in which Belief in a G/god/s or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     uncritical Faith are still held to be perfectly respectable. This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     cultural climate is what Richard Dawkins and Daniel Dennet have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     been criticising in recent books and articles.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     SP: 'I am not entirely convinced that comp is true'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     MP: At the moment I am satisfied that 'comp' is NOT true,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     certainly in any format that asserts that 'integers' are all that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     is needed. 'Quantum' is one thing, but 'digital' is quite another :-)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK, but comp is *digital* mechanism. Then it is a theorem that a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; digital machine cannot distinguish a &quot;physically real computational 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; history&quot; with a purely mathematical or even arithmetical computational 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; history. You can &quot;add&quot; Matter in the immaterial brain: it will change 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nothing unless you give a non turing emulable role to that Matter. Why 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not add magic directly?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then the quantum has to be justified from the digital (that is not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; trivial, see my url for more, or ask questions).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     The main problem [fact I would prefer to say] is that existence is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     irreducible whereas numbers or Number be dependent upon
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     something/s existing. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     MP: Why are we not zombies? The answer is in the fact of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     self-referencing.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     In our case [as hominids] there are peculiarities of construction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     and function arisen from our evolutionary history, ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sure,

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     ... but there is nothing in principle to deny self-awareness from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     a silicon-electronic entity that embodied sufficient details
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     within a model of self in the world.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is *comp* (unless you think about putative non turing emulable 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; silicon electronic).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     The existence of such a model would constitute its mind, broadly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     speaking, and the updating of the model of self in the world would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     be the experience of self awareness. What it would be like TO BE
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     the updating of such a model of self in the world is something we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     will probably have to wait awhile to be told  :-)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; How could we ever know? Of course, *assuming* the comp hyp, we already 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; know: it is like being us here and now.
