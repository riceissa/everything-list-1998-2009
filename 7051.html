I cooked up a little program that displays the relative measure of 
<br />
observer-moments as a rather unfortunate person attempts to cross a couple 
<br />
bridges. It avoids one problem in that the person suffers from short-term 
<br />
memory loss and so convergent observer-moments cause increased measure where 
<br />
they usually would not. It's a start nevertheless.
<br />
Information and images are available here: <a href="http://www.kwinter.ca/d/mwi/">http://www.kwinter.ca/d/mwi/</a>
<br />
<br />If anyone can point me to more well developed methodology, I'd appreciate 
<br />
it.
<br />
<br />Thanks
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Below is the text from the demonstration:
<br />
<br /><br /><br />June 10, 2005
<br />
<br />The purpose of this demonstration is to evaluate every possible sequence of 
<br />
observer moments (OMs) where a person survives a life or death situation. 
<br />
This is very similar to the Quantum Suicide thought experiment, however 
<br />
instead of considering 50/50 chances of being killed by gunshot, a bridge is 
<br />
used to show the relative measure of observer-moments derived from sequences 
<br />
of observer-moments which survived the bridge crossing. The computer model 
<br />
provides visualization and insight into quantum nudging whereby at a given 
<br />
time prior to a dangerous situation, the OMs with greatest measure are 
<br />
poised to avoid that danger. A person experiencing the most common OM 
<br />
sequence is therefore nudged away from danger. This demonstration cannot 
<br />
prove whether we live such most-common OM sequences, it just provides a 
<br />
visualization.
<br />
<br />This demonstration assumes that the Many Worlds Interpretation of Quantum 
<br />
Mechanics (MWI) is correct. IE: A person (like you and me) experiences 1 
<br />
sequence of OMs throughout our lives. Between moments we branch into 
<br />
parallel universes which continue to split/diverge moment to moment.
<br />
<br />Consider a person walking across a bridge. The bridge is 200m above the 
<br />
ground. The person is not capable of knowing whether their steps will cause 
<br />
them to walk off the bridge and cannot avoid falling to their relatively 
<br />
certain death. The person staggers as he moves, from one point to the next 
<br />
he takes each step in one of three ways:
<br />
- straight ahead (S)
<br />
- ahead to the left (L)
<br />
- ahead to the right (R)
<br />
<br /><br />The cause of the direction of each step is random, with an equal 1/3 
<br />
probability that at each step the person will go straight ahead, ahead to 
<br />
the left or ahead to the right. In fact, he does all three, branching into 
<br />
different universes.
<br />
<br />Presented is the result of a computer simulation which computes every 
<br />
possible sequence of steps that conclude in his successful (alive) crossing 
<br />
of the bridge. Each possible sequence is tested once and only once.
<br />
<br />In the following simulations each square represents a position or an 
<br />
observer-moment if the person has no short term memory. The problem being 
<br />
ignored in this demonstration is that typically for OMs to be identical they 
<br />
require the observer to experience the same mind-state for that moment, 
<br />
including completely identical memories. This is ignored by suggesting that 
<br />
for our purposes the observer has no short-term memory. So arriving at the 
<br />
same square via different squares constitutes a convergent OM which 
<br />
increases the measure of such OM.
<br />
<br />The person starts on the square 5,1 and every possible sequence thereafter 
<br />
is computed. Once all the sequences which resulted in the person making it 
<br />
to the other side of the bridge were obtained, the individual OM instances 
<br />
were counted, that is the number of times a successful sequence involved a 
<br />
step on a certain square (OM). The percentages for each represent the 
<br />
measure of those OMs, that is the percentage of total surviving sequences 
<br />
which involved a step on that square.
<br />
<br />A sequence is not successful (does not survive) if the person walks off the 
<br />
bridge. A sequence is successful if the person lands on a square in the top 
<br />
row without falling off the bridge.
<br />
<br />In this first example the bridge is straight:
<br />
<br />There are 153,273 successful sequences, the left-most being 
<br />
L-L-L-L-S-S-S-S-S-S-S and the right-most being R-R-R-R-S-S-S-S-S-S-S. The 
<br />
sequence with the most measure, though it only occurred once in simulation 
<br />
is of course S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S.
<br />
<br />In the second example the bridge has a hole in it, step where a box is 
<br />
absent and die. Observe how this affects measure prior to the hole.
<br />
There are 82,782 successful sequences, the left-most being 
<br />
L-L-L-L-S-S-S-S-S-S-S and the right-most being R-R-S-L-L-S-R-R-R-R-S. The 
<br />
sequence with the most measure, though it only occurred once in simulation 
<br />
(each possible sequence is tested once) would be L-R-L-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S. I 
<br />
find it interesting that this sequence does a zigzag at the beginning, due 
<br />
to recombinant OMs &quot;fleeing&quot; the right side, causing the highest measure OM 
<br />
to temporarily move right, taking them in (5,3).
<br />
<br />The next step is of course to figure out how to represent measure with a 
<br />
more realistic observer (having a functioning memory). Remember that almost 
<br />
none of the concepts presented here have actually been proven, and so this 
<br />
material should be taken simply as food for thought.
<br />
<br />I hope you have enjoyed this demonstration,
<br />
