<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK I will try to read Joyce's book asap. In general I am quite skeptic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about the use of the notion of &quot;causality&quot;. I have also no understanding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of your posts in which you argue about a relationship between the search
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of a TOE and decision theory.
</em><br />
<br />See my recent reply to Hal. Basically they are related through the concept 
<br />
of probabilities (if the TOE makes use of probabilities).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;I'm aware of *a* mind-body problem. I'm not sure if it's the same one you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;have in mind. The one I have in mind is this: how do I derive a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;probability distribution for the (absolute) SSA from a third-person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;description of the multiverse?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The mind-body problem I am talking about is the one formulated by Descartes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (but also by Hindu philosophers before J.C). It is really the problem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of linking private (first person) sensations and third person communicable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; phenomena. How a grey brain produces sensation of color, as someone put it.
</em><br />
<br />Could you state the problem more formally? Also, you asked me whether I 
<br />
was aware of the mind-body problem. What did my answer tell you?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Those I have encapsulated in the label &quot;comp&quot;. Precisely it consists in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1)accepting a minimal amount of arithmetical realism, i.e. the truth of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; elementary statements of arithmetic does not depend of me or us ...
</em><br />
<br />I agree with (1).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) the Church Thesis (also called the Church Turing Thesis, or the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Post Law, etc.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; i.e. all universal machine are equivalent with respect to their simulation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; abilities (making abstraction of the duration of those simulation).
</em><br />
<br />I don't think that is settled yet. We may be able to build machines that 
<br />
are more powerful than Turing machines. I don't think we should rule it 
<br />
out at this point.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3) The existence of a level of description of my body (whatever it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is) such that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my first person experience remains invariant through a functional substitution
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; made at that level.
</em><br />
<br />Can you state this more formally? Specificly how do you define &quot;functional 
<br />
substitution&quot;?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Note that the Arithmetical uda makes it possible to eliminate the &quot;3)&quot; above).
</em><br />
<br />I guess I'll have to wait for your English paper to understand how.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I was referring to the second incompleteness theorem by Godel: a consistent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine cannot prove its own consistency. This means that if you add the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inconsistency as a new axiom the machine will not derive a contradiction,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (because if the machine derive a contradiction from her inconsistency, she
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will prove its consistency by reductio ad absurdo). So a consistent machine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will not be inconsistent when she asserts its own inconsistency.
</em><br />
<br />But in second order logic, if you add a new axiom to a consistent theory
<br />
stating that it's inconsistent, the theory is no longer satisfiable (i.e.,
<br />
it no longer has a model, even though it's still consistent), right? In
<br />
first order logic, the theory would still be satisfiable but that just
<br />
indicates that the semantics of first order logic is flawed. BTW remind me
<br />
what's the relevance of this again?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course I restrict us and the machines I interview to sound logics. Why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should I interview unsound machines? It would be like an historian working on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a biography of Napoleon, and interviewing a mad guy in an asylum pretending
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to be Napoleon. I limit my interview to sound machine for the same reason
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would stop reading papers by someone if I realize
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; he is using (systematically) a theory which is unsound.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Except for clinical case I have never find someone using unsound 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; basic theories.
</em><br />
<br />Ok, I guess I thought your restriction to sound machines was a substantial 
<br />
ones, but perhaps its not. However I still am not sure what point you're 
<br />
making by making this restriction explicit.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;I don't have to explain how I &quot;keep being in the same computation&quot; because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;I don't know or claim that. I'm not sure that's even a meaningful
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;sentence.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It seems to me you claim it in your next sentence, here:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;All I do claim is that for any given computation, if I am in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;that computation, I care about the future version of me in that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;computation, and I can causally affect its future (and only its future).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;In other words, the causal influence of my actions stay in the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;computation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The whole point of the uda thought experiment consists in showing that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; expressions like &quot;I am in that computation&quot; are not well defined. The uda shows
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; also that we have a lot of futures (&quot;future, btw, is a first person construct:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is no notion of future in any &quot;block-reality&quot; approach).
</em><br />
<br />To me, future is a concept linked with causality, because causes always
<br />
occur before effects. In any &quot;block-reality&quot; approach that takes causality
<br />
into account, it would have to be littered with arrows indicating causal
<br />
relationships, and those arrows would differentiate between past and
<br />
future.
<br />
<br />Certainly in a computation there is a natural concept of past and future
<br />
that is not a first person construct, and the causal relationship between 
<br />
one state of a computation and the next one should be quite clear.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The fact that  &quot;I can causally affect its future&quot; is not clear at all,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and any clearer version should be justified.
</em><br />
<br />Read Joyce's book, it should clarify and justify it for you. If not come 
<br />
back and we'll talk about it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let me give you a simple example.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Suppose you decide to drink a cup of coffee.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You will prepare that cup of coffee hoping this will causally affect &quot;its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (yours!) future, in a way such that you make the first person experience
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of drinking that cup of coffee.
</em><br />
<br />Ok.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But the UD, because he is shallow, will generate an infinite number of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computations in which you will experience drinking a cup of tea (if 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not a white rabbit), and this although you have the same experience 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the past which include
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your preparing that cup of coffee).
</em><br />
<br />You can just ignore those universes because their algorithmic 
<br />
complexities are very high (and therefore their measures are very low).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The &quot;invariance lemma&quot;  prevents &quot;easy&quot; use of (Kolmogorov or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Chaitin) complexity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; notion for dismissing those abnormal stories.
</em><br />
<br />Why? I just did it. Are you saying each copy of you in any universe counts 
<br />
equally regardless of how small the measure of the universe is? If that is 
<br />
what you mean by &quot;invariance lemma&quot; then I certainly don't agree with you.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The comp indeterminacy hints to transform that problem into a search 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of a measure,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and into showing that relatively abnormal consistent 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; extension/stories are rare.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is not unlike the Feynman integration on path in quantum mechanics.
</em><br />
<br />I do not see the necessity of it.
