Stathis,
<br />
<br />Thank you for the explanation.  Yes, it is indeed surprising to discover
<br />
that if something CAN happen, it may NOT happen, even in infinite time -
<br />
provided that the chance of it happening decreases with time.
<br />
<br />Nevertheless, the proverbial monkey at the typewriter, randomly hitting the
<br />
keys, must eventually write all the works of Shakespeare, as well as
<br />
everything that has been written or will be written, provided he spends
<br />
eternity at the task.
<br />
<br />As you suggested, I used the spreadsheet to determine the product of
<br />
(1-1/4)(1-1/9)(1-1/16)...(1-1/n^2) with n going from 1 through 65,536 and
<br />
got 0.500,007,629,510,935.   Extending n to 131,072 resulted in
<br />
0.500,007,596,291,283.  It looks like n would have to get to a large number
<br />
before the product would be 0.5, but I'm now convinced that it would
<br />
eventually get there.
<br />
<br />It is counter-intuitive to me that the spreadsheet sum of 1/n^2, with n
<br />
going from 1 through 131,072 , is 0.644,918,874,381,156 rather than 0.5.
<br />
<br />We live in a marvelous universe!
<br />
<br />Norman

<br /><br />Norman,
<br />
<br />Perhaps the term &quot;cumulative probability&quot; was misleading. I meant the
<br />
probability that P will occur at least once between t=2 and t=infinity.
<br />
Suppose you enter a strange lottery in its second week, when the probability
<br />
P that you will win is Pr(P)=1/(t^2)=1/(2^2)=1/4. The lottery runs every
<br />
week from now until eternity, but your chance of winning continuously falls
<br />
so that after t weeks Pr(P)=1/(t^2); that is, in the third week you have a
<br />
1/9 chance of winning, in the fourth week 1/16 chance, and so on. Note that
<br />
Pr(P)&gt;0 for all integers t, no matter how large. Now, the question is if you
<br />
play this lottery forever, what is the probability that you will win at
<br />
least once? (This is what I meant by cumulative probability.) It is easier
<br />
mathematically to rephrase this question as, what is the chance that you
<br />
will NEVER win (Pr(~P)) after t consecutive weeks as t-&gt;infinity? Since
<br />
Pr(P)=1/(t^2), Pr(~P)=1-1/(t^2). So the infinite product
<br />
(1-1/4)(1-1/9)(1-1/16)... gives the probability that you will play this game
<br />
forever and never win. If you multiply out the above sequence, you will see
<br />
that it limits to 1/2. What this means is that there are events which are
<br />
possible at all times, but nevertheless will NEVER occur, even given an
<br />
eternity. This is what I found surprising. So whether a particular event
<br />
does or doesn't actually occur in the future of the universe depends less on
<br />
the absolute probability (if we have infinite time) than on how the
<br />
probability varies as a function of time.
<br />
<br />I have not posted this to the list as you only posted your question to me;
<br />
if you think this reply would be of interest to the list, please feel free
<br />
to forward it.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Stathis Papaioannou,

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I don't understand your statement &quot;For example, if Pr(P)=1/(t^2), as t goes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;from 2 to infinity, the cumulative probability that P will occur at some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;point is 1/2.&quot;  At first glance this looked correct, but when I ran out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Pr(P)=1/(t^2) on a spreadsheet, with t going in steps of 1 from 2 to 65536,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the cumulative probability seems to go to 0.644019, not 1/2.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The cumulative probability seems to depend on the step size.  If t goes in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;steps of 1.448, then the cumulative probability goes to 1/2.  By other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;choices of step size, I can make the cumulative probability sum to anything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;between 1/4 and 16383.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;An explanation will be appreciated.  Thanks,

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; some point is 1/2.
