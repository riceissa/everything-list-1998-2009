<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be missed, and not just because he was one of the few members of the group 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;who eventually came around to a sane view of mortality.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To explain that, I'll have to explain some of what's been going on in 
<br />
this mailing list.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you know, (most of) the people on this list, me included, believe in 
<br />
the existance of what could be called &quot;parallel universes&quot; in which (among 
<br />
other things) other people similar to ourselves exist.  (I will not bother 
<br />
to make a distinction here between the reasons to believe this based on 
<br />
quantum mechanics, vs. those based on general philosophy.)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many ways it is no different from believing in a spacially infinite 
<br />
universe, since in that case if you look at enough planets you would 
<br />
eventually find nearly exact duplicates of the Earth.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem comes when some people consider death in this context.  I'll 
<br />
try to explain the insane view on this, but since I am not myself insane I 
<br />
will probably not do so to the satisfaction of those that are.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OK.  Now, suppose there are two exactly identical twins who lead exactly 
<br />
identical lives up until a moment when suddenly, one of them is killed.  
<br />
(This serves as a model of the case with people in parrallel universes 
<br />
acting as 'twins'.)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, if you care about these twins, the death was a bad thing to 
<br />
happen.  There is now less of these people.  True, one twin survived, but 
<br />
supposing he is still happy, there is still only half as much happiness in 
<br />
the world due to the twins as there would be if one had not died.  I 
<br />
formalize this by saying that the measure of such conscious observations has 
<br />
been reduced by a factor of 2.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The insane view however holds that the mind of the &quot;killed&quot; twin somehow 
<br />
leaps into the surviving twin at the moment he would have been killed.  
<br />
Thus, except for the effect on other people who might have known the twins, 
<br />
the apparent death is of no consequence.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This they call the &quot;quantum theory of immortality&quot; (QTI) because, due to 
<br />
quantum mechanics, there would always be some parrallel universe in which 
<br />
any given person would have copies that live past any given age, and they 
<br />
figure the minds would always leap into those copies.  I will from now on 
<br />
call it the &quot;fallacious immortality nonsense&quot; (FIN).  Those beliefs are 
<br />
dangerous by the way, since they can encourage suicide or worse.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have repeated pointed out the obvious consequence that if that were 
<br />
true, then a typical observer would find himself to be much older than the 
<br />
apparent lifetime of his species would allow; the fact that you do not find 
<br />
yourself so old gives their hypothesis a probability of about 0 that it is 
<br />
the truth.  However, they hold fast to their incomprehensible beliefs.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With one notatable exception that is.  James Higgo believed in the FIN 
<br />
when I joined this list.  However, he came to understand that different 
<br />
people's moments of conscious observation are independent and each valuable 
<br />
in their own right, so he rejected the FIN and came to a sane view on 
<br />
mortality, while continuing to believe in other universes.
