<br />That's a very interesting experiment -- you might be interested to know 
<br />
that Dennett (again, in Elbow Room) predicted something similar; that 
<br />
for all the cases where randomness impacts an organism's choices, 
<br />
&quot;true&quot; randomness would be practically indistinguishable from 
<br />
sufficiently unpredictable pseudorandomness.  I'm glad you're doing 
<br />
these experiments.  How does your true random number generator work?  
<br />
Do you have preliminary results posted somewhere?
<br />
<br />Anyway, I think that the important question of free will is not &quot;Could 
<br />
I have done otherwise than I did in &gt;this exact circumstance&lt;&quot;, but 
<br />
this:
<br />
&quot;Am I so constituted that I will act the way I did in circumstances 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;relevantly like this&lt;, but will be able to change my behavior in the 
</em><br />
way I want to when circumstances change?&quot;.
<br />
<br />In other words -- we really don't care whether or not we'd do the same 
<br />
thing over and over again if circumstances were exactly the same.  That 
<br />
kind of &quot;free will&quot;, what you would get from indeterminism, is not at 
<br />
all what people care about when they think about whether they have free 
<br />
will or not.  What we care about is whether we have self-control.
<br />
<br />You said
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The whole debate you quote from Dennett seems quaint and out of date...
</em><br />
, but I think it's very useful (and actually it was from the Stanford 
<br />
encyclopedia of philosophy, not from Dennett).  There's been a lot of 
<br />
definitional hair-splitting here about just what free will is and 
<br />
isn't; I propose to approach the question in a different way:  What do 
<br />
you personally care about?  Does it matter to you whether the universe 
<br />
is deterministic or not?  Would it matter to you if you realized 
<br />
someone was using subliminal advertising on you to make you buy things? 
<br />
(I'm not suggesting that what we want to be the case has any influence 
<br />
on what is the case; I'm just trying to get at  what people mean when 
<br />
they say &quot;free will&quot;.)
<br />
<br />Well, it looks like there are as many definitions of free will as there 
<br />
are people taking part in the debate -- which is precisely why we need 
<br />
to talk about it, and why it's a good idea be familiar with at least 
<br />
the high points of the past 2500 years of philosophical literature on 
<br />
the subject, in order to avoid making the same mistakes that other 
<br />
brilliant minds have made.
