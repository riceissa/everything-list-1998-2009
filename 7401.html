Hi Chris,
<br />
<br />Le 29-juin-05, à 17:49, chris peck a écrit :
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'ld suggest its a matter of how intuition is used. My intuition can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only guide me in my enquiries, your intuition only you in yours. I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cant persuade you of the truth of a statement by appealing to my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intuitive feelings about it, obviously. Nevertheless, I think it is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the light that guides enquiry. I hope it is for everyone, though 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; clearly with Leslie and others seem more attracted to the counter 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intuitive, I have no idea why.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree there is a sense where only intuition is really the root of 
<br />
&quot;conclusiveness&quot;, but  intuition is always like believing that the 
<br />
earth is flat. It is rooted in locality. So globally &quot;the other of 
<br />
myself&quot; is always, at first counterintuitive: the earth is not flat! 
<br />
The root of conviction are local but when you try to see the border of 
<br />
what the light can enlighten it is not so astonishing to be astonished, 
<br />
surprised, and eventually to develop some intuition on some 
<br />
counter-intuitive feature of reality (whatever it could be).
<br />
Sometime I say that common sense is the unique tool to go beyond common 
<br />
sense, I could say that for intuition. I am attracted by intuition and 
<br />
counter-intuition. I am fond of both Cantor and Brouwer. (and I add for 
<br />
later: I love both S4Grz and G which are two systems of modal logic 
<br />
which go, arguably with the comp hyp) at the heart of intuition and 
<br />
conter-intuition.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Take the Doomsday Hypothesis, its wrong. Even if the world ended 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tommorow, it would still be the case that the Doomsday Hypothesis did 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not predict it to any satisfactory meaning of the word 'predict'. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Intuitively, I'ld just say it was luck that someone considered the DH 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on the day before. Intuitively, I think that is obvious. But intuition 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doesnt explain WHY the Doomsday Hypothesis is wrong, just that it is. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Intuition is not analytical and really it is this that prevents it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from having much persuasive power. But looking at Bostrum and others, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; its clear how they rely on intuition. Unless the DH can be tempered in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some manner, then they tend to agree that its conclusion is reason 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; enough to dismiss it.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You illustrate a difficult idea (intuition) with a difficult problem 
<br />
(the Doomsday argument).
<br />
Here, my intuition is that I should not follow my intuition :)  But 
<br />
analytically, I tend to believe that the doomsday argument is a 
<br />
definite quite convincing argument that the doomsday is for soon, once 
<br />
we accept Newton (on matter) and Aristotle (on mind). I am agnostic 
<br />
about that, but I do think that the comp hypothesis makes quickly 
<br />
Newton wrong on matter and Aristotle wrong on mind, so comp is immune 
<br />
against the doomsday argument (confirming perhaps your intuition if 
<br />
comp is true).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'The best one, in my opinion are those theories which justifies the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ultimate unnameableness of the first person.'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Do you mean private by 'unnameable'?
</em><br />
<br /><br />But I cannot even be sure it is private. I think I see what you mean, 
<br />
and the unameability of the first person by the first person will 
<br />
*appear* most probably private. But I'm open to the ide that we share 
<br />
the deepest intuition and I am neutral on the question how many persons 
<br />
exists really. At least with comp it is possible to explain why those 
<br />
questions are hard, even with (apparant) oversimplifications.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Are you talking about something akin to Nagel's characterisation of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mind? That it is subjective and consequently indescribable by a 3rd 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person account?
</em><br />
<br /><br />I think it is related.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'as I show in my PhD thesis (see my url). comp can explain 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (meta-justify) why the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ultimate evidence is &quot;conclusive&quot; but ineffable.'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'll give it a go, sounds interesting.
</em><br />
<br /><br />The game consists in taking the computationalist hypothesis, in some 
<br />
rather precise form, totally seriously. In the literature those who 
<br />
does that in general present it as an argument ad absurdo of the 
<br />
falsity of mechanism. They &quot;prove&quot; comp -&gt; false. But actually if you 
<br />
look at the details they just prove &quot;comp -&gt; (Newton/Aristotle is 
<br />
false). Actually comp proves something &quot;near false&quot;. We can expect that 
<br />
comp leads to counterintuitive propositions, but that is relative: 
<br />
Pythagoras, Plato, Plotinus, and some other were open for the kind of 
<br />
reality which I suspect is made necessary by comp. In actual physics 
<br />
the closer conception to what comp makes inescapable is Quantum 
<br />
Mechanics without Collapse, that is Everett, Deutch...
<br />
But neither Everett nor Deutsch takes the comp hypothesis 
<br />
&quot;sufficiently&quot; seriously. Deutsch is forced to a revisionist view on 
<br />
Church thesis to make it fitting with his physicalist conception of the 
<br />
multiverse for example.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'I have use the modal logics of self-reference (Solovay's G and G'). 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Have you heard about them?'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Nope, im new to a lot of this - thus my joining. Is self reference the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; same as self perception? you know as well as refering to myself, i can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; introspect to a degree too. Mind may well be inscrutable beyond 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; introspection. I kind of think it is, though self reference is second 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nature.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I think so. Actually here I point on Godel's incompleteness theorem; 
<br />
including its statellite theorems in computer science. If you are open 
<br />
to logic there is a gallery of surprises.
<br />
The best book is, imo, the apparently recreative Forever Undecided by 
<br />
Smullyan.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'Also, do you know the paper by Hardegree which shows that quantum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logic can be seen as a Lewis-Stalnaker logic of the counterfactuals?'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hmmm. I thought Stalnaker and Lewis were opposed to one another when 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it came to counterfactuals.
</em><br />
<br /><br />They disagree like all reseachers who discover that they tackle the 
<br />
same domain. It is an &quot;expert&quot; disagreement. Relatively to the shape of 
<br />
the disagreement in this list, to decide between Lewis and Stalnaker at 
<br />
this stage of the discussion would be falling in the 1004 fallacy. Well 
<br />
perhaps not because we are making progress I think.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Lewis believes they are in some sense real, sort of like Deutsche's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multiverse, or  infinate number of m-branes and so on, in which 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anything logically possible has been actualised at least in one 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe or another.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I think you point on a recent paper by Lewis which I keep for july ;)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I think Stalnaker would disagree with that, possible worlds are just 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; convenient ways of considering possibility, rather than actuality. im 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sure this is all obvious to you, I'll read your PHD and see if I agree 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with that. I hope there isnt too much math.:)
</em><br />
<br /><br />Perhaps. Stalnaker is physicalist. He told us in &quot;Inquiry&quot;.
<br />
I am (mind-body)-problem driven. I take the best of Stalnaker and Lewis 
<br />
(and others). &quot;Best&quot; relatively to my inquiry.
<br />
<br />I think comp makes physicalism wrong.
<br />
<br />Have you read the posts of this list? I have made a very bad and unfair 
<br />
(but short and concise) summary recently:

<br />
<br />Thanks for telling me that you will take a look at my papers (hope you 
<br />
are neither a dogmatic naturalist nor a logical-anxious) ...
