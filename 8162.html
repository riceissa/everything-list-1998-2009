The United States Patent Law (35 U.S.C. 101) provides:
<br />
<br />&quot;Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine,
<br />
manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement
<br />
thereof, may obtain a patent therefore, subject to the conditions and
<br />
requirements of this title.&quot;
<br />
<br />I believe I have discovered a process for modeling photons and
<br />
everything else in the universe.  I believe my process is new and (if it
<br />
is correct) it certainly will be useful.  I believe my theory is
<br />
basically correct.  Therefore, I believe I should be entitled to a
<br />
patent on my discovery.  My attempt to patent my discovery is certainly
<br />
not frivolous or bizarre.  
<br />
<br />If the patent examiner examining my application determines that my
<br />
theory is not correct, he may very likely also determine that my process
<br />
in not useful, therefore, not patentable and I won't get the patent.  If
<br />
any of you or anyone else can convince me that my theory is basically
<br />
wrong, I will abandon my effort to patent it.
<br />
<br />The problem is I do not know for sure whether or not my theory is
<br />
correct.  I have tried without success to get my theory published in two
<br />
very respected scientific journals and have been rejected out of hand.
<br />
I have given descriptions of my theory to almost all of the scientist I
<br />
know (and I know a bunch of them).  No one has pointed out any basic
<br />
flaw in my theory.  I have submitted descriptions of my theory to this
<br />
group (which is suppose to be especially interested in Theories of
<br />
Everything) and have received no response on the merits, just criticism
<br />
or skepticism for my bothering the patent office with my theory.  I and
<br />
others have found many minor flaws and I have in each case modified my
<br />
theory to correct the minor flaws.  In the process I have filed seven
<br />
separate patent applications over a five year period covering the theory
<br />
as it matured.  If any of you are interested in the development of my
<br />
theory,  they can view my earlier patent applications on the PTO web
<br />
site.
<br />
<br />No one should bother with my theory who doesn't want to.  However, I
<br />
welcome, very much any criticism of my theory.  If any of you tell me of
<br />
a flaw that can be easily fixed, I will modify the theory to fix the
<br />
flaw.  And if you can prove to me that I am basically wrong, I will be
<br />
very happy abandon the patent applications, get out of the business of
<br />
trying to discover the secrets or the universe and get on with my life.

<br />The patent process is designed to provide an inventor with certain legal

rights regarding the use of his invention by others.
<br />
<br />To attempt to patent a scientific theory (regardless of its scientific
<br />
merits or lack thereof) in the guise of a &quot;model process&quot; is both
<br />
frivolous and bizarre.  I am at a loss to understand the motivations of
<br />
the original poster in doing this.
<br />
<br />On the other hand, I did not intend to &quot;shut down&quot; discussion of the
<br />
actual hypotheses presented.
