It seems that one of the implicit assumptions in the all-universe model
<br />
is that consciousness is real and that we can determine whether whether
<br />
consciousness would exist in a particular universe.  This allows us to
<br />
apply the anthropic principle and argue that the most probable universes
<br />
which allow consciousness to exist are the ones we should observe.
<br />
<br />An essay at the Edge site by Stanislas Dehaene challenges the
<br />
meaningfulness of &quot;consciousness&quot; as a descriptive term, comparing it to
<br />
&quot;life&quot; as something which turns out not to be well defined.  How would
<br />
this affect the use of the anthropic principle in attempting to draw
<br />
predictions from the AUH?
<br />
<br />The essay, available at <a href="http://www.edge.org/documents/questions/q2001.2.html#dehaene">http://www.edge.org/documents/questions/q2001.2.html#dehaene</a>,
<br />
follows below.
<br />
<br />Hal
<br />
<br />===
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The definition of life and consciousness?&quot;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some scientific questions cannot be resolved, but rather are dissolved,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and vanish once we begin to better understand their terms.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is often the case for &quot;definitional questions&quot;. For instance,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what is the definition of life? Can we trace a sharp boundary between
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what is living and what is not living? Is a virus living? Is the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;entire earth a living organism? It seems that our brain predisposes
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;us to ask questions that require a yes or no answer. Moreover,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as scientists, we'd like to keep our mental categories straight
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and, therefore, we would like to have neat and tidy definitions of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the terms we use. However, especially in the biological sciences,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the objects of reality do not conform nicely to our categorical
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;expectations. As we delve into research, we begin to realize that
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what we naively conceived of as a essential category is, in fact, a
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cluster of loosely bound properties that each need to be considered
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in turn (in the case of life: metabolism, reproduction, autonomy,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;homeostasy, etc..). Thus, what was initially considered as a simple
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;question, requiring a straightforward answer, becomes a complex issue
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or even a whole domain of research.  We begin to realize that there
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is no single answer, but many different answers depending on how one
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;frames the terms of the question. And eventually, the question is
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;simply dropped. It is not longer relevant.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I strongly suspect that one of today's hottest scientific questions,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the definition of consciousness, is of this kind. Some scientists seem
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to believe that what we call consciousness is an essence of reality,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a single coherent phenomenon that can be reduced to a single level
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;such as a quantum property of microtubules. Another possibility,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;however, that consciousness is a cluster of properties that, most
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the time, cohere together in awake adult humans. A minimal list
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;probably includes the ability to attend to sensory inputs or internal
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thoughts, to make them available broadly to multiple cerebral systems,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to store them in working memory and in episodic memory, to manipulate
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them mentally, to act intentionally based on them, and in particular to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;report them verbally. As we explore the issue empirically, we begin
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to find many situations (such as visual masking or specific brain
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lesions) in which those properties break down. The neat question
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;what is consciousness&quot; dissolves into a myriad of more precise and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more fruitful research avenues.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any biological theory of consciousness, which assumes that
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consciousness has evolved, implies that &quot;having consciousness&quot; is not
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an all-or-none property. The biological substrates of consciousness
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in human adults are probably also present, but only in partial form,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in other species, in young children or brain-lesioned patients. It is
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;therefore a partially arbitrary question whether we want to extend
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the use of the term &quot;consciousness&quot; to them. For instance, several
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mammals, and even very young human children, show intentional behavior,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;partially reportable mental states, some working memory ability - but
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perhaps no theory of mind, and more &quot;encapsulated&quot; mental processes
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that cannot be reported verbally or even non-verbally. Do they have
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consciousness, then? My bet is that once a detailed cognitive and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neural theory of the various aspects of consciousness is available,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the vacuity of this question will become obvious.
