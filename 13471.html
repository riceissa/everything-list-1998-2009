<br /><br />What would happen if you had the ability to edit your mind at will? It might
<br />
sound like a recipe for terminal drug addiction, because it would be
<br />
possible to give yourself pleasure or satisfaction without doing anything to
<br />
earn it. However, this need not  necessarily be the case, because you could
<br />
edit out your desire to choose this course of action if that's what you felt
<br />
like doing, or even create a desire to edit out the desire (a second level
<br />
desire). There is also the fact that you could as easily assign positive
<br />
feelings to some project you consider intrinsically worthwhile as to
<br />
idleness, so why choose idleness, or anything else you would feel guilty
<br />
about? Perhaps psychopaths would choose to remain psychopaths, but most
<br />
people would choose to strengthen what they consider ideal moral behaviour,
<br />
since it would be possible to get their guilty pleasures more easily.
