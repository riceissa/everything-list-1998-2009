&quot;That which can be destroyed by the truth should be.&quot;
<br />
<br />-- P.C. Hodgell
<br />
<br />Today, among logicians, Bayesian Inference seems to be the new dogma
<br />
for all encompassing theory of rationality.  But I have different
<br />
ideas, so I'm going to present an argument suggesting an alternative
<br />
form of reasoning.  In essence, I going to start to try to bring down
<br />
the curtain on the Bayesian dogma.  This is not the end, but it *is*
<br />
‘the beginning of the end’ (as Churchill once nicely put it).   I'm a
<br />
fan of David Bohm, the physicist who developed the 'Pilot Wave'
<br />
Interpretation of QM (which I like).  So I base my argument on his
<br />
ideas.
<br />
<br />The genius of David Bohm was that he showed that there’s a perfectly
<br />
consistent interpretation of quantum mechanics which completely
<br />
reverses the normal way that physicists think about the relationship
<br />
between particles and background forces – physicists tend to think of
<br />
particles as real static objects moving around in a nebulous backdrop
<br />
of force fields.  Bohm turned this on its head and said why not regard
<br />
the *background forces* as primary and view particles as simply
<br />
temporary ‘pockets of stability’ in the background forces.  This idea
<br />
is implied by his interpretation of quantum mechanics,  where there’s
<br />
a ‘pilot wave’ (the quantum potential) which is primary and particles
<br />
are in effect ‘epiphenomen’ (mere aspects) of the deeper pilot wave.
<br />
<br />Now my idea as regards rationality is exactly analogous to Bohm’s idea
<br />
as regards physics.  In the standard theory of rationality, causal
<br />
explanations (Bayesian reasoning) is primary and intuition (Analogies/
<br />
Narratives) is merely an imperfect human-invented ‘backdrop’ or
<br />
scaffolding.  My theory totally reverses the conevntional view.  I
<br />
say, why not take analogies/narratives as the primary ‘stuff’ of
<br />
thought, and causal explanations (Bayes) as merely
<br />
‘crystallized’ (unusually precise) analogies?
<br />
<br />Bayesian reasoning is exactly analogous to algebra in pure math,
<br />
because with Bayes you are in effect trying to find correlations
<br />
between variables, where the correlations are imprecise or
<br />
fuzzy.  .Algebra is about *relations and functions* which in effect
<br />
maps two given sets of elements (correlate them).  So I suggest that
<br />
algebra is simply the ‘abstract ideal’ of Bayes, where the
<br />
correlations between variables are 100% precise (think of elements of
<br />
sets as the ‘variables’ of statistics).
<br />
<br />Now…. Does algebra have any limitations?  Yes!  Algebra cannot fully
<br />
reason about algebra.  This is the real meaning of Godel’s theorem –
<br />
he showed that any formal system (which is in effect equivalent to an
<br />
algebraic system) complex enough to include both multiplication and
<br />
addition, has statements that cannot be proved within that system.
<br />
Since algebra is exactly analogous to Bayes, we can conclude that
<br />
Bayes cannot reason about Bayes, no system of statistical inference
<br />
can be used to fully reason about itself.
<br />
<br />But is there a form of math more powerful than algebra?  Yes, Category/
<br />
Set Theory!  Unlike algebra, Category/Set theory really *can* fully
<br />
reason about itself, since Sets/categories can contain other Sets/
<br />
Categories.  Greg Cantor first explored these ideas in depth with his
<br />
transfinite arithmetic, and in fact it was later shown that the use of
<br />
transfinite induction can in theory bypass the Godel limitations. (See
<br />
Gerhard Gentzen)
<br />
<br />By analogy, there’s another form of reasoning more powerful than
<br />
Bayes, the rationalist equivalent of Set/Category theory.  What could
<br />
it be?  Well, Sets/Category theory is very analogous to
<br />
categorization, a known form of inference involving grouping concepts
<br />
according to their degree of similarity – this is arguably the same
<br />
thing as…analogy formation!  Indeed, I’ve been using analogical
<br />
arguments throughout this post, showing that analogical inference is
<br />
perfectly capable of reasoning about itself.  My punch-line?  Bayesian
<br />
inference is merely a special case of analogy formation.
<br />
<br />If all this seems hard to believe at first I suggest readers go back
<br />
and look at the analogy I gave with Bohm’s ideas about physics.
<br />
Remember Bohm’s ‘complete reversal’ of the normal way of thinking
<br />
about physics turned out to be fully consistent.  All I’ve done is
<br />
performed the same trick as Bohm in the field of cognitive science.
<br />
Just as ‘particles’ become mere epiphenomena of a ‘pilot wave’,
<br />
‘Bayes’ becomes a mere epiphenona of analogy formation.
<br />
<br />Time for Bayesian logicians to fill their trousers? ;)
