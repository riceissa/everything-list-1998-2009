<br />
There have always been two ways to interpret the interrelationship
<br />
between the physical world and our minds. The first one is to consider
<br />
the physical world to be fundamental; from this perspective, the
<br />
appearance of the mind is to be understood with the help of some
<br />
neurological theory that maps physical states of the brain to states
<br />
of the mind or observer moments. The second way starts with the mind,
<br />
denying the fundamental role of the physical world. According to this
<br />
assumption, the physical world is introduced with the help of a theory
<br />
of physics mapping mental states to physical states that reproduce the
<br />
mental state within themselves. Imprecisely speaking, the second way
<br />
questions the reality status of the physical world.
<br />
<br />Both ways allow the elaboration of an ensemble theory. The first
<br />
approach starts from the ensemble of all physical worlds (or formally
<br />
with descriptions thereof). The second approach uses the ensemble of
<br />
all observer moments (or descriptions thereof). When Rolf expressed
<br />
the idea &quot;UTM outputs a qualia, not a universe&quot; (which is similar to
<br />
the second approach), I wrote: &quot;I have always been hopeful that both
<br />
approaches will finally turn out to be equivalent.&quot;
<br />
<br />It's a very trivial fact though that the two approaches are not
<br />
equivalent. Nonetheless it's interesting to note it. I argue that we
<br />
have good reasons to discard the second approach. The fundamental role
<br />
will be assigned to the physical worlds (hence the title of this
<br />
message). The difference between the two approaches leads to different
<br />
expections to the question &quot;What will I experience next?&quot;.
<br />
Consequently it can be measured empirically. We find this result by
<br />
observing that different physical worlds may produce the same observer
<br />
moment (e.g. if the physical worlds differ in a detail not perceivable
<br />
by the observer). This assigns a higher probability to the observer
<br />
moment when chosen randomly in order to answer the question (it's
<br />
multiply counted because it appears more than once in the everyting
<br />
ensemble). Opposed to this, every observer moment (in the RSSA within
<br />
a given reference class) would have an equal probability to be
<br />
selected if we used the second approach.
<br />
<br />I think that the quantum mechanical Born rule strongly supports the
<br />
first approach: Observer moments are weighted according to a specific
<br />
formula. They don't have equal probability!
<br />
<br />Example: Both quantum states, |A&gt; = |0&gt;/sqrt(2) + |1&gt;/sqrt(2) and
<br />
|B&gt; = |0&gt;/sqrt(3) + |1&gt;/sqrt(1.5)
<br />
lead to the same two possible observer moments when a measurement in
<br />
the (|0&gt;,|1&gt;) basis is performed. According to the Born rule the
<br />
probabilites for the two observer moments are equal for |A&gt; and
<br />
different for |B&gt;. Starting from the second approach (observer moments
<br />
are fundamental) this result cannot be understood.
<br />
<br />If we take this result seriously, Bostrom's self-sampling assumption
<br />
<br />&quot;Each observer moment should reason as if it were randomly selected
<br />
from the class of all observer moments in its reference class.&quot;
<br />
<br />should be modified:
<br />
<br />&quot;Each observer moment should reason as if it were randomly selected
<br />
from the class of all observer moments in its reference class,
<br />
weighted with their frequencies in the Everything ensemble.&quot;
<br />
<br />In order to avoid misunderstandings, I want to add that I consider the
<br />
Everything ensemble (in both approaches) as given. It's not the output
<br />
of some UTM.
