<br />It can't! Timesteps are denumerable, hence this statement is just a 
<br />
contradiction in terms. You better postulate your ensemble without 
<br />
reference to any algorithm to generate it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, as the cardinality of &quot;my&quot; ensemble is actually &quot;c&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (cardinality of the real numbers), it is quite probably a completely 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different beast.
</em><br />
<br />There you go again with your radical compression. Without the reading I've 
<br />
been doing in the last two weeks, I wouldn't have been able to decode this 
<br />
statement as meaning:
<br />
<br />2^\aleph_0 = \aleph_1 (by definition)
<br />
<br />To assume c = \aleph_1 is the Continuum Hypothesis, which is unprovable 
<br />
(within standard arithmetic).
<br />
<br />&lt;snip&gt;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now an observer will expect to find a SAS in one of the descriptions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as a corrolory of the anthropic principle, which is explicitly stated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as one of the assumptions in this work. I make no bones about this - I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consider the anthropic principle a mystery, not self-evident like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; many people.
</em><br />
<br />Very few supporters of the AP would &quot;expect to find a SAS&quot; in a bitstring.
<br />
Until you *specify* a way of interpreting the string, it contains nothing 
<br />
but bits.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why should an observer expect to see a token of erself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; embedded in reality? That is the mystery of the AP.
</em><br />
<br />What ARE you talking about?  Observer's don't see tokens of themselves... 
<br />
if anyone (God?) has a 3rd-person/bird's eye view, it is certainly not 
<br />
someone who is included in any particular reality. No way is anything like 
<br />
this implied by the AP. All the AP requires is that there *be* 
<br />
observers/SAS in (real) universes, which is true in our case at least.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; And now we find not only that the bit string is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; a description, but it is a complex enough description to describe SAS's?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; How does that work?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The bitstrings are infinite in length. By reading enough bits, they can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have arbitrarily complex meanings attached to them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />In particular, any bitstring can be &quot;interpreted&quot; as any other bitstring 
<br />
by an appropriate map. Hence until you specify an interpreter you are 
<br />
simply not proposing a theory at all.
<br />
<br />&lt;snip&gt;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; All that is discussed in this paper is appearances - we only try to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explain the phenomenon (things as they appear). No attempt is made to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explain the noumenon (things as they are), nor do we need to assume
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that there is a noumenon.
</em><br />
<br />Most readers of your paper would take it that you are making a strong 
<br />
ontological proposition, i.e. that the basis of reality is your set of 
<br />
bitstrings. If this is *not* the case, and you think the bitstrings may be 
<br />
represented in some deeper reality (or maybe are just metaphors), then 
<br />
what is the motivation for your proposal? Why do we need to think about 
<br />
this intermediate layer of bitstrings? The original simplicity goes out 
<br />
the window.
<br />
<br />BTW I'm with Kant: you can't have an appearance without an underlying 
<br />
reality, even if that is unknowable.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno Marchal has a detailed discussion on this in his thesis, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concludes that he &quot;has no need for this hypothesis&quot; (what he calls the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; extravagant hypothesis).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So the former statement is true :[the description strings are] things 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that &quot;observer&quot; TM's observe and map to integers. It is also true that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; descriptions of self aware observers will appear within the description 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by the Anthropic Principle. The phenomenon of observerhood is included. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However where the observers actually live is not a meaningful question 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in this framework.
</em><br />
<br />I think either your terminology or you model has now got very confused. 
<br />
Are your &quot;observer&quot; TMs the observers (SAS) whose experiences your theory 
<br />
is trying to explain? In this case &quot;where they live&quot; is crucial because it 
<br />
defines the environment the SAS find themselves in.  If you are not 
<br />
careful your theory becomes effectively that we are all &quot;brains in 
<br />
bottles&quot; or Leibnizian monads, which is solipsism by another name. Or are 
<br />
your &quot;observers&quot; the missing &quot;interpreters&quot; in your theory which give it 
<br />
meaning, and allow us to find (in principle) the SAS within the bitstrings 
<br />
that represent actual observers like us? In this case it's unhelpful to 
<br />
call these meta-entities &quot;observers&quot;; rather, in effect, they constitute 
<br />
the (meta-)laws of physics. Incidentally, a TM by itself can't generate 
<br />
meaning, as it is only a map from integers to integers. You still have to 
<br />
specify externally how to interpret the code as something more than a mere 
<br />
number. (E.g. in the Turing test the output bits have to be processed into 
<br />
English language text).
<br />
<br />&lt;snip&gt;
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The page then goes on to make some comments about measure applied to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; universes.  Here again I am confused about how to relate it to all that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; has been descibed.  What are the analogs of universes, in this model?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Is it &quot;descriptions&quot;, the infinite bit strings?  From what has been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; presented so far, I don't understand how to relate our experience of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; reality to this model.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Each description is a possible universe, composed of an infinite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; amount of information. Any observer will of course only comprehend a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; finite amount information, and hence be in a superposition of a subset
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of universes corresponding to that finite information. Admittedly the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; usage of the term &quot;universe&quot; is slightly strange here.
</em><br />
<br />Not to mention the terms &quot;observer&quot; and &quot;superposition&quot;. In QM, which is 
<br />
the natural context, superposition implies that it is possible sometimes 
<br />
to observe (and predict) interference effects. I don't see how this can 
<br />
happen in your sense, since there is no interaction between descriptions.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Alterantively, one could talk about &quot;observer moments&quot; as corresponding 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the equivalence classes of descriptions. This interpretation would be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more natural to many here on this list.
</em><br />
<br />Surely not equivalence classes of *descriptions*? If a description = 
<br />
universe, some will contain many different observers and hence OMs.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In section 3 of the paper, I now introduce a temporal dimension, with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the observer repeatedly sampling the set of all descriptions, with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proviso that successor states can only differ by a finite number of bits.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />So are you saying that your &quot;descriptions/universes&quot; in Section 2 don't 
<br />
contain a representation of time? why shouldn't they? If they don't, how 
<br />
can they represent &quot;universes&quot; in any sense at all? If they do, what's the 
<br />
point of introducing a second, independent &quot;time dimension&quot; in your 
<br />
meta-world of &quot;observer&quot; processing &quot;universes&quot;?
<br />
<br />(And no, I havn't managed to work all the way through you &quot;QM&quot; section. 
<br />
After a while you just lost me completely. I'm hoping Hal's questions 
<br />
will help clarify things enough for me to get a grip on it.)
