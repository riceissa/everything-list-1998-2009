<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is an important difference between normative statements and descriptive or empirical statements. Quoting from Wikipedia:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Descriptive (or constative) statements are falsifiable statements that attempt to describe reality. Normative 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; statements, on the other hand, affirm how things should or ought to be, how to value them, which things are good or bad, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which actions are right or wrong.&quot;
</em><br />
<br />Yes; it's always good to keep that in mind. Catch me if I slip  ;-)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Suppose some powerful being sets up an experiment whereby organisms who believe they are the same individual day after 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; day are selectively culled, while those who believe that they are born anew each morning and die when they fall asleep 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; each night, but still make provision for their successors just as we make provision for our children, are left alone or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rewarded....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You would then have to grant the day-people that their belief is just as good as ours, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the difference between us just being an accident of evolution. What's more, to be consistent you would have to grant that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a duplicate is not a self, on the grounds that the great majority of people do not believe this and our very language is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; designed to deny that such a thing is possible (only the British monarch uses &quot;we&quot; to mean what commoners refer to as &quot;I&quot;). 
</em><br />
<br />Of course, actions speak louder than words. As you point out, people have
<br />
believed many seemingly strange things. I'm sure that some medieval
<br />
scholastics, or perhaps people in an insane asylum, have consistently
<br />
held many positions.  What determines sanity, as well as what one's
<br />
true beliefs are, is the way that one acts.
<br />
<br />In your example, indeed people could go around saying that they were
<br />
not the same person from day to day. But (as you also point out) 
<br />
evolution might cull certain beliefs. Now what is important is that
<br />
someone *acts* as though they are the same from day to day. And in
<br />
fact, no matter how people's lips move, we would find that all but
<br />
the seriously deranged *act* as though what happened to &quot;them&quot; 
<br />
tomorrow mattered. 
<br />
<br />So I can imagine people *saying* that they are not the same from 
<br />
day to day, but I cannot imagine successful human organisms acting
<br />
as thought they were not.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Survival and continuity of identity consist solely in the fact that we *believe* we survive from moment to moment.
</em><br />
<br />Whereas I believe that how we act is what is important, and that our
<br />
language should simply reflect how we act. Since people do in fact
<br />
try to save their skins over days, in some sense this makes them at
<br />
least the same &quot;vested interest&quot;.
<br />
<br />In your scenario, language would evolve, although perhaps awkwardly,
<br />
to account for people's  behavior. For instance, contracts could no
<br />
longer be between persons (except ones whose terms expired within
<br />
the course of a single day), but instead would specify &quot;vested 
<br />
interests&quot; or something that meant the same thing as we ordinarily
<br />
mean by &quot;person&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You're right, of course [in that] The belief that we are the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person from moment to moment has a certain utility, otherwise it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would never have evolved. But do you think there is more to the idea
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than evolutionary expediency?
</em><br />
<br />Offhand, I can't think of any reason except, as you say, evolutionary
<br />
expediency. As you also say, there can be no absolute truth to the 
<br />
matter. Nonetheless, as I said above, if we want our words to chase
<br />
our actual behavior, then there are the usual &quot;persons&quot;.
<br />
<br />Notice the great utility of it that even fits the usage I'm suggesting.
<br />
Young people strongly discount things that will happen to them when
<br />
&quot;they&quot; are much older. But you can see a certain reason to it; in the
<br />
sense I use, they may not later be the same person (of course it lies
<br />
on a continuum, as you know).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Also, if a particular belief or behaviour has evolved, does that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessarily makes it true and/or good?
</em><br />
<br />The belief---as all our beliefs---are either accurate (good maps) or
<br />
they are not. We could call our accurate beliefs &quot;true&quot;---isn't that
<br />
Tarski's or someone's Correspondence Theory of Truth?.
<br />
<br />For sure, a belief is good, (or perhaps I should simply say better)
<br />
if either it advances survival or corresponds to the structure of
<br />
the world.
