<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Computer always have counterfactuals, because there changing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; one part of them (whether data or programme) has an effect on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; the overall behaviour. Changing one part of a recording (e.g splicing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; a film) changes only *that* part.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I don't think you can distinguish between recording and computation on that basis. By &quot;recording&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I don't mean just the film, but the film + projector as system. The film is the computer's fixed input
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and the computer is the projector in this case. A closer analogy would be a software media player
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; playing an .mpg file: the output is rigidly fixed by the input, although the media player handles
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; counterfactuals in that the output would be different if the input were different. But the same is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; true of any physical system sensitive to initial conditions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't see how that helps you argument. Such a &quot;recording&quot; is not just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a string
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of unrelated states. There is something beyond the manifest, active
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; state that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explains how one state makes the transition to another. (Of course
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would say that &quot;something&quot; is matter/physical laws).
</em><br />
<br />(I'm assuming physicalism for the sake of argument here.)
<br />
Remember, I am not restricting the term &quot;recording&quot; to the input data alone, but to data + program 
<br />
as a system, because there is always a super-program which includes the data as part of the program, 
<br />
or a super-machine which includes the data hardwired. For example, Winzip accepts .zip files as input 
<br />
and produces as output the original uncompressed file, but it is also possible to have a single self-expanding 
<br />
.exe file which is effectively a combination of Winzip + .zip file. Executing the .exe file puts the computer 
<br />
through much the same sequence of physical states as using Winzip with the appropriate .zip file, but the 
<br />
.exe file accepts no input and is completely deterministic. In other words, you can always make a small 
<br />
adjustment to a system by including data as program, so that the new system goes through the same 
<br />
physical events as the original one, but the if-then statements are just redundant code. I don't see how 
<br />
you can say that one system implements a computation (and is potentially conscious) but the other does not. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  The latter seems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; obvious to me from the fact that an entity experiences only one stream of consciousness at a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time, regardless of how many actual (in the multiverse) or possible (in a single universe model,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with or without true randomness) braches there are in which that entity is conscious.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; That doesn't follow. A counterfactual is a COUNTERfactual - -it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; something that could have happenned but didn't. There is no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; reason why we should be conscious of in things
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; we coudl have done but didn't. (Unless counterfactuals
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; are itnerpreted as alternate worlds, but then they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; are not really COUNTERfactuals -- they actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; did happen, buit &quot;somewhere else&quot;).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; That's just the point I am making: there is no reason why we should be conscious of things we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; could have done but didn't,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, there is if you start from the premisses that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) consciousness is a type of computation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) computations provide counterfactuals
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3) In an immaterial universe, counterfactuals are provided by &quot;other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; worlds&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />I accept (1), although I'm not completely certain about it.
<br />
<br />I think (2) is problematic, because by fixing the input you fix the output as surely as if you excised the 
<br />
if-then statements, and the computer goes through exactly the same sequence of physical states as if 
<br />
you had excised the if-then statements. Conversely, any physical system, however rigidly deterministic, 
<br />
could be seen as implementing if-then statements because *if* some part of the system had been 
<br />
different *then* by following the laws of physics some other part of the system would have been different. 
<br />
If you look beyond the lines of code you will see that a computer loaded with software is really just a 
<br />
physical system that moves this way if you push it here, that way if you push it there, all the while following 
<br />
the laws of physics. How could it be otherwise?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and there is no reason I should notice anything strange had happened
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; if all my copies in other multiverse branches suddenly drop dead. Even if as a matter of fact it can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; shown that consciousness is always associated with the actual or potential implementation of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; counterfactuals, it does not follow that we are conscious *as a result* of this.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The claim of computationalism is that we are indeed conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as the result of running a program. If you are going
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to reject compuationalism, what other route do you have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to a immaterial, Everythingist universe ?
</em><br />
<br />What I'm rejecting is the notion that we are conscious *as a result of the counterfactuals*, whether 
<br />
actually implemented in other worlds or potentially implemented in a single world. A computer with fixed 
<br />
input is as rigidly deterministic as a physical system can be. It may *look* like it has if-then statements, 
<br />
but these cannot be implemented. It is like saying that a billiard ball has if-then statements, because if 
<br />
it were struck differenly by another billiard ball, it would move differently. You could probably build a 
<br />
computer out of billiard balls arranged on a huge table, with the &quot;hardware&quot; being the balls, the &quot;program&quot; 
<br />
being the arrangement of the balls, and the &quot;input&quot; being how you hit the balls with the cue. Ignoring the 
<br />
effects of chaos (something we try to avoid in real computers), this billiard ball computer will respond in a 
<br />
perfectly deterministic way, in that if the input is fixed, so is the output. The counterfactual behaviour is 
<br />
intrinsic at the most basic, most stupid, physical level, and is unavoidable in any physical system. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; The claim that consciousness requires counterfactuals
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; stems from the argument that consciousness is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; comptutation, and computation requires counterfactuals.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; It doesn't stem from an expeiential insight into counterfactual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; situations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; A practical computer requires counterfactuals in order to interact with its environment.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A computer programme has counterfactuals because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in general it has if-then branches, and in gnereal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it doesn't execute them all. That is a quite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; separate consideration from &quot;interacting with the environment&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />If it doesn't interact with the environment the counterfactuals are never implemented, not even 
<br />
potentially.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; problem with this idea is that firstly *any* physical system interacting with its environment
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; handles counterfactuals,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why is that a problem ? The claim is that programmes have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; counterfactuals,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not that everything with a counterfactuals is a programme.
</em><br />
<br />Perhaps you did not say so explicitly, but my impression was that you think counterfactual behaviour is 
<br />
what makes computer programs special. There is some confusion as to the status of a &quot;regular&quot; program 
<br />
accepting input from the environment, compared to the same program with fixed input. I would call the latter 
<br />
a recording and I would say that it is just as conscious (or not) as the regular program on a specific run. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and secondly there is no reason to assume that the handling of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; counterfactuals is somehow responsible for consciousness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The purported reason is computationalism. You culd
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; abandon it, but where does that leave you ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; A rigidly determined computation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; may be a &quot;trivial&quot; case of a computation but it does not mean it is not a computation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A determined system can still have counterfactuals.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; . A machine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; hardwired to compute the digits of pi, and nothing else, is still computing the digits of pi even though
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; it isn't much use as a general purpose computer.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And it would computer something else if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it were hardwired differently. It still fulfils
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the &quot;internal counterfactual criterion&quot; -- if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one of its states were changed, the subsequent sequence of states
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would change. Unlike movie.
</em><br />
<br />A movie would be different if the patterns on the film were different, or the projector's speed were 
<br />
different. If you say that a movie does not implement a computation, it's not because it lacks counterfactual 
<br />
behaviour.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Similarly, we can imagine beings who are still
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; conscious even though their lives are rigidly determined.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Counterfactuals are *not* the same thing as indeterminism.
</em><br />
<br />OK, you've made that clear. But since every physical system implements counterfactuals, it leaves the 
<br />
possibility open that every physical system might implement a computation, perhaps a conscious computation, 
<br />
under the right interpretation. The implementation of a computation occurs as a result of physical activity 
<br />
(according to standard computationalism) but its meaning is a static, timeless thing, perhaps printed in a 
<br />
manual, perhaps held in the mind of the programmer, perhaps not physically available at all. In the latter 
<br />
case - for example, if the manual is destroyed and the programmer dead - there is no reason why the computer 
<br />
should be any less valid a computer, or any less conscious if it were conscious to begin with.
