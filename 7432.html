<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hi Norman,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Who gave this guy a Doctorate? That webpage appears to be merely an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; advertisement for a book.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     I think that your question is more important that the ramblings of Dr. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Raj!
</em><br />
<br />I read the page and was pretty dubious myself, although I don't
<br />
have the balls to say what Stephen did.  From this page:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Raj Baldev said in his book that Black Holes suck and destroy
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the material on one hand, recycles it and then ejects the material 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so violently in the space that they ultimately form stars and planets 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;therefrom.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about 9 months from the release of the book of Dr. Raj Baldev, 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stephen Hawking, one of the noted authorities on Black Hole changed 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his idea about the Black Hole. Hawking was of the firm opinion that 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nothing could escape from the Black Hole, not even light and nothing 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;could come out of it. But in July 2004, at 17th International Conference 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on General Relativity and Gravitation in Dublin, 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he admitted his mistake that he was wrong for thirty years. 
<br />
<br />Hawking wrong about &quot;nothing could escape black holes&quot;?  Has the
<br />
writer never heard of Hawking radiation? Hawking began writing
<br />
about black holes evaporating as far back as the 1970s.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was it not the result of Dr. Raj Baldev's new hypothesis on Black Hole? 
<br />
<br />No.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Hawking did not mention the credit of his changing mind in his new 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;research, the lawyer of the Publisher of the book of Dr. Raj Baldev
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;served upon a legal notice on Stephen Hawking, on which he offered 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no comments. This issue remained on net for about a year, which the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;author ignored and decided not to move the court keeping in view his 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;personal respect for Stephen Hawking.
<br />
<br />Well, why isn't there (if this is the case) a lot of condemnation on
<br />
the net of Dr. Baldev?  I hope that it is not out of sensitivity to
<br />
his and his supporters' feelings. Also, I can't help but wonder if
<br />
Dr. Baldev isn't trying to justify the Hindu theories that examine
<br />
ages of the universe far, far greater than mere billions of years.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     How does anyone get information? Does the acquisition of information 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; always take some form of &quot;work&quot;?
</em><br />
<br />It would indeed seem to me that if System A obtains information 
<br />
(from outside System A), then work must be performed. That is,
<br />
I lack the imagination or the knowledge to see how in the simplest
<br />
case I can think of, a traveling photon that crosses the boundary
<br />
of System A and leaves a record  can do no work.
