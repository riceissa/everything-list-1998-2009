<br />
OK, tell me where all those civilisations of the past have gone to, 
<br />
because THEY did NOT survived.
<br />
<br />Tell me what makes YOU so sure this current global civilisation can 
<br />
survive. I am more than happy to be shown where I am wrong, but if you 
<br />
TRULY disagree with what I am saying, I would like you to provide some 
<br />
clear and unambiguous empirical evidence to back up your assertions. 
<br />
Without that, you are simply complaining that I am just strongly 
<br />
expressing an opinion. I never deny this, in the context that we are 
<br />
speaking of here, but I think that my opinion on this is as good as 
<br />
anybody's that I have seen so far.
<br />
<br />To help you chew on this:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* compassion is the acting out of the ability to see oneself in the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other and the recognition that, except for the throw of some
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cosmic dice, I am he or she and they are me; compassion
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;facilitates the breaking down of the fear and false consciousness
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which underpins unconscious projection; compassion is a sign and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;manifestation of authentic being and strength, not weakness;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without compassion truly human life is well nigh impossible
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* ethics is the foundation of civilisation and is the acting out of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the ability to see that we each depend on many, many others for
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our survival and well being and they depend upon us, and that the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;true genius and strength of humankind is our ability to cooperate
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with each other rather than a propensity to strive against others
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* democracy is essentially the systematic implementation of the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;non-violent resolution of conflict, it requires that everyone's
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;voice be heard and democracy advances as the excessive and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aggressive power of the rich and powerful is curtailed and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;controlled; Karl Popper gave the most succinct explanation of why
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;democracy is both better than all the alternatives and absolutely
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;essential and the basic form of his argument is this: all policies
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;formulated by governments and governing bodies will have
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unexpected negative consequences, no matter how good the policies,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and it is to be expected that at least 50% of the unforeseen
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consequences will be significantly adverse and negative for those
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who experience them so it is imperative that the negative
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consequences of policies be made known to those who govern and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the rulers take notice and actually ameliorate the problems.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the rulers cannot be made to correct these unforeseen negative
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;outcomes then over time the negative outcomes will accrue to the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;extent that the people feel driven to rebel or vote with their
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;feet and leave the land of the rotten regime.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* the advent of scientific method into human culture is what has
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;made the modern world; this modern era is a time of transition in
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which every traditional belief and practice is being challenged by
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the application of scientific method and of the fruits of the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;application of science; in this world of great and ceaseless
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;changes, the continued application of scientific method is and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;always will be essential for allowing us to adapt to all the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unforeseen outcomes of change so far; with scientific method human
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beings have the ability to journey out into the solar system and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beyond, to be citizens of the galaxy, but without scientific
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;method humans will die out on a devastated planet
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
