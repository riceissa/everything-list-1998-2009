Dear Stephen,
<br />
<br /><br />With your permission, I answer an offlist  post you sended to me and 
<br />
some others,
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno, you claim that I assume a physical world. While I would agree 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with that claim to some degree, it misses the point that I am trying 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to make, just as Lee's interpretation of my idea as being about &quot;an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intersubjective reality&quot;. I am trying to start with those aspects that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I can not coherently be skeptical of, the &quot;unassailables&quot; (to use 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Penrose's favorite term). (I am being a Curmudgeon!)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    I can not doubt that I have a 1st person experience and I can not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dismiss that that 1st person experience has some content.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Like me. We agree.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Additionally I am lead by logic to not be able to doubt the existence 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of otherminds - there is no coherent solipsism for finite computations 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thus it is necessary that any model of consciousness must include 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; means and mechanism to explain and predict how the contents of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multiple 1st person experiences are &quot;synchronized&quot; such that this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conversation itself is not only allowed by the model but can also be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shown to be unavoidable or inevitable; that, I think, satisfies my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argument for &quot;necessity&quot; of a 1st person viewpoint.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I completely agree with you.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    Bruno, it seems that you claim that you don't need a &quot;pre-existing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical world&quot; since such, you hope to prove, can be derived solely 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from the relations between numbers.
</em><br />
<br /><br />To be clear I have only proved that IF COMP is taken seriously enough 
<br />
THEN the appearance of a &quot;pre-existing physical world&quot;, including its 
<br />
stability, lawfulness ... MUST BE derivable from the relation between 
<br />
numbers. This is done. Then I got results confirming in part that comp 
<br />
can be true, in proving that the logic of physical propositions is not 
<br />
boolean and even has a quantum smelling (to be short).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I will agree, for the sake of discussion, that numbers can represent 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the content of any and all 1st person viewpoints at some level of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Existence but my challenge to you is to shown how this Existence is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stratified such that our unassailable experience of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;being-in-the-world&quot; is necessary.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I completely agree with you again.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is easy to see that if we only consider a single mind the problems 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of synchronization and &quot;flow&quot; vanish - we have the ideal solipsist 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whose experiences are identified with the &quot;relations between  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; numbers&quot;.  But where does meaningfulness come from?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Meaningfulness comes from the non triviality of our experiences. 
<br />
Suppose someone is cut and pasted in two exemplars in city A and in 
<br />
city B. From a third person point of view no bits are produced. From 
<br />
the personal point of view of each exemplar, when they localize 
<br />
themselves, they find no trivial answers (A or B) each of which 
<br />
produces one bit of information. It is genuine information because for 
<br />
each of them, their result *could* have been different. Note that such 
<br />
bits are not communicable to the outside observer. (Note the importance 
<br />
of the counterfactuals).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;    How is it a coherent claim to have numbers representing everything 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; when there is no way that the numbers can be distinguished. It seems 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to me that this &quot;distinguishability&quot; requires something more than just 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;relations between numbers&quot;..
</em><br />
<br /><br />I don't understand. Please elaborate (when and if you have the time).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;   I still don't get how Bruno bypasses the proofs that quantum logics 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can not be reduced to Boolean algebras... Maybe what I do not grasp is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that Bruno is using a higher logical algebra that has quantum logics 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as a subgroup - of course we know that Boolean algebras are a subgroup 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of quantum...
</em><br />
<br />Quantum logic cannot be embedded by a truth preserving translation. It 
<br />
does not mean the quantum cannot be translated by some more general 
<br />
translation. I will say more on the everything-list because this is 
<br />
obviously a technical point. I use a theorem by Robert Goldblatt 
<br />
translating quantum logic in some modal logic.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Goldblatt, R. I. (1974). Semantic Analysis of Orthologic. Journal of 
<br />
Philosophical Logic, 3:19-35
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;    I am still troubled by the idea that we seem to think that Integers 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (recursively enumerable numbers more precisely?) are sufficient to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; code all possible experience - how do we get complex numbers? ... Wait 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a sec. I have an epiphany! Are all other forms of numbers, set, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; groups, categories, etc. embedded in the Integers by the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; identification of their descriptions with some bitstring, a Geodel 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; numbering scheme?
</em><br />
<br /><br />No. Perhaps it could be, and this would give a constructive version of 
<br />
my theorem, but I doubt it is possible. As a mathematician I use as 
<br />
tools any portion of Cantor paradise. I believe in all real numbers, 
<br />
even non-standard one. I am not at all a constructivist, and I 
<br />
certainly don't identify object with their description. On the 
<br />
contrary, I show explicitly that when the Universal dovetailer 
<br />
&quot;executes&quot; (mathematically in Platonia) his infinite computation, then, 
<br />
what emerge from the point of view of internal observer &quot;simulated&quot; all 
<br />
along, will forever prevent any such identification between observable 
<br />
object and their description. In particular neither a person, nor a 
<br />
universe can, in any effective or constructive sense, be a computable 
<br />
object. I agree this is subtle and could look like a contradiction: I 
<br />
sum it often by saying things like:  if I am a machine then reality 
<br />
cannot be a machine. An image is: if I am so little that I can go 
<br />
through all the tiny holes in the fabric of reality, then my accessible 
<br />
reality will seems genuinely bigger. You can seen comp as a 
<br />
self-humility principle, but it entails a &quot;counter-self explosion&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; WOW!  But what about the Berry paradox?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/CDMTCS/chaitin/unm2.html">http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/CDMTCS/chaitin/unm2.html</a>
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I adore all the work of Chaitin and Svozil. Those works could add many 
<br />
colors to comp. In &quot;Conscience and mécanisme&quot; I make some of those 
<br />
relations explicit. In that setting the work on computational depth by 
<br />
Bennett can give also an important color: indeed the &quot;cosmological&quot; 
<br />
aspect of our reality; the feeling of having a very long and non 
<br />
trivial history can perhaps be justified from Bennett's work. But 
<br />
that's complex enough, and I am now concentrating myself mainly on the 
<br />
quantum logical feature of reality.
