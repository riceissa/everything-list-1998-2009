<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that different TOEs might disagree.
</em><br />
<br />That's true, but the important point is to consider why we are searching
<br />
for a measure, or why we even think there might be a measure that is
<br />
relevant to our experience.
<br />
<br />The reason is because our own existence is not chaotic, but ordered.
<br />
Presumably there are observers who see universes that are much more
<br />
chaotic than ours, universes where there are no natural laws but the
<br />
observers just manage to hang together somehow.  Why do we see a lawful
<br />
universe?
<br />
<br />And in our own universe, why do more probable things happen more often
<br />
than less probable ones?  It's not tautological!  Remember our discussion
<br />
of the magical universe where dice always come up &quot;6&quot; but everything
<br />
else works OK.  Why don't we live in one of those universes?
<br />
<br />The same thing happens in the MWI.  If you send almost-vertically-
<br />
polarized photons through a vertical polarizer then 99 times out of 100
<br />
they go through.  Each time, the universe splits into two branches.
<br />
After 100 photons, only one universe in 2^100 of them will see the
<br />
right statistics.  By sheer numbers of universes, almost all of them
<br />
will see about 50% go through.  Why aren't we in one of those universes?
<br />
<br />The answer to all of these puzzles must be that fundamentally, some
<br />
universes are more likely to be experienced than others.  This is the
<br />
concept which we refer to as measure.  It is a weighting factor that
<br />
somehow must make some universes more important in the grand scheme
<br />
of things.
<br />
<br />You are right that there are many different ideas about how measure works
<br />
and how it could apply, in both the MWI and in the larger multiverse.
<br />
But this uncertainty doesn't mean that we can reject or ignore the concept
<br />
of measure.  Its reality is forced upon us by every observation we make.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Are you talking about a type of measure 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; specific to the MWI of quantum mechanics? I thought there was supposed to be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a problem with this due to the &quot;no preferred basis&quot; problem.
</em><br />
<br />The proper manner for incorporating measure into the MWI is indeed an
<br />
open question at this point.  The simplest is to just introduce it ad
<br />
hoc and define the measure of a branch as the square of its amplitude.
<br />
Others claim that they can derive this from more elementary and/or
<br />
obvious assumptions.  But it's got to be there.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In any case, if there is some sort of theory that would give objective 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; truths about first-person probabilities in splitting experiments (and I'm 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not sure if you believe in continuity of consciousness or that such a theory 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is out there waiting to be found),
</em><br />
<br />Well, I do believe in continuity of consciousness, modulo the issues
<br />
of measure.  That is, I think some continuations would be more likely to
<br />
be experienced than others.  For example, if you started up 9 computers
<br />
each running one copy of me (all running the same program so they stay
<br />
in sync), and one computer running a different copy of me, my current
<br />
theory is that I would expect to experience the first version with 90%
<br />
probability.
<br />
<br />However I don't see any way at this point to test this model.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; then if first-person probabilities 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; disagree with &quot;measure&quot;, however it's defined, I think most people would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; care more about maximizing the first-person probabilities of good outcomes 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as opposed to measure.
</em><br />
<br />Our experiences every day prove that first person probabilities do
<br />
correspond to measure, but that is because we define measure to correspond
<br />
to what we experience.  That is where the amplitude-squared formula for
<br />
probability came from in QM; it is there to make theory match experience.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The main reason to care about measure would be for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; altruistic reasons, that you don't want friends and families to have a high 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probability of suffering because they see you die, but even this could be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stated in terms of maximizing the subjective probability of happy outcomes 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for other people.
</em><br />
<br />It seems that for QS to be an attractive option, you have to believe
<br />
that measure applies all the time, except when you die.  What is the
<br />
justification for making an exception, when all the rest of the time
<br />
you act as if you believe in measure?  You would take a good bet rather
<br />
than a bad bet, but if your death is involved you'll stop caring?
