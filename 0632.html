</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;The motivation for defining this axiom is that if we accept it then that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;buys us a very neat &quot;solution&quot; to the DA problem, i.e. a way of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;giving all the arguments advanced by Carter and Leslie their due
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;without changing our minds one bit about the future of our species
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;and its robotic descendants. The idea is that we could grant that a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;shift must be made ... while insisting that this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;shift is counterbalanced by the greater a priori likelihood of there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;being many observers. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The error here is the same error made by many who try to argue
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; against the DA without realizing that the DA argues for a *shift*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in priors which are otherwise given and not for an a priori likelihood
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of any particular form.  Likewise, as I read KKP, they argue that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in total parallelism with the DA, *another* shift should be made to any
</em><br />
<br />Yes, except that they do not really *argue* for that.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; prior probabilities that the DA is applied to, and they do not argue 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that there is a &quot;greater a priori likelihood of there being many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observers.&quot;
</em><br />
<br />Yet that is precisely what it amounts to. If you think that the 
<br />
Self-Indication Assumption is justified then, if you didn't know your 
<br />
birth rank, you would have to conclude, a priori, that the world 
<br />
contains infinitely many observers. That seems wrong. When I'm saying 
<br />
&quot;a priori&quot; I am referring to this prior probability before you know 
<br />
or take account of your birth rank.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In particular, the SI *Argument* is no more an Assumption (or Axiom
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as the paper has it) than is the Doomsday *Argument*.  They are both
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just applications of Bayes Theorem for which one must specify a prior
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; likelihood.  
</em><br />
<br />I disagree. The Doomsday argument rests on the Self-Sampling 
<br />
assumption, and the Dieks-KKP cancellation of the Doomsday argument 
<br />
rests on the Self-Indication assumption. The difference is that there 
<br />
are independent arguments for the Self-Sampling assumption (namely 
<br />
the Amnesia Chamber thought experiment, and Leslie's Emeralds 
<br />
example) whereas the only reason I know of for accepting the 
<br />
Self-Indication assumption is that it would cancel the Doomsday 
<br />
argument, which is a dubious justification. In addition, there are 
<br />
other problems with the Self-Indication assumption, such as the one 
<br />
referred to above (that you would think with probability one that the 
<br />
universe contains infinitely many observers if you don't know your 
<br />
birth rank). That seems very wrong.
<br />
<br />I had a long debate with Robin Hanson about this some 8 months ago on 
<br />
the extropians list. You might be able to find it in the extropian 
<br />
achives (linked from <a href="http://www.transhumanism.com/lists.htm">http://www.transhumanism.com/lists.htm</a>
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In other words, KKP are arguing that IF the DA shift is made THEN
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; another shift (the SIA shift??) should also be made.  I do not see that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the arguments presented by Bostrom about the SIA address this cleanly.
</em><br />
<br />Whether the DA shift should eb made depends on whether you happen to 
<br />
know your birth rank, but the correctness of the SIA as a principle 
<br />
doesn't hinge on that.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bostrom also wrote:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Moreover, if we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;reject an inference of the DA type, as many of us are inclined to do,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;then we must also abstain from applying the SIA: we should either
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;apply both considerations or none.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;There is nothing deep or very subtle
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;about this. Either you cross the street or you stay on the pavement,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;and in both cases you will be safe; but if you stop midway you'll get
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;run over by a bus.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This appears to be quite consistent with the argument presented in KKP.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thus if Leslie's *conclusion* is to be accepted, then the DArg shift
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; must be made
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; while the SIArg shift is not made.  And this is just what Bostrom has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; called stopping midway, and which he would, from the previous quote,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seem to reject.
</em><br />
<br />Actually, the quote is from a passage where my objective is to spell 
<br />
out this objection to the DA in its strongest form.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  But he has also written in bold letters &quot;The Doomsday
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Argument is Alive and Kicking&quot;, and he stimulated this post by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; commenting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the SIAssumption was problematic, so I would not hazard to guess
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; his writings how he might stand on Leslie's conclusion.
</em><br />
<br />I find it useful to separate Leslie's conclusion from his argument. 
<br />
Even if the DA is correct, it need not mean that intelligent life 
<br />
will probably go extinct soon. Some of the applicability conditions 
<br />
of the DA might not be fully satisfied, e.g. if there are lots of 
<br />
extraterrestrials, or if humans evolve into posthumans which might 
<br />
arguably belong to a different reference class (I'm not sure about 
<br />
that), or if there are infinitely many observers, in which case it is 
<br />
not clear what conclusion to draw. 
<br />
<br />Nowadays I do tend to think that at least in its pure form, the DA is 
<br />
very hard to reject. It is more difficult to say how it applies to 
<br />
the real world, but I think it does place interesting constraints on 
<br />
what may count as plausible future scenarios.
