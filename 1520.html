<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; 	Here your misunderstanding is clearly exposed.  The way I've
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; defined p(A), it is the effective probability of an observation-moment
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; with the property 'A'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Oh dear - and I thought we were debating whether the RSSA is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; consistent with Bayesian statistics. Now you revert to the ASSA, which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I quite accept is consistent.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	This debate started when you claimed that the RSSA is needed.  I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have been trying to show you that it isn't.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	I note that you have oscillated between saying that the RSSA is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; special case of the ASSA, and (as above) saying (or implying) that they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are quite distinct.  Part of the blame no doubt lies with me because at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certain times I have been sloppy in my use of the term 'measure'.  However
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that was a while ago.
</em><br />
<br />No - I have never said that RSSA is a special case of ASSA. I may have
<br />
said that the ASSA is equivalent to measure theory on 3rd person
<br />
observations - if so then this is a lapse on my part - the second
<br />
&quot;S&quot; in ASSA stands for &quot;self&quot; - ie the ASSA is about 1st person
<br />
observations, and the explicit assumption with the ASSA is that 1st
<br />
person observations are indestinguishable from the 3rd person.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	To try to clear up any confusion, let me state what I see as the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distinction.  In the ASSA, the effective probability of an observer-moment
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is proportional to it measure; the measure must be determined by some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical or mathematical 'reality' + some proceedure to map that to a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure distribution.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	In my view I expect the measure to be proportional to the number
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of implementations of a computation.   In QM it is (the absolute
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; square of the amplitude of a wavefunction) x (the number of copies of that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer in that branch), but this should be derivable from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; former rule.
</em><br />
<br />I do not take issue with measure of 3rd person observations being well
<br />
defined (indeed as you are fond to point out, it is simply related to
<br />
the L_2 norm of the projected state in QM), merely that there may be a
<br />
problem with the measure of an observer moment as normally conceived
<br />
in MWI.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	RSSA: there seem to be two versions of it.  The following is my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attempt to describe what my impression is; no doubt those who actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; give the RSSA some respect may wish to clarify it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	1) A special case of the ASSA as defined above, but in which the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure distribution is not merely proportional to the number of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implementations.  Rather, there is some kind of hidden variables that link
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a set of implementations over time and give rise to an objective &quot;identity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; function&quot; that seperates them into various sets called &quot;identities&quot;; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure of an observation A is proportional to the sum over identities i
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and over time t of [(# implementations for A in identity i at time t) /
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (total # of implementations in identity i at time t)] x
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [some constant C_i associated with identity i]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	or 2) There are &quot;identities&quot; as above, but unlike in the ASSA,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only &quot;relative probabilities&quot; for observation A at t, given that B was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observerved within that identity at t', can be calculated.  Questions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about other quantities are not addressed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />Obviously 1) is a complete misunderstanding. 2) is rather obscurely
<br />
put.
<br />
<br />I accept 3rd person probability statements without issue : 
<br />
<br />Given that I observe myself to be the &quot;identity&quot; Russell Standish
<br />
<br />1) I will/have observe(d) the charge of an electron as e\pm whatever
<br />
2) I will/have observe(d) Jacques Mallah aged 35
<br />
3) I will/have observe(d) Russell Standish aged 35
<br />
<br />Statements 1) and 2) are 3rd person observations, and some estimates of
<br />
their probabilities can be calculated from things like mortality
<br />
curves of humans living in the USA etc. 3) is a 1st person
<br />
observation, and is not directly acessible from a 3rd person theory
<br />
like QM. With the ASSA, an additional assumption is made that 1st
<br />
person probabilities are equal to the 3rd person, so one can simply
<br />
apply the 3rd person QM theory. I'm sure this is perfectly consistent,
<br />
although it also implies that Schroedinger's cat does experience its
<br />
death in the box (or equivalently that Max Tegmark experiences his
<br />
death in his suicide experiement), which most of us find counter
<br />
intuitive in the MWI picture.
<br />
<br />The RSSA predicts that what one observes next is related to the
<br />
relative measures of all observer moments accessible from the current
<br />
one (this is why the identity relationship is required). This is
<br />
certainly true of 3rd person statements, as all 3rd person
<br />
observations are accessible, and this then reverts to the normal
<br />
Schroedinger equation evolution. However, it differs substantially for
<br />
1st person observations, for example the probability of statement 3
<br />
occuring is exactly 1, and also the probability of observing one's own
<br />
death is precisely zero, in line with what most people in this expect
<br />
to see if they take the place of Schroedinger's cat.
<br />
<br />Bruno Marchal makes the claim that such 1st person statements are not
<br />
scientifically communicable. I'm not precisely sure what this means,
<br />
but it seems to have some bearing here.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	My view is that 1) is unneccessarily complicated, while 2) is also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; incomprehensible to me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; 	Definitions of identity, of 'me' or 'not me', are irrelevant to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; finding p(A).  By definition, if my current observation is A, and A and B
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; are such that it is not possible for the same observation-moment to have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; both, then I observe (not B).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; 	If you want to talk about the probability that, using some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; definition of identity that ties together many observation moments, &quot;I&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; will eventually observe Y1 - that will depend on the definition of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; identity.  It is NOT what I have been talking about, nor do I wish to talk
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; about it until you understand the much more basic concept of the measure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; of an observer-moment.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I have no problem with the concept of observer moment. It appears you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; have a problem with the concept of connecting up a set of such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; observer moments into an observer. One cannot discuss QTI or RSSA
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; without doing this.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	As I said, what I want to discuss is the measure of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer-moments.  I don't care if you &quot;connect them&quot; (as in RSSA-1
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; above) to do your calculations, as long as your final answer is about the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure I'm asking about.
</em><br />
<br />And I was discussing the effective probability of certain statements
<br />
(about observations) being true. These are only partially related to
<br />
the measure of the observer moments (only when the observer was
<br />
independent of the observer moment)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; In light of our previous discussions, p(X) was defined as the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; probability of being observer &quot;Jacques Mallah&quot;, not the probability of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; being observer &quot;Jacques Mallah&quot; at a particular observer moment.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	No!  I was careful that time to define it precisely.  What I said
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was it was the effective probability of a set of observations, i.e. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observation-moments, with that characteristic.  Observing that one is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Jacques Mallah is something I often do, but if you take some drugs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or have a bad dream or something, for a moment you might think you are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Jacques Mallah as well!  That moment is included in the set of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observations with characteristic 'X'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; There is an obvious normalisation problem with the usual model of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; branching histories in MWI (I see from your signature you at least
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; accept that!). Since the total number of histories (belonging to say a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; particular observer) is some exponentially growing function of time,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and extends indefinitely into the future, the total measure of an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; observer is unnormalisable, without some renormalisation applied at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; each &quot;timestep&quot; (which seems rather arbitrary - unless you've got some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; better ideas). Your measure argument, which is a variation of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Leslie-Carter Doomsday argument, implicitly relies on a normalised
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; measure distribution of observer moments. I seem to remember this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; normalisation problem was discussed earlier this year, but I'm not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; sure (without rereading large tracts of the archives)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	This has been discussed by others, but let me just say again,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is no such problem.  In QM, the total measure is given by the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; squared amplitude of the wavefunction, summed over the possible outcomes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; containing the observer; my belief is that this should be explained in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; terms of numbers of implementations of computations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />OK - clearly the measure of observer moments is vastly greatest in the
<br />
first few seconds of your life (since the measure is diluted according
<br />
to each &quot;split&quot; of the multiverse). If what you observe is related to
<br />
this measure, then surely we would all experience ourselves as being
<br />
babies. 
<br />
<br />This is true, unless one wanted to introduce some kind of ad-hoc
<br />
renormalisation over time (which personally I don't want to do, as I
<br />
believe absolute measure is simply irrelevant, only relative measure is).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Now, with RSSA, this normalisation problem is not an issue, as only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the relative measures between successive time steps is important, not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the overall measure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	'Time steps'?  As in RSSA-2, I just don't understand what you're
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; trying to say.
</em><br />
<br />I am using a discrete time picture here, just as you are by talking
<br />
about observer moments. I assume that this is either really the case,
<br />
or that one can recover the continuum by means of an appropriate limit.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; There is a more important reason why the ASSA is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; unbelievable. Basically, the ASSA implies that the first person view
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of the world is identical with the third person (the observer moment I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; am experiencing now is selected from precisely the same distribution
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; as other people's observer moments). There are many examples that show
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the opposite (eg Tegmark's suicide experiment, Marchal's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;KILL-THE-USER&quot; instruction) that are basically &quot;Schroedinger's cat as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; observer&quot; variants.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	Bullshit.  Tegmark's suicide experiment, for example, shows that
</em><br />
B&gt; when you try to commit suicide, your measure decreases (in the ASSA
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; without RSSA, or ASSA for short).  Of course, if you put the RSSA in by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hand the way Tegmark effectively did, you will get it back out again.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />Bullshit again. Measure is computed deterministically via the
<br />
Schroedinger regardless of whether one &quot;chooses&quot; to commit
<br />
suicide. Measure is an absolute quantity, belonging to the
<br />
deterministic domain of the multiverse. No amount of &quot;free will&quot; can
<br />
alter the evolution of state function.
