<br />
Been thinking about Bruno's often talked 1st person/3rd Person
<br />
division.  Had a series of insights that seem to connect up to some
<br />
ideas of my own.
<br />
<br />Essentially my idea resolves around 'coarse graining' and the
<br />
possibility that there is more than one valid way to define
<br />
causality.  On this and other lists I've often talked about the idea
<br />
that there is more than one sort of time and discussed ideas relating
<br />
to 3 dimensional time.  But it was just vague speculation.  Now my
<br />
early intuitions have crystallized somewhat.
<br />
<br />It seems to me that 'coarse graining' could provide a means for time
<br />
to 'stratify' into different levels.  Now let me elaborate a little.
<br />
Coarse graining is the 'level of detail' at which we observe reality.
<br />
If we observe reality 'with a magnifying glass' as it were, we see
<br />
lots of details.  As we 'zoom out' and observe more higher level
<br />
general features of reality, detailed information is lost.  The
<br />
question is: Is it really true that the higher level descriptions of
<br />
reality are completely *reducible* to the lower level descriptions of
<br />
reality?  (See for instance 'Non-reductive physicalism').  The idea
<br />
here is that 'the higher level' dsecriptions come about because of
<br />
coarse graining and that there are features of these higher level
<br />
descriptions that are not completely reducible to the lower level
<br />
descriptions.
<br />
<br />Now In UML (Unified Modelling Language), there seems to be an implicit
<br />
'stratification' into three different levels of description.
<br />
<br />The first level of description is the 'State Model' - here only the
<br />
most general (class level) properties of something are given.
<br />
<br />The second level of description is the 'Operational Model' - the
<br />
functional properties of a system are what the system is actually
<br />
doing externally. (ie the systems actions on the external world).  But
<br />
I noticed that this level of description involves more detail - the
<br />
'coarse graining' level has changed - we are 'zooming in' on the
<br />
details so to speak.
<br />
<br />Finally, the third level of description is the 'State Change Model' -
<br />
here we 'zoom in' on the internal details of the causal state changes
<br />
in the system.
<br />
<br />Big idea: these three levels of description in UML could correspond
<br />
directly to 'three different levels' in the real world - from which
<br />
could be derived three different definitions of time arising from
<br />
coarse graining!  In other words, time is stratified into three
<br />
different levels.
<br />
<br />Here they are:
<br />
<br />State Model time:    Evolution of the QM wave function: 'branching' of
<br />
MWI tree (high level)
<br />
Operational time:     Observer moments.  What a sentient observer sees
<br />
(mid level)
<br />
State-Change time:  Low-level physics time - computational time. (low
<br />
level)
<br />
<br />The idea is that it's this 'stratification' of time which creates the
<br />
1st person/3rd person division.  It comes about because there is more
<br />
than one valid way to define the flow of time! (causality).
<br />
<br />It seems that 1st person time flow corresponds to what I am here
<br />
calling 'Operational time'.  This is the level of observer moments.
<br />
Herein could lie the key to understanding consciousness.  You can see
<br />
from my scheme that 'Operational time' arises from a 'mid-level coarse
<br />
graining'.  We view reality at a higher level of description than
<br />
standard physics (low-level computational time).  When this happens,
<br />
information is lost and we no longer have detailed info on the
<br />
computations underlying our observer moments (because 'computation' is
<br />
defined on a lower level description of reality).  This could be the
<br />
ultimate cause of 1st person / 3rd person division.
<br />
<br />Anyone have any info on 'coarse graining'?
