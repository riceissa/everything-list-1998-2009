<br />I guess this comes down to the semantics of the word &quot;physics.&quot;  If you want
<br />
to define &quot;physics&quot; to exclude all complex systems besides turbulent fluids,
<br />
that's your right.  But I don't like your definition, personally.  What
<br />
about protein folding?  What about potential quantum effects in water
<br />
macromolecules in the brain?  What about bioelectromagnetic fields, as
<br />
studied by Russian researchers extensively over the last 50 years?  Etc.
<br />
etc. etc.  I feel like you're taking a whole lot of things that contemporary
<br />
physics can't deal with because of its conceptual shortcomings, and
<br />
classifying them as &quot;not physics&quot;, in order to make physics look more
<br />
successful than it is.
<br />
<br />Of course, physics has been dramatically successful in some areas, but let's
<br />
not overlook its weaknesses.  Quantum gravity is not the only area it's
<br />
tried and failed to touch.  And I have a suspicion that the same
<br />
mathematical/conceptual breakthrough that allows complex systems to be
<br />
rigorously studied, will also help with the quantum gravity problem.  This
<br />
suspicion is in line with the intuition of plenty of smart physicists,
<br />
including John Wheeler with his whole &quot;It From Bit&quot; concept (which portrays
<br />
physical law itself as the result of complex self-organization).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Funding is the key issue. Someday I'll write a thing for this list
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about successes vs. failures in terms of auto-funding each successive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stage of a complex technological path. In a nutshell, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; electronics/computer industry was essentially self-funding for the past
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 50 years, with the products of 1962, for example, paying for the work
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that led to the 1965 products. Same thing with aviation.
</em><br />
...
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is unlikely that the &quot;path to AI&quot; will be successful if there are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not numerous intermediate successes and ways to make a _lot_ of money.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My tip to all AI workers is to look for those things. (This is more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than just banal advice about &quot;try to make money,&quot; I am hoping. I have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seen too many tech enthusiasts clamoring for &quot;moon shots&quot; to fund what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they think is needed...))
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The &quot;&quot;AGI&quot; may come from the distant great-great grandchild of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; financial AI systems.
</em><br />
<br />I've worked on financial AI systems myself.  It's hard to argue with a
<br />
statement as loose as &quot;distant great-great grandchild&quot; ... but I think
<br />
financial AI is not on the shortest path to AGI right now.
<br />
<br />I agree that it's important for incremental progress toward AGI to be
<br />
financially viable, and in fact my own current work involves building toward
<br />
real AGI, partly via building bioinformatics applications (which ARE
<br />
financially viable in the short run).
<br />
<br />However, I also would point out that AGI research is different from many
<br />
other kinds of research, in that the primary research tools are very
<br />
inexpensively available.  All you need are computers.  yeah, you may need a
<br />
shitload of RAM, but it's a very different situation from other sciences:
<br />
you don't need a cyclotron, a chip fabrication plant, a microarrayer, a PCR
<br />
machine, etc. etc.  There is real potential for real progress to be made on
<br />
a shoestring.  Funding is valuable, but less critical than in a lot of other
<br />
areas.
<br />
<br />Fundamental physics has the same inexpensiveness, to an extent -- a
<br />
theoretical breakthrough could be made by a guy sitting alone in his attic
<br />
unfunded.  But to verify the currently fashionable theories requires
<br />
insanely expensive equipment, which is a real obstacle to progress -- a type
<br />
of obstacle that's not nearly so severe in AI right now.
