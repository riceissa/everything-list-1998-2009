It seems you've miscontrued my &quot;bashing&quot;, sorry about that. I was,

perhaps somewhat colourfully, meaning &quot;extracting some meaning&quot;. Since
<br />
your prose (and often Colin's for that matter) often sounds like
<br />
gibberish to me, I have to work at it, rather like bashing a lump of
<br />
metal with a hammer. Sometimes I succeed, but other times I just have
<br />
to give up.
<br />
<br />DN:
<br />
I do sympathise, truly!
<br />
<br />RS:
<br />
I most certainly didn't mean &quot;unwarranted critising of&quot;, or &quot;flaming&quot;. I am
<br />
interested in learning, and I don't immediately assume that you (or
<br />
anyone else for that matter) have nothing interesting to say.
<br />
<br />DN:
<br />
No, I've never thought you were 'flaming' and I genuinely appreciate any
<br />
time you take to respond.  I was only indicating the sort of response that
<br />
would most help the improvement of my thought process.
<br />
<br />RS:
<br />
Terminology is terminology, it doesn't have a point of view.
<br />
<br />DN:
<br />
This may be a nub of disagreement.  I'd be interested if you could clarify.
<br />
My characterisation of a narrative as '3-person' is when (ISTM) that it's an
<br />
abstraction from, or projection of, some 'situation' that is fundamentally
<br />
'participative'.  Do you disagree with this?
<br />
<br />By contrast, I've been struggling recently with language that engages
<br />
directly with 'participation'.  But this leads to your next point.....
<br />
<br />RS:
<br />
Terms
<br />
should have accepted meaning, unless we agree on a different meaning
<br />
for the purposes of discussion.
<br />
<br />DN:
<br />
But where there is no generally accepted meaning, or a disputed one, how can
<br />
we then proceed?  Hence my attempts at definition (which I hate BTW), and
<br />
which you find to be gibberish.  Is there a way out of this?
<br />
<br />BTW, when I read 'Theory of Nothing', which I find very cogent, ISTM that
<br />
virtually its entire focus is on aspects of a 'participatory' approach.  So
<br />
I'm more puzzled than ever why we're in disagreement.  I've really been
<br />
trying to say that points-of-view (or 'worlds') emerge from *structure*
<br />
defined somehow, and that (tautologically, surely) the 'primitives' of such
<br />
structure (in whatever theoretical terms we choose) must be capable of
<br />
'animating' such povs or worlds.  IOW povs are always 'takes' on the whole
<br />
situation, not inherent in individuated 'things'.
<br />
<br />RS:
<br />
2) Oxygen and hydrogen atoms as counterexamples of a chemical
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;potential that is not an electric field
<br />
<br />DN:
<br />
I certainly didn't mean to imply this!  I just meant that we seemed to be
<br />
counterposing 'abstracted' and 'participative' accounts, in the sense I
<br />
indicate above.  Something would really help me at this point: could I ask
<br />
how would you relate 'physical' levels of description you've used (e.g.
<br />
'oxygen and hydrogen atoms')  to the 'participative' approach of 'TON'?
<br />
IOW, how do these narratives converge on the range of phenomena to be
<br />
explained?

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Sometimes conversations on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the list feel more like talking past one another, and this in general
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; isn't 'a useful exercise'.  My comment to Brent was motivated by a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; perception that you'd been countering my 1-personal terminology with 3-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; person formalisms.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Terminology is terminology, it doesn't have a point of view. Terms

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Consequently, as such, they didn't strike me as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; equivalent, or as genuine 'counterexamples': this surprised me, in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Which counterexamples are you talking about?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) Biological evolution as a counterexample to Colin's assertion about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doing science implies consciousness. This started this thread.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) Oxygen and hydrogen atoms as counterexamples of a chemical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    potential that is not an electric field
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3) Was there something else? I can't quite recall now.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; view of some of the other ideas you've expressed.  So I may well have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; been too swift to assign certain motives to you, not having detected
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; any pedagogically-motivated intent to caricature, and I would welcome
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; your more specific clarification and correction.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I should say at this point that I too find the 'terminology' task very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; trying, as virtual any existing vocabulary comes freighted with pre-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; existing implications of the sort you have been exploiting in your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ripostes, but which I didn't intend.  I would welcome any superior
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; alternatives you might suggest.  Trying or not, I'm not quite ready to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; give up the attempt to clarify these ideas.  If you think the exercise
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; misconceived or poorly executed, it's of course up to you to choose to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'bash', satirise, or ignore it, but I would particularly welcome open-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ended questions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't recall satirising anything recently. It is true that I usually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ignore comments that don't make sense after a couple of minutes of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; staring at the phrase, unless really prodded like you did in your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recent post on attributing sensing to arbitrary interactions.
