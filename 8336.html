<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I disagree.  How can the worm apply a probability distribution over

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things that he knows nothing of, such as trees, people, and evolution?  
</em><br />
<br />The same way that we can reason about things we know nothing of, such
<br />
as blinkers, puffer trains, glider guns and other objects in Conway's
<br />
Life universe.  It is all a matter of pure logic.  In our case we
<br />
need computers to help us think clearly, but all of these objects are
<br />
implicit in mathematics and logic.  Trees, people and evolution are
<br />
equally implicit in their existence.  Mathematical/logical reasoning
<br />
will allow the worm to conceive of our universe, as well as all others.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Using the Wormopic Principle, when the worm proclaims that, &quot;The 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe is just complex enough to produce and sustain such a worm as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I, and the inside of an apple,&quot; how can he be meaning anything (in his 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; own mind, mind you, since explanatory power refers to being able to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explain the universe to him) that even remotely resembles our universe? 
</em><br />
<br />It is as I explained: the worm can conceive of all universes that might
<br />
include him and the apple, because they are all part of the multiverse.
<br />
And then the judgement about which universe is more complex may not come
<br />
out in the way you expect.  As I explained before, there is a sense in
<br />
which our universe may actually be simpler than one which consists of
<br />
just an apple and worm.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;   (As an aside, as much as we know about our universe, we totally cannot 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rule out the possibility that a worm that understands &quot;sufficient 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematics&quot; actually exists in our universe!)  Instead, even if he 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; developed the in-apple technology to explore quantum mechanics and DNA, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; he might come up with a quantum theory similar to ours (but who knows 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the probability of that?!!), but he would likely come up with a very 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; weird theory of how his DNA was formed, having nothing to do with how 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it actually was formed (according to our theories).
</em><br />
<br />We are assuming (or at least I am) a hypothetical worm who is very smart
<br />
indeed, one who is able to come up with all possible mathematical/logical/
<br />
computational systems and identify which ones are consistent with his
<br />
experiences.  Among those will be ones that have DNA and QM and all
<br />
the other aspects of our physics (or, whatever turns out to be the true
<br />
physics of our universe).
<br />
<br />Now, maybe there are mathematical systems that have worms
<br />
indistinguishable from him but without DNA, without QM, perhaps without
<br />
cells.  We might imagine a sort of cartoon of a worm and think that
<br />
such a simple sketch would be able to do everything the worm does,
<br />
without all the baggage of our universe.
<br />
<br />Yet on further thought it is clear that this cartoon worm is not logically
<br />
possible.  How does he think, how does his digestion operate, what are
<br />
the details about how he is able to move?  We will have to equip this worm
<br />
with organs, muscles, all the other biological components.  And then, how
<br />
do they work?  Why must he eat a certain amount, what about water and air?
<br />
By the time you explain all that in full detail, you will need something
<br />
with the complexity of our own biological systems.  I suspect you will
<br />
need the complexity of DNA.  And then, how does DNA work?  Won't that lead
<br />
to atoms?  Atoms are unstable without QM, so we need something like that.
<br />
And then, what are the atoms made of, and the sub-atomic particles?
<br />
<br />We don't know the answer to that last step yet, but presumably we will
<br />
find a way to get down to pure mathematics.  I suspect that a worm will
<br />
find his way there as well.
<br />
<br />The cartoon worm is a fantasy.  A worm who delves deeply enough will need
<br />
real physics, not just a gloss which skips over the hard details.
<br />
<br />And, to reiterate, if in fact there is a mathematical description of a
<br />
worm in an apple which is much simpler than our universe, and still is
<br />
consistent with the worm's experiences, then he is right to assume that is
<br />
where he lives.  Most worms will in fact live in such universes, and not
<br />
in ones like ours, if this turns out to be true (which I rather doubt).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You make a good point about the complexity of living things.  If you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ask biologists and other non-physics scientists about the Theories of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Everything, a lot of them would say that we're a long way from it.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Roger Trigg, University of Warwick, in his book, Rationality and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Science: Can Science Explain Everything?, makes this point.  Also, for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instance, the premier biologist Carl Woese, in his recent article, A 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; New Biology For A New Century, calls for biologists to get out of their 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; myopic pursuit of genetically breaking things down into the smallest 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; biological quantum, and to step back and look at the big picture, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; saying that there are whole levels of complexity that we will totally 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; miss if we don't, resulting in being totally disabled in being able to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explain everything in biology (to our satisfaction).
</em><br />
<br />I don't see the relevance.  Scientists of all stripes may find it useful
<br />
to work at higher or lower levels of abstraction.  That doesn't change
<br />
the fact that it must all be grounded somewhere.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I should make another point, that it seems very likely that the worm 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has no way of developing the in-apple technology to find out about 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quantum mechanics or DNA.  This emphasizes the fact that we, with our 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quantum theories, M-theories, and loop gravity etc. could be just as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; far away from explaining the universe as the worm is.
</em><br />
<br />It is true that we have created our physical theories based largely on
<br />
experimentation with devices that could hardly be constructed by a worm in
<br />
an apple.  Yet I think most physicists would agree that there is no real
<br />
alternative for describing even the ordinary, everyday universe based
<br />
on simpler theories.  As I described in the worm case, to really have a
<br />
theory of biology we need cells; and to have a theory of cells we need
<br />
atoms and molecules; and to have a theory of atoms and molecules we need
<br />
subatomic particles; and we still need a theory of subatomic particles.
<br />
<br />Even though historically it did not work this way, in principle I
<br />
believe that our common observations of the world are enough to deduce
<br />
the laws of physics.  At least, I am not aware of any alternative physics
<br />
which would work and explain the commonplace world in great detail and
<br />
precision, even if we leave out radioactivity and observations with
<br />
microscope and telescope.
<br />
<br />So contrary to Quentin's point about Plato's allegory of the cave, I
<br />
believe that even people in that situation, if they were intelligent
<br />
enough, would be able to deduce the nature of the universe they were
<br />
observing.
