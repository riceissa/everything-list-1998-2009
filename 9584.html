Bruno raises a lot of good points, but I will just focus on a couple
<br />
of them.
<br />
<br />The first notion that I am using in this analysis is the assumption that a
<br />
first-person stream of consciousness exists as a Platonic object.  My aim
<br />
is then to estimate the measure of such objects.  I don't know whether
<br />
people find this plausible or not, so I won't try to defend it yet.
<br />
<br />The second part, which I know is more controversial, is that it is
<br />
possible to represent this object as a bit string, or as some similar,
<br />
concrete representation.  I think there are a couple of challenges
<br />
here.  The first is how to turn something as amorphous and intangible
<br />
as consciousness into a concrete representation.  But I assume that
<br />
subsequent development of cognitive sciences will eventually give us a
<br />
good handle on this problem and allow us to diagram, graph and represent
<br />
streams of consciousness in a meaningful way.  As one direction to pursue,
<br />
we know that brain activity creates consciousness, hence a sufficiently
<br />
compressed representation of brain activity should be a reasonable
<br />
starting point as a representation of first-person experience.
<br />
<br />Another issue that many people have objected to is the role of time.
<br />
Consciousness, it is said, is a process, not a static structure such as
<br />
might be represented by a bit string.  IMO this can be dealt with by
<br />
interpreting the bit string as a multidimensional object, and treating
<br />
one of the dimensions as time.  See, for example, one of Wolfram's 1-D
<br />
cellular automaton outputs:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:CA_rule30s.png">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:CA_rule30s.png</a>
<br />
<br />We see something that can alternatively be interpreted as a pure bit
<br />
string; as a two-dimensional array of bits; or as a one-dimensional
<br />
bit string evolving in time.  In the same way we can capture temporal
<br />
evolution of consciousness by interpreting the bit string as having a
<br />
time dimension.
<br />
<br />An important point is that although there may be many alternative ways
<br />
and notations to represent consciousness, they should all be isomorphic,
<br />
and only a relatively short program should be necessary to map from one
<br />
to another.  Hence, the measure computed for all of these representations
<br />
will be about the same, and therefore it is meaningful to speak of this
<br />
as the measure of the experience as a platonic entity.
<br />
<br />Bruno also questioned my use of a physical universe in my analysis.
<br />
I am not assuming that physical universes exist as the basis of reality.
<br />
I only expressed the analysis in that form because we were given a
<br />
particular situation to analyze, and that situation was expressed as
<br />
events in a single universe.
<br />
<br />The Universal Dovetailer does not play a principle role in my analysis,
<br />
because it does not play such a role in Kolmogorov complexity.  At most,
<br />
the Universal Dovetailer can be used as a heuristic device to explain
<br />
what it might mean to &quot;run all computatations&quot; in order to explain
<br />
K complexity.
<br />
<br />I think one difference between K complexity and Bruno's reasoning with the
<br />
Universal Dovetailer is that the former focuses on sizes of programs while
<br />
Bruno seems to work more in terms of run time.  In the K complexity view,
<br />
the measure of an information object is (roughly) 1/2^L, where L is the
<br />
size of the shortest program which outputs that object.  Equivalently,
<br />
the measure of an information object is the fraction of all programs
<br />
which output that object, where programs are sampled uniformly from
<br />
all bit strings (or from whatever the input alphabet is for the UTM).
<br />
This does not have anything to do with run time.  Some bit patterns
<br />
may have short programs that take a very long run time to output them.
<br />
Such bit patterns are considered to have low complexity and high measure,
<br />
despite the long run time needed.
<br />
<br />I think Bruno has sometimes said that the Universal Dovetailer makes some
<br />
things have higher measure than others because they get more run time.
<br />
I'm not sure how this would work, but it is a difference from the
<br />
Kolmogorov complexity (aka Universal Distribution) view that I am using.
<br />
<br />Okay, those are some of the foundational questions and assumptions that
<br />
I think are raised by Bruno's analysis.  The rest of it goes through as
<br />
I have described many times.
<br />
<br />Hal
