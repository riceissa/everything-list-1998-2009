This is not the roadmap. I think aloud in case it helps (me or someone 
<br />
else).
<br />
<br /><br />Le 21-juil.-06, à 15:01, I wrote
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This can be made precise with the logics G&amp;Co, but for this I should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explain before the roadmap George has suggested (asap).
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />My problem. How much should I rely on Plotinus?
<br />
<br />When people asks me for a non technical version of my saying, Plotinus' 
<br />
Enneads are quite close to that. You should not take his examples 
<br />
literally, but only its logic and the difficulties he encouters.
<br />
I must think. Strictly speaking, math is what makes the explanation 
<br />
easier. In a nutshell I could perhaps try to put it in this way:
<br />
<br />One (among many) possible description of the comp ontology of a comp 
<br />
TOE, is just:
<br />
<br /><br />Classical logic +
<br />
the (recursive) definition of addition and multiplication.
<br />
<br /><br />This gives Robinson Arithmetic (RA), one of the weakest theory 
<br />
possible. RA can prove that 4 + 5 = 5 + 4, but is already unable to 
<br />
prove that this is true for any number n. RA cannot generalize.  It can 
<br />
prove that the sum of the first ten odd numbers 
<br />
1+3+5+7+9+11+13+15+17+19 = 10 * 10, but RA cannot prove that for any n 
<br />
the sum of the n first odd numbers gives always the perefct square n * 
<br />
n.
<br />
<br />Yet, RA has enough existential provability ability so as to be able to 
<br />
represent the partial recursive functions, and from a recursion 
<br />
theorist point of view RA can be seen as a universal machine, and RA's 
<br />
theorem codes the generation of a universal dovetailing.
<br />
(Technically RA is able to prove all true sigma-1 sentences, those 
<br />
which are like ExP(x) with P decidable).
<br />
<br />Now if I stop here, I would fall against a critic David Deutsch once 
<br />
made against Schmidhuber's &quot;computationalist view of everything&quot;. It 
<br />
would be quasi trivial.
<br />
<br />So I add an epistemology: this concerns what richer machine's can 
<br />
prove. Those richer machines are emulated all the time in the sequence 
<br />
of simple existential proposition proved by RA.
<br />
Then I do what Everett did for quantum mechanics: what can prove the 
<br />
lobian machine whos histories are generated by RA, or any DU, or just 
<br />
the sigma1 truth).
<br />
<br />(To understand this you need to understand the difference between 
<br />
computation or emulation,  and proof). Many people are wrong about 
<br />
this. For example the (very rich) theory ZF can prove that the (rich) 
<br />
theory PA is consistent. PA cannot prove that. But PA can prove that ZF 
<br />
can prove PA's consistency. The main reason fro that, is that the fact 
<br />
that you can emulate Hitler's brain (in platonia) does not entail you 
<br />
will get Hitler's belief. This can be related to Dennett and Hofstadter 
<br />
correct (assuming comp) rebutal of Searles in the book &quot;Mind's I&quot;.
<br />
Even RA can prove that ZF can prove that PA and RA are consistent! But 
<br />
RA and PA and ZF can hardly prove that they are respectively consistent 
<br />
(no theories which can talk about addition and multiplication can prove 
<br />
their own consistency, but richer lobian machine can prove many things 
<br />
on simpler lobian machine, including what is true about the simpler 
<br />
machine that the simpler machine cannot prove).
<br />
<br />The lobian machine, my epistemology, is thus richer than the TOE comp 
<br />
basic ontology (given by RA or the UD). A typical lobian machine is 
<br />
given by the theory (or its corresponding theorem prover program if you 
<br />
prefer) PA (Peano arithmetic). It is given by
<br />
<br />-Classical logic
<br />
-the (recursive) definitions of addition and multiplication
<br />
-The infinity of induction axioms  (read &quot;A&quot; &quot;for all&quot;) like
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[P(0) and An(P(n) -&gt; P(n+1))]   -&gt;   AnP(n)
<br />
<br />This provides PA with incredible introspective abilities, enough for 
<br />
enabling it to discover its limitations and the geometry of those 
<br />
limitations. and eventually to correctly infer, from the logic of 
<br />
provability (note the &quot;v)  the logic of &quot;probability&quot; (note the &quot;b&quot;) 
<br />
bearing on the collection of all their consistent extensions. And more.
<br />
At least enough for discovering two, and then 4, 8, 16, ... 
<br />
plotinian-like hypostases (person notions), including the one which 
<br />
justify matter, both in the UDA sense, and in the plotinian sense (a 
<br />
&quot;slight platonist correction of Aristotle theory of matter actually (I 
<br />
begun the reading of Aristotle at last).
<br />
<br />Note that the first primary hypostasis, truth, could aptly be called 
<br />
the zero person point of view. That could perhaps be related with 
<br />
Nagel's &quot;point of view of nowhere&quot;. It is really here that Plotinus 
<br />
contradicts the more Aristotle, which first hypostasis, seems to be a 
<br />
1-person, especially in the treatise (5.6) which has been abridged out 
<br />
in the pengwin paperbook Ennead (I guess a coincidence because that 
<br />
point is well explained in many other ennead's treatise, so it is 
<br />
normal to abridged this one for making possible to put the enneads in 
<br />
your pocket without demolishing the pants).
<br />
<br />I must think, the subject is difficult and goes over many disciplines,
<br />
<br />Bruno
