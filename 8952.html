<br />Here follows a copy of the remainder:
<br />
<br />...
<br />
Last but not least: this view has the advantage that we no
<br />
longer have to wonder how it comes that particles follows the
<br />
rules, how can a particle influence another particle and so on.
<br />
The situation reversed here too. There is no more necessary
<br />
magic involved.
<br />
<br />This is the last but one speculation. The last one is that our
<br />
thinking and consciousness emerge from the operation of matter
<br />
(that particles are empty or not). This one is more common even
<br />
if not widely accepted. It might be the more puzzling one.
<br />
What can be said about it is that what needs to be explained
<br />
is not physical existence but the perception of a physical
<br />
existence. This is (much) weaker and comes quite easily from
<br />
the combination of all the previously mentionned speculations.
<br />
Indeed what we perceive comes from the &quot;structures&quot; occuring
<br />
from the applications of the rules and the same rules simply
<br />
makes what we perceive appear as a physical reality.
<br />
<br />Finally, Stephen Hawking compeletely missed the point by asking
<br />
&quot;What is it that breathes fire into the equations and makes
<br />
a universe for them to describe?&quot;. He fooled himself just as
<br />
if he asked &quot;Who created the world?&quot;. Common sense can be very
<br />
hard to escape to. There is no need for anything/anybody to
<br />
breathe fire into the equations: the fire *is* in the equations.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2"> &gt; &gt; which then you want to assign to the numbers?
</em><br />
<br />I do not understand what you mean here.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2"> &gt; &gt; What I really asked: WHAT is the operator? without one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt; &gt; the numbers just 'sit there as numbers.
</em><br />
<br />Not soo sure. The natural numbers jsut sit there bu so do also
<br />
the addition and multiplication as operators from NxN into N.
<br />
So do also the Hilbert space with all the operations that makes
<br />
it an Hilbert space.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2"> &gt; &gt; Numbers do not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt; &gt; &quot;decide&quot; to add up or else themselves into complex
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt; &gt; constructs (including 'ourselves') Do they?
</em><br />
<br />Indeed they do not but who said they did or the needed to?
<br />
The addition operator may just sit there with the natural
<br />
numbers. The couple that contains the second and the first
<br />
also just sit there as a semi-group and so on. Nobody has
<br />
to do any operation for that. All the complex constructs
<br />
just sit there. The fact that we perceive them as constructs
<br />
is related to the way we think of them. We ca exhibit some
<br />
relations between them that appear to us as construction
<br />
processes but that does not mean that they need us to just
<br />
sit there all together.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev4"> &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; SKIP
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt; &gt; I feel that gap here:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4"> &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Finally, it might be that one of the (possibly very) complex
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4"> &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; objects in this world of numbers just happens to host us and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4"> &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; all that we see.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4"> &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; But do we need to actually believe in any of these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4"> &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; speculations?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt; &gt; I feel we have a discussion here. Do we just speculate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt; &gt; to entertain ourselves with unbelieved ideas, or some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt; &gt; of us take it seriously to speak about 'real' ideas?
</em><br />
<br />I asked the question but I did not intend to suggest that
<br />
the answer should be &quot;no&quot;. I find the above mentionned
<br />
speculations and the developments above them quite
<br />
entertaining. I am not sure that I am really willing to
<br />
believe into them but currently I did not find any better
<br />
alternative.
<br />
<br />Georges.
