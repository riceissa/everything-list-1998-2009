<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would be interested in reading the opinions of the participants
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about that point and about the sense that could be given to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; question of what &quot;happens&quot; (in the simulated universe) in any non-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; synchronous simulation &quot;when&quot; the simulation diverges ?
</em><br />
<br />I would expect that the situation would expand or inflate.
<br />
My general conjecture of time as a relative [temporant] instantiative
<br />
universal [state] constant is such that time is a singular relative
<br />
universal now instance, by which on one hand we have the physical time
<br />
constraints of the behaviours of matters in time space, and on the other
<br />
hand, we have the theory of motions, speed, light, 'measurable movements' /
<br />
instants of 'self' within time.
<br />
<br />Therefor, time is a universal constraint by which all matter now exists
<br />
within one singular [temporal] continuum of advancement by which only
<br />
relative internal state of [co] localized time based behaviours can be
<br />
established. The universe, while highly difficult to define spatially on an
<br />
infinite basis, can be explained quite sufficiently time wise in terms of a
<br />
temporant continual infinite, in which by infinite is actually the
<br />
cumulative maximum sum of 'time' avaliable in the universe by which motion,
<br />
from the atomic level to the intergalactic  level may occur within that
<br />
temporal now instance of being within 'this' universe. Therefor the entire
<br />
set of ratios of fixed temporal movements and maximum time sums would hold
<br />
as a fixed constraint network by which then the rationalizations of the
<br />
universe are defined. as opposed to looking for fixed spatial boundaries or
<br />
outer limits of matter based existence, one can suppose instead the fixed
<br />
temporant relation of all matter based particles by sum constraint constants
<br />
of [maximum] time [avaliability now] therefor the function of universal
<br />
boundary becoms instead a maximum probable set constituent of things going
<br />
be, or the 'futures' of temporant [interactive dynamic] interactions between
<br />
'fixed instants' of absolute now moments, by which then the 'set state' of
<br />
more+ probable instants are likely to occur. This function is highly
<br />
illogical, not due to some highly inpredicatble nature, but due to the
<br />
innability of applying formal logic to the probable predictions of future
<br />
event states of time, having not yet as happened in any [logically] relative
<br />
state.
<br />
It would therefor be digitally unviable to try and set the probabilistic
<br />
event states of temporal passage by means of any logical/binary
<br />
prescription. Even if you could mathematically explicate ALL of the
<br />
figurative interactions between all unversal instances now, the means by
<br />
which any universal algorythms could be symbolically connected to temporant
<br />
relations are not 'absolutely' digitally compatible. much like the argument
<br />
about 44khx cd's vrs. true analog records, one can assume that if there is
<br />
any skepticism at all on a sound frequency level alone, that this type of
<br />
'digital skewing' would no doubt, on a universally computational level,
<br />
render to enter 'analog conception' entirely temporantly inaccurate due to
<br />
the necessary digitalization [.: the finitization] of absolute [non finite]
<br />
temporant mathematical theory.
<br />
<br />Therefor, in conclusion to the the question of divergence above, I think
<br />
that one can necessarily assume that if indeed you believe you have in fact
<br />
protrayed the universe some how, algorythimically prcise to a digital
<br />
summation of absolute temporant events [universally now] you are in fact
<br />
already presenting a divergence within the basic process of synthesis by
<br />
which your very calculations/measurements are being made. The computer is
<br />
simply not capable of defining a temorally infinite universe in motion ,
<br />
continuously, [while being] while within it's own micro-measurable states //
<br />
digital [frequency] time flow are simply not sensitive enough to predict the
<br />
absolute natures of analog time flow without missing entire layers and
<br />
frquencies of temporant relation between EVERY space-time axis.
<br />
<br />in order to compute this properly, you would need 1 network computing the
<br />
actual values themselves on a specific matter frequency level [macro
<br />
instances] {i.e. the universe of matter[1-d time]} you would then need a
<br />
second network analyzing temporant molecular interactions of those macro
<br />
instances themselves. {i.e. the phsyio-cehmical instances of the matter
<br />
based universe[2-d time]}
<br />
you would then need a third network that analyzes the energy based frequency
<br />
interactions between the pysio chemical instances on a micro scale, and also
<br />
the matter based interactions on a macro level,[chemical-matter
<br />
ineraction{3-d time}], then converting those frequency changes over a period
<br />
of time into a set state of changed ratios, feeding those ratios into the
<br />
first network, such that it can now calculate a new state of set probable
<br />
eevents based on ALL [frequency] time changes in the universe at ALL moments
<br />
in time.
<br />
evidently, you then need a fourth network to calculate how the energy
<br />
freuqncy changes in the phsyio-chemical-matter based universe effect
<br />
electron-molecular states, thusly influencing the behavioural production of
<br />
muons and gluons and other state energy based transferances of time passage.
<br />
Much like the context of what happens when you take an object, and fold it
<br />
in half, and then in half again and then in half again,
<br />
each computer network would represent a digital selection of a
<br />
certatin/specific state by which [now universally] that state is either
<br />
remaining [sum digital 0] or now folding inwards [sum digital 1]
<br />
<br />So much like franks answer, it is already happening, I think we can assume
<br />
that if any 'imporbable' divergance occurs in any universal simulation, that
<br />
this is actually the very nature of the universe itself when digitally
<br />
computed. Therefor the most probable truth in this case would be to develop
<br />
a standby network which isolate divergences which could cause the algorythm
<br />
to end and isolte them [further] internally such that their divergent flow
<br />
patterns must through constraint then 'necessarily' follow the projections
<br />
of other
<br />
non-divergent processess.
<br />
<br />That's my theory on the subject anyway, but then again, most appropriately
<br />
stated, the universe bites the intergalactic muffin, so i guess it's mostly
<br />
just a cheese theory in the end anyway. cheers.

<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I start from a part of this post from David Barrett-Lennard (Mon,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3 Nov 2003 19:48:49) but I could probably hev selected several
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; similar other ones:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Given the &quot;source code&quot; for the simulation of our universe, it would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; seem to be possible to add some extra instructions that test for a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; certain condition to be met in order to tamper with the simulation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It would seem likely that there will exist simulations that match our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; own up to a certain point in time, but then diverge.  Eg it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; possible for a simulation to have a rule that an object will suddenly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; manifestitself at a particular time and place.  The simulated conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; beings in such a universe would be surprised to find that induction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; fails at the moment the simulation diverges.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It seems to me that there is a very strong assupmtion here which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is that there should be some synchronicity between the &quot;time&quot; in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; postulated computer into which the universe would be simulated and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the time inside that simulated universe (as this is typically the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; case when an electronic device is simulated).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But such an assumption not only does not seem necessary in any way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but it also does not seem possibly consistent (or it would be very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arbitrary at least) with a universe like ours for what we know of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the implications of general relativity (it does not seem possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to define any global time in any consistent way in our universe).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Many other way of simulating the universe could be considered like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for instance a 4D mesh (if we simplify by considering only general
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relativity; there is no reason for the approach not being possible in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an even more general way) representing a universe taken as a whole
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in its spatio-temporal aspect. The mesh would be refined at each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; iteration. The relation between the time in the computer and the time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the universe would not be a synchrony but a refinement of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; resolution of the time (and space) in the simulated universe as the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time in the computer increases.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Alternatively (though both views are not necessarily exclusive), one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could use a variational formulation instead of a partial derivative
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; formulation in order to describe/build the universe leading again to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a construction in which the time in the computer is not related at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all to the time in the simulated universe.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It seems to me finally that the simulations in which there is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; synchrony between the time in this universe and the time in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computer simulating it are very specific (if even existing) among
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all other possible simulations of the same universe (at least
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for the kind of relativistic universe we live in). I would even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conjecture that the measure of the set of synchronous simulations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is null within the set of all possible simulations of a given (not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so trivial) universe (if one can give a sound sense to this).
