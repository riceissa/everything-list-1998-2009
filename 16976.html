<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Let me restate by introducing a &quot;definition&quot; (made precise later). The  
<br />
cardinal of a set S is the number of elements in the set S.
<br />
<br />The cardinal of { } = 0. All singletons have cardinal one. All pairs,  
<br />
or doubletons, have cardinal two.
<br />
<br />Problem 01 has been solved. They have the same cardinal, or if you  
<br />
prefer, they have the same number of elements. The set of all subsets  
<br />
of a set with n elements has the same number of elements than the set  
<br />
of all strings of length n.
<br />
<br />Let us write  B_n for the sets of binary strings of length n. So,
<br />
<br />B_0 = { }
<br />
B_1 = {0, 1}
<br />
B_2 = {00, 01, 10, 11}
<br />
B_3 = {000, 010, 100, 110, 001, 011, 101, 111}
<br />
<br />We have seen, without counting, that the cardinal of the powerset of a  
<br />
set with cardinal n is the same as the cardinal of B_n.
<br />
<br />And then we have seen that such cardinal was given by 2^n.
<br />
You can see this directly by seeing that adding an element in a set,  
<br />
double the number of subset, due to the dichotomic choice in creating  
<br />
a subset &quot;placing or not placing&quot; the new element in the subset.
<br />
Likewise with the strings. If you have already all strings of length  
<br />
n, you get all the strings of length n+1, by doubling them and adding  
<br />
zero or one correspondingly.
<br />
This is also illustrated by the iterated self-duplication W, M. Mister  
<br />
X is cut and paste in two rooms containing each a box, in which there  
<br />
is a paper with zero on it, in room W, and 1 on it in room M. After  
<br />
the experience, the 'Mister X' coming out from room W wrote 00 in his  
<br />
diary, and the 'Mister X' coming out from room M wrote 1 in his diary.  
<br />
And then they redo each, the experiment. The Mister-X with-0-in-his- 
<br />
diary redoes it, and gives a Mister-X with-0-in-his-diary coming out  
<br />
from room W, and adding 0 in its diary and a  Mister-X with-0-in-his- 
<br />
diary coming out from room M, adding 1 in its diary: they have the  
<br />
stories
<br />
<br />00
<br />
<br />01,
<br />
<br />and then the Mister-X-coming-from room W, and with 1 written in the  
<br />
diary, similarly redoes the experiment, and this gives two more  
<br />
Misters X, having written in their diaries
<br />
<br />10
<br />
<br />11.
<br />
<br />Obviously the iteration of the self-duplication, gives as result  
<br />
2x2x2x2x...x2 number of Mister X. If those four Mister X duplicate  
<br />
again, there will be 08 of them, with each of those guys having an  
<br />
element of B_3 written in his diary. OK.
<br />
<br />And we have seen that a powerset of a set with n elements can but put  
<br />
in a nice correspondence with B_n.
<br />
<br />For example: The powerset of {a, b}, that is {{ }, {a}, {b}, {a, b}},  
<br />
has the following nice correspondence
<br />
<br />00 .............. { }
<br />
01 .............. {a}
<br />
10 ...............{b}
<br />
11 ...............{a, b}
<br />
<br />Each 0 and 1 corresponding to the answer to the yes/no questions 'is a  
<br />
in the subset?', is 'b in the subset?'.
<br />
<br />Such a nice correspondence between two sets is called a BIJECTION, and  
<br />
will be defined later. What we have seen, thus, is that there is a  
<br />
bijection between the powerset of set with n elements, and the set of  
<br />
binary strings B_n.
<br />
<br />And the second question?
<br />
<br />What is common between the subsets of N, and the set of infinite  
<br />
binary sequences. An infinite binary sequence is a infinite sequences  
<br />
of &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot;.
<br />
For example: 00000000000..., with only zero is such a sequence. It  
<br />
could be the first person story of 'the mister X who comes always from  
<br />
room W. Or, if the zero and one represents the result of the fair coin  
<br />
throw experiment, it could be the result of the infinitely unlucky  
<br />
guy: he always get the head.
<br />
Another one quite similar is 1111111111111111111111111111..., the  
<br />
infinitely lucky guy.
<br />
A more 'typical' would be 1100100100001111110110101010001000...  
<br />
(except that this very one *is* typical, it is PI written in binary;  
<br />
PI = 11. 00100...).
<br />
<br />The link with the subsets of N? It is really the same as above, except  
<br />
that we extend the idea on the infinite.
<br />
<br />A subset of N, that is, a set included in N,  is entirely determined  
<br />
by the answer to the following questions:
<br />
<br />Is 0 in the subset?
<br />
Is 1 in the subset?
<br />
Is 02 in the subset?
<br />
Is 03 in the subset?
<br />
etc.
<br />
<br />You will tell me that nobody can answer an infinity of questions. I  
<br />
will answer that in many situation we can.
<br />
<br />Let us take a simple subset of N, the set {3, 4, 7}. It seems to me we  
<br />
can answer to the infinite set of corresponding question:
<br />
<br />Is 0 in the subset?    NO
<br />
Is 1 in the subset?    NO
<br />
Is 2 in the subset?  NO
<br />
Is 3 in the subset?   YES
<br />
Is 04 in the subset?    YES
<br />
Is 05 in the subset?    NO
<br />
Is 06 in the subset?   NO
<br />
Is 07 in the subset?   YES
<br />
Is 8 in the subset?   NO
<br />
Is 09 in the subset?    NO
<br />
Is 10 in the subset?    NO
<br />
Is 11 in the subset?   NO
<br />
Is 12 in the subset?    NO
<br />
Is 13 in the subset?    NO
<br />
Is 14 in the subset?  NO
<br />
... (etc. and we answer NO for all remaining questions ...!)
<br />
<br />So, in the same spirit as above we associate the infinite binary  
<br />
string 000110010000000000000000... to the subset {3, 4, 7}.
<br />
<br />Even simpler: the empty set. First, is the empty set a subset of N?But  
<br />
we have seen that to verify if the empty set is a subset of any set,  
<br />
we have 0 verification to do: the empty set is included in any set. It  
<br />
correspond here to
<br />
<br />Is 0 in the subset?    NO
<br />
Is 1 in the subset?    NO
<br />
Is 2 in the subset?  NO
<br />
Is 3 in the subset?   NO
<br />
Is 4 in the subset?   NO
<br />
Is 5 in the subset?    NO
<br />
Is 6 in the subset?   NO
<br />
Is 7 in the subset?   NO
<br />
Is 8 in the subset?   NO
<br />
Is 9 in the subset?    NO
<br />
Is 10 in the subset?    NO
<br />
Is 11 in the subset?   NO
<br />
Is 12 in the subset?    NO
<br />
Is 13 in the subset?    NO
<br />
Is 14 in the subset?  NO
<br />
... (and we answer NO for all remaining questions ...!)
<br />
<br />the empty set, seen as a subset of N, is determined by the sequence:
<br />
<br />000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 ...
<br />
<br />All singleton of number, like {0}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, {5}, ...
<br />
<br />will have the following &quot;characteristic&quot; sequences:
<br />
<br />{0} ---- 1000000000000000...
<br />
{1} ---- 0100000000000000...
<br />
{2} ---- 001000000000000..
<br />
etc.
<br />
<br />Doubleton will have characteristic sequences being strings having two  
<br />
occurences of 1, and thus an infinity of zero.
<br />
<br />OK, for finite set, there is a time where all answers become &quot;NO&quot;.
<br />
But what about infinite sets? Can we still answer the infinity of  
<br />
question?
<br />
<br />Of course, at least for &quot;simple&quot; infinite sets.
<br />
<br />First, do we know infinite subset of N? yes, example the set of odd  
<br />
numbers. {1, 3, 5, ...} is included in {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}.
<br />
<br />What is its characteristic sequences, that is the answer to the  
<br />
questions: is 0 in?, is 1in?, is 2 in?,  ...
<br />
<br /><br />Is 0 in the subset?    NO
<br />
Is 1 in the subset?    YES
<br />
Is 2 in the subset?  NO
<br />
Is 3 in the subset?   YES
<br />
Is 4 in the subset?   NO
<br />
Is 5 in the subset?    YES
<br />
Is 6 in the subset?   NO
<br />
Is 7 in the subset?   YES
<br />
Is 8 in the subset?   NO
<br />
Is 9 in the subset?    YES
<br />
Is 10 in the subset?    NO
<br />
Is 11 in the subset?   YES
<br />
Is 12 in the subset?    NO
<br />
Is 13 in the subset?    YES
<br />
Is 14 in the subset?  NO
<br />
... (and we answer YES and NO in that way for all remaining  
<br />
questions ...!)
<br />
<br />So the set of odd numbers has the characteristic sequence:
<br />
<br />{1, 3, 5, ...} -----------  
<br />
010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010...
<br />
<br />and the even numbers:
<br />
<br />{0, 2, 4, 6, ...} ----------  
<br />
101010101010101010101010101010101010101010...
<br />
<br />And ... the prime numbers
<br />
<br />{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...} ------- 00110101000101000101000100000101...
<br />
<br />OK.
<br />
<br />Do you see that for EACH subset of N we have a corresponding infinite  
<br />
binary sequence, and for EACH binary sequence we have a subset.
<br />
<br />Exercise: gives the subset (= write some elements of the subset)  
<br />
corresponding o the sequence &quot;PI&quot;
<br />
<br />1100100100001111110110101010001000...
<br />
<br /><br /><br />The genius of Cantor has consisted in allowing himself the notion of  
<br />
&quot;nice correspondence&quot;, bijection, to infinite sets, including infinite  
<br />
sets of infinite objects, like the subset of N and the set B_infinity,  
<br />
that is the set of infinite binary strings.
<br />
<br />And here, I hope you have the feeling that indeed such a nice  
<br />
correspondence exists between the powerset of N, and B_infinity.
<br />
<br />I let you think, and ask some questions. Bijection will occupy us for  
<br />
awhile. Unfortunately, to make them precise, I have to define what we  
<br />
have already met a lot, but yet not define, and which is the notion of  
<br />
function.
<br />
Functions are utterly important because they define the crucial notion  
<br />
of mathematical dependency, on which eventually the mathematical  
<br />
notion of computation will be a very peculiar particular case.
