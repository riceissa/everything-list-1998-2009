<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From: &quot;Nick Bostrom&quot; &lt;nick.bostrom.domain.name.hidden&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Jacques Mallah wrote some time back:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;[see chapter 8 of <a href="http://www.anthropic-principle.com/phd/">http://www.anthropic-principle.com/phd/</a>]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;If he believes the MWI however, then he knows there is a branch
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;where a deer turns up and one where it doesn't.  He knows that for a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;usual day the effective probability of a deer turning up is about 1%.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Since he has no reason to believe the laws of nature are specially 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;configured to correlate the amplitude of the wavefunction's branches with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;his actions (especially since such correlation would be hard to reconcile 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with QM), he will still believe the effective probability of a deer turning 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;up is just 1%.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;You may be confusing subjective and objective probability.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;    Nope.  Why would you think I might do so?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Adam might have reason to think that the objective chance of Deer is 1%, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and nonetheless have reason assign a 90% (say) credence to Deer. Compare 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the situation to the case of a coin which has just been tossed in what you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;think is a fair manner; so you think there was a 50% chance of Heads. But 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;suppose you have cought a brief glimps of the coin after it landed, and it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;looked like Tails, although you aren't absolutely sure. So your subjective 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;credence may be 95%.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah no shit.  Of course I know about Bayesian probabilities.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You still haven't suggested any reason as to why you might have thought 
<br />
that I was confusing them.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember that effective probability is the fraction of observers, in a 
<br />
given situation, that see that outcome.  For QM this is equal to the sum of 
<br />
the squares of the amplitudes of those branches consistent with that 
<br />
outcome, as long as no observers are created or destroyed and the 
<br />
measurement is definitely made.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;    In both cases I have so far discussed, his Bayesian probaility
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;distribution for the objective probability is sharply peaked about &gt;a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(stochastic xor effective) probability of 1%.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;    A common way this might occur is if he has observed, over the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;course of 10 years (3652 days) that about 37 times a deer has turned up.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If he assumes that there is a fixed probability p, and initially has a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;uniform Bayesian distribution for p on (0,1), then his final distribution 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;will be sharply peaked about 1%.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;    The point, here, is that in such a case he *can't* suddenly assume 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;today is different, so while on a usual day p=.01, I'll just have a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;uniform Bayesian prior for p_today.&quot;, and then apply the &quot;Adam paradox&quot;.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So, in both the non-MWI and the MWI case, p~=.01 is his prior probability 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;before he considers his own situation regarding reproduction, but the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;effect of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;latter is different.  So far I think you agree with that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Yes, I think that's right so far. But prior probability is not the same as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;objective probability. If there is a wounded deer in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;neighborhood, then the objective chance may be quite high (say, 78%).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But Adam doesn't know whether there is such a deer in the neighboorhood, so 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;his subjective credence that the objective chance is that high, is low (say 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;0.1%). So he shouldn't think that a deer will turn up; that has a low prior 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probability. But when he forms the appropriate reproductive intentions, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;then (assuming SSA with a universal reference class), he obtain reason to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;think that the objective chance is actually quite high. This also results 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in his subjective credence in Deer increases.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's only without the MWI.  (i.e. True only for stochastic 
<br />
probabilities, not for effective probabilities.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;(Note that I'm talking about an objective chance here which varies from day 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to day, depending on what the deer in the region are up to. The more deer 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;nearby, the greater the objective physical chance that some will pass by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Adam's cave within a certain time interval.)
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the MWI, btw, there would be little such variation since one must sum 
<br />
over the branches desribing the various deer activities.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;If there are all these other fat branches in the world, then yes, I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;agree with that. However, Adam and Eve were there from the beginning, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;before there deer paths had begun to spread out much as a probability cloud 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;over the terrain. Or at least we can suppose they were - that's the nice 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;thing about thought experiments!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But it would be foolish of Adam to believe that.  Take his name, &gt;for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;example.  (Other examples are easily found.)  There are millions of other 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;names he could have had.  The laws of physics (or initial conditions) would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have to be set up in a very contrived way in order for the effective 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probability of just the one name for the first man, Adam, to be of order 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;one.  Of course, in the biblical story things are very contrived because 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;some guy (god) contrived it, and because this original guy was himself 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;unique to start with.  It's not a coincidence that such a situation is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;implausible, and even if it was true, only a fool would believe it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Let's suppose then that Adam was a fool in that respect. It's irrelevant to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the point of the gedanken. (Besides, I don't think Adam needs to have been 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that foolish, if we assume that he has had the right sorts of revelations 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;etc., and no exposure to other religions; in such cases, a reasonable man 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;might easily be led to believe in the christian God.)
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll have to disagree with you there, but that could get off topic.  
<br />
Sure, if Adam's a fool, he could come up with foolish conclusions.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;And I do find the premise that he can be certain that no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;type of MWI can be true hard to swallow.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;He wouldn't have to be certain about that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;    Well, he would certainly have to assign a ludicrously high
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;probability (e.g. 50%) to the idea that the MWI might be false.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;1. That is not ludicrous even today.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's a matter of opinion.  You know mine.  The majority may rule, but 
<br />
not because of collective intelligence.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;2. Adam might not know contemporary physics.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irrelevant.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;3. Adam would not have to assign a 50% probability to MWI being false; as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;long as there's some finite chance, one would get a shift in his posterior 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probabilty after forming the intention, and that is the point of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;gedanken.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There would be a very small shift, yes.  That's the way it should be.  
<br />
[I have previously stated that, in the hypothetical *absense* of the MWI, 
<br />
the *lack of* such a shift would be counterintuitive and ludicrous in my 
<br />
opinion.  So, to recap, I think the shift is a feature and not a flaw, but 
<br />
the MWI makes it go away.]  But I don't think anyone's intuition would 
<br />
protest against a very small shift.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;    As I see it, it is a priori possible that I could have been any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;observer.  Thus all observers must be included, by definition.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I find the &quot;I could have been you&quot; talk quite suspicious and murky. It's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not clear to me that this is the way to cast light on the situtation.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me try to enlighten you a little then.  Think of it like this: I 
<br />
know I'm an observer-moment (or thought, if you like); that much I can 
<br />
assume a priori.  Now I (or my brain, which is the computer actually 
<br />
carrying out the calculations, with observer-moments like me &quot;along for the 
<br />
ride&quot;) want to compare two possible models of the universe, so I need to 
<br />
calculate the Bayesian probability that each model is true.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In my view, first I must get the prior for this from Occam's razor, or 
<br />
&quot;exp(-complexity)&quot;; pretend for this exercise that it results in just two 
<br />
models with significant prior probability and that each of these is roughly 
<br />
50% likely a priori.  Even if you don't like that, in any case assume I have 
<br />
two competing models of equal a priori probability.  I can always just find 
<br />
the conditional Bayesian probability that model #1 is true given that either 
<br />
#1 or #2 is true; that's more or less what scientists traditionally do, 
<br />
since they neglect the simplest [AUH] models.)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For that I need to know the Bayesian probability that, if a given model 
<br />
is true, the other information that I take as known would also be true.  
<br />
This other information takes the form &quot;I see x&quot;.  Since
<br />
this is not used as a priori information, it will allow me to update my 
<br />
prior.  But I need the Bayesian probabilities that the information would be 
<br />
true if each model were true.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what is the Bayesian probability that I would see x if model #1 were 
<br />
true?  In order to get it, I do not first assume that I see x, since then I 
<br />
would get 1 and that's not what I need.  So the only information I assume is 
<br />
the a priori information, I am an observer-moment.  That is the only other 
<br />
thing I know about myself, other than the observation that I see x.  So if 
<br />
model #1 predicts the existance of N observer-moments, m of whom see x, I 
<br />
have no a priori reason to say that any of them is more likely to be me than 
<br />
the others.  So the Bayesian probability that &quot;I would see x&quot; if model #1 
<br />
were true is the effective probability, m / N.
