Dear CMR,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I honestly do not see where Jim's comments add anything cogent to the
<br />
discussion that was not covered in the Wolfram's article that I referenced
<br />
previously. :_( But I do appreciate that you brought it to my attention.
<br />
Please forward this post to Jim.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am trying to figure out is if it is possible to salvage some
<br />
aspects of the computation idea, for example most of Bruno Marchal's work on
<br />
1st and 3rd person aspects, and dovetail them into a &quot; our experiential
<br />
world is a simulation&quot; model. I think that this is possible but it requires
<br />
that the computations that are both &quot;ongoing&quot; (not one that is timelessly
<br />
preexisting like a &quot;Platonia&quot;), &quot;updatable&quot; and implemented in the quantum
<br />
mechanical realm itself. Of course this requires that we grant ontological
<br />
&quot;reality&quot; to wavefunctions and their attendant mathematical objects, such as
<br />
Hilbert spaces. ;-)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My idea is to identify the unitary evolution of the wavefunction itself
<br />
as the computation that is generating the simulation of the world. But
<br />
instead of trying to have a single computation simulating a single classical
<br />
world we have a potential infinite number of QM systems (Hitoshi Kitada's
<br />
Local systems www.kitada.com ) each generating a repertoire of simulations
<br />
of classical systems. BTW, in Kitada's theory the observers themselves are
<br />
taken to be the QM systems and their observations are classical, an
<br />
inversion of the treatment of observers and observables by the Copenhagen
<br />
interpretation.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The simulated classical systems are taken to be the possible worlds of
<br />
experience, similar to Barbour's &quot;time capsules&quot; but without any kind of
<br />
prespecified arrangement or &quot;best matching&quot; in an a priori sense. Think of
<br />
these simulated classical systems as finite &quot;patches&quot; of space-time with
<br />
particle trajectories, fields, etc. embedded in them and have some duration
<br />
or &quot;thickness in time&quot; associated; Qcomps have been shown (by D. Deutsch!!)
<br />
to be able to simulate not just static &quot;portraits&quot; of classical systems but
<br />
can simulate the dynamics and kinematics, movies instead of snapshots if you
<br />
will. ;-)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &quot;coordinating&quot; of the simulated worlds is another issue that I am
<br />
also working on using a generalization of the notion of periodic gossiping
<br />
over graphs. ;-)
<br />
<br />Kindest regards,
<br />
<br />Stephen

Subject: Is the universe compressable?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     The problem is that there is a large class of physical systems that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; not &quot;computable&quot; by TMs, i.e., they are &quot;intractable&quot;. Did you read the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Wolfram quote that I included in one of my posts? Please read the entire
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; article found here:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     Another way of thinking of this is to concider the Laplacean notion
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; where given the specification of the &quot;initial conditions&quot; and/or &quot;final
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; conditions&quot; of the universe that all of the kinematics and dynamics of
</em><br />
the
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; universe would be laid out. The modern incarnation of this is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; so-called 4D cube model of the universe.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  Again, these ideas only work for those who
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; are willing to completely ignore the facts of computational complexity
</em><br />
and
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the Heisenberg Uncertainty principle.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Stephen,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Am I correct that you're essentially saying that our universe is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; algorithmically incompressible? If so I would agree and, interestingly, so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does my friend Jim in a parallel thread I sparked from this very thread on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the infophysics list a week or so back; thought I'd post it because he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; represents the &quot;hard&quot; info physical view on this subject much  better than
</em><br />
I
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  From: &quot;Jim Whitescarver&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Subject: Re: [InfoPhysics] Fw: Is the universe computable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In so far as the universe is logical it can be modeled as a logical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information system.  The information nature of the quantum makes such a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; model convenient.  It seems surprising how closely nature obeys logic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; granting validity to science.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If we suppose that it is indeed logical and has no other constraints
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; outside that logic, we then find it is an incompressible computation, that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cannot be represented with fewer states.  The universe is computably as it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is a computer, but only a computer larger than the universe itself could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; model it.  In this sense, the universe is not technically computable in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; practical terms.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Intractability, however, is not exclusive of there existing good
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; solutions.  Unknowability is inherent in complex systems and we can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; capitalize on the the uniformity of the unknowable in the world of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; known.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Consider a pure entropy source, e.g. a stationary uncharged black hole.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It effective eats all the information that falls in irretrievably
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; randomizing it into the distant future.  It is not that systems falling in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stop behaving determistically, it is that we no longer care what their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; state is effectively randomized and outside our window of observation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Nothing in our world covaries with what happens inside the black hole but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we know that there would be correlations due to the determinism that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exists independently on the inside and the outside.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am not saying we can compute all of this.  What happens at any point is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the result of the entire universe acting at that point at this instant.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Clearly this is not knowable.  Causes are clearly not locally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deterministic.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But we can represent the black hole as a single integer, its mass in Plank
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; action equivalents.  From this all it's relevant properties to our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perspective are known in spite of however complex it is internally.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; All participants, modeled as information systems, are entropy sources like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; black holes, but we get samplings of their internal state suggesting a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; finite state nature and deterministic behavior.  The distinction is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whether we can determine what that deterministic systems is or not.  We
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cannot without communicating with all the participants and that is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; always possible.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But given a set of perspectives, there is no limit to how closely we can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; model them.  Where no model works randomness may be substituted and often
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we will get good, if not perfect, results.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Even legacy quantum mechanics, misguidedly based on randomness, yields
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deterministic results for quantum interactions shown accurate to many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dozens of decimal places.  This suggests that simple deterministic models
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will most likely be found.
