Eugen said...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I was using a specific natural number (a 512 bit integer) as an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; example for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; creation and destruction of a specific integer (an instance of a class of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; integers). No more, no less.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />That's plenty to bring out our difference of opinion.  cf &quot;creation and
<br />
destruction of a specific integer&quot;
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Existence of a specific integer has nothing to do with existence of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; production system for a class of integers. The recipe for a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; series is not the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dish itself. That recipe is also just information, requiring encoding in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; material carrier. It would have taken considerably more work to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; eradicate the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entire production system, as it is a bit more widespread, and has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a lot more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; vested interest than conservation of a specific, random integer, destilled
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from turbulent gas flow.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />You say &quot;a class of integers&quot;.  Does this mean you don't believe the
<br />
integers are unique?  I guess this is consistent with a non-platonist.
<br />
However, from the Peano axioms it can be shown that the integers are unique
<br />
up to isomorphism.  Does the concept of &quot;uniqueness up to isomorphism&quot; seem
<br />
useful or important to you?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The representation (hex, need to be told that above hex string
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; represents an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; integer (ignoring underlying representations as two's complements,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; potentials, charge buckets and magnetic domains for the moment) indicates
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that even that &quot;simple&quot; information transfer was encrusted with lots of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implicit context people take for granted. Roll back to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sumer, and hand out little clay tablets with that hex string. What does it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mean? Nothing. Not even the alphabet to parse this exists.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Animals evolve representations for quantities, because resource
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; management is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a critical survival skill. After a few iterations you get consensual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; encodings for interactive transfer, then noninteractive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consensual encodings.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I used patterns of luminous pixels (translated into Braille dots,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for all what I know)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instead of scratches on a bone fragent, because that encoding is more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; familiar, and easier to transmit.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Wavefront reemitted from pebbles hitting retina, being processed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on the fly,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tranformed into a spatiotemporal electrochemical activity pattern is an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instance of a measurement of a property. It takes a specific class of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; detectors to do. You cannot conduct that measurement in their absence.
</em><br />
<br />The platonist interpretation of the above is simply that context is needed
<br />
to relate a given sentence (of symbols) back to the Platonic realm.  Note
<br />
that the Platonic realm is *not* itself merely a bunch of sentences.  It
<br />
comes with semantics!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You say the given integer exists because &quot;it is it is physically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; realizable *in principle*&quot;.  That sounds like the platonic view to me -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To me, this sounds like a confusion between a specific integer,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and a recipe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for such. It is quite difficult to feed a wedding throng with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pages from a cookbook.
</em><br />
<br />I can't work out what you are saying!  You use terms like &quot;specific integer&quot;
<br />
and I've got no idea what you mean because you don't believe concepts exist
<br />
independently of &quot;their production systems&quot;.
<br />
<br />The integers are an example of a concept that is *decoupled* from specific
<br />
instances - by definition.  A great deal of our thinking and language
<br />
involves generalisation.  For example the word &quot;chair&quot; is associated with a
<br />
class of objects.  You use generalisation in your sentences as much as
<br />
anyone else.  Your lines of reasoning treat these abstractions as &quot;things&quot;
<br />
that can be manipulated - such as when I say &quot;the boy kicked the ball&quot; and
<br />
you form an image in your mind - even though the sentence involves
<br />
generalisations such as &quot;boy&quot; and &quot;ball&quot;.
<br />
<br />I presume your refutation (as a non-platonist) is that concepts only exist
<br />
while someone (or something) is there to think them.  The problem with that
<br />
view is that many useful lines of reasoning involve the question &quot;Does there
<br />
exist a concept x such that p(x)&quot; without instantiating x.  In other words,
<br />
it seems to be useful to conceptualise over the space of all possible
<br />
concepts.  This is exactly what happens when we generalise specific integers
<br />
to the infinite set of all integers.  I don't see how the non-platonist can
<br />
accept any lines of reasoning that involve the set of integers because it is
<br />
impossible to conceptualise every member of the set which (to them) would
<br />
imply that the set doesn't exist.
<br />
<br />You agreed before with the hypothesis that a computer could exhibit
<br />
awareness.  Suppose we have (say on optical disk) a program and we have a
<br />
computer on which we can run the program,  but we haven't run the program
<br />
yet.  We can a-priori ask the question &quot;On the computer monitor, will we see
<br />
a simulated person laugh?&quot;.  Do you believe this a-priori question has an
<br />
a-priori answer?  After all, there is nothing mystical in a deterministic
<br />
computation.  If so doesn't that mean that the simulated person exists
<br />
independently of running the actual simulation?
<br />
<br />In fact, if we postulate that our universe is computable, then the question
<br />
&quot;Does there exist a person who laughs&quot; on the universal dove-tailer program
<br />
can be answered a-priori in the affirmative.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; because the number is *not* actually physically realized and yet the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; number is purported to have an independent existence.  Are you saying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; otherwise?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I think any form of symbolic manipulation of numbers is implicitly using
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the platonic view.  To say they spring into existence as they are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; written down (which in any case only means they are realizable in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Numbers don't write down themselves. Systems generate them, translate them
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; into specific encodings, to be parsed by other instances of systems of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; same class. Use a system of a different class, and you'll only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; parse garbage.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ATGATAGTGGCCGTCCAACGGTAGACTCTAC might be a number, it might also be a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shorthand for a linear biopolymer (5'-3'? there's some implicit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; context for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you).
</em><br />
<br />Naturally a sentence needs to be interpreted in context.  I still believe my
<br />
point applies.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; principle) just seems silly to me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A cookbook is a promise of a meal, not the meal itself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The Platonic view just says that every mathematical system free from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; contradiction exists.  Ie if it can exist then it does exist.  There is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Exists where? Two production systems of the same kind generate the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; output. Surely, the output is contained within them? In there, somewhere?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mathematicians are production systems. Input is coffee, output is theorem.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; no need to talk about different types of reality.
</em><br />
<br />Concepts don't exist is some &quot;place&quot; in the Platonic viewpoint.  They just
<br />
&quot;are&quot;.
