<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Now an observer will expect to find a SAS in one of the descriptions

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; as a corrolory of the anthropic principle, which is explicitly stated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; as one of the assumptions in this work. I make no bones about this - I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; consider the anthropic principle a mystery, not self-evident like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; many people.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Very few supporters of the AP would &quot;expect to find a SAS&quot; in a bitstring.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Until you *specify* a way of interpreting the string, it contains nothing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; but bits.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The observer specifies the interpretation.
</em><br />
<br />But the observer is *generated* by the interpretation! Until you have an 
<br />
interpretation, you have no observers. And until you have an observer, you 
<br />
have no interpretation (at least that's how I read the sentence quoted 
<br />
above).
<br />
<br />How can structures which exist as some sort of pattern inside a bit string 
<br />
(or am I supposed to say in the &quot;meaning&quot; integer output by some (other) 
<br />
O(x)?) read a separate bitstring which exists as a parallel universe in 
<br />
Platonia?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Why should an observer expect to see a token of erself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; embedded in reality? That is the mystery of the AP.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; What ARE you talking about?  Observer's don't see tokens of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; themselves...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I can see that I have a body - if I look in the mirror I can see a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; face, eye etc, all of which appear to be under my control. This is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; token embedded in my reality that represents me.
</em><br />
<br />So you find it a mystery that you have a face, eye etc??  If so, what does 
<br />
the AP have to do with this mystery? Actually, maybe it would clarify 
<br />
things if you said what you mean by the AP; it certainly doesn't seem to 
<br />
be very like the AP that I know about.
<br />
<br />I'm not sure whether your &quot;my reality&quot; refers to the external world or 
<br />
your internal representation of it. I guess the latter, otherwise your 
<br />
body would be you, not a token representing you.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; In particular, any bitstring can be &quot;interpreted&quot; as any other bitstring
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; by an appropriate map. Hence until you specify an interpreter you are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; simply not proposing a theory at all.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The observer _is_ the interpreter. There may well be more than one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer in the picture, but they'd better agree!
</em><br />
<br />Why does this follow? Your &quot;observers&quot; are maps O(x) from prefix strings 
<br />
to the integers. Why can't you have two inconsistent maps... or rather, 
<br />
how can you possibly avoid such?  And since two different maps don't 
<br />
interact at all (how can a mapping interact with another mapping?) each of 
<br />
your observers seems to be sealed in his own little universe. In which 
<br />
case having &gt;1 observer appears to be an unverifiable speculation, which 
<br />
is why I say it seems like solipsism.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &lt;snip&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; All that is discussed in this paper is appearances - we only try to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; explain the phenomenon (things as they appear). No attempt is made to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; explain the noumenon (things as they are), nor do we need to assume
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; that there is a noumenon.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Most readers of your paper would take it that you are making a strong
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ontological proposition, i.e. that the basis of reality is your set of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; bitstrings.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is the case.
</em><br />
<br />Well, if you are making an ontological proposition, you are ipso facto not 
<br />
just explaining appearances. In your model your &quot;bitstrings&quot; *are* the 
<br />
noumenon (in Kant's terminology).  Kant's point was that you can't infer 
<br />
the nature of &quot;things in themselves&quot; from observation. He didn't say that 
<br />
you can't speculate about their nature, and even guess right, by chance. 
<br />
In effect, this mailing list discusses nothing but the nature of the 
<br />
noumenon. (Kant would probably say this is a waste of time, of course).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I think either your terminology or you model has now got very confused.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Are your &quot;observer&quot; TMs the observers (SAS) whose experiences your theory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is trying to explain?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; In this case &quot;where they live&quot; is crucial because it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; defines the environment the SAS find themselves in.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why?
</em><br />
<br />An intelligent system is &quot;intelligent&quot; by virtue of the way it interacts 
<br />
with its environment. Think about the Turing test again: we conclude that 
<br />
the computer is (not) intelligent because of the way it interacts with us. 
<br />
To put it another way, you define these things as &quot;observers&quot;. This 
<br />
implies something observed. Obviously your model had better account for 
<br />
people (observers) like us observing something like the world we see 
<br />
(&quot;where we live&quot;), and preferably interacting with other people who are 
<br />
granted equal status your ontology.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is not solipsism, if only for the reason that multiple observers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exist in our observed reality. They are all as real as our own consciousness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno Marchal calls this &quot;shared dreaming&quot;. It seems apt.
</em><br />
<br />If that's the *only* reason it's not solipsism, then I would say you just 
<br />
don't have the courage of your convictions. Bruno's &quot;shared dreaming&quot; 
<br />
sounds very like Leibniz's pre-established harmony, but that only works if 
<br />
you believe in a provident deity (if it ever worked for anyone but 
<br />
Leibniz!).
<br />
<br />The acid test is this: Can your observers exchange information with each 
<br />
other, and if so what is the data channel?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Or are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; your &quot;observers&quot; the missing &quot;interpreters&quot; in your theory which give it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; meaning, and allow us to find (in principle) the SAS within the bitstrings
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that represent actual observers like us?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes. I wasn't aware of them being missing though. Where did you find
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them? :)
</em><br />
<br />I hope this is a bit clearer now. My problem is that you are trying to 
<br />
make your observers work at two different levels: as structures within the 
<br />
universes generated (somehow!) by your bitstrings, but also as an 
<br />
interpretive principle for producing meaning by operating *on* the 
<br />
bitstrings.  It's a bit like claiming that PCs are built by &quot;The Sims&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Incidentally, a TM by itself can't generate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; meaning, as it is only a map from integers to integers. You still have to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; specify externally how to interpret the code as something more than a mere
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; number. (E.g. in the Turing test the output bits have to be processed into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; English language text).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The use of TM was to connect with computationalists. Computationalists
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would say that all observers could be represented by a TM, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observers do attach meaning to bitstrings. The meanings themselves can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be enumerated, ie embedded in N.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />I'm actually very sceptical of this claim.  Obviously you can encode a 
<br />
meaning in a number, but the meaning is then carried at least partly by 
<br />
the code, and not just by the number.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And the theory works even if the observers were not TMs, but simply
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some prefix map from the space of descriptions to the space of meanings.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; All you give up is the compiler theorem, or some universal complexity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure. Grounding complexity with respect to the observer suffices.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />Is there a mathematical theory of meanings that could make the notion of a 
<br />
&quot;space of meanings&quot; well-defined? Last I heard, philosophers were still 
<br />
arguing about what &quot;meaning&quot; means!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Not to mention the terms &quot;observer&quot; and &quot;superposition&quot;. In QM, which is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the natural context, superposition implies that it is possible sometimes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to observe (and predict) interference effects. I don't see how this can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; happen in your sense, since there is no interaction between descriptions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I disagree. Superposition simply means that something is true and not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; true simultaneously, it is indeterminate.
</em><br />
<br />In your private language, maybe. I shudder to think what bizarre ideas it 
<br />
would put in the heads of my students if I used this definition!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is true in QM that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; complex Hilbert space structure allows for interference effects, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the term superposition surely has a broader meaning.
</em><br />
<br />The most general meaning is the literal one: A &amp; B are super(im)posed if 
<br />
they are lying on top of each other. But it's rather a pointless 
<br />
expression if a superposition can't be distinguished from either/or.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; However the word &quot;contains&quot; has two distinctly different mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meanings here. It is probably better to replace it with the word
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;belongs&quot; when referring to OMs, ie &quot;Set A contains description x&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whould be translated as &quot;Observer moment A belongs to universe x&quot;. By
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logic, of course, OMs in general belong to many universes. Also &quot;a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe x having many OMs&quot; corresponds to &quot;description x being an element of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multiple sets&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />OK, that's clearer.
<br />
<br />&lt;stuff on meta-time deleted as maybe this will make sense when we get on 
<br />
to your QM section!&gt;
