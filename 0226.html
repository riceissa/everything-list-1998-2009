<br />James Higgo replies:
<br />
All that exists, exists in the block universe; you can choose to see the
<br />
universe as containing choices, or you may prefer to view the question as
<br />
meaningless (as I do).  My view of the universe is put forward, clumsily, in
<br />
the following exchange with Vic Stenger:
<br />
<br />Vic Stenger:
<br />
Suppose humanity never evolved. There still will be supernovas
<br />
that spew out
<br />
particles in all directions and we need to explain why, greatly
<br />
separated in
<br />
space and not in contact, at least for ten billion years or so, this
<br />
always
<br />
happens in the same time direction. That is, we do not have
<br />
some spewing out
<br />
and some where the same particles converge to make a nice
<br />
stable star, carbon
<br />
turning back to hydrogen and deuterium, and so on. Or, why
<br />
there are
<br />
(apparently) black holes and no white holes (maybe the gamma
<br />
bursters are
<br />
white holes, now that I think of it). As Huw Price makes it clear
<br />
(I'm reading
<br />
his whole book a second time, and working on my chapter on
<br />
time's arrow), this
<br />
is an unexplained puzzle--why the universe has this highly
<br />
improbable state at
<br />
one extreme of the time axis and not the other, thus setting a
<br />
universal arrow
<br />
of time for macroscopic (but not microscopic) systems.
<br />
<br />Bayes that, my old man.
<br />
<br />Vic
<br />
<br /><br /><br />James Higgo:
<br />
&nbsp;Like so many other paradoxes, the question Vic asks about
<br />
supernovas having an arrow of time is shown to be meaningless
<br />
when you adopt Deutsch's view that time is an aspect of the
<br />
relationship between 'snapshots' (individual 3-d universes) in the
<br />
'multiverse'.
<br />
<br />Time's arrow points forwards, backwards, everywhichwayyou like
<br />
in the multiverse - it just depends on how you want to look at it.
<br />
Supernovas would 'exist' without us, but only if someone chose to
<br />
string snapshots together so they saw supernovas. It's an infinite
<br />
multiverse, but unless someone is looking along some axis, it is
<br />
meaningless to say this or that exist. Everything possible exists.
<br />
<br />We ourselves only exist in some of the tiny fibres of inter-
<br />
universe connections along which time's arrow happens to point
<br />
forwards, along which 'cause' precedes 'effect'. Because,
<br />
although the multiverse is infinite, we could only exist in this sort
<br />
of stable environment, where lots of things don't 'decay' at once.
<br />
<br />Decay is not the phenomenon; that any two particles appear to
<br />
be related is the rarity. But in an infinite multiverse...
<br />
<br />It is pointless to talk about 'supernovas' *per se* - they are merely
<br />
a function of the way we string universes together. But there are
<br />
very few such strings that would result in 'environments' in which
<br />
llife would evolve; of those, most if not all involve supernovas.
<br />
<br />Vic Stenger : This explanation borders on solipsim. It explains everything
<br />
by explaining
<br />
nothing. We see no white holes or imploding supernovae in our universe. Sure
<br />
this could be because this is just a statisical fluctuation. The average
<br />
universe has half of each and we are way out on the tail of the
<br />
distribution.
<br />
This is very unsatisfying. Just giving up. &quot;Everything is possible.&quot; You are
<br />
welcome to do that. I would prefer to keep trying to see if there is some
<br />
non-random reason for what we see in our universe. I do not think the WAP,
<br />
as
<br />
you use it with your fibers above, is enough.
<br />
<br />James Higgo: Vic, you may say that recourse to the WAP (weak anthropic
<br />
principle) is 'giving up'.  But in the context of MWI it explains
<br />
everything, such as the absence of vacuum collapses and all
<br />
sorts of nasties. It is also the basis for the wacky quantum theory
<br />
of immortality, which is another reason for you to be prejudiced
<br />
against it. You seem to be denying the validity of WAP, which
<br />
makes intuitive sense, as piously as most people deny time's
<br />
arrow can point both ways. It isn't as 'satisfactory' as a nice
<br />
experimental 'proof' but what if this is as good as it gets? Perhaps
<br />
the universe was not designed for satisfaction.
