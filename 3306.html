<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Because the state of a computer exists at a level at which it can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;perfectly known, copied or changed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes but the computer itself can not find this level in a provable way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is not obvious (search for benacerraf in the archive).
</em><br />
<br />This is true, but the current state of a computer can always be represented
<br />
within a finite string. Perhaps the computer cannot ever realize this, as
<br />
the description will be a part of the computer (ad-infinitum), but as long
<br />
as I see myself as seperate from the process of the computation, I can
<br />
objectively describe it in a 'total' manner - I can always describe all the
<br />
constituent parts that satisfy the circumstance of my definition of a
<br />
computer. It is by definition, finitely realizable, which isn't really true
<br />
for things that really exist in the objective world. In reality, I am not
<br />
completely seperate from the computer as an actual physical object, but it's
<br />
like an emulation of a computer running on a 'real' computer; code running
<br />
on the emulated computer, makes no more sense to the actual physical
<br />
computer its based on than any other arbitrary program would. A physical
<br />
computer makes no more sense to the 'cosmos' than does any other arbitrary
<br />
arrangement of objects.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Let's say we take a snapshot of a consistant conscious computer that's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;been evolved to a certain point. It's possible for me to have created an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;identical computer from nothing, without having the need to evolve it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Now the first evolved computer, is consistant and may even have an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;accurate set of memories, reflecting where it is now, and where is has
</em><br />
been,
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;etc... However, the second created machine, which is in *exactly* the
</em><br />
same state
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;as the first, has a set of false memories, that we know that it has never
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;actually experienced. Its only resort, on the basis of its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;'infallibility' is that it did in fact experience them, but in the
</em><br />
platonic (timeless)
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;world and not in our own. The consistancy of the computer has not been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;contravened, as perhaps it would have been (as you have said previously)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;if I had simply changed its memory; yet its inner certainty of memory is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;fallible.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree and that is why I believe that IF we are machine THEN we are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; immaterial machine. We have never leave Plato heaven if you want.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now I don't believe &quot;copy of material universe&quot; exists in Platonia.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Appearance of physical universes emerges on the computational histories.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To explain appearnance of lawfulness we need to take into account
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *ALL* computational histories.
</em><br />
<br />So is a physical computer an immaterial machine, or is it just an example of
<br />
an immaterial machine, that does actually exist in somewhere in Plationia,
<br />
or is it neither? Seeing that there is no rigerous way to define what
<br />
actually constitues a physical computer, and what does not, does it make any
<br />
sense to say &quot;my desktop computer&quot; has become conscious? As the entire
<br />
universe is eventually connected, I could prob. show and almost infinite
<br />
number of such machines, just by choosing arbitary points in space to
<br />
represent the various units of my computer.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I agree that there is a problem translating from first person experiene to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;third person reality.  However, I believe that memory is a first-person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;experience, as opposed to something that is 'out-there', in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;'third-person', that has a physical explanation/theory that is more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;fundamental than the actuality of the experience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This confirms what I say, you reason quite correctly. Now comp is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my working hypothesis (I don't care at all if comp is true or false).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What I say is that IF comp is true then the apparently 3-person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical phenomena are in reality the result of interference and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; partial sharing of many number theoretical machine anticipations.
</em><br />
<br />OK, so memory may be a first person experience to us, but would it be a
<br />
first person experience to an actual physical computer? All the parts of a
<br />
physical computer are mutually exclusive and rely on a specific physical
<br />
organisation, existing in the third-person in relation to each other.
<br />
Therefore, there is no real sense in which the physical computer is in the
<br />
first-person with regards to anything. It is always going to perceive its
<br />
memory in a third-person sense. It perhaps is justified to say that that
<br />
although this computer specifically is not conscious/1st-person, it is an
<br />
example of an equivalent that does exist somewhere in the platonic world or
<br />
in the multiverse, and so in a certain sense, is conscious, but this seems a
<br />
bit dubious.
