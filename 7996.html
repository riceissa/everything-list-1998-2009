<em class="quotelev1">&gt; life….again…
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Firstly:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In <a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/</a> 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; SANE2004MARCHAL.pdf is:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Definition:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; “Fundamental Physics: I define it by the correct-by-definition  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discourse about observable and verifiable anticipation of possible  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relatively evolving quantities and/or qualities.”
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Do you see the assumption here? It assumes that models derived from  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiential qualities (=empiricism) necessarily capture those  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; processes of the natural world that generate the experiential  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; qualities used to be empirical.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Why? No. I don't make that assumption at all. The definition of  
<br />
physics I gave is very general. It does neither assume comp nor  
<br />
assume the existence of an empirical world. The definition is  
<br />
agnostic. It assumes the notion of stable observable and sharable  
<br />
histories, but is neutral on the nature of them. See also my answer  
<br />
to Tom (daddycaylor).
<br />
Precisely, models derives from experiential qualities does not  
<br />
necessarily capture the processes of some natural world (if that  
<br />
exists) generating the qualities, only if the &quot;model&quot; is correct, and  
<br />
that is why I put it in the definition. It looks trivial? It is  
<br />
certainly, at first sight. But the whole paper will show that once  
<br />
comp is assumed, the definition is no more trivial.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is simply a belief. Yes the universe may behave in the way  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; characterised –as you say – by ‘definition’. They are tautologous.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Well, no. The argument that I gave shows the contrary.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; To assume that these are ‘fundamental’ is to make the whole  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definition an oxymoron! The ‘fundamental laws’ that responsible for  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiential qualities and the laws obtained by USING those  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiential qualities to do observation cannot logically be  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; claimed to be the same set! No useful outcome can be acquired from  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this thinking.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />You must take the definition literally and abstract yourself from  
<br />
your own naturalist hypotheses. All what I say, is that if &quot;H phi = E  
<br />
phi&quot; is correctly related to what we can always observe, then it is a  
<br />
physical law. It is very near a tautology, but with comp, strangely  
<br />
enough perhaps, it will appeared to be everything but tautological.  
<br />
But then you must follow the reasoning.
<br />
To be sure I am not so glad of that definition because people tend to  
<br />
take it in some non literal sense.
<br />
Another definition works: physics is what is true in all &quot;observer- 
<br />
moment&quot; when they are seen by betting machine, or still better:  
<br />
&quot;physics&quot; is what is invariant for all observable point of views. The  
<br />
defect is that the terms &quot;observable&quot; are defined in the course of  
<br />
the reasoning.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Secondly:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To make any sense at all of the words ‘first-person’ you have to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have some sort of definition of what that is. I don’t think there  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is any real definition of that anywhere in QM or UD or YD or any of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the other models discussed here.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I should stop here because I can deduce you have not read even the  
<br />
short papers. The notion of first person is completely defined both  
<br />
during the UDA and in the interview of the Lobian machine. The UDA  
<br />
definition is equivalent to the definition of &quot;subjective&quot; by  
<br />
Everett. And the arithmetical definition (in the AUDA) is taken from  
<br />
Theaetetus. The definition use in UDA is based on fold-psychology,  
<br />
and in AUDA: on self-reference logic (making my work 100% third  
<br />
person falsifiable).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is an assumption that the idea of a ‘third person’  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perspective and ‘third person experience’. These I think are both  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an oxymoron like military intelligence. J  This is another  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumption deriving from the idea that first person perspective is  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an any way captured by QM or a COMP machine.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I explictly prove that the first person notion of a machine cannot  
<br />
been described in any third person term by the machine itself. I can  
<br />
do that consistently for the class of sound machine thanks to the  
<br />
axiomatizability of the gap which exists between truth on machine and  
<br />
truth provable by the machine. It is the gap captured by the  
<br />
difference between the modal logics G* and G (but UDA gives already  
<br />
an intuitive picture of the gap).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not shown, not justified…
</em><br />
<br /><br />I explain in detail the necessary hypothetical part of comp, once  
<br />
comp is true. This has never been done in *any* theory so far. I know  
<br />
it is a subtle matter, and I have been convinced of the consistency  
<br />
of that procedure thanks to the taking into account of incompleteness  
<br />
(which has eventually been axiomatized by the G and G* logics, by  
<br />
Solovay).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Third and finally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; COMP can be found to be false as follows:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In <a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/</a> 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; SANE2004MARCHAL.pdf there is, on page 10, the following statement:  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; “It can be seen as a manner to emulate digital parallelism in a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; linear sequential way.”
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; According to your own document the UD is an enormous serial proof  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine. It _assumes_ that the very act of being such a machine  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; somehow preserves all the characteristics of what it is describing.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is simply untrue.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Proof:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Two turing machines A and B working in lockstep actually do 3  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ‘computations’ or ‘proofs’: machine A proof Ta, machine B proof Tb  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and C) the ‘relative’ proof Tab (and Tba) between machines A and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; B....Equally true, but not literally proven by the two machines.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; These are virtual theorems that precisely fit the classification of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Gödellian ‘unprovable truths’ (which, I hereby claim priority as  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discoverer). Russel has my paper on them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The UD has Ta in it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The UD has Tb in it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The UD does not have Tab or Tba
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />Why ? The UD dovetails on all interactions between all machines. You  
<br />
are not giving evidence that you did grasped what is a dovetailer  
<br />
(universal or not).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Furthermore:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In order that Tba/Tab be excluded in the UD you have to assume they  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are not relevant to subjective experience.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I don't excluded them. If you think so, prove it. The UD excludes  
<br />
only actual use of actual infinities.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If Tba and Tab are recognised at all they are certinly not included  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the UD by defintion of the serial execution. Nor are they proven  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; eliminable from the UD (=unimportant).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Tba and Tab are IMPLICIT proofs = virtual theorems that are only  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; present in inherently parallel systems.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Why do you think the Universal Dovetailer do dovetail?  The UD  
<br />
dovetails on all inherently parallel systems once digital. If not  
<br />
digital, we go out of my comp working hypothesis. We can do that, but  
<br />
then this would not been a critic of my theorem.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ergo it is simply an erroneous basis to start any model of the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; natural world
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />What you call &quot;natural world&quot; *is* a model (in your sense of the  
<br />
world). If not, tell me what do you mean by that.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and especially erroneous if it has anything to say about subjective  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience, which, if it is anything at all is NOT about what a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thing IS,
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Oh!   I agree, here. I guess you mean IS in some 3 person viewpoint.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; but is about what a thing IS NOT.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />... and much more!!!
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; When you explicitly define any ‘thing’ you implicitly define NOT  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; THING!
</em><br />
<br /><br />Hal Ruhl says something like that, but even after asking for an  
<br />
explanation I have not yet figure what that could mean.
<br />
Which &quot;NOT&quot; ? It should be stronger than the actually very strong  
<br />
classical negation.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Any computationalist approach formulates seriality and disposes of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all the virtual theorems! No amount of wishful computing will  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reinstate them! You have to BE PARALLEL to get them.
</em><br />
<br /><br />But the universal dovetailer is *the* master in implementing all  
<br />
digital parallel processes, even some infinite Garden of Eden. Only  
<br />
parallelism + explicit call to actual infinities would cause trouble  
<br />
to comp. That the UD does not miss anything thing computable  
<br />
(including the inherently parallel procedures) is a non trivial  
<br />
consequence of Church Thesis.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Alternatively you can prove conclusively prove that they are not in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the universe….woops…you will then prove all Feynman diagrams to be  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; false…(virtual theorems = virtual matter) …and….I can find a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mechanism whereby the human brain makes very good use of virtual  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theorems.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You are mystifying parallelism. I guess you know Johnson Laird's work  
<br />
in the comp philosophy of mind. He made that moves but  this has not  
<br />
yet explain anything &quot;physical&quot; or &quot;psychological&quot;. Beside, it  
<br />
contradicts my working hypothesis, which you have not shown false or  
<br />
inconsistent.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So “what is it like to be a UD?”
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It’s like being a whopping great fat Turing machine = like being a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tape reader and tape: probably nothing at all, but certainly  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different from whatever the UD thinks it is emulating!
</em><br />
<br /><br />Why do you want the UD ever thinks. Gosh, please, read my papers. The  
<br />
UD is certainly not a person, or an infinitely dumb and shallow one.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What’s it like to be a computer based on silicon? Like being a hot  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rock? What’s it like to be a quantum computer? Like being a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cryogenically cold rock. :)
</em><br />
<br /><br />Remember I don't assume rock and silicon. I try to explain them as we  
<br />
are obliged when we postulate the comp hyp.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Finally: This is development of Progoginian thinking. The two  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; people on this list who seem to be getting nearest to it are  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Stephen Paul King and Hal Ruhl.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Can we please move on? The universe is absolutely bristling with  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; virtual theorems. There are no theories of everything here… but  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; merely ‘theories of not much at all’!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Experiential qualities are not in the UD.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Right! But totally unrelated with the demonstration I gave. Only  
<br />
Lobian machine can have experential qualities. The UD is definitely  
<br />
not a Lobian machine. Actually it is more a Robinsonian Machine (but  
<br />
that's is for later ifr you ask me to explain).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; All human knowledge is symbolically grounded in experiential  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; qualities (a la Harnad).
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Agreed!   And explained in term of Lobian machine if you accept  
<br />
Theaetetus' definitions of knowledge.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ergo ... Bye bye COMP.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />You are quick, to say the last. Give me your hypotheses please, and  
<br />
show me how precisely they are in contradiction with comp. Don't say  
<br />
&quot;my first person experience&quot;, because &quot;machine's first person  
<br />
experiences&quot; also are not describable in third person term by the  
<br />
machine. To abandon comp effectively you must refer to some third  
<br />
person process which would be not emulable by a Turing machine. That  
<br />
exists. Nielsen has given a nice example: e^iOMEGAt, with OMEGA being  
<br />
Chaitin's number.
<br />
You really need that? How could you build an experimental device  
<br />
capable or recognizing e^iOMEGAt ?
<br />
<br /><br />If you follow the UDA argument, you will understand that if you  
<br />
assume a &quot;natural primitive world&quot;, then comp is false, and you can  
<br />
search for actual infinities. With comp, it would be a waste of time,  
<br />
because a sound machine cannot recognize something as being provably  
<br />
more complex than eself.  She can only bet on things like that,  in  
<br />
some circumstances.
<br />
And in some (lucky?) situations machines can even correctly bet on  
<br />
those uncomputable things.
<br />
