</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shitting (is this correct? polite?)
</em><br />
<br />It's correct - and fine with me - but not perhaps quite polite.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What comp (by UDA+FILMED-GRAPH) shows, is that, once the digitalness of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your local relative description is taken seriously, you can no more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distinguish the comp stories existing below your comp substitution
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; level.
</em><br />
<br />So, 'materiality' - for you - can consist in effect only of what is at
<br />
or above this level?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Eventually the laws of physics will be the law of what remains
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or emerges as observable in all computations.
</em><br />
<br />Again - for all observers - what emerges at or above their substitution level?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; From inside this has to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interfere statistically (by UDA).
</em><br />
<br />That is, from inside comp reality, not inside 'matter'?  Then, given
<br />
this, statistical interference leads to first person indeterminacy.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; How? I would say by self-measurement relatively to their most probable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (or credible ...) comp histories. There is always an infinity of them.
</em><br />
<br />How does 'self-measurement' lead to the observables of physics?  By
<br />
'most probable' I assume you mean the convergence of first person
<br />
experience on such histories.  Is this what you mean by
<br />
'self-measurement' (i.e. the convergence by self-sampling on a
<br />
first-personal 'measure')?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You can see my thesis either as a the showing that comp necessitates to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generalize Everett embedding of the subject into the physical world.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Cf also Rossler endophysiocs). Indeed comp forces us to embed the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arithmetician (or any memory machine) in numberland (something for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which we will never have a complete unification).
</em><br />
<br />Is comp therefore in effect a 'many minds' view?  In this case, do the
<br />
'many worlds' emerge as the observables contingent on the povs of the
<br />
many minds (from the background of numberland)?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I said in Siena, and already in this list, that for Plato, what *you*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; see (observe, measure) is the border of what *you* don't see. In the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universal machine context this can lead to a recursive but solvable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; equation where physical reality is a sort of border of the comp-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indeterminacy or the comp intrinsical ignorance.
</em><br />
<br />When you refer to the observables as the border of what you don't see,
<br />
or the border of the comp indeterminacy, are you again referring to
<br />
the indistinguishability of what lies below one's substitution level?
<br />
If so, would this not imply the potential existence of an infinity of
<br />
levels of observables, or physics(s), depending on the substitution
<br />
levels of classes of observers?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In a nutshell, you cannot use Godel incompleteness to show that we are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not machine (or that we are not lobian), but you can use Godel
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; incompleteness to argue that IF we are sound lobian machine then we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cannot know which machine we are, still less which computations support
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; us. It gives the arithmetical origin of the first person comp
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indetermincacy, which you are supposed to have already intuitively
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; swallow from the UDA, OK?
</em><br />
<br />OK.  However, I still have in reserve my question about how we are
<br />
supposed to think about the relation between, say, our minds and some
<br />
observable version of our brains.  For example, how are we supposed to
<br />
account for how changes to some version of our brains seem to
<br />
correlate with changes of mind, or how the physical evolution of
<br />
brains relates to that of minds?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Where a layman says: the temperature in Toulouse is 34.5,  the logician
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; says:   temperature(Toulouse) = 17.
</em><br />
<br />Is it colder for logicians?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So an arbitrary function from n-tuple to number will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be denote by f(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n). Exactly like in the definition of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an arbitrary derivative in calculus: the limit, if it exists, for h
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; going near zero of the quotient f(x + h) - f(x) with h. OK?
</em><br />
<br />OK, thanks.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I propose to go, from the Cantor non-enumerability of the reals (or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things equivalent) to Kleene non recursive enumerability of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recursive reals, by Church thesis. Comp, both in the UDA, and in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arithmetical UDA, is mainly Church thesis. I want to show you how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; strong and deep that thesis is. OK?
</em><br />
<br />OK
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now diagonalization will appear to be a sort of &quot;transcendental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; operation&quot;. Its main use is for going outside some set, and I would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like to convey why the fact that the set  &quot;programmable functions&quot; is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; closed for diagonalization is truly a miracle! (to borrow Godel's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; expression). It is really that miracle which makes the set of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; programmable or computable function fitting so well the search for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universal everything theory.
</em><br />
<br />I think I see what you mean - i.e. that extensions to the set by
<br />
diagonalisation are also programmable functions, which makes the set
<br />
in effect a closed but infinite universe.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, ok, sorry. Instead of &quot;the non enumerability of the subset of N&quot;,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; read &quot;the non enumerability of the set of subsets of N&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Have you take a look on my old diagonalization post which I send to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Lennart?
</em><br />
<br />Yes, thanks.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Did this post helped? I want you to understand Church thesis, before
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the description of some formal language. This will economize work, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; help you disentangle the rigorous from the formal. In our setting,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;formal&quot; will always mean &quot;output by a machine&quot;. Don't believe that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; formal = rigor. That would be equivalent to believe that all machines
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are correct (a nonsense).  OK?
</em><br />
<br />Yes, very helpful.

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; That the 'comp reality' is founded on the number realm, is almost

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; that, once you say &quot;yes&quot; to the digital doctor, for some level of

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; substitution, then your immateriality (somehow like the quantum

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;measure&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; on the UD accessible relative states.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This perhaps needs to be explained more slowly.  What - exactly - do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; you mean by &quot;immateriality&quot;, and &quot;contagious on your most probable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; neighbourhoods&quot;?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Nothing magical. For example the game of bridge is immaterial, despite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you need some local matter to implement some particular bridge game.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; All abstract concepts are immaterial. You don't have the need to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explain what bosons and fermions are to explain what is a number.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Like Stathis argued a lot, if you identify yourself with your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; history/personality there is a sense to be 50 years old, but if you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; identify yourself with your matter, you disappear a bit by eating and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shitting (is this correct? polite?) and respiring, etc. and never
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; really exist for more than seven years, etc... In the first case you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; admit somehow your immateriality despite contingent and local
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appearance of being composed in some substancial way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What comp (by UDA+FILMED-GRAPH) shows, is that, once the digitalness of

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Also, precisely what do you intend to be included in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; - or excluded from - the notion of 'physics' in this context?  Is it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to be equated with what is observable, and if so, how and by whom?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; By lobian machine. By lobian machine, as they are emulated by a weaker
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine (the universal dovetailer, alias the arithmetical Sigma1
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sentences).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; How? I would say by self-measurement relatively to their most probable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (or credible ...) comp histories. There is always an infinity of them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I said in Siena, and already in this list, that for Plato, what *you*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; see (observe, measure) is the border of what *you* don't see. In the

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; To be sure, it is needed,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; however, for the understanding that with comp, we *have to* derive the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; physics from &quot;intensional numbers prevailing discourses&quot;. With comp,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; postulating a physical world cannot be used as an explanation relating
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; mind and appearance of matter (memory-stable observations).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; It is not that (aristotelian primary )substance does not exist, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; that such primary substance is provably (with the comp hyp) void of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; explanation power.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It strikes me, reading the above, that it might be a good idea to find
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a way to limit ourselves -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes. (but hard!)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; at this deliberately elementary stage - to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; an agreed set of terms with which to designate each of your key ideas,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; for example with respect to physics deriving from &quot;intensional number
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; prevailing discourses&quot;.  Perhaps what we need is not so much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; grandmother-version, but a kindergarten-level introduction to the key
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; terms and concepts, which we can then use slowly and clearly to build
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; up the argument.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have to explain enough notions so as to be able to explain Solovay
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theorem, which links precisely the modal logic G and G* with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discourse of the ideally correct lobian machines. &quot;Machine theology&quot; is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; really captured by the study of G*, G* \ G, and their intensional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (modal) variants (but this is again an anticipation).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Most key terms and concepts are from mathematical logic and computer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; science key terms and concepts, at least for the arithmetical part.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You can see my thesis either as a the showing that comp necessitates to
</em><br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which we will never have a complete unification).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But you can also see the technical part of the thesis as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reconstruction of Lucas-Penrose godelian argument. This reconstruction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has a long history which, paradoxically enough precedes both Lucas
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (1960) or Penrose (Much latter). The line is: Post, Benecerraf, Wang,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Reinhardt, (myself), Webb, etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In a nutshell, you cannot use Godel incompleteness to show that we are

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Thanks
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think this one is the best. But the subject is so beautiful that you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can find other very nice book (I think of the classical bible of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recursion theory, the book by Rogers, Tourlakis comes to my mind.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Calude also did wrote a cute technical textbook, Saloma too, aargh
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there are too much good books! OK, keep on on Cutland and Franzen.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (A chef d'oeuvre which is hard to find is the preprint by Machtey and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Young, Cutland acknowledge being inspired by it).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; OK. I will begin by saying two words on the language we will use when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; discussing with the machine. I can already explain the difference
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; between the layman (or grandmother) and the logician. This is not just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; for you (I guess you know what I will say) but for those who just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; abandon logic for reason of notation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; The main difference is that where a layman says &quot;Alfred is serious&quot;,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; the logician says serious(Alfred).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Where the layman will say there is a ferocious dog, a logician will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; that it exists something such that that something is a dog and is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; ferocious. Because of laziness he will write Ex(dog(x) &amp;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; ferocious(x)).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; For saying that all dogs are ferocious, he will say that for all dogs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; (i.e. choose any thing that is a dog) that things will be ferocious:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; and he will write Ax (dog(x) -&gt; ferocious(x)).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Of course, there is perhaps no effective test to see if a dog is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; ferocious or not, perhaps the notion is not well defined, but we have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; to live with things like that: even in the pure realm of numbers we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; will encounter some unexpected (I guess) complexity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Thanks, this is useful.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So, where the layman says &quot;17 is prime&quot;, the logician writes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;prime(17)&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But let me add two words on function. Actually you can see &quot;prime(17)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as a function, defined on numbers and having {true, false}, or {t, f}
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as range: for example prime(17) = t, and prime(14) = f. OK?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Where a layman says: the temperature in Toulouse is 34.5,  the logician
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; says:   temperature(Toulouse) = 17. And, here, you can see
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;temperature&quot; as a function from location (city) in the real numbers. A
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; function is just such an association. The key idea is that a function
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will always have zero or one value. There is no sense to say that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; temperature in toulouse is 34.5 and 23.7.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Childhood operation on numbers are usually function, even binary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; functions (functions with two arguments, inputs, ...). Where the layman
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will say: the sum of 3 and 4 gives 7, the logician will write: +(3,4) =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 7. They put the name of the function in front, and they put the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arguments after. So an arbitrary function from n-tuple to number will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be denote by f(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n). Exactly like in the definition of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an arbitrary derivative in calculus: the limit, if it exists, for h
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; going near zero of the quotient f(x + h) - f(x) with h. OK?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; By the way, David, do you know what is called &quot;classical propositional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; calculus&quot;, the truth table method? Do you need some refreshing?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Some refreshing is in Smullyan's FU, but I can do it, or focus on some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; difficulty (classical propositional calculus is not so simple indeed,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; even if simpler than most other logics).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I can always use wikipedia - which I've looked at - or other sources
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; online, but anything you would also be prepared to do here would be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; most helpful.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK. The road is the following:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I propose to go, from the Cantor non-enumerability of the reals (or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things equivalent) to Kleene non recursive enumerability of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recursive reals, by Church thesis. Comp, both in the UDA, and in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arithmetical UDA, is mainly Church thesis. I want to show you how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; strong and deep that thesis is. OK?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; I don't think Church thesis can be grasped
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; conceptually without the understanding that the class of programmable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; functions is closed for the diagonalization procedure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Please explain 'programmable functions' and 'closed for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; diagonalisation procedure'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course, today, there is a simple way to say what is a programmable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; function: it is a function that you can program on a computer. But wait
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I explain Church thesis, for really making sense of this.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I can explain to you what I mean by: a set is closed for this or that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; function/operation/procedure. A set is closed for some operation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; applicable to its elements when such application does not lead outside
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the set. Examples:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the set of natural numbers N = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...} is closed for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; addition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the set of natural numbers N = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...} is NOT closed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for subtraction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the set of natural numbers N = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...} is closed for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multiplication
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the set R of real numbers is closed for addition, multiplication,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; division, subtraction, but ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     is not closed for the square roots
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the set of humans is closed for sexual reproduction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Etc ... OK?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now diagonalization will appear to be a sort of &quot;transcendental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; operation&quot;. Its main use is for going outside some set, and I would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like to convey why the fact that the set  &quot;programmable functions&quot; is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; closed for diagonalization is truly a miracle! (to borrow Godel's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; expression). It is really that miracle which makes the set of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; programmable or computable function fitting so well the search for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universal everything theory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Do everyone
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; (interested) know how to prove the non enumerability of the subset of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; N
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; by diagonalization?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Which subset do you mean?  I've encountered the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; diagonalisation/enumerability argument, assuming it's the one I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; referred to above.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, ok, sorry. Instead of &quot;the non enumerability of the subset of N&quot;,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; read &quot;the non enumerability of the set of subsets of N&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Have you take a look on my old diagonalization post which I send to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Lennart?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Let us go slow and deep so that everybody can understand, once and for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; all.  OK?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Definitely OK.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Did this post helped? I want you to understand Church thesis, before
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the description of some formal language. This will economize work, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; help you disentangle the rigorous from the formal. In our setting,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;formal&quot; will always mean &quot;output by a machine&quot;. Don't believe that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; formal = rigor. That would be equivalent to believe that all machines
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are correct (a nonsense).  OK?
