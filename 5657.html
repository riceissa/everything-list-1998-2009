Bruno, I really cannot work this way. I still prepare to reply to your
<br />
earlier post (to me) and here I have the repost on the &quot;1st part&quot;
<br />
with lots to be replied upon. &lt;G&gt;.
<br />
<br />I am in debt with ~30,000 books I did not read. Never will. How much time
<br />
may I have left? 30-40 years? (I am pushing 83). Will my mind give up? My
<br />
hip did already. (My fingers did not, I still perform classical piano-music
<br />
for a local-public audience - next: October).
<br />
So I gave up checking on past millennia wisdom and work on the present -
<br />
absorbed and developed for myself since retirement. The oldies speculated in
<br />
a cognitive inventory of the mind which was much poorer than the lately
<br />
absorbed enrichments. I appreciate their wisdom, as 'function of mind', but
<br />
the conclusions MAY be old. I am not a judge of that, but can stay out of
<br />
such argumentations.
<br />
&quot;Comp&quot;, &quot;QM&quot;, you ask? Aren't they within the mindset of the minds within
<br />
THIS universe, which I deemed &quot;human ways&quot; of thinking? Same good old
<br />
math-conceptualization. I am talking about something not-matching. Cohen and
<br />
Stewart played such tunes in their enjoyable books (Collapse of Chaos and
<br />
Figments of Reality) - their &quot;aliens&quot;, the Zarathustrans, with their
<br />
octimalization (8?). Of course that was still sort of &quot;human&quot; switch, a bit
<br />
of Tao etc.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;truth&quot; is an object of study by logicians.&lt;&lt; My best wishes for them. I
</em><br />
went through many 'thruths' - different religious ones, reincarnational,
<br />
pragmatic natural science, astrology, Indian,
<br />
Marxist, Leninist, atheist (who require a god to deny), every one had
<br />
something attractive, but...
<br />
and settled with my scientific agnosticism: not even the contrary is true of
<br />
what people believe. (That really came from politics).
<br />
If you go into &quot;variables&quot;: my wholistic views allow no fixed conditions and
<br />
unlimited variabilities upon which a mathematician friend remarked: &quot;well,
<br />
this is a bit steep&quot;. Only models can have boundaries, quantities, fixed
<br />
qualia etc. That goes also for QM (Comp I don't know, never let it clarify
<br />
in my mind). Even &quot;topics&quot; are cut out from the extratopical wholeness.
<br />
Limited Models.
<br />
A map is a model, a territory a wider one. Most minds (on this and other
<br />
lists) work within a certain modeling (we cannot do better, that's the way
<br />
we can manage with the material tool we apply for thinking: the neuronal
<br />
brain, restricting the mind into &quot;human&quot; logic (oops!).
<br />
Is my wholistic thinking inept for achieveing practical conclusions? you bet
<br />
it is. We just started to tackle with such ideas, have to find suitable
<br />
concepts and (formulate?) words to express them.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt;...(UDA) *forces* us to do: if comp is true we have to explain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the physical appearances by a sort of mean on all consistent belief
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; systems. &lt;
</em><br />
(if!) - now the 'physical appearances' are the mind's interpretations upon
<br />
impact inknown, lately observed by instruments WITHIN this system of ours.
<br />
And I did not ask for &quot;CONSISTENT&quot; belief systems, before I even know what
<br />
kinds may exist at all. We know SOME, here and now,
<br />
pertinent to our cultural basis (human mindset of the present local(?!)
<br />
societal conditions).
<br />
I am consistent in my agnosticism. All argumentative support from within is
<br />
useless for without.
<br />
<br />Now I can return to thinking about math (for the 2nd part reply), although I
<br />
don't know much about it. It was my elective in my Ph.D. work (1948), never
<br />
used it later, beyond arithmetics, mostly by my slide ruler, while inventing
<br />
and implementing a pioneering-worldlevel industrial branch, 38 patents,
<br />
consulting (and solving technical production-problems) on 3 continents over
<br />
4 decades. All in the simplest reductionist technical common sense
<br />
creativity.
<br />
&nbsp;I am ready for a coffee, myself.
