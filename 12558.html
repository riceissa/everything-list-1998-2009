To avoid to much posts in your mail box, I send all my comments in this 
<br />
post,
<br />
<br />Hi Brent,
<br />
<br />1a) Brent meeker wrote (quoting Jim Heldberg) :
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Atheism is not a religion, just as a vacant lot is not a type of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; building, and health is not a form of sickness.  Atheism is not a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; religion.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	--- Jim Heldberg
</em><br />
<br /><br />It seems to me that Jim Heldberg confuse the scientist (indeed) 
<br />
attitude of agnosticism and atheism.
<br />
Let D = the proposition &quot;God exists&quot;, &quot;~&quot; = NOT, B = believes.
<br />
<br />An agnostic is someone for which the proposition &quot;~BD&quot; is true.   (And 
<br />
&quot;~B~D&quot; could be true as well)
<br />
An atheist is someone for which &quot;B~D&quot; is true.
<br />
<br />The atheist is a believer. As John M often says, an atheist already has 
<br />
some notion of God such as to be able to believe it does not exist.
<br />
Now most atheist are already &quot;believer&quot; in believing &quot;religiously&quot; in 
<br />
Primary Matter (a metaphysical entity).
<br />
<br />I'am agnostic in both sense. I do not believe in God, nor do I believe 
<br />
in Matter. Those terms are not enough well defined.
<br />
I do neither believe in the inexistence of God, nor in the inexistence 
<br />
of Matter. I wait for more data.
<br />
<br />But assuming comp, I must confess that I have *reason* to put some more 
<br />
credo on Plotinus, and other platonist approaches, on &quot;mind/god/matter&quot; 
<br />
and fundamental principle, than on the aristotelian primitive matter 
<br />
theory. Actually, I infer the same belief from the empirical quantum 
<br />
data.
<br />
<br /><br />1b) Brent wrote to John M:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Values existed longer before humans.
</em><br />
<br /><br />So you are a bit Platonist too .... :)
<br />
<br /><br /><br />1c) Brent wrote (to Stathis):
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; How is this infinite regress avoided in our world?  By consciousness 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not representing the rest of the world.
</em><br />
<br /><br />That is an interesting idea. You could elaborate a bit perhaps? I do 
<br />
agree with your most of your recent replies to Stathis about the 
<br />
question &quot;does a rock think?&quot;.  But perhaps not entirely for the same 
<br />
reason as you. We will see.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The world is what it is and representation is not essential.  I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suppose this is somewhat like Peter's &quot;primitive substance&quot; whose only 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; function is to distinguish things that exist from their 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; representation.
</em><br />
<br />yes, but then the question is &quot;what are you assuming to exist?&quot;
<br />
<br /><br /><br />1d) Brent wrote to Mark Peaty (in Jason's thread about 
<br />
&quot;irreversibility):
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think there is a confusion creeping in here.  I don't think 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;logically reversible&quot; is misleading.  It is only physical processes 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that can be termed reversible or irreversible.  Logic lives in a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; timeless Platonia.  Computers operated irreversibly, they dissipate 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; heat when they they erase data.  Feynman pointed out that this was not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessary and a computer that did not erase data could operate without 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dissipating heat (no increase in entropy).
</em><br />
<br /><br />The logician Hao Wang, is, as far as I know, the first to prove that a 
<br />
universal machine can operate without ever erasing information, and 
<br />
this is enough for developping notion of logical reversibility (quite 
<br />
useful in quantum computing). I say more in term of &quot;combinators&quot; in my 
<br />
Elsevier paper. The one which is not yet on my web page. People 
<br />
interested can ask me a preprint.
<br />
Grosso modo you lose universality if both &quot;eliminating info&quot; is 
<br />
prohibited and &quot;duplicating info&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />2a) John wrote to Jamie:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sponging the 'gedanken..' - the falling treebranch reflects in your 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; version the omniscient arrogant reductionist position. I go with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Popper: no evidence, because we cannot encompass 'totality'  (my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conclusion).
</em><br />
<br />Cute. And admitting to represent &quot;totality&quot; by the set of codes of 
<br />
total (everywhere defined) computable functions, this can be made very 
<br />
precise in term of the Wi and the Fi, as I try to explain from time to 
<br />
time in the list.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would'nt go to the primitive mechanistic AI-levels to learn about 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mentality unlimited. Bits (and pieces) for unrestricted relations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; AI simulates (mechanically?) certain aspects of human mentality - up 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to a limited fashion.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You seem quite sure about that. How do you know? Why couldn'it be that 
<br />
*you* find this &quot;limited&quot; due to your own prejudice about numbers and 
<br />
machines?
<br />
<br /><br />2b) John wrote to Brent:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So noted. (However: in my feeble English 'bias' means
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; '~prejudice' and I have yet to learn about prejudicial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instruments. Unless we accept the &quot;conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instrument e.g. a thinking yardstick).  I, as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Loebian machine, may well be prejudicial).
</em><br />
<br /><br />That is true!!!  Are you serious about being a lobian machine? As a 
<br />
matter of fact, lobian machine can know and prove that they are lobian.
<br />
To prove being a *consistent* lobian machine is quite another matter, 
<br />
though ....
<br />
It is not impossible. *Inconsistent* lobian machine *can* prove that 
<br />
they are consistent lobian machine, but then they can prove the 
<br />
existence of Santa Klaus, and also, to be sure, of 0 = 1.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />3a) Stathis wrote (to me):
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Regarding consciousness being generated by physical activity, would it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; help if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I said that if a conventional computer is conscious, then, to be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consistent, a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rock would also have to be conscious?
</em><br />
<br />I think you could be right ... It is difficult because terms like 
<br />
&quot;conventional&quot; and &quot;physical&quot; are quite fuzzy.
<br />
I do think that if a conventional (material in the mundane sense) is 
<br />
conscious, most probably anything *is* conscious, and that is related 
<br />
to the fact that I think (assuming the comp hypothesis) that a 
<br />
conventional computer is *not* conscious. Consciousness is a first 
<br />
person attribute, and the UDA shows that it has to be associated with 
<br />
an (infinity) of (mathematical) computations. This 1-person has no 
<br />
shape, and can even be considered as not being a machine. I guess we 
<br />
will have to discuss this with more details.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's difficult to find the right words here. I think we can all agree 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on the appearance
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of a physical reality as a starting point.
</em><br />
<br />Yes.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The common sense view is that there is an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; underlying primitive physical reality generating this appearance, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; without which the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appearance would vanish and relative to which dream and illusion can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be defined.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If this is so, it is not a scientifically testable theory.
</em><br />
<br />I think it is testable indirectly.  Recall that although I disagree 
<br />
with Penrose godelian argument, I do arrive at similar conclusion: you 
<br />
cannot have both &quot;computationalism&quot; and &quot;materialism&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; We can't just switch off the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical reality to see whether it changes the appearance, and the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; further we delve
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; into matter all we see is more appearance (and stranger and stranger 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appearance at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that). Moreover, dream and illusion are defined relative to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appearance of regular
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical reality, not relative to the postulated primitive physical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality.
</em><br />
<br />I would say &quot;relative to a theory explaining the appearances&quot;, not just 
<br />
to the appearances.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />3b) Stathis wrote to John M:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not really: the people who claim they saw Elvis after his alleged 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; death are more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; numerous and more credible than the second-hand (at best) Biblical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; accounts of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Jesus being sighted after his crucifixion. When I have put this to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Christians they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; answer that Elvis did not claim to be God etc. Well, if he had done, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; make a difference?
</em><br />
<br /><br />I'm afraid it would have!
<br />
Reciprocally, would Jesus have been only a musician, things would have 
<br />
been different, I guess :)
<br />
<br /><br /><br />3c) Stathis wrote to John in another post:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The constraint on meaning and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; syntax would then go, and the vibration of atoms in a rock could be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implementing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any computation, including any conscious computation, if such there 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; John Searle, among others, believes this is absurd, and that therefore 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it disproves
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computationalism. Another approach is that it shows that it is absurd 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; supervenes on physical activity of any sort, but we can keep 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computationalism and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; drop the physical supervenience criterion, as Bruno has.
</em><br />
<br />Yes.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />3d) Stathis wrote to Brent:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Any serial computation can be made up of multiple parallel 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computations, and vice versa. You can't say, aha, we've used that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; string for &quot;dog&quot; so we can't now use it for &quot;cat&quot;, because who is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; going to patrol the universe to enforce this rule? This is what you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are left with if you eliminate the constraint that the computation has 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to interact with an external observer.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am aware that this is a very strange idea, perhaps even an absurd 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; idea, but I don't see any way out of it without ruining 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computationalism, as by saying that it's all bunk, or only 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computations that can interact with the environment at the level of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; their implementation can be conscious. Because if you insist on the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; latter, it implies something like ESP: the computer will know the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; difference between a false sensory stimulus and one emanating from the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; environment... possible, but not very Turing-emulable.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree with Brent's remark on that: &quot;I find that doubtful - do you 
<br />
have a reference?  Isn't it the definition of &quot;incompressible&quot; 
<br />
computation that there is no way faster than executing each step in 
<br />
sequence (Brent Meeker).
<br />
<br /><br />3e) Stathis' answer to Brent:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm not referring to speed, just to doing it. For example, a serial 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stream of consciousness can be emulated by multiple shorter parallel 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; streams; there is no way of knowing whether you're being run in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; serial, parallel, how fast the real world clock is running, etc.
</em><br />
<br />I agree there is no way to know whether you are being run in serial, 
<br />
parallel, etc. But mathematically multiple shorter parallel streams 
<br />
have to be able to be glued, at least mathematically, for constituting 
<br />
a proper computation. If not literally anything can be described as a 
<br />
computation. That is why I explicitly use a mathematical definition of 
<br />
computation, and then(and only then) try to figure out what is a rock, 
<br />
for example.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />4) Mark Peaty wrote (to Brent):
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; As I say, the essence of evil is the act of treating other persons as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I so agree with you. And then, with Church thesis (less than comp, 
<br />
thus) you can understand the reason why even some (relative) machine 
<br />
and some (relative) numbers should not be confused with any of their 
<br />
third person description.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  On another tack: it seems to me the extent and scope of suffering in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the world is one of the most powerful arguments in favour of the total 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; irrelevance of the concept of G/god/s. However it is not for me to go 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; around telling those who believe in some G/god/s that they are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deluded.
</em><br />
<br />Do you agree that those who believe in a primitive physical universe 
<br />
could be deluded in the same manner than those who believe in some 
<br />
notion of God. Perhaps even in a worse manner, because many people 
<br />
believe that the existence of a primitive material universe is a 
<br />
&quot;scientific fact&quot;. Of course not. At least in many theological text, 
<br />
the word &quot;God&quot; is used in a more axiomatic way than &quot;Matter&quot; is by some 
<br />
scientist (at lunch or during the week-end). Most religious people will 
<br />
never say that the existence of God is a scientific fact, and in that 
<br />
sense are less deluded than many materialist.
<br />

<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; As for the simulation argument itself, I've suggested previously that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instead of thinking &quot;which kind of universe am I likely to be in&quot;, it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; makes more sense to consider myself as being &quot;simultaneously&quot; in all 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universes that contain me, and to decide my actions based on their 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; effects on the overall multiverse.
</em><br />
<br />I agree. It is not even just an option with the comp hyp. With comp we 
<br />
just cannot belongs to a universe or to a computational history, we 
<br />
always &quot;belong&quot; to an infinity of them.
