<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, but if so that's just an example of the point that I
<br />
made, that even if all possibilities exist there are still free parameters
<br />
in specifying how to count them up in order to make predictions.  So it's
<br />
really not a problem with the idea I described, which is a simple (thus
<br />
interesting) choice for the free parameters, but rather it's a problem for
<br />
the more ambitious goal of having no information, which I currently doubt
<br />
could be achieved.  
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for posting the archive.  I looked at it and noticed that
<br />
Max Tegmark has never posted to this list.  Do you know why not?  Does he
<br />
read it?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that the view that the quantum suicide experiment
<br />
could show anything comes from a misconception about measure.  I know this
<br />
has been discussed before, but I'll give it one more shot.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are 900 people named Bob and 100 named Tom, all else
<br />
being equal, the effective probability of a typical conscious observation
<br />
to be associated with thinking one's name is Bob is 90%.  That is the
<br />
measure associated with such observations.  It does not matter if all the
<br />
Bobs are identical; they could be, and that should not alter the measure.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it did matter, than it would be difficult to explain how, in
<br />
the MWI of QM, the probabilities could depend on the amplitude of the wave
<br />
function.  (See my page on interpretation of QM.)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of computers, and the variable resistance connections
<br />
proposed by Hal Finney, there is indeed an objective distinction that
<br />
should be made between independent vs. linked computers.  It is not a
<br />
question of whether the AI 'feels a difference'; obviously, if it runs the
<br />
same computation, it must be able to report the same feeling to us.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distinction is simply a question of how many different
<br />
implementations of that computation there are.  As explained on my page,
<br />
one requirement for an implementation is that causal relationships must be
<br />
true between states of the computation, both the actual states and the
<br />
counterfactual possible states.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the computers are wired together, they're no longer independent
<br />
implementations; it would be impossible to change the initial conditions
<br />
so that some computers would pass through a different set of states from
<br />
the others.  If however the resistance is high enough and the digital
<br />
gates are still able to distinguish high vs. low voltage states without
<br />
interference, the computers will behave independently and have more
<br />
implementations.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if the average Bob lifetime is 1/36 as long as the average
<br />
Tom lifetime due to a propensity of Bobs to commit quantum suicide, the
<br />
measure of Bobs drops to 25% of the total measure, and the total measure
<br />
itself is greatly reduced (though unobservable).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It works the same across time.  Suppose the Bobs have a halflife
<br />
of 20 years.  The effective probability of an observation being associated
<br />
with Bob before the age of 40 is then 75% of Bob's total measure.  The
<br />
effective probability at age 1000+ is negligable.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I want to point out that surviving a quantum suicide
<br />
attempt does NOT provide any evidence for the MWI.  The only way to have
<br />
such an observation is by luck, and it makes no difference whether it is
<br />
an effective probability or a real probability, it ain't likely to happen
<br />
again if you try another suicide.
