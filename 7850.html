&nbsp;Hi George,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Still trying to understand you but having trouble holding my 
<br />
disbelieve...
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Godfrey Kurtz
<br />
&nbsp;(New Brunswick, NJ)
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;Hi Godfrey
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The &quot;I&quot; that I consider consists of a logical system that defines and 
<br />
coincides with the physical system that the &quot;I&quot; inhabits. Thus the 
<br />
world (the slice of the plenitude that we can observe) is anthropically 
<br />
constrained by the &quot;I.&quot;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;So the &quot;I&quot; is (1) a logical system (2) a physical system inhabited (1) 
<br />
and (3) the set of anthropic constraints which delimits
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the whole of the (non-&quot;I&quot;) universe (?) where (I am guessing) (1) and 
<br />
(2) find themselves! Is this what you are saying?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;So the &quot;I&quot; is coextensive with what I would call my body (including my 
<br />
brain) but not my mind (including my reasoning)?
<br />
&nbsp;Not sure I follow you here...
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GL]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;A first consequence is that physics is perfectly rational and 
<br />
understandable since it matches the &quot;I.&quot; (This is a response to 
<br />
Einstein's question of why is the world subject to rational analysis)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;A second consequence is that your logical system is the same as mine, 
<br />
- we share the same &quot;I,&quot; - hence your world is the same as mine - we 
<br />
share the same world or perspective of the plenitude. Therefore, you 
<br />
and me appear to share an objective reality.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hold on there! If all physics is reducible to &quot;a logical system&quot; why 
<br />
would there need be physics at all ? Why would you have
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;to be the one answering Enstein's quandary? Wouldn't his &quot;I&quot;, being 
<br />
the same as yours be able to answer himself?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words: maybe your explanation of knowledge is incapable of 
<br />
explaining... ignorance?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, if I remember it correctly, logical systems have the nasty 
<br />
habit, once they take on the minimal complexity, to have to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;opt between remaining consistent or aiming for completion. This, of 
<br />
course, would exempt your &quot;I&quot; from having to be
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;consistent, but would also invalidate your claim that &quot;the I physics 
<br />
is perfectly rational is understandable&quot; which, by the
<br />
&nbsp;way, is a much bigger claim than what Einstein had in mind...
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GL]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Objective reality is an illusion that disappears when observers differ 
<br />
in their frame of reference. In this particular case, it does not exist 
<br />
when observers operate according to different but entirely consistent 
<br />
fundamental logics. In fact, such observers would have a lot of 
<br />
difficulty communicating since their worlds would be different slices 
<br />
of the plenitude.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;George
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that right? &quot;...disappears when observers differ in their frame of 
<br />
reference.&quot;? But the &quot;strangeness&quot; of relativistic physics
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;is that observers can actually compare and agree on their observations 
<br />
even when they have entirely different deployments
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;in their different frames of reference! The correct physics is 
<br />
identifiable from these apparently orthogonal sets of data...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Isn't your metaphor a bit upside down or &quot;am &quot;I&quot; not intersecting your 
<br />
slice of plenitude?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I am not trying to be entirely fascicious. You may be onto 
<br />
something( at least worth shooting down which is more than
<br />
&nbsp;I can say for a lot of today's physics).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Godfrey
