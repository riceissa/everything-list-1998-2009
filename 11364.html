<br />This deficit of mine includes having trouble with ALL numbers. :-)
<br />
<br />For the life of me I cannot imagine what an 'object' is that has
<br />
quintessential property of 'five' about it. Sitting in platonia somewhere
<br />
is this object. Somewhere else in platonia sit the objects 'red' and 'sad'
<br />
and 'big'. Here on the list we talk of integers and given them a label I
<br />
and then speak of operations on I. We tend to think of I as 'being' an an
<br />
integer..
<br />
<br />...But it's not. Lets talk about the object with this property of five in
<br />
platonia as &lt;5&gt;. Here in reality what we are doing is creating a label I
<br />
and interpreting the label as a pointer to storage where the value in the
<br />
storage (call it [I])  is not an integer, but a symbolic representation of
<br />
property of five_ness as mapped from platonia to reality. What we are
<br />
doing is (very very metaphorically) shining a light (of an infinity of
<br />
possible numbers) on the object &lt;5&gt; in platonia and letting the reflected
<br />
light inhabit [I]. We behave as if &lt;5&gt; was in there, but it's not.
<br />
<br />All the rules of integers act as-if &lt;5&gt; was there. At that moment the
<br />
storage pointed to by I contains a symbolic rearrangment of matter such as
<br />
binary 1001 implemented as the temporary state (an arrangement of charge
<br />
in space) of logic gates. We logically interpret this artrangement of
<br />
charge in space as having the effect of five_ness, which is property of we
<br />
assign at the moment we use it (such as one more than 4).
<br />
<br />To me the actual numbers (things) don't exist at all. All I can really see
<br />
here in reality is logical relations that behave as-if the platonic
<br />
entities existed. This all may seem obvious to the rest of you. That's my
<br />
problem! But to me here watching the industrial scale manipulations of
<br />
symbols going on, I wonder why it is we think we are saying anything at
<br />
all about reality - the computation that literally _is_ reality - which,
<br />
again, I see as a pile of logical relations that sometimes lets the
<br />
platonic light shine on them in useful ways - say in ways that enable a
<br />
mathematical generalisation called an empirical law.
<br />
<br />As to what the non-ideal numbers are....
<br />
<br />Well there aren't any. Not really. At least I can't conceive them. However
<br />
the logical operations I see around us have the structure of numbers
<br />
correponding to a rather odd plethora of bases. Quantity is implicit in
<br />
any natural aggregation resulting from logical operations. One number
<br />
might be:
<br />
<br />human.cell.molecule.atom.nucleus.proton.quark.fuzzy1.fuzzy2...fuzzyN
<br />
(fred.dandruffskincell.omega3.carbon.nucleus.3rd_proton.UP_quark1_string.loop_2.etc1.etc2.....)
<br />
<br />If you work in base &quot;atom&quot; arithmetic you have and arithmetic where atoms
<br />
associate with a remainder, say a unit in another base called .photon  
<br />
This is called chemistry.
<br />
<br />The human (and all the space that expresses it) is one single number
<br />
consisting of 'digits' that are all the cells(and interstitial molecules)
<br />
collected together according to affinities of fuzzyN, which acts in the
<br />
above 'number' like the integer I does to the set of integers expressed in
<br />
binary I mentioned above.
<br />
<br />There's no nice neat rows. No neat remainderless arithmetic.
<br />
<br />But it's all created with logical operators on an assumed elemental
<br />
'fuzzyN' (see above) primitive. '.fuzzyN' can be treated as an underlying
<br />
structural primitive 'pseudo-object' as a fundamental 'thing'. But .fuzzyN
<br />
can be just another logical relation between deeper primitives. There is
<br />
no depth limit to it.
<br />
<br />As to computation - I have already described what we do here in maths and
<br />
computation - all the same, really - all manipulating 'as-if' labeled
<br />
entities. At the instant we lose sight of the logical/relational nature of
<br />
what we are doing then we can delude ourselves that the symbols denote
<br />
real 'objects' such as those in platonia and - especially - if you happen
<br />
to 'be' a collection of these logical operations the rest of the logical
<br />
operations going on around you look very lumpy and thingy indeed! It looks
<br />
even more compellingly so when you it appears to obey empirical laws like
<br />
quantum mechanics and the Nernst equation when perception - made of the
<br />
same logical operations - presents you with a representation of it all
<br />
using that special logical aggregate called a brain.
<br />
<br /><br />In terms of the thread subject line, then, a chair is literally
<br />
mathematics going on. There's an infinity of other mathematics that can
<br />
symbolically fiddle with entities in an arithmetical base
<br />
linguistic_token_for_chair or perhaps linguistic_token_la_chaise, but in
<br />
coming into existence in the minds of humans we instantly lose the native
<br />
maths of which the chair is an expression - a computation - an unfolding
<br />
neverending proof - a theorem pushed along by the drive of the master
<br />
mathematician - the 2nd law of thermodynamics (= natural propensities for
<br />
.fuzzyN entities to associate recursively - see above).
<br />
<br />I think I might make sense here but as usual I remain skeptical of myself.
<br />
<br />cheers
<br />
<br />Colin Hales
