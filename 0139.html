Hi Mat
<br />
<br />I haven't checked out the archive yet either.  Wei - I'm not sure I follow
<br />
the instructions, but I'll give it a try.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 1. Mathematics is a continuum, putting it into discretely labelled packages
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; may hinder thought.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I'm not sure what this means . . . certainly our mathematical models of

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the universe represent it as continuous, but I don't know how mathematics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;itself can be a continuum . . . maybe you can fill me in . . .
</em><br />
<br />I'm just worrying about the semantics: Max's paper bounds each branch of mathematics by its name. The names imply a hierarchy, and the subsequent inference is that there is some equivalent hierarchy of realities.  My use of continuum only means there is a smooth transition from the simplest formal systems to the highest planes of mathematical thought. He even asks the question: Which mathematical structure is isomorphic to our Universe? I just have trouble with the discreteness of the packaging.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 2. I believe the total math continuum exists independently of any
</em><br />
universe
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Are you are suggesting that mathematical theorems are necessarily existent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;abstracty entities, like some people take propositions and states of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;affairs to be?  Or is this something else?
</em><br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Yes. Axioms are existent and therefore so is the entire (infinite) set of theorems, whether proven or not.  A line of proof require sentience, and I'm glad we agree anthropicism is a facile cop-out.... Propositions, I think, are not existent naturally: I'm not sure what you mean by states of affairs.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Also, what's a &quot;universe&quot; on your usage?  Is it a spatiotemporally unified
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;concrete set of existents?  Is it a possible world in some abstract
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;representationalist sense?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Yes to the first, no to the second, but you have made me rethink this. My original thought was that there's a line somewhere which can take you from a dimensionless set of axioms to our 3d+t universe - and to other spatiotemporal theorems or universes.  I think I'll stick with it: a universe in my book has to have dimension(s). But that is not a complete definition of universe.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 3. Assuming the total math is consistent (it seems to be so far), then it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; can never be complete (Godel): there is an infinity of theorems to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; discovered.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;There are undoubtedly an infinite number of theorems to be discovered, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this isn't a consequence of Godel's incompleteness proof as I understand
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it.  Godel's proof merely tells us that for every logical system, some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;statements that are strue in that system will necessarily be unprovable in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that system.  So is you are taking mathematics to be such a system, there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;will be within this sytem unprovable, but true theorems.
</em><br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I thought it was: you cannot have a complete and consistent system, but I guess I made a bad deduction there.  And I was just thinking the other day I'd better re-read Hofstadter - it's been ten years, and I'm no mathematician.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 4. We should regard theorems as the cause of physical laws, not just the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; explanations for them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Cause in what sense?  How does one set of abstract entities &quot;cause&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;another set of abstract entities?
</em><br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I agree. I don't mean cause-and-effect. Cause is not really the right word. I'm really trying to say our viewpoint should change a bit. As a very poor physics student of the 60s (there were always better things to do, it seemed), I used to think maths was the tool of the physicist, and a boring evil at that. I now see physics only as a resultant by-product.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 5. It follows from 3 and 4 that there exist mathematical causes for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; creation of an infinity of universes and all the physical laws pertinent
</em><br />
to
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; each universe: you can start with a set of axioms and arrive at a set of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; dimensions, a set of physics and a set of physical phenomena. And in any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; universe, if a theorem can have a valid physical representation, then the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; representation will be realised.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I don't see how this follows.  Not unless you are assuming that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mathematical theorems can somehow be the hylarchic cause of the universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (or all universes).  
</em><br />
<br />Yes. Although I'm ignorant of &quot;hylarchy&quot;!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The last statement here strikes me as a very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;questionable maxim.  Why assume that all (mathematically consistent?)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;possibilities will be actualized?
</em><br />
<br />Um.  You're right. If this Universe is finite in space and time then the infinity of actualizable theorems can never be manifest, I guess.  That was wishful thinking!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;On the normal causal model, concrete
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;existents must be appealed to in a causal explanation of concrete
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;existents.  Obviously this won't work in a causal explanation of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;entire universe (or set of universes).  But that, in itself, doesn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;justify appeal to such an anomalous form of causation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />Then we shall re-think the model, or our definitions. Does a virtual pair have concrete existence? Is quantum math the &quot;cause&quot; of the particles? I'd like to think so. Perhaps the concept of cause is too hard. Perhaps it's enough to say, something &quot;is&quot;, therefore something else &quot;is&quot;, or &quot;may be&quot;. The only reality in the nothingness or meta-void is mathematics: it may not be concrete, but there's nothing else to &quot;cause &quot; things.
