<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I would say no. But of course, the real question is, &quot;Why does it

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; matter?&quot; If I'm reading you correctly, you're taking the view that

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; it's the pattern of bits that matters, not what created it (or

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;caused&quot; it, or &quot;computed it&quot;, etc.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes. Suppose one of the components in my computer is defective but,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with incredible luck, is outputting the appropriate signals due to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thermal noise. Would it then make sense to say that the computer isn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;really&quot; running Firefox, but only pretending to do so, reproducing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Firefox behaviour but lacking the special Firefox
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; qualia-equivalent?
</em><br />
<br />Doesn't this antinomy arise because we equivocate on &quot;running Firefox&quot;.  Do we 
<br />
mean a causal chain of events in the computer according to a certain program 
<br />
specification or do we mean the appearance on the screen of the same thing that 
<br />
the causal chain would have produced?  We'd say &quot;no&quot; by the first meaning, but 
<br />
&quot;yes&quot; by the second.  Obviously, there the question is not black-and-white.  If 
<br />
the computer simply dropped a bit or two and miscolored a few pixels, no one 
<br />
would notice and no one would assert it wasn't running Firefox.  So really, when 
<br />
we talk about &quot;running Firefox&quot; we are referring to a fuzzy, holistic process 
<br />
that admits of degrees.
<br />
<br />I'm developing a suspicion of arguments that say &quot;suppose by accident...&quot;.  If 
<br />
we say that the (putative) possibility of something happening &quot;by accident&quot; 
<br />
destroys the relevance of it happening as part of a causal chain, we are, in a 
<br />
sense, rejecting the concept of causal chains and relations - and not just in 
<br />
consciousness, as your Firefox example illustrates.
<br />
<br />I wrote &quot;putative&quot; above because this kind of thought experiment hypothesizes 
<br />
events whose probability is infinitesimal.  If you take a finitist view, there 
<br />
is a lower bound to non-zero probabilities.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It would help me if I had a clearer idea of how you view
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; consciousness. I assume that, for you, if someone flips the squares on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; a Life board at random and creates the expected &quot;chaos&quot;, there's no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; consciousness there, but that there are certain configurations that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; could arise (randomly) that you would consider conscious. I assume
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that these patterns would show some kind of regularity - some kind of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; law-like behavior.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In the first instance, yes. But then the problem arises that under a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certain interpretation, the chaotic patterns could also be seen as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implementing any given computation. A common response to this is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; although it may be true in a trivial sense, as it is true that a block
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of marble contains every possible statue, it is useless to define
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something as a computation unless it can process information in a way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that interacts with its environment. This seems reasonable so far, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what if the putative computation is of a virtual world with conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observers? The trivial sense in which such a computation can be said
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to be hiding in chaos is no longer trivial, 
</em><br />
<br />It is still trivial in the sense that it could be said to instantiate all 
<br />
possible conscious worlds (at least up to some size limit).  Since we don't know 
<br />
what is necessary to instantiate consciousness, this seems much more speculative 
<br />
than saying the block of marble instantiates all computations - which we already 
<br />
agree is true only in a trivial sense.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;as I see no reason why the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness of these observers should be contingent on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possibility of interaction with the environment containing the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; substrate of their implementation. My conclusion from this is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness, in general, is not dependent on the orderly physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; activity which is essential for the computations that we observe.
</em><br />
<br />Yet this is directly contradicted by those specific instances in which 
<br />
consciousness is interrupted by disrupting the physical activity.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Rather, consciousness must be a property of the abstract computation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; itself, which leads to the conclusion that the physical world is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probably a virtual reality generated by the big computer in Platonia,
</em><br />
<br />This seems to me to be jumping to a conclusion by examining only one side of the 
<br />
argument and, finding it flawed, embracing the contrary.  Abstract computations 
<br />
are atemporal and don't have to be generated.  So it amounts to saying that the 
<br />
physical world just IS in virtue of there being some mapping between the world 
<br />
and some computation.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; since there is no basis for believing that there is a concrete
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical world separate from the necessarily existing virtual one.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It's not easy for me to explain why I think it matters what kind of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; process (or in Platonia, what kind of abstract computation) generated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that order. But it's also not easy for me to understand the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; alternative view. During those stretches of time when the random field
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of bits is creating a pattern that you would call conscious, what do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; you *mean* when you say it's conscious? By definition, you can't mean
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; anything about how it's reacting to its environment, or that it's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; doing something &quot;because of&quot; something else, etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I know what I mean by consciousness, being intimately associated with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it myself, but I can't explain it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; I think there is a partial zombie problem regardless of whether
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Unification or Duplication is accepted.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Can you elaborate on this? What partial zombie problem do you see that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Unification doesn't address?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If by &quot;Unification&quot; you mean the idea that two identical brains with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; identical input will result in only one consciousness, I don't see how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this solves the conceptual problem of partial zombies. What would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happen if an identical part of both brains were replaced with a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non-concious but otherwise identically functioning equivalent?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; And do you think that the move away from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;physical reality&quot; to &quot;mathematical reality&quot; solves that problem? If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; so, how?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The Fading Qualia argument proves functionalism, assuming that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical behaviour of the brain is computable (some people like Roger
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Penrose dispute this). Functionalism then leads to the conclusion that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness isn't dependent on physical activity, as discussed in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the recent threads. So, either functionalism is wrong, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness resides in the Platonic realm.
</em><br />
<br />Of there's something wrong with the argument that functionalism implies 
<br />
consciousness isn't dependent on physical activity.  As Bruno points out 
<br />
&quot;physical activity&quot; is not so well defined at a fundamental level and neither is 
<br />
&quot;consciousness&quot;.
