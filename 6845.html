I continue to describe a different way of talking than that
<br />
used by Stathis, who writes
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [Saibal writes]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The same is true here. It must follow from the laws of physics (which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; include the effects of simulations) that there are indeed many more copies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of you at t2.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, we can say that there are more *copies*, i.e. more instantiations,
<br />
and that these provide altogether more runtime at t2 (whatever X is).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In dealing with this type of problem you have to consider not only the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics, which I'm sure you understand much better than I do, but also the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; psychology of how the first person experience of being a unique individual 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; persisting through time is constructed from observer moment building blocks. 
</em><br />
<br />Yes, nature would naturally construct creatures that looked at it
<br />
this way. It would not do, for example, for a lion to have other
<br />
than a single memory stream that described his current environment,
<br />
and, to the degree it is useful, how he got there.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is not as obvious as may first appear; specifically, it does not follow 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in general that more copies/ greater measure at time t = more likely to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience time t. The important thing to keep in mind is that each 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; individual experiences only one OM at a time.
</em><br />
<br />As I say it, one is *certain* to experience time t under your
<br />
hypothesis. I consider whether one experiences time t to be
<br />
an objective question: an examination of, say, the solar system
<br />
during a certain interval (Jan 2006 to Dec 2006) reveals that
<br />
either Stathis got runtime there or he didn't.
<br />
<br />But &quot;only one OM at a time&quot;?  No, not if we are speaking of time
<br />
in the objective sense: again, a piecemeal examination of a certain
<br />
region of space could easily show that Stathis is running at two
<br />
separate locations even at the same time t1.  In fact, one possibility
<br />
is that Stathis(X1, t1) has the same OM as Stathis(X2, t1).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If I consider the future, then there is a potential that I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could &quot;become&quot; any of the many OM's who consider me to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in their past.
</em><br />
<br />I suggest that it is better to drop the language of probability
<br />
here. It is *certain* that you will become all the Stathis's 
<br />
of 2006. You will be some of them in greater measure than others.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, when I arrive at the future, and also when I remember
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the past, I consider myself to be unique. All the other OM's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which from a third person perspective are other versions of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;me&quot; (and this third person perspective includes me looking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at my potential futures) from my perspective are completely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; separate people.
</em><br />
<br />I would say that they are separate instances, but not separate
<br />
people. (A corollary from the usual belief that we are the same
<br />
person from day to day even though our memories, obviously, are
<br />
not identical.) You are the same person that you were yesterday,
<br />
and tomorrow you will be the same person you are today, unless
<br />
we do great violence to what we mean by &quot;person&quot;.  Derek Parfit
<br />
in &quot;Reasons and Persons&quot; (1986) analyses this in great detail,
<br />
along with Mike Perry in &quot;Forever For All&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So if I am told that tomorrow I will be copied ten times and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one of these copies will be tortured, I am worried, because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that means there is a 1/10 chance I will be tortured.
</em><br />
<br />Good example, but I would say that you will be tortured with
<br />
100% probability at some places, and tortured with 0% probability
<br />
at nine others. The characterization of a piece of matter &quot;Stathis
<br />
is undergoing torture&quot; is looked upon from the 3rd person as an
<br />
entirely physically characterized objective process.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But when tomorrow comes and I am not the torture victim, I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relieved, because it is someone else who is suffering, and I can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; feel sorry for him in the way I feel sorry for suffering strangers.
</em><br />
<br />I suggest that this is not the correct, selfish way that you should
<br />
look at it. It's just the same as in MWI when there &quot;really is&quot; a
<br />
version of you who saw the other outcome. He's you. I have a so-called
<br />
proof of this proposition at <a href="http://www.leecorbin.com/dupproof.html">http://www.leecorbin.com/dupproof.html</a>
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What this means is that if you trace an individual's history from his birth 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to his ultimate demise (which may never come, if QTI is correct), at each 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time point he is associated with only *one* OM.
</em><br />
<br />Perhaps my insistence wherever possible of describing what is
<br />
happening in our universe from the 3rd person is responsible
<br />
for our different ways of talking.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Two or more individuals may share two or more OM's at some point
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in their life, for example when a duplication occurs, but from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the point of view of each of them, they still only experience one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OM at a time for their entire life history. Two OM's may 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; also &quot;combine&quot; in one of two ways: either a third OM exists with the content 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the other two, or they do not really combine but a later OM has the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; memory of having been both in the past. The one OM per time point for each 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; individual rule is maintained.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The conclusion from the above is that the absolute measure of an individual 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at any time point, from that individual's point of view, is unity. When 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; looking into the future, the other copies in the multiverse do matter, but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in this case it is the relative measure of different outcomes rather than 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the absolute measure which is important. Once the future becomes present, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the other copies from the first person perspective are just other people.
</em><br />
<br />Well, we aren't yet used to having more than one of us around
<br />
at any given time. Perhaps our gut feelings on this issue will
<br />
change when the technology allows duplicates. I, for example,
<br />
would never dream of regarding my duplicate as another person.
<br />
He's me, just running at a different location. (Just as, for
<br />
example, my future and past selves are also me, just running
<br />
at different times.)
<br />
