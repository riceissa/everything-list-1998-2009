If we consider measuring the spin of a particle, you could also say that the
<br />
two possible outcomes just exist and thatthere are two possible future
<br />
versions of me. There is no meaningful way to associate myself with either
<br />
of the two outcomes.
<br />
<br />But then, precisely this implies that after a measurement and forgetting
<br />
about the result will yield a version of me who is in a similar position as
<br />
that earlier version of me who had yet to make the measurement. If one could
<br />
perform measurements in a reversible way, this would be possible to
<br />
experimentally confirm, as David Deutsch pointed out. You can start with a
<br />
spin polarized in the x direction. Then you measure the z-component. There
<br />
then exists a unitary transformation which leads to the observer forgetting
<br />
about the outcome of the measurement and to the spin to be restored in the
<br />
original state. The observer does remember having measured the z-component
<br />
of the spin.
<br />
<br />Then, measuring the x-component again will yield &quot;spin-up&quot; with 100%
<br />
probability, confirming that both branches in which the observer measured
<br />
spin up and spin down have coherently recombined. This then proves that had
<br />
the observer measured the z-component, the outcome would not be a priori
<br />
determined, despite the observer having measured it earlier. So, both
<br />
branches are real. But then this is true in general, also if the quantum
<br />
state is of the form:
<br />
<br />|You&gt;[|spin up&gt;|rest of the world knows the spin is up&gt; + |spin down&gt;|rest
<br />
of the world knows spin is down&gt;]
<br />
<br />although you cannot directly verify it here. But that means that you cannot
<br />
rule out an alternative theory in which only one of the branches is real
<br />
when performing a measurement in this case. But if the reality of both
<br />
branches is accepted, then each time you make a measurement and you don't
<br />
know the outcome, the outcome is not fixed (proovided, of course, there is
<br />
indeed more than one branch).

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I've written up a small article about the idea that you could end up in a

different sector of the multiverse by selective memory erasure. I had
<br />
written about that possibility a long time ago on this list, but now I've
<br />
made the argument more rigorous.
<br />
<br />Saibal, I have to say that I disagree.  As you acknowledge, erasing memory
<br />
doesn't recohere the branches.  There is no meaningful sense in which you
<br />
could end up in a different branch due to memory erasure.
<br />
<br />You admit the 'effect' has no observable consequences.  But it has no
<br />
unobservable meaning either.
<br />
<br />In fact, other than what I call 'causal differentiation', which clearly will
<br />
track the already-decohered branches (so you don't get to reshuffle the
<br />
deck), there is no meaningful sense in which &quot;you&quot; will end up in one
<br />
particular future branch at all.  Other than causal differentiation
<br />
tracking, either 'you' are all of your future branches, or 'you' are just
<br />
here for the moment and are none of them.
