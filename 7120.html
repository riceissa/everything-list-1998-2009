<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that we just said we are allowed to do it.  But it doesn't really make 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sense.
</em><br />
<br />We do experience continuity of consciousness, despite the fact that we may 
<br />
be completely different physically. If you got into a Star Trek type 
<br />
teleporter, the idea is that your body is destructively analysed, the 
<br />
information sent to a distant place, and there your body is rebuilt from 
<br />
local raw materials. As far as you are concerned, you walk into the machine 
<br />
in one place, then suddenly find yourself in a different place. There is no 
<br />
test you could do to show that the teleported person isn't &quot;really you&quot;, 
<br />
assuming the machine works properly. But what if the machine malfunctions, 
<br />
and you are *not* destructively analysed? There are now two of you, one 
<br />
local and one distant. The local version will argue that he is the 
<br />
&quot;original&quot;, and that he now realises that the machine's designers are 
<br />
actually murderers, who kill people and create imposters able to fool 
<br />
everyone (including themselves) that no crime has taken place. The distant 
<br />
version will argue that as he is an exact copy, both versions have an equal 
<br />
right to claim they are the &quot;real&quot; you. If the two versions meet, they are 
<br />
likely to become bitter enemies, especially when it comes to deciding who 
<br />
gets the house, the wife etc.
<br />
<br />Before you had this problem with the two versions existing simultaneously, 
<br />
you were quite happy to use the teleporter, and quite happy to let the guy 
<br />
who came out at the destination carry on as if he were &quot;you&quot;. Now, you see 
<br />
him as a rival and a fake. You can think of other examples like this. You 
<br />
are saving money for your future; but if your future self comes back in a 
<br />
time machine and withdraws all the money and spends it, arguing that this is 
<br />
what it was for all along, you will be annoyed. Another: if all the atoms in 
<br />
your body that are excreted and lost were actually saved and assembled into 
<br />
another body, that person could claim to be the &quot;original&quot;, and you just the 
<br />
copy.
<br />
<br />The point of all this is that you basically are just a series of copies (not 
<br />
even exact copies), and the only reason this is not obvious is that the 
<br />
copies never meet. If they did meet, they certainly wouldn't have the same 
<br />
concern for each other as they do for themselves; they would have the view 
<br />
that the other guy is just someone who looks like me and thinks he's me, but 
<br />
obviously isn't me, because *I'm* the only one who is me!
<br />
<br />Having made this point, I certainly wouldn't advocate &quot;living for the 
<br />
moment&quot; as the right thing to do. How we live our lives has nothing to do 
<br />
with these sorts of philosophical issues, and everything to do with how our 
<br />
brains have evolved. If you point out to a patient that phantom limb pain is 
<br />
&quot;irrational&quot; because their limb has actually been amputated, it doesn't make 
<br />
the pain go away.
