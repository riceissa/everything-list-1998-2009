<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     I would like for you to consider that we should not take OMs as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;objective processes&quot; but the result of &quot;objective processes&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />Of course, I will bow to whatever word usage is favored by most of
<br />
the people, or by those who have the longest experience with the
<br />
term. I merely want to assert that I don't and never have found
<br />
any real value in what is not objective. 
<br />
<br />For example, if I am poked with a needle and cry out, one may wish
<br />
to proclaim to me &quot;see, you do have a subjective reality&quot;.  &quot;Oh, that
<br />
really hurt,&quot; I'll admit &quot;but if you want to really know what happened
<br />
then the needle caused some nerves in my finger to fire, which caused
<br />
other nerves to fire and so on. I am a process fashioned by evolution
<br />
to object to actions like poking me.&quot;
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I shudder every time I read of notions that imply some kind of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; knowledge of &quot;reality in itself&quot;!
</em><br />
<br />Yeah, well now you know how it feels!  :-)   Feels, that is, every
<br />
time that someone speaks of inner truths not accessible to anyone
<br />
else, not accessible in *principle* to anyone else. I don't consider
<br />
those things to rank very highly on the scale of truth.
<br />
<br />It boils down, as you hint, to what we mean by &quot;knowledge&quot;.  Casting
<br />
aside the incredibly mistaken quest for &quot;certainty&quot;, we ought to 
<br />
speak of that which can be objectively known in principle. It doesn't
<br />
ever do any good to speak of anything else. Sure, ask someone if he
<br />
or she has a headache---but if you want to think about it strictly,
<br />
then it is a state (or a succession of states constituting a process)
<br />
in that person's brain.  I repeat my challenge: find *one* thing that
<br />
is subjectively &quot;known&quot; or investigable or knowable by introspection
<br />
that was not &quot;known&quot; by the ancients.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; How is it that we simply can not seem to acknowledge what we can not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; know Existence in-itself and merely must rely upon logical rules, gleamed 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from multiple attempts, to figure out good models of &quot;what we think is going 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on&quot; and not try to fool ourselves that we can somehow abstract away 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ourselves from our deliberations about the nature of *Reality*?
</em><br />
<br />First, the models (as you call them) were provided by evolutionary processes
<br />
that finally led to one's own embryonic and fetal development. As a two
<br />
year old, you know that sometimes it's light and sometimes it's dark,
<br />
unless your brain is malformed or malfunctioning.  There is *so* much
<br />
true knowledge of that form accessible to a two-year old that it's
<br />
staggering.
<br />
<br />Yet no one except a naive child supposes that there is any absolute certainty
<br />
to his knowledge, or is unaware of the processes that put information about
<br />
outside events (and some internal ones) into his brain. So I reject the claim
<br />
that I or people like me believe &quot;we can know Existence in-itself&quot; as you write.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Let me try to boil this down a little, how is it even consistent to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; claim that some &quot;set of states&quot; completely represents a &quot;process&quot;? The 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumption here seems to beg us to assume that a static representation can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; faithfully capture all of the transitive properties implicit in the notion 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of process.
</em><br />
<br />Oh, here I agree with you.  I consider the speculations of the Everything
<br />
Platonic monists to be, er, speculations only. Those conjectures have not
<br />
even *begun* to pass the test of time, i.e., have not endured much criticism
<br />
as yet, and certainly cannot be said to have survived much criticism. Your
<br />
real knowledge, (for example, that some people have been to Hawaii or that
<br />
you have two hands or that four gas giants revolve around the sun), has
<br />
survived the tests of time.
<br />

<br />
<br />P.S. I'll reply to Colin's post in a while.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; For me this is equivalent to claiming that Becoming can be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; derived from Being. I would truly like someone to explain this idea to me! 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;From what I can figure it is easy to show how Being can derive from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Becoming, so why the kicking against the pricks trying to go backwards?
