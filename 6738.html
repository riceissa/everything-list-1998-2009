<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probably doesn't work.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Back when I wasn't long in the field of video production I was well aware

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the insistance and belief of &gt;TV engineers that a single tube industrial

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;quality, etc. and &gt;came to the conclusion that it shouldn't be a problem. 2

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;years later I got the chance to prove it when a &gt;local news station sent a

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;crew out to cover something that I was shooting. In the end I gave them 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;the editied sequence I had shot (now down two generations), and they took 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it and edited it into their &gt;story, which would have taken it down a third. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Then they broadcasted it over the air. I taped it off-air and &gt;the results 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;were conclusive - I was right, all the nay-sayer engineers were wrong. A

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;$40,000 Ikegami  &gt;vs a $1,500 Panasonic and it was a tie except for one

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;slight red bleed from a costume due to the &gt;Saticon tube bias toward red in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the camera I used, which could have been color corrected with a time &gt;base 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;corrector, but whoever dubbed the tape left the red level a little too hot.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;My point being that that was the first in a long line of &quot;you can'ts&quot; that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I've faced which I eventually &gt;proved, &quot;you can&quot;. Thus I have a dim view of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;such positions when they aren't backed up with &gt;experiments that prove so 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;*conclusively*. As long as the possibility exists, I keep an open mind. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Besides, if unbriddled skepticism was right all the time, we wouldn't be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;using computers, flying, or &gt;even have phones of any kind, just to name a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;few things.
</em><br />
<br />There is a fundamental difference between claims that we can never do 
<br />
something because the engineering problems are too great, and claims that we 
<br />
can never do something because the laws of physics themselves say it's 
<br />
impossible. For example, I've heard people say things like &quot;I'm sure we'll 
<br />
eventually break the light-speed barrier, after all, once people thought it 
<br />
was impossible that we'd ever break the sound barrier but they've been 
<br />
proved wrong&quot;. But the two are not really comparable, because no one ever 
<br />
thought the laws of physics said breaking the sound barrier was impossible, 
<br />
they just thought the technical challenges to doing so would be too 
<br />
difficult, whereas the light-speed barrier is built into the basic structure 
<br />
of relativity (although there are possible loopholes in general relativity 
<br />
like wormholes, where you get to distant destinations quickly without ever 
<br />
*locally* exceeding the speed of light).
<br />
<br />Similarly, when Hal Finney suggests he thinks interworld communication is 
<br />
impossible, I think he's suggesting that it would violate basic principles 
<br />
of QM, not that it's too big of a technical challenge. I also saw this 
<br />
suggested in the book &quot;Schrodinger's Rabbits&quot; by Colin Bruce, a pop science 
<br />
book about the MWI (p. 137):
<br />
<br />&quot;If only we could do a clear and unambiguous communication-between-worlds 
<br />
experiment. Then there would be no room for argument about the reality of 
<br />
many-worlds. Unfortunately, the laws of physics do not seem to allow such a 
<br />
thing.
<br />
<br />&quot;This is frustrating because two potentially useful methods of harnessing 
<br />
the power of many-worlds, which we will look at in detail shortly, can be 
<br />
described in terms of sharing resources between worlds, or even sharing 
<br />
information between worlds. For example, a loose way of describing the 
<br />
operation of a quantum computer is as follows: As worlds start to diverge, 
<br />
hundreds of billions of different copies of the computer come into 
<br />
existence. Each of these computer copies can work on a different 
<br />
calculation. The shared results of their labors, however, can be made 
<br />
available to all the diverging worlds created when the bubble of Hilbert 
<br />
space describing the computer is systematically collapsed by measurement at 
<br />
the end of the calculation.
<br />
<br />&quot;This makes it sound as if Hilbert space might possibly be used as a kind of 
<br />
mailbox for communicating between worlds. Unfortunately, the mathematics 
<br />
that describes Hilbert space rules this out because it implies that 
<br />
everything that goes on in Hilbert space is reversible. As soon as you try 
<br />
to take information out of Hilbert space, that reversibility is destroyed. 
<br />
Such acts of measurement, by definition, cause decoherence. You can preserve 
<br />
multiworld access to a bubble of Hilbert space only by allowing it to evolve 
<br />
undisturbed. It reminds me of C.S. Lewis's &quot;Wood Between the Worlds&quot; 
<br />
described in the Magician's Nephew. Any Hilbert space accessible from more 
<br />
than one world line must be a timeless place, in which we can leave no 
<br />
permanent mark.&quot;
<br />
<br />If this is correct (and I don't understand this stuff well enough to say for 
<br />
sure it is), then inter-world communication would only be possible if it 
<br />
turned out that the existing principles of QM were wrong, and that they 
<br />
ended up being modified by some future theory (quantum gravity, perhaps) in 
<br />
a way that removes these fundamental obstacles.
