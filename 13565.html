Hi,
<br />
<br />RUSSEL
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; All I can say is that I don't understand your distinction. You have
</em><br />
introduced a new term &quot;necessary primitive&quot; - what on earth is that? But
<br />
I'll let this pass, it probably isn't important.
<br />
<br />COLIN
<br />
Oh no you don't!! It matters. Bigtime...
<br />
<br />Take away the necessary primitive: no 'qualititative novelty'
<br />
Take away the water molecules: No lake.
<br />
Take away the bricks, no building
<br />
Take away the atoms: no molecules
<br />
Take away the cells: no human
<br />
Take away the humans: no humanity
<br />
Take away the planets: no solar system
<br />
Take away the X: No emergent Y
<br />
Take away the QUALE: No qualia
<br />
<br />Magical emergence is when but claim Y exists but you can't
<br />
identify an X. Such as:
<br />
<br />Take away the X: No qualia
<br />
<br />but then....you claim qualia result from 'information complexity' or
<br />
'computation' or 'function' and you fail to say what X can be. Nobody can.
<br />
<br />You can't use an object derived using the contents of
<br />
consciousness(observation) to explain why there are any contents of
<br />
consciousness(observation) at all. It is illogical. (see the wigner quote
<br />
below). I find the general failure to recognise this brute reality very
<br />
exasperating.
<br />
<br />COLIN
<br />
&lt;snip&gt;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So this means that in a computer abstraction.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; d(KNOWLEDGE(t))
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ---------------  is already part of KNOWLEDGE(t)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;       dt
</em><br />
<br />RUSSEL
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No its not. dK/dt is generated by the interaction of the rules with the
</em><br />
environment.
<br />
<br />No. No. No. There is the old assumption thing again.
<br />
<br />How, exactly, are you assuming that the agent 'interacts' with the
<br />
environment? This is the world external to the agent, yes?. Do not say
<br />
&quot;through sensory measurement&quot;, because that will not do. There are an
<br />
infinite number of universes that could give rise to the same sensory
<br />
measurements. We are elctromagnetic objects. Basic EM theory. Proven
<br />
mathematical theorems. The solutions are not unique for an isolated
<br />
system.
<br />
<br />Circularity.Circularity.Circularity.
<br />
<br />There is _no interaction with the environment_ except for that provided by
<br />
the qualia as an 'as-if' proxy for the environment. The origins of an
<br />
ability to access the distal external world in support of such a proxy is
<br />
mysterious but moot. It can and does happen, and that ability must come
<br />
about because we live in the kind of universe that supports that
<br />
possibility. The mysteriousness of it is OUR problem.
<br />
<br />RUSSEL
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Evolutionary algorithms are highly effective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information pumps, pumping information from the environment into the
</em><br />
genome, or whatever representation you're using to store the solutions.
<br />
<br />COLIN
<br />
But then we're not talking about merely being 'highly effective'
<br />
in a target problem domain, are we? We are talking about proving
<br />
consciousness in a machine. I agree - evolutionary algoritms are great
<br />
things... they are just irrelevant to this discussion.
<br />
<br />COLIN
<br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; My scientific claim is that the electromagnetic field structure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; literally the third person view of qualia.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; Eh? Electromagnetic field of what? The brain? If so, do you think
</em><br />
that
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; chemical potentiation plays no role at all in qualia?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Chemical potentiation IS electric field.
</em><br />
<br />RUSSEL
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bollocks. A hydrogen molecule and an oxygen atom held 1m apart have
</em><br />
chemical potential, but there is precious little electric field
<br />
<br />I am talking about the membrane and you are talking atoms so I guess we
<br />
missed somehow...anyway....The only 'potentiation' that really matters in
<br />
my model is that which looks like an 'action potential' longitudinally 
<br />
traversing dendrite/soma/axon membrane as a whole.
<br />
<br />Notwithstanding this....
<br />
<br />The chemical potentiation at the atomic level is entirely an EM phenomenon
<br />
mediated by QM boundaries (virtual photons in support of the shell
<br />
structure, also EM). It is a sustained 'well/energy minimaum' in the EM
<br />
field structure....You think there is such a 'thing' as potential? There
<br />
is no such thing - there is something we describe as 'EM field'. Nothing
<br />
else. Within that metaphor is yet another even more specious metaphor:
<br />
Potential is an (as yet unrealised) propensity of the field at a
<br />
particular place to do work on a charge if it were put it there. You can
<br />
place that charge in it and get a number out of an electrophysiological
<br />
probe... and 'realise' the work (modify the fields) itself- but there's no
<br />
'thing' that 'is' the potential.
<br />
<br />Not only that: The fields are HUGE &gt; 10^11 volts/meter. Indeed the
<br />
entrapment of protons in the nucleus requires the strong nuclear force to
<br />
overcome truly stupendous repulsive fields. I know beause I am quite
<br />
literally doing tests in molecular dynamics simulations of the E-M field
<br />
at the single charge level. The fields are massive and change at
<br />
staggeringly huge rates, especially at the atomic level. However....Their
<br />
net level in the vicinity of 20Angstroms away falls off dramatically. But
<br />
this is not the vicinity of any 'chemical reaction'.
<br />
<br />And again I say : there is nothing else there but charge and its fields.
<br />
<br />When you put your hand on a table the reason it doesn't pass through it
<br />
even though table and hand are mostly space ...is because electrons
<br />
literally meet and repulse electrons.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; between them. Furthermore, the chemical potential is independent on the
</em><br />
separation, unlike the electric field.
<br />
<br />Nope. There is a &quot;potential well&quot; close in to the relvent atoms, created
<br />
on approach by the near-EM field interactions close in.....The field draws
<br />
the atoms together and the resulting field stablises the result (emitting
<br />
photons or creating other sources of kinetic energy as necessary). In
<br />
femtochemistry the exquisite detail of the interrelationships of the
<br />
fields determines the detail as they approach each other. The words
<br />
&quot;chemical potential&quot; is just a metaphor for the potential well in close to
<br />
the participants...no wonder it is independent of distance - the well is
<br />
in close! . There is no such 'thing' as 'chemical'. There is no such
<br />
'thing' as mechanical, including 'quantum mechanical'. There is just
<br />
something: ...where some of it bahaves like charge/fields with/without
<br />
mass and the rest of it behaves like space.
<br />
<br />RUSSEL
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You're obviously suggesting single neurons have qualia. Forgive me for
</em><br />
being a little sceptical of this suggestion...
<br />
<br />There are so many good reasons to hold them accountable ..... Read the
<br />
recent book by Jon Edwards...In any event - I hold the FIELD accountable.
<br />
The fact that it happens to be delivered by astrocytes/neuron membranes is
<br />
incidental. If you have to be skeptical about something, please be
<br />
skeptical about the right thing for a good reason!
<br />
<br />In a critical argument about hypothesis viability it stacks up. I have
<br />
truckloads of empirical correlates consistent with it. Neurons and
<br />
astrocytes can have their own qualia. They can participate collaboratively
<br />
to construct more complex qualia. It's all self-similar/recursive. And, as
<br />
a result...I have a 'necessary primitive' in the electric field. No
<br />
membrane field =  No qualia.
<br />
<br />That the perfect field happens to be implemented in the membrane of
<br />
astrocytes and neurons is not relvant. An inorganically produced field
<br />
with the same spatiotemporal characteristics should be produce the same
<br />
effect (virtual bosons).
<br />
<br />The fact that it may be difficult (at this stage) to see HOW this may
<br />
deliver qualia is not relevant: especially when the circumstances of the
<br />
claim are at an epistemological cul-de-sac that precisely predicts
<br />
a-priori that very difficulty....consider Eugene Wigner in &quot;Are we
<br />
machines?&quot; in 1960s...P96. Top right. In respect of scientific laws:
<br />
<br />&quot;The primitive facts in terms of which the laws are formulated are not the
<br />
positions of atoms, but the results of observations. It seems
<br />
inconsistent, therefore, to explain the state of mind of the observer, his
<br />
apperception of the result of an observation, in terms of
<br />
concepts, such as positions of atoms, which have to be explained,
<br />
then, in terms of the content of consciousness&quot;
<br />
<br />Wigner is too reserved...Instead of &quot;It seems inconsistent...&quot; I would say
<br />
&quot;It's at best completely meaningless and at worst a grave mistake....&quot;.
<br />
<br />Over to Quentin's post...
<br />
<br />cheers
