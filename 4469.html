I would propose (as I layed out in some detail in a post about
<br />
3 months ago) that their are in fact many constraints on those
<br />
states-of-affairs that can be said to &quot;exist&quot;.
<br />
<br />I would put it this way: Only those states and state changes
<br />
capable of supporting communities of communicating intelligent
<br />
observers &quot;exist&quot;. Other, weirder states only &quot;potentially exist&quot;,
<br />
but a better way of saying it is that they are &quot;partially
<br />
qualified to exist, but not fully&quot;. They are &quot;partially qualified&quot;
<br />
in the sense of being configurations of information, as are the
<br />
more self-consistent &quot;existable&quot; states, but they are not 
<br />
self-consistent enough to exist.
<br />
<br />This amounts to a definition of &quot;exist&quot; more than anything else.
<br />
<br />Factors:
<br />
<br />1. The &quot;consistent enough to exist (and be commonly perceived)&quot;
<br />
states must not only be able to support a single observer, but
<br />
the whole ecosystem of observers that allows that observer to 
<br />
exist, and the whole physical set-up (planet, gravity, particular
<br />
gaseous mixtures, particular energy and temperature regimes etc)
<br />
that allows communities of intelligent agents to exist and observe.
<br />
<br />Any state changes (at any time) that would deviate from the 
<br />
maintenance of the consistent physical laws that allow for 
<br />
conventional existence of stable emergent systems and 
<br />
intelligent observers will be automatically disqualified
<br />
from full observable existence.
<br />
<br />2. My contention is that this is an onerous constraint on
<br />
&quot;fully existable states&quot;, and that the number of possible
<br />
configurations of such states is probably very limited.
<br />
It wouldn't surprise me if something very close to the known
<br />
physical constants and laws turned out to be actually
<br />
&quot;logically necessary&quot; for the continual self-consistency
<br />
requirement of existable states that I propose. It could be
<br />
that ALL other configurations of matter, energy, information
<br />
become inconsistent (or too disordered, or too ordered) quickly,
<br />
and disqualify themselves from &quot;observer production&quot; and 
<br />
&quot;full-fledged (classical) existence&quot;.
<br />
<br />3. This is not to say that every action that every person
<br />
for example takes is &quot;necessary&quot; for continued full existence
<br />
of the classical, existing, &quot;way things actually are&quot; state.
<br />
But it means that such personal actions are heavily 
<br />
constrained by the way things had to be in the historical
<br />
development of our species, and its body's capabilities and
<br />
its brain's capabilities. 
<br />
And so human behaviour, on average, will be as determined
<br />
by our nature, and all of that (narrow) range of behaviour
<br />
will be within the narrow bounds of &quot;fully existable&quot; states.
<br />
<br />4. It seems to me that &quot;self-consistency&quot; and 
<br />
&quot;rule-governed, effectively continuous, localized change&quot; of 
<br />
state are the necessary pre-conditions of sequences of 
<br />
states that can be fully existent (observable).
<br />
<br />Bear in mind that these requirements must be met to the full
<br />
extent of allowing non-locally consistent existence. i.e.
<br />
a whole consistent universe (observable and agreeable by all 
<br />
observers in it) must be possible with those
<br />
state-change rules, not just one person's consistent life-story.
<br />
<br />That's a very heavy constraint on state-changes. ALL of those
<br />
state changes must conserve the non-locally-consistent full
<br />
universe life-story without discrepency.
<br />
<br />5. My intuition says that these very heavy consistency and 
<br />
continuity requirements (on &quot;fully existable state change sequences&quot;)
<br />
would probably rule out travel or communication by observers between
<br />
different possible worlds. 
<br />
<br /><br />And would probably rule out there being a different calculus
<br />
of consequence and probability in a MWI compared to an SWI.
<br />
<br />Only each &quot;self-consistent world&quot; can be a &quot;possible world&quot;.
<br />
Most sets S where S is a &quot;set of alternative possible worlds&quot;
<br />
will not be themselves (as a set S) able to be self-consistent 
<br />
enough to be a fully existent &quot;world&quot;. Or another way of putting it is
<br />
that if a set S of alternative possible worlds is itself
<br />
self-consistent (over spatiotemporal evolution of its states) then
<br />
it collapses by definition into being a single world, not
<br />
a set of different worlds.
