<br />
As I mentioned in my last email, I'm new to this list.  So if
<br />
this topic has already been discussed, I apologize.
<br />
<br />The argument I want to make is related to the &quot;Doomsday 
<br />
argument&quot; that I just read on one of your websites (I can't
<br />
remember whose).  In that argument, one draws conclusions
<br />
about one's environment based on the proposition that the
<br />
SAS that you are is likely to be an &quot;average&quot; one.  That is,
<br />
each of us can assume that we are a sort of random sample
<br />
among all possible SAS's of similar complexity.  That's
<br />
the most general form of the statement that I would feel
<br />
comfortable making.
<br />
<br />It seems plausible that our complexity, or our information-
<br />
processing capability, is not an accident.  If it were much
<br />
less, we would probably not be self-aware.  I don't know
<br />
why it's not much more than it is, although I (of course)
<br />
have a theory about that too.
<br />
<br />Anyway, Tegmark, in his paper, made some rather extravagant
<br />
claims, IMO, that:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears likely that the most basic mathematical
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;structures that we humans have uncovered to date are
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the somae as those that other SASs would find.
<br />
<br />He attempted to justify this idea using anthropic reasoning,
<br />
which I found awfully dubious.  I just don't have the
<br />
confidence that he expresses that we humans aren't &quot;missing
<br />
something&quot; when it comes to the types of mathematical 
<br />
structures possible.  I would guess that the field of
<br />
mathematics just keeps getting more varied, more bizarre,
<br />
and more rich, the more it is studied.  How could we possibly
<br />
know that there aren't more SAS-supporting structures of types
<br />
that we cannot yet dream?
<br />
<br />On the other hand, I believe that one can reason that the
<br />
environment we find ourselves in must be as it is, or at least
<br />
must be typical, using the concept that each of us is a
<br />
typical SAS.
<br />
<br />It's very simple:  if the measure of the infinite number of
<br />
SAS's allowed by one mathematical structure A is greater than
<br />
that in structure B, then we *must* find ourselves A or in
<br />
yet another structure with an even greater measure.  That is,
<br />
we must find ourselves in the structure which admits the
<br />
largest number of SAS's of our complexity.
<br />
<br />This idea first occured to me when pondering the vast number
<br />
of branches allowed by MWI QM.  I haven't investigated this
<br />
fully, but I think it's of the order of 2^c, where c is the
<br />
cardinality of the real numbers.  I could be wrong.  Anyway,
<br />
it's big.
<br />
<br />The logical continuation of this idea is that the order of
<br />
SAS's allowed in our mathematical structure must be utterly
<br />
unbounded.  I don't know how to describe this, perhaps
<br />
Aleph-infinity.  Isn't it true that for any infinite cardinal
<br />
number, there is another that is of a higher order?  I'm a
<br />
little rusty on this - I have to re-read my primer on 
<br />
infinities.  But I just wanted to get this idea out, so my
<br />
terminology might be screwed up.
<br />
<br />But how could the cardinality of the allowable SAS's in our
<br />
mathematical structure be &quot;utterly unbounded&quot;.  The only way
<br />
that I can conceive of this is that the laws of physics
<br />
are an infinitely deep well of complexity.  That, for example,
<br />
when we find a theory of quantum gravity, that it allows for
<br />
yet a higher order of SAS's than that allowed by the standard
<br />
model.  But then we would find that that is still not the
<br />
ultimate theory, and when we dig further, we find yet more
<br />
possibilities.  I can't see any aesthetic reason for assuming
<br />
that the &quot;structure&quot; we are in would ever be completely well
<br />
demarcated to us, in our frog perspective.
<br />
<br />Thoughts?
