<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (BTW please delete any previous version of this posted in error.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm absolutely sincere in what I've said about approaching comp in 'as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if' mode.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />All right. I thought so. Let us try to see if and where we differ.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But at the same time I've hoped from the beginning that we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could make explicit the choices that motivate our different ontic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; starting assumptions. Are there perhaps irreconcilable issues of style
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or preference, or are there fundamental logical, philosophical, or even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; semantic errors entailed in one or other position? Well, let me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; continue in the effort by trying to clarify my position on some of your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recent points.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; So, either you put in AR something which is not there (like peter D
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Jones who want me doing &quot;Aristotle error&quot; on the numbers (like if I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; reifying some concreteness about them), or you should have a powerful
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; argument against AR, but then you should elaborate.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; To be honest I have not yet seen where you postulates comp wrong in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; your long anti-roadmap post.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Recall that I take comp as YD + CT + AR (Yes Doctor + Church Thesis +
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Arithmetical Realism).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK.  I've already agreed to accept AR in 'as if' mode. So that implies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm staying on the comp road in the same 'as if' spirit to see where it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; leads. It's very interesting! Also I genuinely think that AR is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'false' from any of the *logical* perspectives from which you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; defend it.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; My problem - outside 'as if' mode (and this goes back to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'primacy' issue) - is with adopting *any* essentially 'non-indexical'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (or in Colin's usage 'non-situated') postulate as 'ontic ground zero'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My view - and I'm still not clear whether you think it unjustified, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that you simply *prefer* to start elsewhere - is that we go wrong the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moment we fail to treat reflexive indexical necessity with maximal -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *extreme* - seriousness. My most basic claim is that to make *any*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non-indexical assumption primary - even one as apparently 'modest' as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; AR - is to try to 'sneak past' this, and thereby to fail *the* crucial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; test of ontic realism.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Because comp makes it possible to postulate a simple theory where 
<br />
everything is communicable in a third person way. By making the first 
<br />
person primitive, you loose the ability to explain it (or to get some 
<br />
best possible third person explanation). I agree with Peter (1Z) when 
<br />
he criticize you by saying that a person is something complex, and I 
<br />
agree with Dennett when he says that something complex must be 
<br />
explained by something easier. Now comp shows the ultimate fundamental 
<br />
role of the first person, and that is why I appreciate your seriousness 
<br />
here, and in principle you still could try to formalize it in a third 
<br />
person way, but your last attempt led to some explosion of more 
<br />
complicated concepts.
<br />
The same remark works when you are making &quot;indexical&quot; primitive, 
<br />
although &quot;indexical&quot; can be translated in purely third person way (that 
<br />
is exactly what Post, Turing, Godel ... Kleene have proved). The case 
<br />
of platonist or classical machine gives rise to the indexical but 
<br />
purely arithmetical &quot;provability predicate&quot; B, and this one is 
<br />
quasi-primitive in the sense that all others notions of persons (the 
<br />
hypostases) are variant of B.
<br />
So yes, there is just a tiny difference between us. I just doubt you 
<br />
can axiomatize your first person indexical seriousness in a simple 
<br />
third person way. If comp is correct, you can't, I think, and 
<br />
eventually this gives a protection of the first person against 
<br />
normative theories.
<br />
To sum up, the notion of first person is too complex to be be 
<br />
primitive, especially when you see that comp explains why the first 
<br />
person is correct when thinking it is primitive (but false by trying to 
<br />
put this in a third person discourse.
<br />
And the, unlike Peter, I consider that the notion of &quot;matter&quot; is also 
<br />
complex, and assuming it also thhrows away any hope foir explanation, 
<br />
and then comp forbid that move anyway by the UDA.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We could call this position maximal personal, or indexical,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seriousness, but what's in a name? It frustrates me almost beyond
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; endurance that this isn't simply 'obvious' (though error, especially
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one's own, is subtle).
</em><br />
<br />As a first person discourse, comp tells that you are correct. As a 
<br />
third person discourse you are on the verge of inconsistency.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But it seems as though we're somehow 'tricked'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; out of seeing it because all 'personal' interaction (including that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with the 'self') is relational, and 3rd-person is the characteristic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mode of relational interaction. So all natural language just assumes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Consequently when you say:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; What you say is exactly what the lobian *first person* will feel.  I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; hope you will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; see this eventually.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think I do 'see' it. I understand that the lobian first person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *emerging* from your non-indexical AR postulate could indeed be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; decribed as 'possessing' such a view. I can indeed 'see' how you can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; invoke a '1st-person David analog' in 3rd-person language in this way,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but I can't at all see how this causes 'indexically necessary David' -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'here and now' - to appear out of 'thin 3rd-person air'.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes and that is normal. I reduce the mystery of &quot;here and now&quot; to the 
<br />
much simpler mysteries of the type:  &quot;why am I in Washington and not in 
<br />
Moscow&quot;, or &quot;why am I in Moscow and not in Washington&quot; after a WM 
<br />
self-duplication experiment. Surely with comp you could figure out that 
<br />
those questions, although first person meaningful, are third person 
<br />
meaningless. NO?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Does mere
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logic posess such power?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Bertrand Russell thought so, but technically speaking logic is not that 
<br />
powerful (at all). Now Arithmetic is *that* powerful, amazingly enough 
<br />
perhaps.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It seems as if only magic will do. It's like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Harry Potter saying - &quot;I know I'm just imagining you, but hang on, in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just a jiffy AR will make you indexically necessary&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />No need of Harry Potter. If you are a digital machine, 
<br />
(self-referentially correct or not) your current computational steps 
<br />
will occur at a time (an infinity of time, but note that time here is 
<br />
just given by the ordering of non negative integers), making you 
<br />
&quot;relatively necessary&quot;.
<br />
And then modal logic and Kripke &quot;multiverse&quot; has been invented to 
<br />
handle those notion of &quot;relative necessity&quot;. And the Godel &quot;B&quot; is quite 
<br />
rich in that respect.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; On the other hand, bare 'indexical necessity' is the sole ontic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; postulate I need.
</em><br />
<br />It is as correct as it is uncommunicable. &quot;First person ndexical 
<br />
necessity&quot; is true ... until you posit it as an axiom. My feeling is 
<br />
that you perhaps just confuse ... Bp and Bp &amp; p.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is this an insufficiently 'modest' requirement? My
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; justification is reflexively evident and incorrigible.
</em><br />
<br /><br />&quot;Bp &amp; p&quot; is (obviously) incorrigible, but that is related with the fact 
<br />
that no indexically correct machine can posit it as an hypothesis. 
<br />
Actually, no machine can even define its own indexical Bp &amp; p. To act 
<br />
as a scientist, the machine, like the doctor,  can talk only on Bp.
<br />
Now a machine can make the complete theory of both Bp and Bp &amp; p for 
<br />
any lobian machine sufficiently simpler than itself. Like ZF can prove 
<br />
the G* of PA, but not its own. The erst then follow from the comp hyp.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It does no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; practical damage to the subsequent postulation of AR - it can't do,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because this position simply *is* the situation from which I postulate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it. By the same token, CT survives (if true) undamaged by being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; postulated from this position. In other words, I'm claiming that we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have access to versions of AR and CT manifested entirely in virtue of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; their generalisation from relational reality, and I can't see that you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or I have reason to believe anything else, except through 'Penrose
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; direct revelation', which you reject. So what's the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; alternative?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; YD now becomes the interesting case, and the point, as I recall, where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we started. My long post refers to the dependencies and assumptions,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implicit in bit-stream representations, that are only made explicit by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; their instantiation. My argument is that any digital program is an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arbitrary gloss on the behaviour of a 'substrate' (i.e. lower logical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; level) - I think I've seen you argue more or less the same point - and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; therefore relies on a notion of 'causation' (dependency, sequence,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure, behaviour, or state your preferred terminology) - that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; essentially non-local at the level of such instantiation.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Consequently we must choose: to believe either that *any* example of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; situated, indexical, experience arises from localised phenomena at the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; causal level of their instantiation (appropriately schematised), or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that it arises from arbitrary, non-localised, aspatial, atemporal,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; abstractions from behaviour at this level. I can't see that these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; considerations don't apply to *any* digital 'substitution level' that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relies on a purely syntactical expression - e.g. instantiation in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; digital computer -
</em><br />
<br />OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and would consequently have to decline the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doctor's offer. This is what I mean by non-invariance of experiential
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure to Turing emulation.
</em><br />
<br /><br />?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, the question then becomes one of defining the 'level' of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instantiation.
</em><br />
<br />It is part of the 1-indeterminacy.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You have pointed out, I recall, that the comp
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumptions leave 'matter' devoid of any unique explanatory function.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This isn't a surprise surely, because 'matter' is defined purely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relationally as behaviour.
</em><br />
<br />I can agree. No physicist posit matter in a fundamental theory. Except 
<br />
by expression like &quot;let B be a field, ...&quot;. But I have not yet find a 
<br />
matter postulate in fundamental physics, not even in Aristotle (yet).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Be that as it may, why would we ever expect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a purely relational or behavioural description *on its own* to invoke
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prior indexical necessity in my maximally serious sense?
</em><br />
<br />Why indeed?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such a prior ontic postulate, any relational schema surely 'exists'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only in 'Harry Potter space'?
</em><br />
<br />?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; With it, 'matter' becomes a causal layer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the construction of experience and everything we infer from it. If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we can schematise this in a way that proves capable of 'substitution',
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; YD would then emerge as an empirical possibility
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'from the bottom up'. In effect, to say 'yes' to the doctor would be to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; agree to be cloned.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So, in summary, if comp were presented as a relational substitution
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scheme defined on prior, maximally serious ontic necessity - in my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense - from which AR, CT and YD emerge at the appropriate relational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; level, I could perhaps travel with you even more happily. I just can't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; see, except in 'as if' mode, how AR truly serves as 'ontic ground zero'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in this 'maximally serious' sense. I'd be grateful if you could show me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; how this is false. Or is it rather that modesty dictates that comp
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; takes us no further than 'as if'?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Not just comp. I would say of any scientific theory.
<br />
And then with comp this can be justify through B and its variants 
<br />
(hypostases).
<br />
It is the correct incorrigibility of the first person which prevents 
<br />
her to participate in the third person discourse. Although she is 
<br />
correct, and here I follow you completely with the idea of being 
<br />
maximally serious about that correctness, she have to stay mute, for 
<br />
not falling into incorrectness, or even inconsistency.
<br />
Some truth just cannot be 3-asserted without becoming a falsity.
<br />
<br />Must go now,
<br />
<br />Bruno
