<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I know this is not a popular view, but I am not convinced of the validity of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such experiments.  One proponent of the realist opinion, who has better
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arguments than I, is Caroline Thompson:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://users.aber.ac.uk/cat/">http://users.aber.ac.uk/cat/</a>
</em><br />
<br />Yes, I know. But chances for loopholes are very narrow, after
<br />
20 years, unfortunately.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I admit I'm not too familiar with these concepts or terms.  I'll try to read
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; up and understand them a little better.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In the mean time, my main objection to non-local phenomena is, once again,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our inability to formally implement it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Challenge: write a set of non-local equations or a non-local computer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; program that isn't implemented locally.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For example:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It would be easy enough to program a virtual reality simulation to exhibit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seemingly non-local behaviors.  We could even do something extremely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; macroscopic like joining the motion of two pool balls firmly together - so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that whenever one was moved, the other moved also - seemingly

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instantaneously.

Non-locality and quantum theory: new experimental evidence
<br />
Luigi Accardi, Massimo Regoli
<br />
Starting from the late 60's many experiments have been performed 
<br />
to verify the violation Bell's inequality by Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen 
<br />
(EPR) type correlations. The idea of these experiments being that: 
<br />
(i) Bell's inequality is a consequence of locality, hence its experimental 
<br />
violation is an indication of non locality; (ii) this violation is a typical
<br />
quantum phenomenon because any classical system making local 
<br />
choices (either deterministic or random) will produce correlations 
<br />
satisfying this inequality. Both statements (i) and (ii) have been criticized 
<br />
by quantum probability on theoretical grounds (not discussed in the present 
<br />
paper) and the experiment discussed below has been devised to support
<br />
these theoretical arguments. We emphasize that the goal of our experiment 
<br />
is not to reproduce classically the EPR correlations but to prove that there 
<br />
exist perfectly local classical dynamical systems violating Bell's inequality.

Locality and Bell's inequality
<br />
Luigi Accardi, Massimo Regoli
<br />
We prove that the locality condition is irrelevant to Bell in equality. 
<br />
We check that the real origin of the Bell's inequality is the assumption 
<br />
of applicability of classical (Kolmogorovian) probability theory to quantum 
<br />
mechanics. We describe the chameleon effect which allows to construct 
<br />
an experiment realizing a local, realistic, classical, deterministic
<br />
and macroscopic violation of the Bell inequalities.

A Proposed Experiment Showing that Classical Fields 
<br />
Can Violate Bell's Inequalities
<br />
Patrick Suppes (Stanford University, USA), J. Acacio de Barros 
<br />
(Federal University at Juiz de Fora, Brazil), Adonai S.
<br />
Sant'Anna (Federal University at Parana, Brazil)
<br />
We show one can use classical fields to modify a quantum optics experiment 
<br />
so that Bell's inequalities will be violated. This happens with continuous 
<br />
random variables that are local, but we need to use the correlation matrix 
<br />
to prove there can be no joint probability distribution of the observables.

The Violation of Bell Inequalities in the Macroworld
<br />
Diederik Aerts, Sven Aerts, Jan Broekaert, Liane Gabora
<br />
We show that Bell inequalities can be violated in the macroscopic world. 
<br />
The macroworld violation is illustrated using an example involving connected 
<br />
vessels of water. We show that whether the violation of inequalities occurs in 
<br />
the microworld or in the macroworld, it is the identification of nonidentical events 
<br />
that plays a crucial role. Specifically, we prove that if nonidentical events are 
<br />
consistently differentiated, Bell-type Pitowsky inequalities are no longer violated, 
<br />
even for Bohm's example of two entangled spin 1/2 quantum particles. 
<br />
We show how Bell inequalities can be violated in cognition,
<br />
specifically in the relationship between abstract concepts and specific 
<br />
instances of these concepts. This supports the hypothesis that genuine quantum 
<br />
structure exists in the mind. We introduce a model where the amount of 
<br />
nonlocality and the degree of quantum uncertainty are parameterized, 
<br />
and demonstrate that increasing nonlocality increases the degree of
<br />
violation, while increasing quantum uncertainty decreases the degree of violation.
<br />
<br />and for Bohm-Aharonov effect and weird jamming:

Action and Passion at a Distance: An Essay in Honor of Professor 
<br />
Abner Shimony
<br />
Sandu Popescu, Daniel Rohrlich
<br />
Quantum mechanics permits nonlocality---both nonlocal correlations 
<br />
and nonlocal equations of motion---while respecting relativistic 
<br />
causality. Is quantum mechanics the unique theory that reconciles 
<br />
nonlocality and causality? We consider two models, going beyond 
<br />
quantum mechanics, of nonlocality---``superquantum&quot; correlations, 
<br />
and nonlocal ``jamming&quot; of correlations---and derive new results for 
<br />
the jamming model. In one space dimension, jamming allows reversal 
<br />
of the sequence of cause and effect; in higher dimensions, however, 
<br />
effect never precedes cause. 
<br />

Jamming non-local quantum correlations
<br />
J. Grunhaus, S. Popescu, D. Rohrlich
<br />
We present a possible scheme to tamper with non-local quantum 
<br />
correlations in a way that is consistent with relativistic causality, 
<br />
but goes beyond quantum mechanics. A non-local ``jamming&quot; 
<br />
mechanism, operating within a certain space-time window, would 
<br />
not violate relativistic causality and would not lead to contradictory 
<br />
causal loops. The results presented in this Letter do not depend 
<br />
on any model of how quantum correlations arise and apply to any 
<br />
jamming mechanism. 
<br />
<br />Thanks,
<br />
