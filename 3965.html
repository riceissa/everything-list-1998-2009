The difficulty is Godel incompleteness theorem. I thought that

books like Nagel &amp; Newman's &quot;GODEL'S PROOF, or Hofstadter's &quot;Godel,

Escher Bach&quot; would popularize Godel's proof, but since I have defended

my thesis I realize Godel's result have not yet been really

understood even by most mathematicians.
<br />
No problem with your concentration on the lattice/Heyting algebra.

Mmmh... I am not sure about that. This is also a question of fashion.

There is also a conflict between more theoretically oriented long term

project and then doing money quickly in private business.

I would be more cautious about those matter. Also, a lot of things in

traditional practical computer science were developed first in symbolic

AI. In fact I do not believe in a net separation between computer

science, artificial intelligence, artificial life, control theory, etc.

On this point we differ a lot. I cannot imagine a more fundamental

Have you try to understand the UDA? Have you read Hofstadter and

the puzzle. The qubits/bits relation I made was just an opportunist

tool. I don't know.

All that is indeed very interesting indeed. (A little premature
<br />
from my angle of approach though). As the question of space, which
<br />
is much more mysterious for me than time. My approach leads quickly
<br />
to subjective time (through S4Grz), but subjective space is quite
<br />
more difficult. It is there that non-topos categories, and probably
<br />
braided monoidal categories should introduce themselves.

Please try. It would be an honor to be refuted :-)

Until now some people have pretended having find a flaw, but nothing

serious has been shown. Serious critics are necessary for improvements though.
<br />
<br />OK Tim I will finish the &quot;Yetter&quot; post this afternoon or tomorrow,
<br />
may be trying to be a little less technical. But the technics are
<br />
much more simple than the concepts. Old preliminary versions of my
<br />
work did not use modal logic at all, but was done directly in term
<br />
of godel numbers. The modal technics and the Solovay results has made
<br />
possible to shorten considerably the presentation of my result,
<br />
making things truly far simpler. It's not important if you don't
<br />
understand at once the technics. Give time to time ;)

<br />
<br /><br />PS In the meantime I let you meditate, just for fun, on the following
<br />
paragraph by Yetter in the introduction of his &quot;functorial knot theory&quot;:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&lt;Another feature of these recent developments is the difference
<br />
between the role categories and functors have usually played
<br />
since their discovery and the role they now play in quantum topology.
<br />
Rather than serving a foundational role, as a clean way of encoding
<br />
&quot;natural&quot; constructions of one kind of mathematical object from
<br />
another, categories in quantum topology stand as algebraic objects
<br />
in their own right. This difference has not always been generally
<br />
understood, even by quite brilliant mathematicians working in related
<br />
areas, as the following personal anecdote involving the late Moshé
<br />
Flato illustrates. One evening at a joint Summer Research Conference
<br />
in the early 1990's Nicholai Reshetikhin and I button-holed Flato,
<br />
and explained at length Shum's Coherence theorem and the role of
<br />
categories in &quot;quantum knot invariants&quot;. Flato was persistently
<br />
dismissive of categories as a &quot;mere language&quot;. I retired for the
<br />
evening, leaving Reshetikhin and Flato to the discussion. At the
<br />
next morning's session, Flato tapped me on the shoulder, and giving
<br />
a thumbs-up sign, whispered, &quot;Hey! Vive les categories! These new
<br />
ones, the braided monoidal ones.&quot;&gt;&gt;
