How does a human differ in kind from a rock?
<br />
<br />-Well both are well modelled as being &quot;slow processes&quot; (i.e. localized 
<br />
states and events) in spacetime.
<br />
- A process is a particular kind of &quot;pattern of organization&quot; of some 
<br />
subregion of spacetime.
<br />
- We share being made of similar kinds of matter particles that stay 
<br />
close to each other in spacetime for
<br />
some finite time period, and some finite spatial extent.
<br />
<br />Oh, but you said &quot;how do we differ?&quot;
<br />
<br />Well, a human roganism is a sub-unit of a longer-lived &quot;species&quot; pattern 
<br />
within an &quot;organic emergent system eco-system&quot;
<br />
pattern.
<br />
A rock does not appear to have that much complexity of form and 
<br />
autopoietic function.
<br />
<br />A rock is one of those kind of local spacetime patterns or systems that 
<br />
&quot;doesn't have much choice about how it is.&quot;
<br />
The laws of physics, and the nature of the rock's components and the 
<br />
thermodynamics of its vicinity are such that it
<br />
pretty much collects into how it's going to be at some time, then is 
<br />
physically constrained to stay just that way,
<br />
at macro scales anyhow, for a long period of time. Of course, being a 
<br />
big physical process pattern subject to
<br />
the laws of thermodynamics, it is, actually, changing, and usually 
<br />
dissipating (disorganizing), just very, very slowly.
<br />
<br />A human organism pattern is existing at a thermodynamic range 
<br />
internally, and in a thermodynamic regime in its
<br />
environment, that allows for more &quot;options&quot;. for how (and e.g. where) to 
<br />
be (over short time scales.) Interestingly,
<br />
this makes for the presence of all kinds of other similar organic 
<br />
patterns with options, and interesting behaviours
<br />
(like eating you for dinner, or infecting you and eating your cell 
<br />
structure.) In other words, this thermodynamic
<br />
regime, and the particular kinds of atoms and chemical bonds in 
<br />
ecosystems, make for active competition for
<br />
which should be the dominant pattern of organization of matter and 
<br />
energy in the vicinity. i.e. You can't always
<br />
just be a rock, because there might be a creature with a hammer wanting 
<br />
to break you down into cement.
<br />
Or you can't live for ever, as an organism, because something else wants 
<br />
to re-pattern your matter and energy;
<br />
that is, the matter and energy your pattern has competed successfully to 
<br />
borrow for its form for a while.
<br />
<br />Clear as oozing primordial subterranean sulphur-vent mud?
<br />
<br />Ok but here's the interesting part of the story. Because there are 
<br />
&quot;options for how to be i.e. how to hold together&quot;
<br />
at our organic ecosystem thermodynamic regime, there is 
<br />
&quot;pattern-competition&quot; for who is the most auto-poietic
<br />
(i.e. what forms of matter and energy collection can hold together best, 
<br />
at the expense of others).
<br />
<br />And it turns out that life-like ecosystem patterns, species patterns, 
<br />
and organism patterns win out for a time,
<br />
precisely because their main function is autopoiesis, and they 
<br />
eventually, through natural selection, get very
<br />
good at it.
<br />
<br />And it may turn out that the way you survive best as a pattern in 
<br />
spacetime, assuming you have a certain
<br />
thermodynamic range to work with, is to store inside yourself 
<br />
INFORMATION about &quot;that which is
<br />
outside yourself and nearby. i.e. about your environment. In otherwords, 
<br />
pattern, if you want to live, get
<br />
out there and start RE-PRESENTING aspects of your environment WITHIN 
<br />
YOURSELF (in some
<br />
partly abstract form within some aspect of your own form.)    
<br />
Eventually, if you do that, simple representation
<br />
of your environment. &quot;Ouch that hurt. I'm going to flail the other way 
<br />
outa here.&quot; or
<br />
&quot;hmmm, my complex molecules like the smell and molecular fit of YOUR 
<br />
complex molecules&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;will give way to complex representation within the organism of its 
<br />
environment, and complex action plans
<br />
to be carried out to protect the organism (and its kin's) pattern from 
<br />
nastier aspects of the environment.
<br />
So we get &quot;Hmmm. I think that guy and his army is out to get me and 
<br />
mine.&quot; &quot;I think I will pre-emptively
<br />
strike on that other guy's country because he vaguely looks like the 
<br />
first guy.&quot; Ok, bad example.
<br />
or you get &quot;Hmmm. What an intelligent (accurate 
<br />
environment-representer), capable (effective environment
<br />
modifier and pacifier), and beautiful (pattern-form-average-conformant) 
<br />
woman she is. I'll ask her to marry me.
<br />
<br />Or something like that.
<br />
<br />And that's the major difference between humans and rocks. Our 
<br />
thermodynamic regime necessitates that
<br />
we navigate options for our existence/non-existence as stable patterns 
<br />
by representing informationally, then
<br />
navigating and affecting, our surrounding  space, time, matter, and 
<br />
energy forms.
