<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hi LZ!

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &lt;snip&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; and the perfect benchmark behaviour to contrast the zombie
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; and the human.So, I have my zombie scientist and my human
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; scientist and I ask them to do science on exquisite novelty.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; What happens? The novelty is invisible to the zombie, who
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; has the internal life of a dreamless sleep.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I think you are confusing lack of phenomenality with lack of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; response to the environment. Simple sensors
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; can respond without (presumably) phenomenality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; So can humans with blindsight (but not very efficiently).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No confusion at all. The zombie is behaving. 'Wide awake' in the sense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that it is fully functional. Doing stuff. I said it has the _internal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; life_ of a dreamless sleep, not that it was asleep. This means that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; life you 'experience that is the state of a dreamless sleep - the nothing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of it - that is the entire life of the awake zombie.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Want to partially 'zombie' yourself?  close your eyes. block your ears. I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; know seeing black/hearing nothing is not blindess/deafness, but you get
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the idea.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Scientific behaviour demanded of the zombie condition is a clearly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; identifiable behavioural benchmark where we can definitely claim that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; phenomenality is necessary...see below...
</em><br />
<br />It is all to easy to consider scientific behaviour without
<br />
phenomenality.
<br />
Scientist looks at test-tube -- scientist makes note in lab
<br />
journal...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; The reason it is invisible is because there is no phenomenal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; consciousness. The zombie has only sensory data to use to do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; science. There are an infinite number of ways that same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; sensory data could arrive from an infinity of external
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; natural world situtations. The sensory data is ambiguous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; That doesn't follow. The Zombie can produce different responses
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; on the basis of physical differences in its input, just as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a machine can.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I spent tens of thousands of hours designing, building, benchtesting and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; commissioning zombies. On the benchtop I have pretended to be their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; environment and they had no 'awareness' they weren't in their real
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; environment. It's what makes bench testing possible. The universe of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; zombies was the universe of my programming. The zombies could not tell if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they were in the factory or on the benchtop.
</em><br />
<br />According to solipsists, humans can't either. You seem
<br />
to think PC somehow tells you reality is really real,
<br />
but you haven't shown it. Counterargument: we have
<br />
PC during dreaming, but dreams aren't real.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  That's why I can empathise so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; well with zombie life. I have been literally swatted by zombies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (robot/cranes and other machines) like I wasn't there....scares the hell
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; out of you! Some even had 'vision systems' but were still blind.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; so....yes the zombie can 'behave'. What I am claiming is they cannot do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; _science_ i.e. they cannot behave scientifically. This is a very specific
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; claim, not a general claim.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;- it's all the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; same - action potential pulse trains traveling from sensors to brain.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; No, it's not all the same. Its coded in a very complex way. It's like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; saying the information in you computer is &quot;all the same -- its all ones
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and zeros&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; yes you got it - all coded....I am talking about action potential pulse
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; trains. They are all the same general class. Burst mode/Continuous mode,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all the same basic voltage waveform, overshoot, refratory period...LTP,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; LTD, afterhyperpolarisation.... all the same class for sight, sound,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; taste, imagination, touch, thirst, orgasm etc etc... coded messages
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; travelling all the way from the periphery and into the brain. They are all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the same...and..
</em><br />
<br />So the fact that they are coming in on distinct channels is what is
<br />
important.
<br />
<br />I still don't see why we need to appeal to PC.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; None of it says anything about WHY the input did what it did. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; causality outside the zombie is MISSING from these signals.
</em><br />
<br />The causality outside the human is missing from the signals.
<br />
A photon is a photon, it doesn't come with a biography.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  They have no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intrinsic sensation to them either. The only useful information is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; body knows implicitly where they came from..which still is not enough
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Try swapping the touch nerves for 2 fingers. You 'touch' with one and feel
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the touch happen on the other. The touch sensation is created as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; phenomenal consciousness in the brain using the measurement, not the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; signal measurement itself.
</em><br />
<br />The brain attaches meaning to signals according to the channel they
<br />
come on on, hence phantom limb pain and so on. We still
<br />
don't need PC to explain that.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now think about the touch..the same sensation of touch could have been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generated by a feather or a cloth or another finger or a passing car. That
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; context is what phenomenal consciousness provides.
</em><br />
<br />PC doesn't miraculously provide the true context. It can
<br />
be fooled by dreams and hallucination. And it doesn't have
<br />
access to information that the physical brain doesn't have access
<br />
to. A photon is a photon. And the context of one particular
<br />
signal is a bunch of other signals, memories and so on.
<br />
You haven't shown that the process of contextualising
<br />
a signal isn't essentially cognitive.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; The zombie cannot possibly distinguish the novelty from the sensory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; data
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; and has no awareness of the external world or even its own boundary.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Huh? It's perfectly possible to build a robot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that produces a special signal when it encounters input it has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; not encountered before.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes but how is it to do anything to contextualise the input other than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correlate it with other signals?
</em><br />
<br />Why would it need to do something more? Are you saying PC
<br />
is something more? What?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; (none of which, in themselves, generate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any phenomenal consciousness, they trigger it downstream in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cranium/cortex).
</em><br />
<br />In robots?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; re robot...now do science on a signal and use the signal to make a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; statement about the natural world that generated/caused the signal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; elsewhere away from/outside the robot. It can't.
</em><br />
<br />No. But that may be a conceptual deficit. It can't make
<br />
much in the way of spontaneous statements anyway, since
<br />
natural language hasn't been cracked.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  It's blind, deaf, can't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; taste or smell or touch.
</em><br />
<br />Phenomenally. The two facts are true individually,
<br />
but you haven't shown that the one must be explained
<br />
by the other.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Having the sensor transduction does not give it
</em><br />
<br />phenomenal
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; sight... that is scientifically proven fact. EG There is a HUGE neural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sensory transduction/actuation system along the wall of your intestines,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of which you have no awareness at all, but is hammering away like a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; factory squeezing and pushing all day...
</em><br />
<br /><br />You mean &quot;having the sensor transduction does not necessarily give it
<br />
phenomenal
<br />
sight&quot;
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Put it this way.... a 'red photon' arrives and hits a retina cone and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; isomerises a protein, causing a cascade that results in an action
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; potential pulse train. That photon could have come from alpha-centuri,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bounced off a dog collar or come from a disco light.
</em><br />
<br />That is equally true with or without PC.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The receptor has no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; clue. Isomerisation of a protein has nothing to do with 'seeing'. In the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; human the perception (sensation) of a red photon happens in the visual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cortex as an experience of redness and is 'projected' mentally into the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; phenomenal scene. That way the human can tell where it came from.
</em><br />
<br />Not exactly. We can tell where it came from because it is
<br />
combined with a lot of other data to form a 3d reconstruction.
<br />
For instance, there is no depth information in the photon
<br />
per se. The depth information comes from matching the information
<br />
on the two retinas. Phenomenality is just how it is &quot;presented&quot;
<br />
once it has been worked out.
<br />
<br />You seem to be saying that without the phenomenal
<br />
&quot;show&quot;, we wouldn't have the information in the first
<br />
place. But, blindsight shows we might.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mystery of how that happens is another story. That it happens and is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessary for science is what matters here.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The main fact is that the zombie does not have sensation at all
</em><br />
<br />Does not have phenomenal sensation. Could have sensory
<br />
access to the world (as in blindsight). Could have tha bility
<br />
to integrate and contextualise it, non-phenomenally.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  and that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as a result it cannot do science on the world outside the zombie. It's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doesn't even know there is a world to do science on.
</em><br />
<br />And we do, contra the solipsist. How do we?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; All it can do is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correlate measurements with each other, measurements that could have come
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from anywhere and the zombie can never tell from where.
</em><br />
<br />According to the solipsist, that is all we can do. And we
<br />
can be fooled.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have great empathy for the poor zombie! Indeed I am starting to realise
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that it may be my practical training which has enabled me to better
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand the zombie - more so than the norm... it seems to have made
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certain things rather more plain to me than others.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cheers
