<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; say that &quot;3+2=5&quot; as exemplified by 3 oranges and 2 apples is conscious, then should we also say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; that the pairs+triplets of fruit are also conscious? If so, where do we draw the line?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I'm not sure I understand your example.  Are you saying that by simply existing, two
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; apples and 3 oranges compute 2+3=5?  If so I would disagree.  I would say it is our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; comprehending them as individual objects and also as a set that is the computation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Just hanging there on the trees they may be &quot;computing&quot; apple hanging on a tree,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; apple hanging on a tree,... but they're not computing 2+3=5.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What about my example in an earlier post of beads on an abacus? You can slide 2 beads to the left, then another
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3 beads to the left, and count a total of 5 beads; or 2 pairs of beads and 3 pairs of beads and count a total of 5
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pairs of beads, or any other variation. Perhaps it seems a silly example when discussing consciousness, but the most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; elaborate (and putatively conscious) computation can be reduced to a complex bead-sliding exercise. And if sliding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; beads computes 2+3=5, why not if 2 birds and then 3 birds happen to land on a tree, or a flock of birds of which 2
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are red lands on one tree and another flock of birds of which 3 are red lands on an adjacent tree? It is true that these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; birds and beads are not of much consequence computationally unless someone is there to observe them and interpret
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them, but what about the computer that is conscious chug-chugging away all on its own?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;That is what I mean
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; when I say that any computation can map onto any physical system.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But as you've noted before the computation is almost all in the mapping.  And not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; just in the map, but in the application of the map - which is something we do.  That
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; action can't be abstracted away.  You can't just say there's a physical system and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; there's a manual that would map it into some computation and stop there as though the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; computation has been done.  The mapping, an action, still needs to be performed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What if the computer is built according to some ridiculously complex plan, plugged in, then all the engineers, manuals,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; etc. disappear. If it was conscious to begin with, does it suddenly cease being conscious because no-one is able to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand it?
</em><br />
If it was consicous, it ws consicus as the result
<br />
of whatever computation it is performing, and that is *not* the
<br />
computation resulting froma complex process of re-interpretation.
<br />
As I have shown, such a process is a separate computation in
<br />
which the &quot;computer&quot; figures as a subrouting -- possibly
<br />
even an unimportant one.
<br />
<br />It is also possible that the &quot;computer&quot; isn't conscious, but
<br />
the total system of comptuer+reinterpretation is conscious
<br />
In that case, if the apparatus that implements the mapping is
<br />
dismantled,
<br />
the consciousness disappears.
<br />
<br />The thing to remember is that just because one physical
<br />
systems is desgnated a computer, and another isn't, that doesn't
<br />
mean the first systesm is in fact doing all the computing. The
<br />
computing
<br />
is taking place where the activity and the complexity is taking place.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It could have been designed according to the radioactive decay patterns of a sacred stone, in which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; case without the documentation, its internal states might appear completely random. With the documentation, it may be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible to understand what it is doing or even interact with it, and you have said previously that it is the potential for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interaction that allows it to be conscious, but does that mean it gradually becomes less conscious as pages of the manual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are ripped out one by one and destroyed, even though the computer itself does not change its activity as a result?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;The physical structure and activity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; of computer A implementing program a may be completely different to that of computer B implementing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; program b, but program b may be an emulation of program a, which should make the two machines
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; functionally equivalent and, under computationalism, equivalently conscious.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I don't see any problem with supposing that A and B are equally conscious (or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; unconscious).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But there is a mapping under which any machine B is emulating a machine A. Figuring out this mapping does not change the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical activity of either A or B.
</em><br />
<br />But without an phsyical activity to actually implement the mapping
<br />
(the kind of thing which, I have ben arguing, is computation itself)
<br />
that is a mere possibility.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You can argue that therefore the physical activity of A or B is irrelevant and consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is implemented non-corporeally by virtue of its existence as a Platonic object;
</em><br />
<br />If you wanted to beg the whole question.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; or you can argue that this is clearly nonsense and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness is implemented as a result of some special physical property of a particular machine.
</em><br />
<br />Or you can still argue that it is implemented by the computational
<br />
activity of the machine, since it is not implemented by a merely
<br />
hypothetical mapping, and an actual mapping or re-interpretation is
<br />
another, different physical system, and another, dfferent computation.
