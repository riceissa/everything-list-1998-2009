<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Yes. Causal chains, no matter how improbable, executed at the tiniest
</em><br />
of
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; scales the same ones that make LUCY our literal ancestor..... connect
</em><br />
us.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />LZ
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It depends what you , mean by &quot;connect&quot;. I am connected to these things,
</em><br />
but they can manage without me. It is a one-way
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; kind of connection.

<br />
We are touching on the unidirectionality of time, here. Specifically the
<br />
2nd law of thermodynamics. Myriad infinitesimal entropy transactions
<br />
resulting in overall increases in disorder but localised increases in
<br />
order (&amp; complexity , russel's playground) where net energy inflow exists
<br />
- such as where we are in the beam of the floodlight called sol.
<br />
<br />If you mean the current state is the sum of the transactions of the entire
<br />
history of the transactions comprising you... then yes, your present state
<br />
is connected to all this causal history. The thing is that you literally
<br />
_are_ it. You are not like some bulldozed pile of independent stuff. So
<br />
the idea that you and the causality that got you to your current state are
<br />
separate is meaningless. You literally are causality - intrinsically made
<br />
of change, but change that results in persistent structure that is you.
<br />
<br />So. yes. The model I am working with is untrinsically unidirectional, I
<br />
suppose - one way in a flow sense and one way in a causal sense that the
<br />
present (current state) did not 'cause' the past (previous states), nor
<br />
can the future cause the present state.
<br />
<br />The easiest way to imagine it is to think of it as computation. Go through
<br />
the sequence of operations 2+5=7. The 'present' is the state of the
<br />
computation as is progresses (load, 2, load 5 add, display result, for
<br />
example). The 7 did not cause a 2 and 5 to be added. Similarly 7's
<br />
participation in a future computation cannot be said to have caused the 7.
<br />
<br />I know we can _imagine_ realms where bidirectional causality may be so.
<br />
These are best represented in our formal mathemtical depictions of our
<br />
world that have t in them, t for time). What I am saying is that the realm
<br />
we are in is not like them. This is the one _we_ inhabit, with particular
<br />
instances of particular kinds of things going on. Or perhaps a little more
<br />
generally - the one we inhabit is currently in a state where
<br />
unidirectional causality (albeit intrinsically randomised in selecttion of
<br />
particular outcomes) rules. A really good book on this is 'The end of
<br />
certainty' by Prigogine.
<br />
<br />COL
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; identical to other sorts of neuron cohorts nearby. One set delivers
</em><br />
qualia. The others do not.
<br />
<br />LZ
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; How do you know ?
</em><br />
<br /><br />COL
<br />
Human verbal reports in a very detailed experimental regime. This was done
<br />
by imaging humans and controlling for various physiological circumstances
<br />
to eliminate the cohorts involved in things like (in the case of thirst)
<br />
the 'mouth-dryness' factor and micturition state. When you control
<br />
everything you end up being able to isolate one specific, unique region
<br />
that is correlated only with the experienced emotion of 'thirst'
<br />
(reasulting in an 'imperious desire' for drinking behaviour). The imaging
<br />
results are in the book.
<br />
<br />The interesting thing in the case of these low level emotions is that they
<br />
are all separate cohorts (thirst, hunger, sex drive etc). It's not one
<br />
cohort that changes in subjective quality. There must be an evolutionary
<br />
reason for this... maybe in DNA or maybe the emotions compete for
<br />
behavioural dominance (micturition thwarting, for example, may stop you
<br />
being afraid of something or vice versa)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; So there are 2 parts to an explanation:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; a) single neuron properties
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; b) cohort organisation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Unless thesre is a property of single neurons to use for a cohort to do
</em><br />
something with, you are attributing 'magical emergence' to a cohort. This
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is a logical inevitability.
</em><br />
<br />LZ
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; y-e-e-s. But where are you without emergence? Qualia would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then be properties of quarks. Wihich brings on a Grain problem with a
</em><br />
vengeance.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />COL
<br />
There are no gaines to have a problem with. See below.
<br />
<br />COL
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Magical emergence means attributing some sort of property inherent in
</em><br />
organisation itself.
<br />
<br />LZ
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The point of emergence is rather that the property is *not* inherent in
</em><br />
the lower-level parts and relations.
<br />
<br />COL
<br />
Yes, but these properties cannot exist without colligative actions of
<br />
_something_. Like I said:
<br />
<br />LAKE is to H20
<br />
as
<br />
REDness is to 'what?'.
<br />
<br />That is, what elemental property is dragged along with matter (atoms,
<br />
molecules) that can result in it being 'like something' to be those
<br />
atoms/molecules? Yes, you can say they are behaving in a specific way
<br />
...like neural cells doing the &quot;qualia dance&quot;.... but you are still stuck
<br />
with not knowing the 'what?' shown above. This is only
<br />
correlation/description , not causation/explanation. The real question is
<br />
to ask yourself what are the innate circumstances in the universe that
<br />
would mean doing the neural qualia dance be 'like something'? This
<br />
fundamentally questions your view of the universe.
<br />
<br />That view is, in my model, that qualia are not about what is you, but what
<br />
'is not' you. In a spatial sense. You are manipulating the space you
<br />
inhabit. Space is stuff. It has a permeability and permittivity for
<br />
example. To an accuracy of several orders of magnitude more then 1 part in
<br />
10^20 you - all of us are space - in essence, we are kind of not there.
<br />
Space is the dominant feature of being a human. Our relationship with
<br />
space is, in my model, easily seen - our structural components (entropy
<br />
transactions) derive from a common parent structure. In other words the
<br />
organisational structure of the space and the matter within it come
<br />
literally from one set of common parent structures down deep. They are
<br />
identical at this level. Hence when any matter does anything, the space it
<br />
in habits cooperates in a very intimate way. There is no 'granularity'
<br />
issue. There is no need to have an 'ultimate building block'.
<br />
<br />When you stare at a human - or any 'stuff' at all, you are not staring at
<br />
organs or cells or molecules or atoms ot protons or electrons or photons
<br />
.... what you are looking at is an organised collection of X with a really
<br />
good qualia paint job.
<br />
<br />An analogy: stare at a building made purely of bricks. You can say - and
<br />
be right - that you are staring at a building. But you are not. You are
<br />
staring at organised bricks...ie only bricks. Extend that to humans - and
<br />
ask what is the brick? What it is  _not_ is any of the 'things' we isolate
<br />
with appearances - like atoms, cells, etc (these are 'buildings' in the
<br />
analogy). The statement &quot;X has an appearance&quot; is meaningless - appearance
<br />
is something we add to large accretions of it.
<br />
<br />My solution to this 'what?' = X (=brick) question is to say that whatever
<br />
X is, space and all matter are made of it. A common parent in a very deep
<br />
organisational hierarchy which we have only just begun to unpack. The only
<br />
property you need to assign to X is the property of change. i.e. that X
<br />
goes cyclically through a series of states (lossless, in an entropy/energy
<br />
sense). When you do that you can observe a relationship between one
<br />
organisation (space) and another (matter) and qualia are easily seen to
<br />
result from the cellular qualia dance.
<br />
<br />Another way of looking at the model is to imagine a waterfall. Imagine,
<br />
lost in the struture of change that is a waterfall (H20 passing through a
<br />
region of space), in one particular place in the waterfall, the shape of a
<br />
human outlined in the flow. This is, at the most fundamental level, a
<br />
metaphor for the reality of a universe in which qualia make sense. It also
<br />
predicts what looks like what we describe with maths - gravity and quantum
<br />
mechanics and other stuff, but that's a different issue (Cahill can do
<br />
that)... I'm only interested in qualia and the AI I can make with it.
<br />
<br />This is kind of interesting - you are forcing me to voice things in ways I
<br />
would not have otherwise. :-)
