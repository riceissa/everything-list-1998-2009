<br />
But how do you know that the Qu'ran is actually the word of God? People
<br />
claim all sorts of things, and while it's often easy to prove that they
<br />
*claimed* these things (although as you rightly point out, with many
<br />
religions, such as Christianity, even this is not a given), the point is to
<br />
prove that these things are *true*. The more incredible-sounding, the more
<br />
proof is needed. If I tell you I had a conversation with my mother last
<br />
night you would probably have no reason to demand proof, but if I tell you I
<br />
had a conversation with God or aliens or Elvis Presley, then you'd be
<br />
foolish to just accept it, even if it can be shown that I genuinely believe
<br />
what I am claiming.

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; demonstrate how important a place this pillar of faith has for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; whole of creation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; The Qur'an specifically explains that everything is predetermined, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; then recorded after its coming into existence, as indicated in many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; verses like,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Nor anything green or withered except it is all in a Manifest Book.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I guess the Koran's author hadn't heard about quantum randomness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Anyway that's not an explanation, it's just an assertion - and why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should anyone credit assertions written without supporting evidence by a man
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; who didn't even know that the Earth orbits the Sun.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; This Quranic statement is confirmed by the universe,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It's not only not confirmed, it would be impossible to confirm even if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it were true.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Brent Meeker
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There are hundreds of religions flourishing around the world:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Sikhism, Hinduism, Judaism, Bahaism,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Babism, Zoroastrianism, Mormonism, Jehovas Witnesses, Jainism,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Confucianism etc. And each of these religions claim that their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scripture is preserved from the day it was revealed (written) until
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our time. A religious belief is as authentic as the authenticity of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the scripture it follows. And for any scripture to be labeled as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; authentically preserved it should follow some concrete and rational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; criteria.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Imagine this scenario:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A professor gives a three hour lecture to his students. Imagine still
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that none of the students memorized this speech of the professor or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wrote it down. Now forty years after that speech, if these same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; students decided to replicate professor's complete speech word for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; word, would they be able to do it? Obviously not. Because the only two
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; modes of preservation historically is through writing and memory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Therefore, for any claimants to proclaim that their scripture is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; preserved in purity, they have to provide concrete evidence that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Scripture was written in its entirety AND memorized in its entirety
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from the time it was revealed to our time, in a continuous and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unbroken chain. If the memorization part doesn't exist parallel to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; written part to act as a check and balance for it, then there is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; genuine possibility that the written scripture may loose its purity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; through unintentional and intentional interpolations due to scribal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; errors, corruption by the enemies, pages getting decomposed etc, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; these errors would be concurrently incorporated into subsequent texts,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ultimately loosing its purity through ages.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, of all the religions mentioned above, does any one of them
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possess their scriptures in its entirety BOTH in writing AND in memory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from the day of its revelation until our time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; None of them fit this required criteria, except one: This unique
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scripture is the Qur'an - revelation bestowed to Prophet Muhammad
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (p.b.u.h) 1,418 years ago, as a guidance for all of humankind.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Lets analyze the claim of the preservation of the Quran...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Memorization
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'In the ancient times, when writing was scarcely used, memory and oral
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; transmission was exercised and strengthened to a degree now almost
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unknown' relates Michael Zwettler.(1)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Prophet Muhammad (S): The First Memorizer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It was in this 'oral' society that Prophet Muhammad (S) was born in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mecca in the year 570 C.E. At the age of 40, he started receiving
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; divine Revelations from the One God, Allah, through Archangel Gabriel.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This process of divine revelations continued for about 22.5 years just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; before he passed away.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Prophet Muhammad (S) miraculously memorized each revelation and used
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to proclaim it to his Companions. Angel Gabriel used to refresh the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Quranic memory of the Prophet each year.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'The Prophet (S) was the most generous person, and he used to become
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more so (generous) particularly in the month of Ramadan because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Gabriel used to meet him every night of the month of Ramadan till it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; elapsed. Allah's Messenger (S) use to recite the Qur'an for him. When
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Gabriel met him, he use to become more generous than the fast wind in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doing good'. (2)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'Gabriel used to repeat the recitation of the Qur'an with the Prophet
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (S) once a year, but he repeated it twice with him in the year he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Prophet) died'. (3)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The Prophet himself use to stay up a greater part of the night in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prayers and use to recite Quran from memory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Prophet's Companions: The First Generation Memorizers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Prophet Muhammad (S) encouraged his companions to learn and teach the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Quran:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'The most superior among you (Muslims) are those who learn the Qur'an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and teach it'. (4)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'Some of the companions who memorized the Quran were: 'Abu Bakr, Umar,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Uthman, Ali, Ibn Masud, Abu Huraira, Abdullah bin Abbas, Abdullah bin
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Amr bin al-As, Aisha, Hafsa, and Umm Salama'. (5)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'Abu Bakr, the first male Muslim to convert to Islam used to recite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Quran publicly in front of his house in Makka'. (6)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The Prophet also listened to the recitation of the Qur'an by the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Companions: 'Allah Apostle said to me (Abdullah bin Mas'ud): &quot;Recite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (of the Quran) to me&quot;. I said: &quot;Shall I recite it to you although it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; had been revealed to you?!&quot; He Said: &quot;I like to hear (the Quran) from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; others&quot;. So I recited Sura-an-Nisa' till I reached: &quot;How (will it be)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then when We bring from each nation a witness and We bring you (O
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Muhammad) as a witness against these people?&quot;' (4:41) 'Then he said:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Stop!&quot; Behold, his eyes were shedding tears then'. (7)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Many Quranic memorizers (Qurra) were present during the lifetime of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Prophet and afterwards through out the then Muslim world.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'At the battle of Yamama, many memorizers of the Quran were martyred.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'Narrated Zaid bin Thabit al Ansari, who was one of those who use to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; write the Divine Revelations: Abu Bakr sent me after the (heavy)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; casualties among the warriors (of the battle) of Yamama (where a great
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; number of Qurra were killed). Umar was present with Abu Bakr who said:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Umar has come to me and said, the people have suffered heavy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; casualties on the day of (the battle of) Yamama, and I am afraid that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there will be some casualties among the Qurra (those who memorized the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entire Quran) at other place...&quot;' (8)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'Over the centuries of the Islamic Era, there have arisen throughout
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the various regions of the Islamic world literally thousands of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; schools devoted specially to the teaching of the Quran to children for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the purpose of memorization. These are called, in Arabic, katatib
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (singular: Kuttab). It is said that the Caliph 'Umar (634-44) first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ordered the construction of these schools in the age of the great
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; expansion'. (9)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Second Generation Memorizers:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;...Quranic schools were set up everywhere. As an example to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; illustrate this I may refer to a great Muslim scholar, of the second
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Muslim generation, Ibn 'Amir, who was the judge of Damascus under the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Caliph Umar Ibn 'Abd Al-Aziz. It is reported that in his school for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; teaching the Quran there were 400 disciples to teach in his absence&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (10)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Memorizers in Subsequent Generations:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The Number of Katatib and similar schools in Cairo (Egypt) alone at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one time exceeded two thousand. (11)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Currently both in the Muslim and non-Muslim countries thousands of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; schools with each instructing tens of hundreds of students the art of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; memorizing the entire Quran. In the city of Chicago itself, there are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; close to 40+ Mosques, with many of them holding class for children
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instructing them the art of Quranic memorization.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Further Points of Consideration:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; * Muslims recite Quran from their memory in all of their five daily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prayers. * Once a year, during the month of Fasting (Ramadan), Muslims
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; listen to the complete recitation of the Quran by a Hafiz (memorizer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the entire Quran) * It's a tradition among Muslims that before any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; speech or presentation, marriages, sermons, Quran is recited.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Conclusion:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Quran is the only book, religious or secular, on the face of this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; planet that has been completely memorized by millions. These
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; memorizers range from ages 6 and up, both Arabic and non-Arabic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; speakers, blacks, whites, Orientals, poor and wealthy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thus the process of memorization was continuous , from Prophet
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Muhammad's (S) time to ours with an unbroken chain.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;The method of transmitting the Quran from one generation to the next
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by having he young memorize the oral recitation of their elders had
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mitigated somewhat from the beginning the worst perils of relying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; solely on written records...&quot; relates John Burton (12)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;This phenomenon of Quranic recital means that the text has traversed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the centuries in an unbroken living sequence of devotion. It cannot,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; therefore, be handled as an antiquarian thing, nor as a historical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; document out of a distant past. The fact of hifz (Quranic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Memorization) has made the Qur'an a present possession through all the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lapse of Muslim time and given it a human currency in every generation
</em><br />

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Written Text of the Quran
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Prophet's Time:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Prophet Muhammad (S) was very vigilant in preserving the Quran in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; written form from the very beginning up until the last revelation. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Prophet himself was unlettered, did not knew how to read and write,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; therefore he called upon his numerous scribes to write the revelation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for him. Complete Quran thus existed in written form in the lifetime
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the Prophet.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Whenever a new revelation use to come to him, the Prophet would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; immediately call one of his scribes to write it down.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'Some people visited Zaid Ibn Thabit (one of the scribes of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Prophet) and asked him to tell them some stories about Allah's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Messenger. He replied: &quot;I was his (Prophet's) neighbor, and when the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inspiration descended on him he sent for me and I went to him and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wrote it down for him...&quot; (14)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Narrated by al-Bara': There was revealed 'Not equal are those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; believers who sit (home) and those who strive and fight in the cause
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of Allah' (4:95). The Prophet said: 'Call Zaid for me and let him
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bring the board, the ink pot and scapula bone.' Then he (Prophet)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; said: 'Write: Not equal are those believers...' (15)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Zaid is reported to have said: 'We use to compile the Qur'an from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; small scraps in the presence of the Apostle'. (16)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'The Prophet, while in Madinah, had about 48 scribes who use to write
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for him'. (17)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Abdullah Ibn 'Umar relates:... 'The Messenger of Allah (S) said: &quot;Do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not take the Qur'an on a journey with you, for I am afraid lest it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should fall into the hands of the enemy&quot;' (18)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; During the Prophet's last pilgrimage, he gave a sermon in which he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; said: 'I have left with you something which if you will hold fast t it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you will never fall into error - a plain indication, the Book of God
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Quran) and the practice of his Prophet...' (19)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'Besides the official manuscripts of the Quran kept with the Prophet,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; many of his companions use to possess their own written copies of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; revelation'. (20)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'A list of Companions of whom it is related that they had their own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; written collections included the following: Ibn Mas'ud, Ubay bin Ka'b,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ali, Ibn Abbas, Abu Musa, Hafsa, Anas bin Malik, Umar, Zaid bin
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thabit, Ibn Al-Zubair, Abdullah ibn Amr, Aisha, Salim, Umm Salama,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ubaid bin Umar'. (21)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'The best known among these (Prophet's Scribes) are: Ibn Masud, Ubay
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bin Kab and Zaid bin Thabit'. (22)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'Aisha and Hafsa, the wives of the Prophet had their own scripts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; written after the Prophet had died'. (23)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Conclusion:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The complete Quran was written down in front of the Prophet by several
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of his scribes and the companions possess their own copies of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Quran in the Prophet's lifetime. However the written material of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Quran in the Prophet's possession were not bounded between the two
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; covers in the form of a book, because the period of revelation of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Qur'an continued up until just a few days before the Prophet's death.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The task of collecting the Qur'an as a book was therefore undertaken
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by Abu Bakr, the first successor to the Prophet.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Written Quran in First Generation:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; At the battle of Yamama (633 CE), six months after the death of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Prophet, a number of Muslims, who had memorized the Quran were killed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hence it was feared that unless a written official copy of the Quran
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; were prepared, a large part of revelation might be lost.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Narrated Zaid bin Thabit al-Ansari, one of the scribes of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Revelation: Abu Bakr sent for me after the casualties among the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; warriors (of the battle) of Yamama (where a great number of Qurra
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (memorizers of the Quran, were killed). Umar was present with Abu Bakr
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; who said: &quot;Umar has come to me and said, the people have suffered
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; heavy casualties on the day of (the battle) of Yamama, and I am afraid
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that there will be some casualties among the Qurra at other places,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whereby a large part of the Quran may be lost, unless you collect it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (in one manuscript, or book)...so Abu Bakr said to me (Zaid bin
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thabit): You are a wise young man and we do not suspect you (of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; telling lies or of forgetfulness) and you used to write the Divine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Inspiration for Allah's Apostle. Therefore, look for the Qur'an and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; collect it (in one manuscript)'...So I started locating the Quranic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; material and collecting it from parchments, scapula, leafstalks of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; date palms and from the memories of men (who know it by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; heart)...&quot; (24)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, a committee was formed to under take the task of collecting the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; written Quranic material in the form of a book. The committee was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; headed by Zaid bin Thabit, the original scribe of the Prophet, who was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; also a memorizer of the complete Quran.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; '...Zaid bin Thabit had committed the entire Quran to memory...' (25)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The compilers in this committee, in examining written material
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; submitted to them, insisted on very stringent criteria as a safeguard
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; against any errors.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1. The material must have been originally written down in the presence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the Prophet; nothing written down later on the basis of memory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; alone was to be accepted. (26) 2. The material must be confirmed by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; two witnesses, that is to say, by two trustworthy persons testifying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that they themselves had heard the Prophet recite the passage in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; question. (27)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'The manuscript on which the Qur'an was collected, remained with Abu
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bakr till Allah took him unto Him, and then with Umar (the second
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; successor), till Allah took him unto Him, and finally it remained with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hafsa, 'Umar's daughter (and wife of the Prophet)'. (28)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This copy of the Quran, prepared by the committee of competent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; companions of the Prophet (which included Memorizers of the Quran) was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unanimous approved by the whole Muslim world. If they committee would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have made a error even of a single alphabet in transcribing the Quran,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Qurra (memorizers of the Quran) which totaled in the tens of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hundreds would have caught it right away and correct it. This is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exactly where the neat check and balance system of preservation of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Quran comes into play, but which is lacking for any other scripture
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; besides the Quran.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Official written copy by Uthman
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The Quran was originally revealed in Quraishi dialect of Arabic. But
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to facilitate the people who speak other dialects, in their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understanding and comprehension, Allah revealed the Quran finally in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seven dialects of Arabic. During the period of Caliph Uthman (second
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; successor to the Prophet) differences in reading the Quran among the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; various tribes became obvious, due to the various dialectical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recitations. Dispute was arising, with each tribe calling its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recitation as the correct one. This alarmed Uthman, who made a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; official copy in the Quraishi dialect, the dialect in which the Quran
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was revealed to the Prophet and was memorized by his companions. Thus
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this compilation by Uthman's Committee is not a different version of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Quran (like the Biblical versions) but the same original
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; revelation given to the Prophet by One God, Allah.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Narrated Anas bin Malik: Hudhaifa bin Al-Yaman came to Uthman at the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time when the people of Sham (Syria) and the people of Iraq were
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; waging war to conquer Armenia and Azherbijan. Hudhaifa was afraid of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; their differences in the recitation of the Quran, so he said to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Uthman, 'O chief of the Believers! Save this nation before they differ
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about the Book (Quran) as Jews and Christians did before'. So Uthman
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sent a message to Hafsa saying, 'Send us the manuscripts of the Quran
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so that we may compile the Quranic materials in perfect copies and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; return the manuscripts to you'. Hafsa sent it to Uthman. 'Uthman then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ordered Zaid bin Thabit, 'Abdullah bin Az-Zubair, Said bin Al-As and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Abdur Rahman bin Harith bin Hisham to rewrite the manuscripts in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perfect copies. Uthman said to the three Quraishi men, 'In case you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; disagree with Zaid bin Thabit on any point in the Quran, then write it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in their (Quraishi) tongue'. They did so, and when they had written
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; many copies, Uthman sent to every Muslim province one copy of what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they had copied and ordered that all the other Quranic materials
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whether written in fragmentary manuscripts or whole copies, be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; burnt...&quot; (29)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Again a very stringent criteria was set up by this Committee to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prevent any alteration of the Revelation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1. The earlier recension (Original copy prepared by Abu Bakr) was to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; serve as the principal basis of the new one. (30) 2. Any doubt that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; might be raised as to the phrasing of a particular passage in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; written text was to be dispelled by summoning persons known to have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; learned the passage in question from the Prophet. (31) 3. Uthman
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; himself was to supervise the work of the Council. (32)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; When the final recension was completed, Uthman sent a copy of it to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; each of the major cities of Makka, Damascus, Kufa, Basra and Madina.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The action of Uthman to burn the other copies besides the final
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recension, though obviously drastic, was for the betterment and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; harmony of the whole community and was unanimously approved by the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Companions of the Prophet.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Zaid ibn Thabit is reported to have said: &quot;I saw the Companions of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Muhammad (going about) saying, 'By God, Uthman has done well! By God,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Uthman has done well!&quot; (33)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Another esteemed Companion Musab ibn Sad ibn Abi Waqqas said: &quot;I saw
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the people assemble in large number at Uthman's burning of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prescribed copies (of the Quran), and they were all pleased with his
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; action; not a one spoke out against him&quot;. (34)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ali ibn Abu Talib, the cousin of the Prophet and the fourth successor
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the Prophet commented: &quot;If I were in command in place of Uthman, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would have done the same&quot;. (35)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of the copies made by Uthman, two still exist to our day. One is in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the city of Tashkent, (Uzbekistan) and the second one is in Istanbul
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Turkey). Below is a brief account of both these copies:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1. The copy which Uthman sent to Madina was reportedly removed by the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Turkish authorities to Istanbul, from where it came to Berlin during
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; World War I. The Treaty of Versailles, which concluded World War I,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contains the following clause:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'Article 246: Within six months from the coming into force of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; present Treaty, Germany will restore to His Majesty, King of Hedjaz,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the original Koran of Caliph Othman, which was removed from Madina by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Turkish authorities and is stated to have been presented to the ex-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Emperor William II&quot;. (36)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'This manuscript then reached Istanbul, but not Madina (Where it now
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; resides)'. (37)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2. The second copy in existence is kept in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. 'It
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; may be the Imam (master) manuscript or one of the other copies made at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the time of Uthman'. (38)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It Came to Samarkand in 890 Hijra (1485) and remained there till 1868.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then it was taken to St.Petersburg by the Russians in 1869. It
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; remained there till 1917. A Russian orientalist gave a detailed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; description of it, saying that many pages were damaged and some were
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; missing. A facsimile, some 50 copies, of this mushaf (copy) was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; produced by S.Pisareff in 1905. A copy was sent to the Ottoman Sultan
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'Abdul Hamid, to the Shah of Iran, to the Amir of Bukhara, to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Afghanistan, to Fas and some important Muslim personalities. One copy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is now in the Columbia University Library (U.S.A.). (39)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'The Manuscript was afterwards returned to its former place and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reached Tashkent in 1924, where it has remained since'. (40)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Conclusion:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'Two of the copies of the Qur'an which were originally prepared in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time of Caliph Uthman, are still available to us today and their text
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and arrangement can be compared, by anyone who cares to do, with any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other copy of the Quran, be it in print or handwritten, from any place
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or period of time. They will be found identical'. (41)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It can now be proclaimed, through the evidences provided above, with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; full conviction and certainty that the Prophet memorized the entire
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Quran, had it written down in front of him through his scribes, many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of his companions memorized the entire revelation and in turn possess
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; their own private copies for recitation and contemplation. This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; process of dual preservation of the Quran in written and in the memory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was carried in each subsequent generation till our time, without any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deletion, interpolation or corruption of this Divine Book.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sir Williams Muir states, &quot; There is otherwise every security,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; internal and external, that we possess the text which Muhammad himself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; gave forth and used&quot;. (42)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sir William Muir continues, &quot;There is probably no other book in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world which has remained twelve centuries (now fourteen) with so pure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a text&quot;. (43)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This divine protection provided to the Quran, the Last Reveled Guide
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to Humanity, is proclaimed by One God in the Quran:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We* (Allah) have, without doubt, send down the Message; and We will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assuredly Guard it (from corruption)' (Quran - Chapter 15, Verse 9).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *('We' is the plural of Majesty, and not the Christian plural of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; trinity)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Compare this divine and historical preservation of the Quran with any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; literature, be it religious or secular and it becomes evident that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; none possess similar miraculous protection. And as states earlier, a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; belief is as authentic as the authenticity of its scripture. And if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any scripture is not preserved, how can we be certain that the belief
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arising out of this scripture is divine or man made, and if we are not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sure about the belief itself, then our salvation in the hereafter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would be jeopardized. Thus this above evidence for the protection of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Quran from any corruption is a strong hint about its divine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; origin. We request all open hearted persons to read, understand and
</em><br />
