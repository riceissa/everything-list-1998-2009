Stathis:
<br />
I try a 'funny' aspect.
<br />
Not in Tom's rather utilitarian point (whether it is good or bad, making a 
<br />
person happy or inspired) but upon your questioning the 'truth' in (among 
<br />
others) religious stories.
<br />
<br />Consider 'numbers' as religion. How many of us (you?) had a 'revelation' 
<br />
about numbers per se? Mostly accepted the bible of Plato and the teachings 
<br />
of math-teacher priests.  It became a belief-system - no argument.
<br />
Is it &quot;true&quot;?
<br />
Does it 'exist' in the universality?
<br />
Of course, the idea &quot;lives&quot; in minds so it exists. There is no postulate 
<br />
that an 'existing' idea has to be &quot;matter-physics&quot; based. The 'mental world 
<br />
is part of the 'demental' (as you know from your profession&lt;G&gt;).
<br />
Religion lives in minds, ergo the 'facts' included are true. It can be read 
<br />
in &quot;script&quot; and inventive people say they have revelations just like what 
<br />
Newton's apple brought up.
<br />
We have a belief system that religion is 'not true', others: that 'religion 
<br />
is true'.
<br />
I don't believe in AR: does it make it 'untrue'?
<br />
We formulate our mindset upon stories figmented by primitive observations of 
<br />
what ancestors saw and speculated.
<br />
So do religious people  on other wavelengths.
<br />
Can you ask Zeus upon Athenae? I asked Bruno upon numbers. Many people do 
<br />
not share MY belief ystem of the wholeness. Does it make it untrue? In who's 
<br />
terms?
<br />
Everybody has a certain level of 'faith' in HIS OWN belief.
<br />
Even the 'utilitarian' aspect is personal. The smallpox virus instigated the 
<br />
social structural renovation of the western world. We judge within our 
<br />
momentary personal interests.
<br />
Maybe the demise of humankind is a good thing for the biosphere.
<br />
<br />Opimistically yours
<br />
John

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The problem with religious beliefs is not that they are bizarre (after

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; all, many

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; scientific theories at first glance are just as bizarre) but that there

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; religious beliefs because

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; they would like them to be true or because their parents brought them up

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that way.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It may be interesting to know if a religious belief makes a person

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; happy, has inpired

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; good deeds or great art, and so on, but the specific question I want

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; answered is whether
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; it is true. For example, it is true that the smallpox virus causes a

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; severe illness which has

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; killed million of people over the centuries, and this is true regardless 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of whether it is good,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; bad, interesting or whatever. I would like to know whether it is the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; case that Jesus rose from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; his tomb after being crucified or Athena sprang from Zeus' head after 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Hephaestus struck it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; with an axe, and I would like to know this independently of whether it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; makes an interesting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; or inspiring story.

<br />
When I am confident about some empirical belief, I am confident that a 
<br />
perfectly fair,
<br />
disinterested observer given the same evidence that I have will come to the 
<br />
same conclusion
<br />
that I do, or at least entertain it as a serious possibility. For example, 
<br />
if I am confident that
<br />
the Quran was written in Arabic in the 7th century, then I am confident that 
<br />
any reasonable person
<br />
who went to the trouble to investigate the matter would agree with me. If I 
<br />
am a Muslim, I
<br />
may be as certain about the evidence supporting that the Quran is the word 
<br />
of God as I am
<br />
about the evidence supporting that the Quran was written in Arabic in the 
<br />
7th century. However,
<br />
while as a Muslim I may be just as confident that a reasonable and 
<br />
disinterested observer would agree
<br />
about when the Quran was written, I would be far less confident that he 
<br />
would agree about its
<br />
divine origin (and perhaps be converted to Islam). This presents a problem: 
<br />
I can't say that both
<br />
my beliefs about the divine origin of the Quran and when it was written are 
<br />
epistemologically
<br />
equivalent and empirically equally well founded, but hold that a 
<br />
disinterested observer would likely
<br />
accept one but not the other. I have to say that one of my beliefs is *not* 
<br />
as firmly rooted in the
<br />
objective evidence as the other, but that in order to drag it up to the same 
<br />
level of believability, it
<br />
requires something in addition which even the perfectly fair and 
<br />
disinterested observer lacks: namely,
<br />
faith. And when you allow faith to tip the balance in these equations, 
<br />
anything at all can be taken as
<br />
true.
