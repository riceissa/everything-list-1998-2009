<br />I think that is probably true about the Church Thesis, which I
<br />
would paraphrase as saying that there are no physical processes more
<br />
computationally powerful than a Turing machine, or in other words that
<br />
the universe could in principle be simulated on a TM.  I wouldn't be
<br />
surprised if most people who believe that minds can be simulated on
<br />
TMs also believe that everything can be simulated on a TM.
<br />
<br />(I don't see the two philosophical questions as absolutely linked, though.
<br />
I could imagine someone who accepts that minds can be simulated on TMs,
<br />
but who believes that naked singularities or some other exotic physical
<br />
phenomenon might allow for super-Turing computation.)
<br />
<br />But isn't AR the notion that abstract mathematical and computational
<br />
objects exist, to the extent that the mere potential existence of a
<br />
computation means that we have to consider the possibility that we are
<br />
presently experiencing and living within that computation?  I don't
<br />
think that is nearly as widely believed.
<br />
<br />That simple mathematical objects have a sort of existence is probably
<br />
unobjectionable, but most people probably don't give it too much thought.
<br />
For most, it's a question analogous to whether a falling tree makes a
<br />
noise when there's no one there to hear it.  Whether the number 3 existed
<br />
before people thought about it is an abstract philosophical question
<br />
without much importance or connection to reality, in most people's minds,
<br />
including computationalists and AI researchers.
<br />
<br />To then elevate this question of arithmetical realism to the point
<br />
where it has actual implications for our own perceptions and our models
<br />
of reality would, I think, be a new idea for most computationalists.
<br />
Right here on this list I believe we've had people who would accept
<br />
the basic doctrines of computationalism, who would believe that it is
<br />
possible for a human mind to be &quot;uploaded&quot; into a computer, but who
<br />
would insist that the computer must be physical!  A mere potential or
<br />
abstractly existing computer would not be good enough.  I suspect that
<br />
such views would not be particularly rare among computationalists.
