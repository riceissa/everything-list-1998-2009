Dear Bruno, thanks for a detailed reply.
<br />
<br />If you re-read *your* words in my first quote (or in J.Corgan's quote) your
<br />
words *(&quot;How could I ever be able to define &quot;conscious&quot; for a state without
<br />
any memory?&quot;)* sound unfounded, unless you emphasize the *&quot;define&quot;* in it.
<br />
My question also referred to its *'existence'* rather than a fitting
<br />
definition. Similarly I cannot figure what you meant (below):
<br />
<br />*Bruno: &quot;... you recover your real identity, ...&quot;* - *after* your memory got
<br />
lost. What is your identity without your memories? What do you *recover?* Or
<br />
is the 'lost' only hiding and available? The skull and neurons are figments
<br />
of the physical world, the genetic neuronal 'functions' work also only on
<br />
memory-induced topical items. (Which I did not adjust with the
<br />
memory-process idea I mention below).
<br />
I don't agree that e.g. a newborn with just marginal in-tomb collected
<br />
'memory' *IS* the same person that it will soon turn into (cf. Prof.
<br />
Singer,  Princeton) after getting more experience (by some(?) kind of
<br />
memory).
<br />
<br />Johnathan Corgan separates himself from the LSD-like halucinogenal
<br />
consciousness and asks, what math Platonists may apply for such
<br />
*altered *computations by
<br />
a different kind Ccness. I separated myself (on other lists, now all
<br />
discussiong Ccness and related ideas) from results obtained on psych
<br />
&quot;patients&quot; because I am curious about the 'normal'  (i.e. average and
<br />
un-impeded) human mentality rather than the sickness induced
<br />
exceptions/distortions.
<br />
<br />I consider &quot;a person&quot; as a total complexity (as we say: mind-body+ unit) in
<br />
its entire experience (memory-capability) and if a *teleporation* is said to
<br />
take only part of such with it, I write it off as a different person from
<br />
the (orig).  person. (Besides my aversion towards thought-experiments).
<br />
<br />I wonder if we dream under REM? I placed dreaming into the last period of
<br />
waking up. REM is the deepest closure from the aware Ccness. I think.
<br />
(Stathis?) Is there a way to remember REM period ideas?
<br />
<br />Bruno: &quot;...I don't interpret....&quot;
<br />
I think you do, do you do it consciously or not. Without interpretation you
<br />
cannot arrive at your usable terms. Raw data are - in human logical thinking
<br />
- meaningless and contentless as far as one wants to use them in
<br />
conscious(?) thinking.
<br />
You may have refered to the level of interpretation as adjusting into your
<br />
prior mindset, or just store as (roughly interpreted) glimps. Discussing
<br />
with others? food for your 1st pers. interpretation from the *same* of
<br />
others.
<br />
(Remember: I don't condone 3rd pers. straight entry into one's mentality).
<br />
<br />&quot;...Memory is very important...&quot;
<br />
Yes, but what is it? (If it is an &quot;it&quot;, at all, not a process) I disagree
<br />
with the neurologists that molecular changes in brain-tissue (neurons, glia
<br />
and maybe other proteins) &quot;STORE&quot; the experience as memory and can be
<br />
recalled(!!) when needed. I dropped my 1st objection: nature has so many
<br />
code-possibilities that in the quadrillion+ of conformational groups in all
<br />
that stuff EVERYTHING can be codedly stored, but then, when needed, you
<br />
require a similarly flexible and mutiple code for the recall  to find it. In
<br />
other words: you have to recall it in order to recall it. For the finding
<br />
'coding' recall you require a similar ordering system to do that and so on,
<br />
so the idea cannot be started except from the ready (and already found)
<br />
memory you are looking for.
<br />
<br />Now the process? If one allows the 'thought' (mentality, mind-stuff, you
<br />
name it) to be above space and time (although capable of considering them)
<br />
you may *recall *a memory (!?) by &quot;going back in time&quot; and take another
<br />
look. That may account for some flexibility in memory-recall, (vs. an
<br />
inflexible molecular/chip change). It also can serve repetitive learning by
<br />
easing connectivity in the multiple usage.  - Just an idea.
<br />
<br />Thanks again for your input
<br />
<br />John

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I cannot define &quot;conscious&quot; for a state with memory. How could I ever be

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I am also not really saying &quot;without any memory&quot;, I said &quot;without any

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; memory of ...&quot;, and then a list with &quot;my usual memories, person, space,

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time. But in that experience you feel like you recover your real identity,

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or older memories, and it happens that that identity has nothing to do with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; memory, except you remember that, or perhaps better you just feel very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; familar with the state. A big déjà-vu. Some describes this as a new quale. I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can hardly describe the &quot;feeling&quot;, like you can hardly describe the feeling
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of seeing blue to a blind.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is true in fine and precision for all consciousness experience, and

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't even really try to understand. I just live it. When I try to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand I use a theory and logic, etc. When I live, I eat, or I sleep,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and in this case I smoke a psycho-active product (like alcohol or tea,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; except salvia seems more safe, even if it seems more impressive than the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience with tea).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You may experience a connectionless and meaningless *wirwar *emerging in

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (literally) senseless randomity - not even recognizing that it is a

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I certainly develop connexion; like with the &quot;Lady Salvia&quot;. The salvia
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience is like dream, except it is of a different nature, but it has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; repeatable patterns, including connecting and disconnecting many things.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then you learn by discussing with others. It provides some new angle on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Then you have a 'perceived (solipsist) world to be 'aware of'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is already interpretating too much. I don't interpret. It is raw
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiences. I discuss with other people of their raw experiences, and we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; learn in the traditional non-solipsist way. Of course, with consciousness,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; each of us is its own only guinea pig).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now in that you can continue reading. But what will you read?...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; With comp I have a subtheory which predicts that some perturbation of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain (or computer) can  lower down your brain capacity of filtering of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness. I am still not sure. I have made dreams which confirms
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; feeling of &quot;higher order&quot; form of consciousness, but typically my brain was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more active (REM state).  I am not reading something. Just taking the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; opportunity that a product, which in my opinion is very safe (certainly much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; safer than alcohol, tobacco), can lead you easily to a, rather fascinating,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;altered state of consciousness&quot;  to learn, perhaps something on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;consciousness&quot;, perhaps something on realities.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Regards (hopefully with retained memory, so I still remember you...)

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Memory is very important. But even just to manage them well, we have to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; forget things. We forget things all the time. The relation of consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and memory is a fascinating question, and the experience of salvia, has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; already shaken some certainties I still had (without knowing). It has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certainly renewed my interest in the fuse thought experiment, a bit like the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; movie &quot;the prestige&quot;. Forgetting is the path to abstraction; which is useful
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the comprehension search.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have also discovered that plant helps also headache, also on other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; people, especially the real &quot;migraine&quot;. I will not try to make a list of

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; benefits of that plant, it would be like a propaganda. It is a lovely magic

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; thanks for your interesting answer, I have some questions though.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; course, as I said, this will depend of what you mean by &quot;you&quot;. In
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; case
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; you accept the idea of surviving with amnesia, you can even get to a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; state where you &quot;know&quot; you are immortal, because your immortality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;past event&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; I would equate total amnesia with death (we've been through this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; before,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Stathis has written about this, if I remember correctly).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; I remember Quentin identifying himself with his memory, and very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; logically, identifying total amnesia with death.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; It is a complex matter. Total amnesia concern only some form of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; declarative knowledge, you cannot loss your &quot;procedural memory&quot;,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; because it is part of ... arithmetic, and common to all elementary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; knowers.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Well I agree that in total amnesia thought experiment... well the amnesia
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is not total... the subject still knows his former language and other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; knowledge... except all knowledges/memories about *who* he was is lost. And
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; in this sense IF in one minute I lose these memories about my current ME,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; then my current ME is dead for all practical purpose. And IF mwi and/or comp
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is true then there must exists a moment which is a successor of current ME
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; without the current ME memories being lost... so I should end up in this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; state and not in the state where my identity was erased because like I can't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; be where I'm dead... I can't be where I'm not. The 'I' which is referred is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the one with memories, the one without cannot meaningfully say he is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; successor of me now, except if he sees like in real world &quot;total&quot; amnesia
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; case that his body was mine and causally connected to mine. But in comp
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; sense this is not meaningful... If my mind can be copied and transferred in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; a &quot;metal&quot; body, this metal body is not causally connected to my biological
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; body... but that mind is a continuation of current me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; So in this sense, if you say that it is possible that all successor moment
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to a moment could lead to a &quot;total&quot; amnesia, then QI is false... or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; tautologically true because it means you are everyone (ie: no one). But for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; all practical purpose current ME would be dead.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; both Moscow and Washington the 18 March 2009, say)? The problem is that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; reconstitution machine did dysfunction in Washington, so that, from the 18
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; March 2009 up to the 20 Augustus 2009 you (the you in Washington) suffered a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  &quot;total amnesia&quot;.  And then, &quot;you&quot; recovered slowly and progressively from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that through adequate medication up to a total recall, the 23 December (and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; none of yous did move from W or M).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Note that with high concentrated extract of Salvia Divinorum, people can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;suffer&quot; (or &quot;enjoy&quot;) a total amnesia, where you forget not just your name
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and memories of life, but you forget even what is a person, what is space,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; what is time.  Yet you remain conscious. Life appears as a dream, that you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; recall vaguely, and then forget, and then you forget you did that dream. Yet
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;you&quot; come back. (See the reports, I don't encourage its consumption, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; anyone interested by consciousness can be interested by such reports).

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; OK.
