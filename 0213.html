<br />What is needed is an operational definition of &quot;free will&quot;.  
<br />
I want some way to tell from *external* observations of 
<br />
a system whether it has free will.  Can one come up with 
<br />
a definition such that humans show free will but electrons
<br />
do not?  I want to be able to apply the definition to a
<br />
mechanical intelligence.
<br />
<br />It seems to me that this is likely to involve some notion of 
<br />
unpredictability.  Since I do not want to include electrons 
<br />
as having free will, the unpredictability has to go beyond 
<br />
a statistical predictability.
<br />
<br />I agree that the levels notion is important, but would emphasize the 
<br />
emergent properties aspect rather than the compositional aspect.  
<br />
Thus molecules display huge variety which is barely present at the 
<br />
atomic level.  Cells display self-reproduction which is barely present 
<br />
among single molecules.  Multi-cell beings have such emergent properties 
<br />
as self awareness, intelligence, and values.
<br />
<br />A point of an operational definition of free will would seem to me to be
<br />
that the values and intelligence of a person are not directly
<br />
observable,
<br />
but are inferred from their past actions.  Having some notion of their
<br />
values, some predictability is possible, but lack of precision in 
<br />
measuring values leaves a large amount of unpredictability.  Since we
<br />
are
<br />
including autonomous agents for which establishing precise starting 
<br />
conditions is not possible or is ethically inadmissable, then this could
<br />
only be tested on ensembles of beings.  
<br />
<br />Problem: suicide would appear to be statistically predictable 
<br />
for ensembles of people, yet surely this is an act (the ultimate act??) 
<br />
of free will.  Or is it?  Well, it has to depend on age, culture, 
<br />
status within the culture, ... Age is rather clearly not a direct 
<br />
determinant, but an indicator for other variables not easily measured.  
<br />
So if there is only a residual variance after taking into account 
<br />
explanatory variables, then one might want to argue that 
<br />
not all of the suicides *had* exercised free will, even if they 
<br />
could have.  But one would want to appeal to the residual variance 
<br />
to argue that free will was shown by some of the suicides
<br />
(and non-suicides), and potentially available to all of them.  
<br />
Thus free will is shown if we cannot build a model that accounts 
<br />
for both the mean and variance from the single prediction of a 
<br />
probability for an ensemble.
<br />
<br />I believe this will exclude electrons (prepared spin up in x direction,
<br />
spin measured in y direction), but I'm not at all sure it excludes
<br />
amoeba.  And it seems a rather weak concept if it is manifested by
<br />
single cell creatures, so there are likely some basic ideas missing.
<br />
<br />Cordially,
<br />
Gale
