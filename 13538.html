</em><br />
<br />What sort of misconstruals do you mean? I'm interested...
<br />
<br />'organisational complexity' does not capture the concept I'm after.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; COLIN

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The question-begging loop at this epistemic boundary is a minefield.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [[engage tiptoe mode]]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would say:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (1) The evolutionary algorithms are not 'doing science' on the natural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world. They are doing science on abstract entities whose relationship with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the natural world is only in the mind(consciousness) of their grounder -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the human programmer. The science done by the artefact can be the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perfectly good science of abstractions, but simply wrong or irrelevant
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; insofar as it bears any ability to prescribe or verify claims/propositions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about the natural world (about which it has no awareness whatever). The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; usefulness of the outcome (patents) took human involvement. The inventor
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (software) doesn't even know it's in a universe, let alone that it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; participated in an invention process.
</em><br />
<br />This objection is easily countered in theory. Hook up your
<br />
evolutionary algorithm to a chemsitry workbench, and let it go with
<br />
real chemicals. Practically, its a bit more difficult of course, most
<br />
likely leading to the lab being destroyed in some explosion.
<br />
<br />Theoretical scientists, do not have laboratories to interface to,
<br />
though, only online repositories of datasets and papers. A theoretical
<br />
algorithmic scientist is a more likely proposition.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (2) &quot;Is this evolutionary algorithm conscious then?&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In the sense that we are conscious of the natural world around us? Most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definitely no. Nowhere in the computer are any processes that include all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aspects of the physics of human cortical matter. 
</em><br />
<br />...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Based on this, of the 2 following positions, which is less vulnerable to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; critical attack?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A) Information processing (function) begets consciousness, regardless of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the behaviour of the matter doing the information processing (form).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Computers process information. Therefore I believe the computer is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; B) Human cortical qualia are a necessary condition for the scientific
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behaviour and unless the complete suite of the physics involved in that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; process is included in the computer, the computer is not conscious.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Which form of question-begging gets the most solid points as science?  (B)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of course. (B) is science and has an empirical future. Belief (A) is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; religion, not science.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bit of a no-brainer, eh?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />I think you're showing clear signs of carbon-lifeform-ism here. Whilst
<br />
I can say fairly clearly that I believe my fellow humans are
<br />
conscious, and that I beleive John Koza's evolutionary programs
<br />
aren't, I do not have a clear-cut operational test of
<br />
consciousness. Its like the test for pornography - we know it when we
<br />
see it. It is therefore not at all clear to me that some n-th generational
<br />
improvement on an evolutionary algorithm won't be considered conscious
<br />
at some time in the future. It is not at all clear which aspects of
<br />
human cortical systems are required for consciousness.
