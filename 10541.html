<br />
Scientists are part of the natural world, like elephants. Scientific
<br />
behaviour, like elephant behaviour, has invariants across the entire set of
<br />
scientific disciplines (humanity) as for elephanity(!) = elephants behaving
<br />
elephantly. Not many invariants, but a few. One of those is creativity, for
<br />
example. Not all are adopted well by all scientists. But there are
<br />
invariants to be found, even if they are not always adopted.... 
<br />
<br />Scientists are regularity in the natural world. There is absolutely no
<br />
reason why Scientific behaviour can't be expressed as a natural law like any
<br />
other law. Their behaviour is not that of a musician. Their behaviour is not
<br />
that of a tax accountant. Whatever their behaviour it is unique and can be
<br />
expressed as a basic minimal prescription, a statistic like and other
<br />
natural law.
<br />
<br />I have constructed a prototype of what it may be like. The difference
<br />
between this law and all others is that it is implicit in scientists in that
<br />
unlike any other law of nature it has never been explicitly formulated, but
<br />
is passed on by mimicry. The complete set of all J+1 currently available
<br />
'laws of nature' (any paper in any scientific journal expressing empirical
<br />
results qualifies to go into this set....) is:
<br />
<br />T = {t0, t1 ..tN, .. tJ }
<br />
<br />These are the laws of appearances, the T-aspect. The special law t0 is the
<br />
one for scientific behaviour. The status of these laws is as follows:
<br />
<br />By acting 'as-if' t0 was literally driving the natural world you can predict
<br />
(statistically) the behaviour of a scientist.
<br />
By acting 'as-if' tx was literally driving the natural world you can predict
<br />
(statistically) the behaviour of those things that were used to formulate
<br />
tx. For example newton's 2nd law f = ma reformulated into the form of the
<br />
set T members would be one such law - this would enable a human to predict
<br />
the behaviour of mass m.
<br />
<br />All the laws in the set T can be treated as beliefs necessary to drive
<br />
behaviour of a HUMAN in order that the natural world be predictable. They
<br />
say NOTHING about the actual underlying causal necessities of the natural
<br />
world. That claim cannot be made: there is no evidence. Novel Technology
<br />
proves the laws as predictive and therefore that the causal parent = the
<br />
human behaviour resulting from believing in the laws is adequate...remember
<br />
the laws are formulated with evidence of behaviour as presented by qualia
<br />
into the head of scientists. To the best of my ability the law t0 is as
<br />
follows:
<br />
<br />======================================
<br />
tN =	The natural world in &lt; insert context&gt; behaves as follows: &lt;insert
<br />
behaviour&gt;
<br />
<br />t0 =	The natural world in &lt;the context of being scientific about the
<br />
natural world&gt; behaves as follows: &lt; to formulate statements of type tN,
<br />
each of which is a statementNote 1 of regularityNote 2 in a specific
<br />
contextNote 3 in the natural world arrived at through the process of
<br />
critical argumentNote 4 and that in principle can be refuted through the
<br />
process of experiencingNote 5 evidenceNote 6 of the regularity Note 7&gt;.
<br />
====================================
<br />
I have embedded the notes down below. They don't matter much in what I am
<br />
trying to convey. Creativity is in them. Objectivity is in them.
<br />
<br />Just like a thought about thinking is a member of the set of all possible
<br />
thoughts, the law t0 is a law of type tN about the formulation of laws of
<br />
type tN.
<br />
<br />The set T does not have to be consistent. Different laws in set T can
<br />
contradict each other. That is they can be egregiously wrong outside their
<br />
context. The set T is growing exponentially day by day. Each member of set T
<br />
represents a net brain state (achieved during dynamic brain activity)
<br />
comprising the holding of a belief about the natural world by a scientist.
<br />
That is all that is claimed.
<br />
<br />The property of the natural world that enables t0 is intrinsic (innate) to
<br />
brain material: the extraction of invariance from perceptual fields. The
<br />
accuracy of t0 is proven by observation of history in that it has been used
<br />
all along by scientists and can be seen to be in operation all along even
<br />
though any explicit t0 at any time could be very very wrong (it was never
<br />
written down until now)!
<br />
<br />t0, as a 'law of science' is NOT 'scientific method'. Scientific method is
<br />
just detail inside the overall behaviour. This law t0 is novel. It is not in
<br />
science literature and it is not in philosophy literature and it is not in
<br />
anthropology literature.
<br />
<br />Note that I have a second aspect T' ( a new set about underlying structure)
<br />
and the pair T and T' form the characterisation of science called dual
<br />
aspect. Set T and set T' are not claimed to 'be' the natural world, but
<br />
merely be 'about' it. Qualia as scientific evidence are evidence for both T
<br />
and T' equally. Natural laws in T' (future) will account for structures that
<br />
generate the qualia that are used to formulate the laws T. The system is
<br />
quite consistent and empirically backed throughout.
<br />

<br /><br />t0 Notes:
<br />
Please note that the detail included in these notes is not intended to be
<br />
complete or even appropriately configured. It is merely intended to be a
<br />
prototype - as starting point - for ongoing development. The details have no
<br />
fundamental bearing on the outcome of establishment of a t0, its framework
<br />
and delineation of inconsistency in science.
<br />
<br />Note 1.	Formulation of a statement is the creative act of a cognitive agent
<br />
and the statement must be well formed in that it is consistently derived
<br />
from a well formed axiomatic context (see note 3). The statement is a
<br />
potential truth about the universe or a prediction of same. Philosophical
<br />
considerations can be used here to assist with the creative process.
<br />
<br />Note 2.	This includes statistical (probabilistic/stochastic) regularities.
<br />
Indeed it is arguable that all empirical theorems are describing statistical
<br />
objects. Most, if not all, current theories of the natural world describe
<br />
regularities in the behaviour of statistics evident in the colligative
<br />
behaviour of multiple instances of similar natural structures. Ms. and Mr.
<br />
Average have predictable behaviour useful in making decisions. These people
<br />
do not actually exist (they are virtual). Nevertheless we can formulate
<br />
theorems that can be said to describe the natural world in a useful way i.e.
<br />
one that facilitates decision making. The decision being made is one of
<br />
configuration of initial conditions which will subsequently lead to the
<br />
natural world achieving a desired state (technology).
<br />
<br />Note 3.	A well formed set of axioms (assumptions held to be self evident for
<br />
the purpose) establishing the basis for the hypothesis that is the
<br />
'statement'. A theoretical system may be said to be axiomatised if a set of
<br />
statements, the axioms, has been formulated which satisfies the following
<br />
four fundamental requirements: (a) a system of axioms must be free from
<br />
contradiction (whether self-contradiction or mutual contradiction). This is
<br />
equivalent to the demand that not every arbitrarily chosen statement is
<br />
deducible from it. (b) The system must be independent, i.e. it must not
<br />
contain any axiom deducible from the remaining axioms. In other words, a
<br />
statement is to be called an axiom only if it is not deducible within the
<br />
rest of the system. (c) The axioms should be sufficient for the deduction of
<br />
all statements belonging to the theory which is to be axiomatised, and (d)
<br />
axioms should be necessary, for the same purpose; which means that they
<br />
should contain no superfluous assumptions.
<br />
<br />Note 4.	This incorporates the creative act of induction and all critical
<br />
argument that stabilises on a final chosen statement.
<br />
<br />Note 5.	This means that the regularity shall occur in the experiential life
<br />
of an observer. This prescribes phenomenal consciousness as the source of
<br />
all evidence. This may include the use of instruments which make visible
<br />
otherwise unobservable aspects of the natural world. Instruments are
<br />
technology and exploratory regimes resulting from previously formulated
<br />
statements.
<br />
<br />Note 6.	Evidence results from the act of deduction and the creative act of
<br />
formulation of a statement (via the same method of critical argument) which
<br />
leads to a choice of initial conditions as a causal precursor to an
<br />
experiment exhibiting behaviour in relation to the chosen statement.
<br />
<br />Note 7.	Statements tN are not a prescription of truth in that it is not
<br />
proven by the scientific process. Scientific statements, unlike mathematical
<br />
theorems, are never proven. They live life permanently in the inferior state
<br />
of being 'not wrong' but of great predictive utility. This is mandated
<br />
logically because no matter how predictive any one theorem may be it is
<br />
always possible to configure doubt in accuracy or applicability in new
<br />
context.
