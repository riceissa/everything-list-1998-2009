Hi Tim,
<br />
<br />I never have seen someone so electronically sensitive
<br />
(except perhaps my french director thesis ... ;-)
<br />
<br />You know how much I have enjoyed your posts, and you know
<br />
how many mathematical structures we share the taste for.
<br />
(categories, modal logic, Baez stuff ...)
<br />
<br />But, indeed, apparently we disagree somewhere.
<br />
<br />But this is certainly not a reason to leave the list, ...unless
<br />
you believe we are dogmatical?
<br />
<br />I think the disagreement occurred on the interpretation of
<br />
quantum mechanics. For example, when you told (to Hal Finney) ...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I would say &quot;nothing&quot; about the past prior to a measurement
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;being made.
</em><br />
<br />...you really talk like Bohr. The whole point of Everett is that
<br />
measurement is not something special.
<br />
<br />So my feeling is that you have not yet really acknowledged the
<br />
enormity of the quantum. I would suggest you to read the original
<br />
papers by Everett(*). In my opinion NOBODY has ever been as clear
<br />
and honest as Everett on quantum mechanics.
<br />
<br />But the misunderstanding between us is perhaps deeper. Everett
<br />
deduced the MANY (branches, relative-alternative states, worlds,
<br />
histories, .... call it like you want) FROM the Schroedinger Wave
<br />
Equation (SWE) + the computationalist theory of mind. Perhaps it
<br />
is comp which trouble you (you would not be the first!). My thesis
<br />
basically illustrated that most of the weirder aspect of the quantum are
<br />
not really consequences of SWE but are already consequences of comp.
<br />
(and that is relatively easy to show, actually I show more, I show
<br />
that the whole quantum must follow from the comp hyp).
<br />
In that case, i.e. the misunderstanding concerns comp, everybody
<br />
will learn something if you told us where
<br />
in the &quot;universal dovetailer thought experiment (UDA)&quot; you suspect a
<br />
flaw.
<br />
<br />I think that most of us have a scientific attitude, that is they
<br />
are modest and agnostic on the fundamental issues, and just try
<br />
to figure out what the others are trying to say and how to clarify the
<br />
difficulties, and even sometimes just to clarify where we disagree.
<br />
<br />I told you that you came a little too early with your toposes
<br />
concerning the mathematical development of the &quot;everything&quot; type
<br />
of TOE. But, in case you leave the list I would say you would leave
<br />
it a little too early concerning the understanding of the main
<br />
fundamental issues.
<br />
<br />Don't force us to wait for another reality for having the pleasure
<br />
to discuss with you ...
<br />
<br />Bruno
