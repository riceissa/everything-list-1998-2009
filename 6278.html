<br />
&nbsp;From &quot;A Different Universe&quot; by Robert Laughlin (winner of the Nobel 
<br />
Prize in physics in 1998):
<br />
<br />&quot;Greek creation myths satirize many things in modern life, particularly 
<br />
cosmological theories.  Exploding things, such as dynamite or the big 
<br />
bang, are unstable.  Theories of explosions, including the first 
<br />
picoseconds of the big bang, thus cross Barriers of Relevance and are 
<br />
inherently unfalsifiable, notwithstanding widely cited supporting 
<br />
&quot;evidence&quot; such as isotopic abundances at the surfaces of stars and the 
<br />
cosmic microwave background anisotropy. One might as well claim to infer 
<br />
the properties of atoms from the storm damage of a hurricane.  Beyond 
<br />
the big bang we have  really unfalsifiable concepts of budding little 
<br />
baby universes with different properties that must have been created 
<br />
before the inflationary epoch, but which are now fundamentally 
<br />
undetectable due to being beyond the light horizon.  Beyond even that we 
<br />
have the anthropic principle- the &quot;explanation&quot; that the universe we can 
<br />
see has the properties it does by virtue of our being in it.  It is fun 
<br />
to imagine what Voltaire might have done with this material...String 
<br />
theory is immensely fun to think about because so many of its internal 
<br />
relationships are unexpectedly simple and beautiful.  It has no 
<br />
practical utility, however, other than to sustain the myth of the 
<br />
ultimate theory.&quot;
<br />
<br />Laughlin goes on to argue that string theory is a &quot;textbook case of a 
<br />
Deceitful Turkey, a beautiful set of ideas that will always remain just 
<br />
barely out of reach.&quot;  Essentially, he is arguing these pursuits into 
<br />
cosmology have taken us beyond our ability to reliably test theories, 
<br />
and therefore beyond the bounds of meaningful science.  He does not 
<br />
argue we should stop pursuing  science, but instead that we should focus 
<br />
on emerging laws instead of a reductionist attempt to create a TOE.  The 
<br />
main thing is he wants scientists to be more cognizant of these areas 
<br />
where they cross Barriers of Relevance, and can no longer reliably 
<br />
produce verifiable data. 
<br />
<br />Is Laughlin right that so many of these topics we discuss are beyond the 
<br />
reach of &quot;real&quot; science?  Should certain questions be put on hold until 
<br />
science/technology has caught up with our ability to test questions?
<br />
I don't know the answer, but it seems reasonable to ask the question as 
<br />
to whether science can take us only to a certain point, from which we 
<br />
must then apply logic, circumstantial evidence, etc.
<br />
<br />It occurred to me while reading Laughlin's book that in Cosmology 
<br />
reductionism can be roughly compared to a study of the past, while 
<br />
emergence can be roughly considered a study of the future, or at the 
<br />
least of the evolution of states into the more recent past.
<br />

<br />
<br />PS- another book I'm reading, Schrodinger's Rabbits by Colin Bruce, 
<br />
quotes Penrose as telling Bruce &quot;David [Deutsch] seem to disagree on 
<br />
every conceivable point.&quot;  That two individuals so imminent in the field 
<br />
could disagree so thororoughly on matters seems to make Laughlin's point.
