<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    DOes Mike Perry elaborate on how anyone can know for sure that &quot;they 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are not the same person from day to day&quot;. What does he define &quot;same&quot; to be?
</em><br />
<br />The point is that it is very difficult to pin down what is and is not &quot;the 
<br />
same person&quot;, especially in the unusual situations discussed on this list, 
<br />
such as duplication, teleportation, mind uploading etc., but also in 
<br />
everyday life. For example, human brains are constantly disintegrating and 
<br />
being repaired with externally supplied matter, such that you have a 
<br />
completely &quot;new&quot; brain every couple of months. Along with physical changes 
<br />
come mental changes; we think that we retain memories over time, but even 
<br />
without any brain pathology, our memories of past events probably change at 
<br />
least as much over time as our physical bodies do. We cope with these 
<br />
changes by saying that a person is &quot;the same&quot; if there is physical and 
<br />
mental continuity over time, but it is not difficult to come up with 
<br />
examples that thwart this criterion: for example, a person who has a head 
<br />
injury, is in a coma for years, then wakes up with complete amnesia re his 
<br />
past, along with a delusion that he is the Messiah, along with appropriate 
<br />
false memories of an alternative and internally consistent life. That isn't 
<br />
too far from what actually happens to thousands of people every day, and it 
<br />
is as nothing compared to the sorts of mind manipulations that technology 
<br />
could make possible in the future.
<br />
<br />A standard example in the philosophy of identity is the Ship of Theseus, 
<br />
which is kept in Athens as a museum piece (in legend, not in reality). Over 
<br />
time, bits of the ship rot and are replaced. After many years, it could be 
<br />
that only a small proportion of the ship is &quot;original&quot;. Should it still be 
<br />
called &quot;the Ship of Theseus&quot; if none of the matter in the ship was present 
<br />
when Theseus sailed in it? What about if only one plank of wood has been 
<br />
replaced? What if all the original material is all there, but the ship is 
<br />
destroyed in a storm and is rebuilt from memory in a different configuration 
<br />
to the original one?
<br />
<br />There is a way to avoid arguments and ambiguity when referring to the ship: 
<br />
aknowledge that the decision whether to apply the name &quot;Ship of Theseus&quot; is 
<br />
ultimately arbitrary when the entity in question is changing over time, and 
<br />
rather than trying to define, describe. That is, describe what it looks like 
<br />
and of what material it is comprised at a particular point in its history. 
<br />
Applying the same method to personal identity, we can avoid ambiguity by 
<br />
describing the mental properties of the person in question at a specific 
<br />
time: that is, the observer moments. We aknowledge that how the OM's are 
<br />
arranged to give the first person impression of an individual persisting 
<br />
through time, although it can be made clear and unequivocal in many cases, 
<br />
is shown by consideration of examples as above to be ultimately arbitrary.
<br />
<br />Now, what I meant in saying that we die every moment and are replaced by a 
<br />
copy is that each OM is transient, and the successor OM, although usually 
<br />
dependent on the same process as its predecessor (i.e. brain activity), is 
<br />
not necessarily so dependent, and could arise from anywhere else in the 
<br />
multiverse, or indeed never arise at all (which of course would mean real 
<br />
death - no more OM's ever). I dicuss this more in my post to the list about 
<br />
two weeks ago, &quot;death&quot;.
<br />
<br />The final point I wish to make is that if in fact someone came to your bed 
<br />
every night, killed you in your sleep, then put an exact copy in your place, 
<br />
there would be no way you could tell from introspection that anything 
<br />
unusual had happened.
