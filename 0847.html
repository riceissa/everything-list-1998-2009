</em><br />
<br />I disagree with this, although it is very well put.  It is true that 
<br />
the question &quot;why is something we have chosen to be very unusual, very 
<br />
unusual?&quot; is circular and useless.  But that's not the way I read the
<br />
&quot;flying rabbit&quot; problem.  Let me try to be precise about the way I
<br />
interpret the problem.  I'd very much like it if people could comment 
<br />
on this, since I don't feel that I'm very clear, yet, about the 
<br />
terminology used on this group, in particular, relative 
<br />
strong-Self-Sampling Assumption (SSSA)&quot; and &quot;Strong SSSA&quot; (did you
<br />
really mean &quot;strong strong self-sampling assumption, Bruno?).
<br />
<br />No matter what is meant by the term &quot;existence&quot;, one can say that 
<br />
there is some number, probably infinite, of conscious observer 
<br />
moments in existence.  The weak anthropic principle would suggest 
<br />
that we find ourselves in a set of those which are &quot;not very special&quot;. 
<br />
This is the SSA.  So the natural next step is to examine the 
<br />
properties of ourselves that we can identify, and try to determine if 
<br />
that principle holds.
<br />
<br />To define &quot;not very special&quot;, we need to establish some kind of 
<br />
measure over the set of possible universes, and thus, in theory, over 
<br />
the set of all existing observer-moments (I just made the assumption 
<br />
that possible == exists, which is a tenent of this group).  This 
<br />
brings us to the question which was posed in the very first post to 
<br />
this group, by Wei Dai:  how do we establish this measure?
<br />
<br />Now, one of the properties of our conscious existence which is 
<br />
identifiable is that causal relations seem to hold.  That is, we don't
<br />
see flying rabbits, because in flying is caused by flapping wings, and
<br />
rabbits don't have wings (to quote Monty Python, they don't so much 
<br />
fly, as plummet).  But modern physics tells us that causal relations 
<br />
only hold in a statistical sense.  That is, our science can only give
<br />
relative probabilities that things will happen.  This is true in the
<br />
quantum as well as in the classical domain, it's just that in the
<br />
classical domain, the probabilities become ridiculously large (or 
<br />
small) depending on the phenomenon that is studied.
<br />
<br />But why should causal relations *seem* to hold at all?  This was the
<br />
problem posed by Hume.  Why should there be any connectedness between
<br />
one moment of time and another, or between our memories and physical
<br />
reality?  It would seem plausible that among the set of all possible
<br />
(hence existing) conscious observer moments, there are a fair number
<br />
that just are, without having been caused by anything, and that are
<br />
in existence in nonsense universes.  Even in this universe, there 
<br />
is a non-vanishing probability that a rabbit will materialize out of 
<br />
the thin air, and fly (for however brief a moment) through the room.  
<br />
Why is it be that the probability of this is what it is, i.e. 
<br />
extremely low?  Granted we picked, on purpose, a scenario  which we 
<br />
know to be unlikely.  But the question is, why are the probabilities 
<br />
what they are?
<br />
<br />So the &quot;flying rabbit&quot; problem is just a restatement of the &quot;why are
<br />
there physical laws&quot; question, which has also been debated on this
<br />
list myriads of times.  I do agree with Jacques M. Mallah that this
<br />
group desperately needs a FAQ, especially to tie different approaches
<br />
to the same questions together.
