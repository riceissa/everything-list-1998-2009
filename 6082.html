Hi,
<br />
<br />For those who are interested in the comp hypothesis,
<br />
it is hardly a luxury to dig a little bit in computer science.
<br />
If only to go toward explicit definition of notion like computations,
<br />
computational history, consistent extensions, models, etc.
<br />
I open this thread for the very long term.
<br />
<br />One of the jewel of computer science is the theory of combinators.
<br />
<br />They have been discovered and presented in a talk by Moses
<br />
Schoenfinkel (from Moscow) in 1920. And rediscovered
<br />
independently by Haskell Curry (USA) in 1930. Church
<br />
rediscovered them too under the form of closed lambda expression,
<br />
for which he will postulate his famous &quot;Church thesis&quot;: the closed lambda
<br />
expression are enough to define all computable functions (from N to N, where
<br />
N = the set of positive integers).
<br />
<br />There is no &quot;Schoenfinkel thesis&quot; nor any &quot;Curry thesis&quot;, as
<br />
opposed to &quot;Church thesis&quot;. Indeed the goal of both Schoenfinkel
<br />
and Curry was to &quot;rebuild&quot; an alternative to the whole of mathematics.
<br />
One of Schoenfinkel's motivation was to eliminate all variables.
<br />
Curry's motivation was to find the most elementary finitary operations
<br />
rich enough to (re)build mathematics, and this preferably without  formal
<br />
sets, but only a finite set of primitive operations.
<br />
<br />Actually Combinatory Logic can &quot;easily&quot; be shown
<br />
rich enough to represent the partial recursive function, so that
<br />
the combinators gives a nice and pleasant computer programming
<br />
language. (And indeed LISP and functionnal programming languages
<br />
are all descendants or cousins of the combinators/lambda calculus).
<br />
But at some fundamental level combinatory logic is much more than
<br />
a programming language: it is really a possible road to tackle the problem
<br />
of the nature of mathematics, and with comp: the nature of reality.
<br />
Also, combinatory logic is very fine grained, and this will enable us to
<br />
introduce at a very cheap price important nuances.
<br />
<br /><br />Here is a short descrition of combinatory logic (beware: in the preceding post
<br />
I made a typo error):
<br />
<br />STATIC:
<br />
1) K is a molecule (called the &quot;kestrel&quot; is Smullyan's terminology)
<br />
2) S is a molecule (the &quot;Starling&quot;)
<br />
3) if x and y are molecules then (x y) is a molecule. From this you can 
<br />
easily enumerate all possible molecules: K, S, (K K), (K S), (S K), (S S), 
<br />
((K K) K), ((K S) K) ...
<br />
<br />DYNAMICS:  (X and Y are put for any molecules)
<br />
1) ((K X) Y) = X    (Law of the Kestrel)
<br />
2) (((S X) Y) Z)  = ((X Z) (Y Z))  (Law of the Starling)
<br />
<br />1) means that on any molecules X the molecules (K X) is stable and does not 
<br />
evolves (except by the evolution of X perhaps). I will say that a molecules 
<br />
of the shape (K X) is a charged Kestrel.
<br />
Now if (K X) comes to interact with some other molecules Y giving ((K X) Y) 
<br />
you get an explosion leaving as result of the reaction just the molecule X.
<br />
So for example
<br />
K is stable
<br />
(K K) is stable
<br />
(K (K K)) is stable
<br />
((K K) K) is unstable, indeed it matches the law &quot;1)&quot;, with X = K, and Y = 
<br />
K, so the reaction
<br />
is trigged giving K.
<br />
<br />((K (K K)) (K K)) gives (K K), ok?
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Well the price of having a conceptually very simple syntax (static) is that 
<br />
the notation can be very quickly a little bit cumbersome. The tradition is 
<br />
to neglect the left parenthesis abbreviating
<br />
(((a b) c) d) by abcd. The laws becomes:
<br />
<br />KXY = X
<br />
SXYZ = XZ(YZ)
<br />
<br />The examples becomes
<br />
<br />K is stable
<br />
KK is stable
<br />
K(KK) is stable
<br />
KKK is unstable and &quot;decays&quot; into K, and finally
<br />
<br />K(KK)(KK) gives (KK) ok?
<br />
<br />What gives S(KK)(KK) ? Solution: it remains S(KK)(KK). It is stable because
<br />
S needs &quot;three&quot; molecules to trigger its dynamic. So S(KK)(KK)(KK) gives 
<br />
KK(KK)(KK(KK)), as
<br />
SKKK gives KK(KK) which is still unstable and gives K.
<br />
<br />Exercices (Taken from the course &quot;My First Everything Theory&quot; Primary 
<br />
school Year 2127 :)
<br />
<br />Evaluate:
<br />
<br />(SS)KKK = ?
<br />
KKK(SS) = ?
<br />
(KK)(KK)(KK) = ?
<br />
(KKK)(KKK)(KKK) = ?
<br />
<br />Evaluate:
<br />
<br />K
<br />
KK
<br />
KKK
<br />
KKKK
<br />
KKKKK
<br />
KKKKKK
<br />
KKKKKKK
<br />
KKKKKKKK
<br />
KKKKKKKKK
<br />
KKKKKKKKKK
<br />
<br />A little more advanced exercices: is there a molecule, let us called it I, 
<br />
having
<br />
the following dynamic:   (X refers to any molecule).
<br />
<br />IX = X
<br />
<br />So a solution is some molecule made up from K and S which applied on any
<br />
molecule give as result of the reaction that very molecule unchanged.
<br />
<br />For example KXS is not a solution, although it gives X, it is not of the 
<br />
shape (molecule  X).
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Of course you can learn a lot by searching &quot;combinators&quot; or &quot;lambda calcul&quot;
<br />
on the net. Two samples:
<br />
For those &quot;who knows&quot;, here is a paper on
<br />
Kolmogorov Complexity viewed through the
<br />
combinators. It can be used as a quick introduction to combinators.
<br />
<br />Kolmogorov Complexity in Combinatory Logic
<br />
John Tromp
<br />
<a href="http://homepages.cwi.nl/~tromp/cl/CL.pdf">http://homepages.cwi.nl/~tromp/cl/CL.pdf</a>
<br />
<br />And here is a much more technical paper on some advanced stuff translating
<br />
an amazing idea of Girard, the geometry of interaction (GOI) in terms
<br />
of combinator.
<br />
<a href="http://www.mathnet.or.kr/papers/Pennsy/Haghverdi/main7.pdf">http://www.mathnet.or.kr/papers/Pennsy/Haghverdi/main7.pdf</a>
<br />
(Need Category Theory).
<br />
<br />Soon I will give the solution of the exercices. I will give you &quot;my second 
<br />
everything
<br />
theory (Year 2127)&quot;. Then a third ... I let you meditate on the following 
<br />
&quot;philosophical&quot;
<br />
question &quot;does Kestrel really exist?&quot;, doesn't Classical General Relativity 
<br />
entails the
<br />
existence of Kestrels? Does not a &quot;physical&quot; time arrow need kestrels?
<br />
Look closely: KXY = X, kestrels eliminate information, Y has been erased).
<br />
<br />To doubt on the physical existence of kestrels leads to quasi-physicalist 
<br />
view of logic
<br />
(not unlike the one by *the other Schmidhuber*Strings from Logic:
<br />
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0011065">http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0011065</a>   I tend to think for
<br />
now that Newton's lesson can (admittedly roughly) be sum up by saying there 
<br />
are no
<br />
Kestrels. And perhaps the no-cloning theorem gives us empirical reason to doubt
<br />
about the Starling too, because they clone (duplicate)
<br />
one of their argument (Einstein Podolski Rosen Bell ... Diecks Zurek 
<br />
Wootters lesson).
<br />
<br />In fine combinators provide tools for building models of weak logics. 
<br />
Strictly speaking
<br />
abandoning the kestrel is abandoning the a priori axiom: p-&gt;(q-&gt;p). This is 
<br />
a step toward
<br />
quantum or toward relevance logics. But I guess I anticipate too much.
<br />
<br />I am not hiding you that one of my motivation is to make my thesis easier. 
<br />
Until now
<br />
I have attempt to describe the SHORT path (the interview of the lobian 
<br />
machine). Now I
<br />
will give you the LONG path, including a precise sequences of formal theories.
<br />
The result is that Lobian machine should prove that if Kestrels and 
<br />
Starling exist then
<br />
they cannot be *observed* by Lobian machine. Feel free to make comments or
<br />
metacomments. I see this thread as an aside thread which I hope will not 
<br />
perturbate
<br />
more general discussions, only that with comp some computer science could 
<br />
be helpful.
