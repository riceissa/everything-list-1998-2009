I like this a lot. The idea of selecting non-suicidal versions of you is
<br />
fun. A worthwhile avenue to get me over the depression of being unable to
<br />
understand consciousness.
<br />
<br />More comments when I've read it again.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; From:	Christopher Maloney [SMTP:dude.domain.name.hidden]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sent:	Saturday, June 19, 1999 1:55 AM
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To:	everything-list
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Subject:	Confessions of a quantum suicidal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'd be surprised if an idea similar to quantum suicide hadn't occured
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to most of the members of this list before you read Tegmark's paper.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I first started thinking about it about ten years ago, I think.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Being prone to depression most of my life, it seemed like an obvious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; plan: a way to force God's hand, in a way.  Who says my arms are too
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; short to box with God?  Quantum suicide offers a way to choose which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; environments are acceptable to us.  We can truly become masters of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our destiny.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm an electical engineer, so I have (had) the means to carry out the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiment.  As I mentioned, I was prone to depression.  I can't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; remember if a specific incident triggered the desire to carry out the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; plan, or if the desire just built in me over time.  It seems like an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; awfully long time ago, now. Things weren't going my way.  At least,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not the way I thought I wanted them to go.  So I made the decision to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; go through with it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The whole time, I knew that only one thing would be certain: that I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would survive.  But I didn't know by which avenue I would escape.  So
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the whole time I was planning and designing and plotting, I tried to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; figure out which would be the most likely.  The answer is obvious:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the most likely scenario for my survival would be that would change
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my mind, and not go through with it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I was unhappy, and a part of me desperately wanted to go through
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with it, so I tried to make a firm resolve, whenever I could, that I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would complete the plan, and step through the device.  This of course
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; had an undesired affect: I was selecting out those versions of me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that had a weak resolve. For, as you've probably guessed by now, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; avenue that my survival did take was that I changed my mind.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; On the other hand, my life has gotten dramatically better.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Coincidence?  I'm not sure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let me explain &quot;the project&quot;.  Again, the only thing I knew for sure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was that I would survive.  Well, I wanted to get something in those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; worlds in which I did survive, and I figured out a way that I could.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I could set it up so that I would be killed if and only if I didn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; win the lottery on a particular day.  It was a sort of Russian
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; roulette with one player.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Doing a rough estimate, I figured that I could find a game that would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; offer a reasonable jackpot and that would have odds of winning at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about a million to one.  I could, of course, buy extra tickets to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reduce the odds. I wanted to minimize the chances of surviving and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *not* winning the lottery, so that meant that I had to design an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; extremely reliable killing device.  I shot for there to be odds of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; device failure on the order of a billion to one - so that if I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; survived, chances would be roughly one in a thousand that I *didn't*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; win the lottery.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To recap:  from the bird perspective, for every billion copies of me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that went through the experiment, one thousand would have a winning
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lottery ticket.  So the device would &quot;attempt&quot; to kill 999,999,000
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; copies.  But it would fail about once  with this number of kills, So
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that one of those copies, that didn't win the lottery, would survive.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; How to design a device with that kind of reliability? Satellite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; engineers know the answer to that one: redundancy. If you have a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; single device that will fail about once in a thousand operations,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then three such devices, operating in parallel, will fail only about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; once every billion.  That assumes that *everything* in the system is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in parallel, which is impossible.  There will be &quot;weak spots&quot; in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; design - single points of failure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I also figured that I could make the device more reliable by the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; following technique: if anything went wrong, the default behavior of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any of the mechanisms should be &quot;kill&quot;, instead of switching off.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Remember, I wanted to minimize the chances that I survive and don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; win the lottery.  If there's a small chance of something in an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; individual mechanism malfunctioning, then that won't affect the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; overall odds much, as long as the default behavior is to kill.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There are two basic failure modes of the system: A, the device kills
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; when I do win the lottery; and B, it doesn't kill when I don't win
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the lottery.  I figured that I wanted to reduce the likelihood of B
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as much as possible, and that I didn't care that much about A, as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; long as it was reasonably low (say one in a hundred).  Again, from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the bird perspective of the ensemble of one billion copies of me:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    Out of 1,000,000,000:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;        1,000 win the lottery, of which:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;            10 get killed anyway, 990 survive.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;        999,999,000 don't win the lottery, of which:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;            999,998,999 get killed, 1 survives.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So a total of 991 &quot;me&quot;s survive, of which 990 have won the lottery.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Good odds, I think.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Another failure scenario is that I only get maimed instead of killed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; when the device goes off.  This is a grisly outcome, so I wanted to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; design the likelihood of this to be as small as possible.  I decided
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to use high-caliber pistols aimed at the base of my brain.  I needed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to ensure that when the time came, my head was restrained so that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there was no chance of the bullet missing the critical target.  I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; didn't finish this portion of the investigation, but I'm pretty sure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that there's an optimal aim at close range which would ensure a very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; low probability of a bullet doing damage, but not killing me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So I designed a system with three independent electronic kill
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; devices.  Each device consisted of a timer which, when it counted
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; down to zero, would discharge a capacitor through a solenoid, which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would pull the trigger of a .45 caliber pistol, which would shoot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; through my head.  The counter would only be stopped by a signal from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a computer, indicating that I had won the lottery.  That signal would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; come from one of three trusty helpers that I had hired (who had no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; idea of what they were really doing, of course), to type in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; winning lottery number and send it to my computer by modem.  My
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computers already knew the numbers of the tickets that I had bought,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so it could check to see if any of them matched.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Nearly everything would be redundant - the timers, the guns, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computers, and the helpers.  I had to shoot for (excuse the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; expression) a one in a thousand failure rate or less for any one of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; those individual systems.  Difficult, but possible.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Leading up to the day of the actual lottery, I would do several trial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; runs to verify the reliability.  The weakest link is probably the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; people who are hired to type in the lottery number.  So I would hire
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them to do that for several days in a row, and on the days leading up
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the target date, I would verify that they were performing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correctly.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Also, prior to the target date, I would allow a long window of time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for each of the electronic mechanisms to charge up from the wall
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sockets.  After they are charged, they can be disconnected and will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; operate independently, thus eliminating a power outage as a source of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; failure.  Then I would set the timers, verify that each is working,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and secure myself into the chair.  The probability would be high that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something would go wrong at this point.  These preparatory steps are,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in effect, a single point of failure.  Nothing can be done to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; eliminate this completely, though.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The chair would have a simple electronic locking mechanism that would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; secure my head and arms.  When the counters got to zero, each gun
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would either go off or not.  It's designed in such a way that if any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one of the three guns goes off, I would almost certainly be killed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instantly.  If none of the three guns goes off, then the electronic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lock would be released, and, hopefully, I'd be somewhat richer.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; When you're talking about odds like one in a million, it's ridiculous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to think that the avenue of my survival would be to actually go
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; through with this plan.  I knew that it was much more likely that I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would change my mind.  Another possibility also occured to me: that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; someone would find out and would stop me.  I thought that most people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would think that this plan of mine was insane, and would probably
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have me commited as a hazard to myself, if they knew how serious I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was.  So I took precautions to prevent anyone from finding out.  I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; kept it a secret.  This is actually the first time I've told anyone
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about the details of my plan.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I called it &quot;the project&quot;, so that no one would see something written
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by me that would give away what it was really about. Later, I changed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the name to &quot;the Lathe&quot;, after an Ursula K. LeGuin story called &quot;The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Lathe of Heaven&quot;.  It seems to me that this device is a little bit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like that story - where we can choose what worlds we will live in.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course, we can't ever actually change the past, but we can select
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our future.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I never went through with it, obviously.  My life just inexplicably
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; got better, and I ceased being depressed.  As I mentioned above, I'm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not sure this was a coincidence.  Perhaps I did select my future,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just by planning and having that firm resolve to go through with it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps I can continue to select my future, by &quot;threatening God&quot; that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'll go through with it unless I get my way.  But now I doubt it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now I actually care too much about somebody else -- my wife.  I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; couldn't kill myself now, knowing how much it would hurt her.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So now I take my lumps as they come.  That sounds like maturity, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; when I write about the Lathe, it sure does sound pretty immature.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But lots of people kill themselves.  I'm certainly not in a position
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to judge any of them.  We're all just shooting arrows in the dark,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; after all.  I just thought I could deflect my arrow by purpose.
