<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I am generally of the school that considers that calculations can be

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; treated as abstract or formal objects, that they can exist without a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; physical computer existing to run them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I completely agree with that... but I have problem with the word 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;instantiating&quot; in front of an abstract calculation, because if the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; calculation is abtract that means the calculation just is, no need of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instantiation.
</em><br />
<br />I agree, and if I used that terminology then it was probably a
<br />
mistake.  Looking back at the message you replied to, I did not talk of
<br />
instantiating an abstract calculation.  I did mention the question of
<br />
whether a given calculation instantiated a given OM.  Maybe &quot;instantiate&quot;
<br />
is not the right word there.  I meant to consider the question of whether
<br />
the first calculation added to the measure of the information structure
<br />
corresponding to the OM.  If you can find any other place where I used
<br />
the word confusingly, let me know.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; On the other hand I have still problem with abstract 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; calculation... take for example a mathematic demonstration written on a sheet 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of paper, it doesn't mean anything if there is no observer to read it and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand it (thereby &quot;instantiating&quot; the calculus in his own mind), what do 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you think of that ?
</em><br />
<br />I can interpret your question in two ways.  One is, does a mathematical
<br />
proof written on paper has an intrinsic meaning, or is the meaning
<br />
in the mind of the reader?  And the other is, do mathematical proofs
<br />
have abstract, logical/mathematical existence, in the same way that,
<br />
say, numbers or geometric figures might be said to abstractly exist?
<br />
<br />As far as the first question, I would analyze it by asking whether someone
<br />
who did not know the language it was written in, not even recognizing
<br />
the symbols, would be able to deduce what the proof was.  I believe the
<br />
answer is yes, for reasonably long proofs.  There would be no ambiguity.
<br />
<br />As a concrete way to understand this, suppose we want to ask the question,
<br />
does this string of symbols represent proof X, where X is some valid
<br />
mathematical proof.  We could write a translation program which, given the
<br />
symbols, would output proof X.  If the string of symbols is reasonably
<br />
long and actually does match proof X, the translation program will be
<br />
short, much shorter than the proof itself.  However if the string of
<br />
symbols is not a proof of X, then the translation program will have to
<br />
be long.  By the same type of argument I have used repeatedly, this gives
<br />
us a tool for evaluating whether a string has a given &quot;meaning&quot;.  If the
<br />
translation program is short, then the meaning is in the string.  If the
<br />
translation program is long, then the meaning is in the translation.
<br />
I believe that this shows that it is in fact reasonably to suppose that a
<br />
complex proof written on paper does in fact have intrinsic meaning and it
<br />
is not just a matter of how it is interpreted in the mind of the reader.
<br />
<br />In terms of the other question, whether proofs have abstract mathematical
<br />
existence just as (we suppose) integers and triangles do, again I think
<br />
that the answer is yes.  Proofs are merely more complex.  They have
<br />
relationships amongs their parts.  They depend on an axiom system.
<br />
The implicit &quot;causality&quot; and &quot;time ordering&quot; among steps of the proof
<br />
could be represented graphically, by colored arrows leading from one
<br />
step to another.  I could imagine a representation where valid proof
<br />
steps would be as apparent and obvious as the question of whether a set
<br />
of lines in a geometric figure all meet at a common point.
<br />
<br />In short, I do think that proofs, and for that matter computations,
<br />
can be sensibly thought of as having abstract existence just like other
<br />
complex mathematical objects.  Some of the constructions of set theory
<br />
are far more complex than any humanly understandable proof, yet it is
<br />
reasonable to say that sets exist in the abstract.  The fact that a
<br />
proof has many parts and has complex relationships between the parts is
<br />
no obstacle to its having abstract mathematical existence.
