</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but they can manage without me. It is a one-way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; kind of connection.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We are touching on the unidirectionality of time, here. Specifically the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2nd law of thermodynamics. Myriad infinitesimal entropy transactions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; resulting in overall increases in disorder but localised increases in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; order (&amp; complexity , russel's playground) where net energy inflow exists
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - such as where we are in the beam of the floodlight called sol.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you mean the current state is the sum of the transactions of the entire
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; history of the transactions comprising you... then yes, your present state
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is connected to all this causal history. The thing is that you literally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; _are_ it.
</em><br />
<br />No, I'm literally *not* it. I am *not*, literally , the state of
<br />
the universe at the Big Bang. Even though it caused me,
<br />
in a sense. Causes are not the same entities as their effects, in
<br />
general.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You are not like some bulldozed pile of independent stuff. So
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the idea that you and the causality that got you to your current state are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; separate is meaningless. You literally are causality - intrinsically made
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of change, but change that results in persistent structure that is you.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So. yes. The model I am working with is untrinsically unidirectional, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suppose - one way in a flow sense and one way in a causal sense that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; present (current state) did not 'cause' the past (previous states), nor
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can the future cause the present state.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The easiest way to imagine it is to think of it as computation. Go through
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the sequence of operations 2+5=7. The 'present' is the state of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computation as is progresses (load, 2, load 5 add, display result, for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; example). The 7 did not cause a 2 and 5 to be added. Similarly 7's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; participation in a future computation cannot be said to have caused the 7.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I know we can _imagine_ realms where bidirectional causality may be so.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; These are best represented in our formal mathemtical depictions of our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world that have t in them, t for time). What I am saying is that the realm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we are in is not like them. This is the one _we_ inhabit, with particular
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instances of particular kinds of things going on. Or perhaps a little more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generally - the one we inhabit is currently in a state where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unidirectional causality (albeit intrinsically randomised in selecttion of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particular outcomes) rules. A really good book on this is 'The end of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certainty' by Prigogine.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; COL
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; identical to other sorts of neuron cohorts nearby. One set delivers

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; LZ
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; How do you know ?

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; COL
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Human verbal reports in a very detailed experimental regime. This was done
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by imaging humans and controlling for various physiological circumstances
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to eliminate the cohorts involved in things like (in the case of thirst)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the 'mouth-dryness' factor and micturition state. When you control
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everything you end up being able to isolate one specific, unique region
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that is correlated only with the experienced emotion of 'thirst'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (reasulting in an 'imperious desire' for drinking behaviour). The imaging
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; results are in the book.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The interesting thing in the case of these low level emotions is that they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are all separate cohorts (thirst, hunger, sex drive etc). It's not one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cohort that changes in subjective quality. There must be an evolutionary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reason for this... maybe in DNA or maybe the emotions compete for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behavioural dominance (micturition thwarting, for example, may stop you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being afraid of something or vice versa)
</em><br />
<br />So science *is* investigating phenomenal consciousness, not ignroaing
<br />
it?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; So there are 2 parts to an explanation:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; a) single neuron properties
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; b) cohort organisation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Unless thesre is a property of single neurons to use for a cohort to do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something with, you are attributing 'magical emergence' to a cohort. This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; is a logical inevitability.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; LZ
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; y-e-e-s. But where are you without emergence? Qualia would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; then be properties of quarks. Wihich brings on a Grain problem with a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; vengeance.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; COL
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There are no gaines to have a problem with. See below.
</em><br />
<br />?????
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; COL
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Magical emergence means attributing some sort of property inherent in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; organisation itself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; LZ
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The point of emergence is rather that the property is *not* inherent in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the lower-level parts and relations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; COL
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, but these properties cannot exist without colligative actions of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; _something_. Like I said:
</em><br />
<br /><br />And pheomenal properties at the neuronal level must emerge from
<br />
colligative actions of molecules.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; LAKE is to H20
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; REDness is to 'what?'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is, what elemental property is dragged along with matter (atoms,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; molecules) that can result in it being 'like something' to be those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; atoms/molecules? Yes, you can say they are behaving in a specific way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ...like neural cells doing the &quot;qualia dance&quot;.... but you are still stuck
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with not knowing the 'what?' shown above. This is only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correlation/description , not causation/explanation. The real question is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to ask yourself what are the innate circumstances in the universe that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would mean doing the neural qualia dance be 'like something'? This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fundamentally questions your view of the universe.
</em><br />
<br />That is the question. You seem to be rejecting one answer --
<br />
&quot;magical&quot; emergence -- without supplying another.
<br />
<br />If qualia don't emerge, they are either non-existent , or they
<br />
are properties of fundamental particles -- which is
<br />
where your Grain Problem comes in.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; That view is, in my model, that qualia are not about what is you, but what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'is not' you. In a spatial sense. You are manipulating the space you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inhabit. Space is stuff. It has a permeability and permittivity for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; example. To an accuracy of several orders of magnitude more then 1 part in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 10^20 you - all of us are space - in essence, we are kind of not there.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Space is the dominant feature of being a human. Our relationship with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; space is, in my model, easily seen - our structural components (entropy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; transactions) derive from a common parent structure. In other words the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; organisational structure of the space and the matter within it come
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; literally from one set of common parent structures down deep.
</em><br />
<br />Space doensn't have any inherent structure. It is *trivially*
<br />
true that the structure of &quot;spaces&quot; -- different sized gaps --
<br />
is imposed bymatter. There is a spherical space inside
<br />
a ping-pong ball because ping-pong balls are hollow spheres.
<br />
<br />But that doesn't help **at all** with the grain problem. The
<br />
tiny interatomic and intermolecular spaces are still far too
<br />
fine-grained
<br />
for qualia.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; They are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; identical at this level. Hence when any matter does anything, the space it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in habits cooperates in a very intimate way. There is no 'granularity'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; issue.
</em><br />
<br />Yes there is. Our phenomenal experiene is not detailed
<br />
at the neruonal level, and even less so at the atomic level.
<br />
<br />As explained, interatomic spaces obviously have the same detail as the
<br />
atomic
<br />
level.
<br />
<br />You might want to claim that only spaces at the neuronal
<br />
or higher level count, but that looks like emergence.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is no need to have an 'ultimate building block'.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; When you stare at a human - or any 'stuff' at all, you are not staring at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; organs or cells or molecules or atoms ot protons or electrons or photons
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; .... what you are looking at is an organised collection of X with a really
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; good qualia paint job.
</em><br />
<br />So ? If the qualia paint job exists only a a relatively
<br />
high level of organisation, that is emergence.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; An analogy: stare at a building made purely of bricks. You can say - and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be right - that you are staring at a building. But you are not. You are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; staring at organised bricks...ie only bricks. Extend that to humans - and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ask what is the brick? What it is  _not_ is any of the 'things' we isolate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with appearances - like atoms, cells, etc (these are 'buildings' in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; analogy). The statement &quot;X has an appearance&quot; is meaningless - appearance
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is something we add to large accretions of it.
</em><br />
<br />If you really think thre is no primary matter, that is one
<br />
less reason to reject emergence.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; My solution to this 'what?' = X (=brick) question is to say that whatever
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; X is, space and all matter are made of it. A common parent in a very deep
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; organisational hierarchy which we have only just begun to unpack. The only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; property you need to assign to X is the property of change. i.e. that X
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; goes cyclically through a series of states (lossless, in an entropy/energy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense). When you do that you can observe a relationship between one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; organisation (space) and another (matter) and qualia are easily seen to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; result from the cellular qualia dance.
</em><br />
<br />I can't make any sense of that. You seem to be saying that
<br />
both matter and space are phenomenal illusions while
<br />
simultaneously saying that qualia emerge from a particular
<br />
form of matter, &quot;cells&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Another way of looking at the model is to imagine a waterfall. Imagine,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lost in the struture of change that is a waterfall (H20 passing through a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; region of space), in one particular place in the waterfall, the shape of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; human outlined in the flow. This is, at the most fundamental level, a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; metaphor for the reality of a universe in which qualia make sense.
</em><br />
<br />I don't see how that metaphor connects with qualia.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  It also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; predicts what looks like what we describe with maths - gravity and quantum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mechanics and other stuff, but that's a different issue (Cahill can do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that)... I'm only interested in qualia and the AI I can make with it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is kind of interesting - you are forcing me to voice things in ways I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would not have otherwise. :-)
