Hi Kim, hi John, hi People,
<br />
<br />Kim provided me with an excellent answer to my preceding post (out-of- 
<br />
line though). And John told me he was impatient to see &quot;my definition&quot;  
<br />
of the natural numbers (and some other numbers) in term of sets. So I  
<br />
make a try. Nothing is important here for the sequel, but it can help  
<br />
too.
<br />
<br />This is in line with our future goal to figure out what a computation  
<br />
is, and what is the difference between a computation and a description  
<br />
of a computation. This plays a probably subtle role in the seventh  
<br />
step of UDA, and also in the eight step. So just another example of a  
<br />
well standard set theoretic representation of the natural numbers (and  
<br />
the transfinite ordinals which extends them) can be useful, if only as  
<br />
a reservoir of examples of structures later.
<br />
<br />John has perhaps believed I was trying to define the numbers, (by  
<br />
which I always mean &quot;natural numbers&quot;, that is 0, 1, 2, 3, ...), but I  
<br />
don't try to do that. I try just to help people with different view of  
<br />
those numbers with an emphasis on what they are, as opposed to how to  
<br />
represent them.
<br />
<br />I have already mentioned the notation I, II, III, IIII, ...
<br />
<br />We could capture this number's representation by axioms (and implicit  
<br />
rule), like
<br />
<br />Axiom 1: I is a number
<br />
Axiom 2: if x is a number, then xI is a number.
<br />
<br />So I is a number (by axiom 1), so II is a number (by axiom 2), so III  
<br />
is a number (by axiom 3), so IIII is a number (by axiom 3).
<br />
<br />Is IIIIIIIIIIII.... a number? To avoid it we should need a rule saying  
<br />
that we can apply axiom 2 only a finite number of time. But &quot;finite  
<br />
number&quot; is what we were trying to define, so, well, we can't define  
<br />
them, and I will rely on your intuition.
<br />
<br />* * *
<br />
<br />So, let me give you a nice representation of the natural numbers in  
<br />
terms of sets. This material will not been used in the sequel, so take  
<br />
it easy. it is a glimpse of &quot;beyond infinity&quot;. This is due mainly to  
<br />
to von Neumann. He showed that we can generate &quot;the universe of  
<br />
numbers&quot; (actually of ordinals) from &quot;nothing&quot;, or from an empty  
<br />
universe, by using two powerful principles: the principle of set  
<br />
comprehension, and the principle of set reflexion. I have tested  
<br />
successfully this idea with young people.
<br />
<br />The generation of the universe of numbers proceed in stages, beginning  
<br />
with an empty universe. At each state we try 1) to comprehend the  
<br />
whole universe, and 2) (it is the rule of the game) to put what we  
<br />
have comprehend in the universe. 1) and 2) are the comprehension rule  
<br />
and the reflexion rule.
<br />
<br />Well, we still need a notation to describe the result of the  
<br />
comprehension. On a board a use circles or ellipses, but here I will  
<br />
use the more standard accolades. For example I comprehend John and  
<br />
Kim, means I conceive the set {John, Kim}.
<br />
<br />Let us go: (please do it yourself alongside, with {} a circle, { { } }  
<br />
a circle with a little circle inside, it is easier to read, more cute,  
<br />
and you will see the growing fractal:
<br />
<br /><br />Day 0: I wake up and I observe the universe. But the universe is  
<br />
empty. Nothing. My comprehension of the universe at this stage is  
<br />
represented by the empty set { }. It is my model of the universe at  
<br />
that stage. And, well I will define or represent the number 0 by { }.  
<br />
It is my conception of the universe at the middle of the day 0. We  
<br />
have 0 = { }
<br />
But then I have to obey to the reflection rule, and I have to put { }  
<br />
in the universe, and then I go to bed.
<br />
<br />Day 1: I wake up and I observe the universe. But the universe contains  
<br />
{ }. It contains 0. My comprehension of the universe at this stage is  
<br />
represented by the set containing the empty set {{ }}. And, well I  
<br />
will define or represent the number 1 by {{ }}.  It is my  
<br />
comprehension of the universe at the middle of the day 1. We have 1 =  
<br />
{{ }}
<br />
But then I have to obey to the reflection rule, and I have to put  
<br />
{{ }} in the universe, and then I go to bed.
<br />
<br />Day 2: I wake up and I observe the universe. But the universe contains  
<br />
{ } and {{ }}. It contains 0, and 1. My comprehension of the universe  
<br />
at this stage is represented by the set containing {{ }, {{ }}}. And,  
<br />
well I will define or represent the number 2 by {{ }, {{ }}}.  It is  
<br />
my comprehension of the universe at the middle of the day 2. We have 2  
<br />
= {0, 1}
<br />
But then I have to obey to the reflection rule, and I have to put {{ }  
<br />
{{ }}} in the universe, and then I go to bed.
<br />
<br />Day 3: I wake up and I observe the universe. But the universe contains  
<br />
{ } and {{ }} and {{ } {{ }}}. It contains 0, and 1, and 2. My  
<br />
comprehension of the universe at this stage is represented by the set  
<br />
{{ },  {{ }},  {{ } {{ }}}}. And, well I will define or represent the  
<br />
number 3 by {{ },  {{ }},  {{ } {{ }}}.  It is my comprehension of the  
<br />
universe at the middle of the day 3. We have 3 = {0, 1, 2}
<br />
But then I have to obey to the reflection rule, and I have to put  
<br />
{{ },  {{ }},  {{ } {{ }}}} in the universe, and then I go to bed.
<br />
<br />Day 4: I wake up and I observe the universe. But the universe contains  
<br />
{ } and {{ }} and {{ }, {{ }}} and {{ } , {{ }},  {{ }, {{ }}}}. It  
<br />
contains 0, and 1, and 2, and 3. My comprehension of the universe at  
<br />
this stage is represented by the set {{ },  {{ }},  {{ }, {{ }}},  
<br />
{{ } , {{ }},  {{ }, {{ }}}}}. And, well I will define or represent  
<br />
the number 4 by {{ },  {{ }},  {{ }, {{ }}}, {{ },  {{ }},  {{ },  
<br />
{{ }}}}}.  It is my comprehension of the universe at the middle of the  
<br />
day 4. We have 4 = {0, 1, 2, 3}
<br />
But then I have to obey to the reflection rule, and I have to put  
<br />
{{ },  {{ }},  {{ }, {{ }}}, {{ },  {{ }},  {{ }, {{ }}}}} in the  
<br />
universe, and then I go to bed.
<br />
<br />Well, at this stage, or a bit later, some people tell me already &quot;OK,  
<br />
we have understood, we got the idea&quot;. But &quot;to understand&quot; is the  
<br />
english for the latin &quot;comprehendere&quot; (comprendre, in french). It  
<br />
seems that now, your conception of the universe is
<br />
<br />{   { },    {{ }},    {{ }, {{ }}},      {{ },  {{ }},  {{ },  
<br />
{{ }}}}     ... }
<br />
<br />This is day omega. Omega is the first infinite number. It is an Other  
<br />
number (note). not a natural number. It is the unavoidable infinite  
<br />
number IIIIIII.....   omega = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}. It is the well known  
<br />
set of all natural numbers.
<br />
OK, but if I &quot;comprehend it&quot; I have to put it in the universe by the  
<br />
reflexion rule. So at the middle of the day omega+1, my conception of  
<br />
the universe:
<br />
<br />{   { },    {{ }},    {{ }, {{ }}},      {{ },  {{ }},  {{ },  
<br />
{{ }}}}     ...  {   { },    {{ }},    {{ }, {{ }}},      {{ },   
<br />
{{ }},  {{ }, {{ }}}}     ... }}
<br />
<br />omega+1 is {0, 1, 2, 3, ... omega}
<br />
<br />Ok, but if I comprehend it, I have to put it in the universe, so I get
<br />
<br />{   { },    {{ }},    {{ }, {{ }}},      {{ },  {{ }},  {{ },  
<br />
{{ }}}}     ...  {   { },    {{ }},    {{ }, {{ }}},      {{ },   
<br />
{{ }},  {{ }, {{ }}}}     ... } {   { },    {{ }},    {{ },  
<br />
{{ }}},      {{ },  {{ }},  {{ }, {{ }}}}     ...  {   { },     
<br />
{{ }},    {{ }, {{ }}},      {{ },  {{ }},  {{ }, {{ }}}}     ... }}}
<br />
<br />omega+2
<br />
<br />get it? after some infinite time again the universe looks like
<br />
<br />{0, 1, 2, ... omega, omega+1, omega+2, omega+3, omega+4, omega+5, ...}
<br />
<br />This is omega+omega,
<br />
and thus this continues
<br />
<br />omega+omega+1, omega+omega+2, omega+omega+3, omega+omega+4, omega+omega 
<br />
+5, ...
<br />
<br />Which leads to omega+omega+omega
<br />
omega+omega+omega+1
<br />
omega+omega+omega+2
<br />
omega+omega+omega+3
<br />
...
<br />
which leads to
<br />
omega+omega+omega+omega
<br />
omega+omega+omega+omega+1
<br />
omega+omega+omega+omega+2
<br />
omega+omega+omega+omega+3
<br />
...
<br />
which leads to
<br />
omega+omega+omega+omega+omega
<br />
omega+omega+omega+omega+omega+1
<br />
...
<br />
which leads to
<br />
omega+omega+omega+omega+omega
<br />
...
<br />
omega+omega+omega+omega+omega+omega
<br />
...
<br />
omega+omega+omega+omega+omega+omega+omega
<br />
...
<br />
omega+omega+omega+omega+omega+omega+omega+omega
<br />
...
<br />
omega+omega+omega+omega+omega+omega+omega+omega+omega
<br />
...
<br />
omega+omega+omega+omega+omega+omega+omega+omega+omega+omega
<br />
...
<br />
...
<br />
which leads to
<br />
<br />omega*omega
<br />
omega*omega+1
<br />
omega*omega+2
<br />
...
<br />
omega*omega+omega
<br />
<br />and you can guess (making giant steps):
<br />
<br />omega*omega*omega
<br />
... ...
<br />
omega*omega*omega*omega
<br />
... ...
<br />
omega*omega*omega*omega*omega
<br />
... ...
<br />
omega*omega*omega*omega*omega*omega
<br />
... ...
<br />
omega*omega*omega*omega*omega*omega*omega
<br />
... ...
<br />
omega^omega
<br />
<br />and speeding
<br />
omega^omega^omega
<br />
...
<br />
omega^omega^omega^omega
<br />
<br />leading to
<br />
omega^omega^omega^omega^...
<br />
<br />which is named epsilon zero. It is a star in logic, by playing some  
<br />
role in proof theory. Epsilon zero is still a very little ordinals, as  
<br />
such &quot;other&quot; infinite, transfinite number are called.
<br />
<br />We will need only omega. Computability theory need even much higher  
<br />
ordinal than epsilon zero, but don't worry now about that. But natural  
<br />
numbers are like that, they behave so weirdly that you have to  
<br />
introduce many kind of &quot;other numbers&quot; to help to figure out what  
<br />
they, the natural numbers, are capable of.
<br />
<br />It is good to met the ordinals at least once.
<br />
Do you think is is possible to comprehend *all* ordinal numbers? To  
<br />
get a picture of the whole universe of number and ordinals? (subject  
<br />
of reflexion).
<br />
<br />Thanks for your work Kim and Russell,
<br />
<br />Best regards to John and the others for they kindness,
<br />
<br />Bruno
<br />
<br />PS I will take the opportunity of JOUAL, and our conversations, to try  
<br />
sum up UDA (and AUDA?) in a short paper, and I have already accepted  
<br />
to participate to a mini-colloquium (by psychologists which are kind  
<br />
with me) this month in Brussels, so I have to write two papers, and  
<br />
this to say that I am a bit busy this month, so:  it is hollyday Kim!   
<br />
No more math until april! Take all your time for swallowing those  
<br />
ordinals, and don't be afraid to ask question (perhaps online so other  
<br />
can learn something too). Next lesson, in April: I say a bit more on  
<br />
those other numbers.
