</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;to correctly bet on p&quot;, which never really made sense to me. What's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the French word you would use for this - I may know it, or perhaps I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can figure the relevant English term from a dictionary.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Let me first explain in few words a plausible logician conception of a 
<br />
&quot;multiverse&quot;. I borrow the term &quot;multiverse&quot; from FOR, but I think we 
<br />
should be neutral about what is really a universe, or a world, or a 
<br />
state, or an observer-moment: the only thing which matter is that we 
<br />
have many of them, and that they are related by a relation of 
<br />
accessibility. So a multiverse is just a set W (of elements called 
<br />
&quot;worlds&quot;) and a binary relation R defined on it.  Let us use the letter 
<br />
a, b, c, d, ... for the worlds. So aRb just means that the world b is 
<br />
accessible from the world a. You can travel from a to b.
<br />
Note that I am not pretending that the &quot;real multiverse&quot; (perhaps the 
<br />
quantum one) is of that type, but it is good to begin with that 
<br />
familiar sort of Kripke multiverse, and then to correct it.
<br />
<br />Now we assume that all the worlds obey classical logic:  if p is true 
<br />
in world a, and if q is true in world a, then propositional formula 
<br />
like (p &amp; q), (p -&gt; q) etc. are true at a, and ~p is false at a, etc. 
<br />
In particular, all classical tautologies are true in all worlds of all 
<br />
multiverse independently of the assignment of truth value to the 
<br />
sentence letter p, q, r, etc.
<br />
<br />The main idea of Kripke has consisted in saying that the modal formula 
<br />
Bp (also written []p) is true at world a, if p is true in all the 
<br />
worlds you can access from a. p is relatively necessary at a.
<br />
For example, if the world are countries and if you have to pay taxes in 
<br />
all countries that you can access from where you are, then taxes are 
<br />
necessary (relatively to a).
<br />
<br />That is, p is &quot;necessary&quot; at world a if p is true for all worlds b such 
<br />
that aRb. It is intuitively normal: a proposition is necessary for you 
<br />
if it is true in all world you can access.
<br />
<br />Then a proposition is possible at world a if it is not necessary that 
<br />
~a. So &quot;possible p&quot;, written Dp, or &lt;&gt;p, can be seen as an abbreviation 
<br />
of ~B~p. Note that if Dp is true at a, it means there is an accessible 
<br />
world (where p is true) from a. In particular, given that the constant 
<br />
true t is true in all worlds, Dt really means I can access to some 
<br />
world (I am alive, if you want).
<br />
<br />Now, there are relation between the structure of the multiverse, i.e. 
<br />
the nature of its accessibility relation, and the formula which are 
<br />
true in each world. It should be easy to guess that if the multiverse 
<br />
is reflexive (i.e. all worlds are accessible from themselves) then the 
<br />
formula Bp -&gt; p is true in all the worlds, independently of the truth 
<br />
value of the sentence letters. Slightly less easy: the reverse is true: 
<br />
if Bp -&gt; p is true in all worlds, independently of the assignment of 
<br />
true/false to the sentence letters, then the multiverse is reflexive. 
<br />
We say that the reflexive multiverse characterizes the formula Bp -&gt; p. 
<br />
It means the formula remains invariant when we travel in that 
<br />
multiverse.
<br />
It can be shown that the symmetrical multiverse, that is those where 
<br />
the accessibility relation is symmetric, characterizes the formula p -&gt; 
<br />
BDp. The transitive multiverse characterizes Bp -&gt; BBp. etc.
<br />
<br />Of special interest in this thread are the dead-end world, or 
<br />
cul-de-sac observer-moment (we have use many name for them). A world a, 
<br />
in a multiverse W, is said to be a dead end or a cul-de-sac world if, 
<br />
when you are in a, there is no more world in which you can acceded. So, 
<br />
in such world no proposition are possible, so whatever proposition p 
<br />
is, ~Dp is always false. By classical logic B~p is always true. This is 
<br />
true whatever p is, in particular this is true for its negation ~p. So 
<br />
in a dead end world, all proposition are necessary and none is 
<br />
possible. Not a funny place!
<br />
<br />Now, when B represents the Godel-Lob provability predicate, i.e. when B 
<br />
represents provability in or by a &quot;sufficiently rich&quot; formal 
<br />
system/machine, it can be shown that the &quot;humble multiverse&quot;, that is 
<br />
those where all worlds have access to a dead end world, characterizes 
<br />
B. In that case Dp = ~B~p = &quot;~p is not provable&quot; = &quot;p is consistent&quot; 
<br />
(because if you cannot prove ~p, you will not get a contradiction by 
<br />
adding ~p as axiom, that is you will not prove ~p, that is p is 
<br />
consistent (with your formal theory or for your machine). So &quot;humble 
<br />
multiverse&quot; characterizes the formula Dp -&gt; ~BDp, which is the second 
<br />
incompleteness theorem of Godel: consistent p -&gt; not provable 
<br />
consistent p. So the humble multiverse characterize the machine's 
<br />
discourses.
<br />
<br />This prevents us of defining &quot;probability(p) = 1&quot; in world a by Bp is 
<br />
true at a, because if a is  a dead end then Bp is true (D~p is false) 
<br />
although the probabilities are senseless.
<br />
<br />Now, as you know, I limit the interview of machine to the correct and 
<br />
consistent one. This is just a mathematical trick. For those machine Bp 
<br />
-&gt; Dp is true, but not provable by the machine. So we can define 
<br />
&quot;probability(p) = 1&quot; by &quot;Bp &amp; Dp&quot;. It means that we define the 
<br />
probability one of a proposition p, by p is true in all accessible 
<br />
worlds and there is (at least one) accessible world. The incompleteness 
<br />
forces us to put explicitly the consistency as a requirement. It 
<br />
corresponds to the correct bets, or to the observation of laws 
<br />
(invariant truth of the multiverse).
<br />
<br />Actually, adding that Dp to Bp is so much constraining that we loose 
<br />
the Kripke multiverse structure in the process, but we get instead a 
<br />
more interesting proximity relation, and ultimately we get (translating 
<br />
the comp hyp itself in the language of the machine) an orthogonality 
<br />
structure on the worlds of the multiverse, making it looking like the 
<br />
quantum multiverse  inferred by the observing physicists.
<br />
<br />Observation is implicitly defined here by measurement capable of 
<br />
selecting alternatives on which we are able to bet (or to gamble ?). 
<br />
The french word is &quot;parier&quot;.
<br />
<br />I will not explain the nuance between Bp &amp; Dp and Bp &amp; Dp &amp; p. It just 
<br />
happen that they are not equivalent in the humble multiverse, that is 
<br />
they are not equivalent in the discourse of the correct machine, and 
<br />
this provide nuances. Arithmetical quantum logics appear for all first 
<br />
person nuances put on the provability predicate (with the comp hyp), 
<br />
giving three arithmetical interpretation of some quantum logic. Could 
<br />
explain this latter but I'm afraid it is a bit more technical.
<br />
<br />Hoping this could help (to make logician's and physicist's talk closer 
<br />
perhaps). 'course, Kripke uses himself the term &quot;frame&quot; instead of 
<br />
multiverse, and &quot;model&quot; when each of the proposition letters (p, q, r, 
<br />
...) are assigned to true or false (1 or 0, t or f) in each world.
