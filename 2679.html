Dear Juergen:
<br />
<br />In reply:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Where does all the randomness come from?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Many physicists would be content with a statistical theory of everything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;(TOE) based on simple probabilistic physical laws allowing for stochastic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;predictions such as &quot;We do not know where this particular electron will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;be in the next nanosecond, but with probability 0.04 we will find it in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;certain volume V&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Any source of randomness, however, leaves us with an unsatisfactory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;TOE, since randomness does not have a compact or simple explanation, by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;definition.
</em><br />
<br />That seems incorrect. Randomness can have a simple explanation. However, a 
<br />
particular packet of random information is considered to be incompressible.
<br />
<br />Here is what I consider to be a simple explanation for randomness in the 
<br />
Everything:
<br />
<br />The very essence of the Everything is that it contains no information. In 
<br />
that case it can not internally resolve the question of its own stability 
<br />
because that would be information. There is another polar expression of no 
<br />
information and that is the Great Empty or the &quot;Nothing&quot;. The Nothing is 
<br />
not in the Everything because it is not a pattern.  [See next 
<br />
paragraph]  It also cannot internally resolve the question of its own 
<br />
stability for the same reason. However, the question of stability is not 
<br />
avoidable. The only way to attempt to resolve it is for each to make the 
<br />
only test available which is the minimum available perturbation - a 
<br />
conversion into its polar opposite. The two of these must then alternate 
<br />
existences. The alternation can not inject any information into either pole 
<br />
so it can not have a selected particular pattern. [Neither pole can contain 
<br />
a history of the process since that too would be information thus each 
<br />
alternation is an independent event resulting in no pattern to the 
<br />
alternation.]
<br />
<br />Consider each manifestation of the Everything to be a particular pattern of 
<br />
all patterns each repeated an infinite number of times. The Everything can 
<br />
not be a fixed pattern of patterns. But it is not because each 
<br />
Everything/Nothing alternation conveys no history so the particular pattern 
<br />
of patterns manifest at any alternation is a random selection from all 
<br />
possible patterns of patterns.
<br />
<br />Each pattern internal to the Everything has associated with it all possible 
<br />
interpretations of pattern. Each [pattern,interpretation] pair could be 
<br />
isomorphic to a particular possible/actual state of a particular 
<br />
&quot;universe&quot;. Write these isomorphismic links as: 
<br />
{[pattern,interpretation]/[possible/actual state of a universe]}.
<br />
<br />Again the possible/actual pattern of these links within the Everything can 
<br />
not be static or it is information. So there needs to be a no information 
<br />
generating shifting of these isomorphismic links from possible to actual 
<br />
and back again.
<br />
<br />The only essential aspect is that the current pattern of all these links 
<br />
can not endure.  The historic active states are in no way essential to the 
<br />
link shifting process.  Only the active state and its possible states are 
<br />
essential.
<br />
<br />Each universe is defined by its rules of link shift.  Those rules that 
<br />
insist on even a partial consideration of the set of that universe's 
<br />
historic links in addition to the current link are more complex than those 
<br />
that do not.  If we live in a universe with simple rules it is unlikely our 
<br />
universe's history is an issue in determining its future - only its current 
<br />
state is germane.
<br />
<br />Rules that have a &quot;do not care&quot; component can be even simpler than fully 
<br />
deterministic rules.
<br />
<br />The rules need just compare all nearby links vs the current one in an 
<br />
increasing region of the current Everything pattern until a match is found 
<br />
then the shift takes place.  This process is interrupted by the 
<br />
Everything/Nothing alternation which results in a new pattern of patterns 
<br />
at the next manifestation of the Everything.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Where does the enormous information conveyed by a particular
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;history of random events come from? A TOE that cannot explain this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;is incomplete.
</em><br />
<br />No such data is essential.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;The in hindsight obvious solution is an &quot;ensemble TOE&quot; which covers all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;possible universe histories.  The ensemble conveys less information than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;most particular histories - one main motivation of this mailing list.
</em><br />
<br />Since both the Everything and the Nothing have no information and thus no 
<br />
history, any particular selected historic information is more more 
<br />
information.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Which are the possible histories?  Let us focus on well-defined ensembles
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;only, and ignore those that cannot be sufficiently specified to permit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;reconstruction through a formally describable computer. In particular,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;we may ignore uncountable ensembles such as continua, or other ensembles
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;including histories without finite descriptions.
</em><br />
<br />Well you are focusing on excessively complex rules of universe evolution 
<br />
IMO.  Also see further comments below.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Is there an optimally efficient way of computing all the &quot;randomness&quot; in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;all the describable (possibly infinite) universe histories?  Yes, there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;is. There exists a machine-independent ensemble-generating algorithm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;called FAST that computes any history essentially as quickly as this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;history's fastest algorithm. Somewhat surprisingly, FAST is not slowed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;down much by the simultaneous computation of all the other histories.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;It turns out, however, that for any given history there is a speed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;limit which greatly depends on the history's degree of randomness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Highly random histories are extremely hard to compute, even by the optimal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;algorithm FAST. Each new bit of a truly random history requires at least
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;twice the time required for computing the entire previous history.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;As history size grows, the speed of highly random histories (and most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;histories are random indeed) vanishes very quickly, no matter which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;computer we use (side note: infinite random histories would even require
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;uncountable time, which does not make any sense). On the other hand,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;FAST keeps generating numerous nonrandom histories very quickly; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;fastest ones come out at a rate of a constant number of bits per fixed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;time interval.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Now consider an observer evolving in some universe history. He does not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;know in which, but as history size increases it becomes less and less
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;likely that he is located in one of the slowly computable, highly random
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;universes: after sufficient time most long histories involving him will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;be fast ones.
</em><br />
<br />As I said I currently see no essential role for &quot;history&quot;.   Further the 
<br />
Everything/Nothing alternation can inject no historic information into the 
<br />
Everything there is no way to detect its actual individual 
<br />
alternations.  Any SAS that can conclude it exists seems to be in a 
<br />
universe with undecidables.
<br />
<br />The Everything/Nothing alternation is in effect the transporter operating 
<br />
at the lowest level.
<br />
<br />Hal
