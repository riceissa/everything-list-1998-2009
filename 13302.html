<br />
Hi Max,
<br />
<br />in this particular universe it's going well, thank you!
<br />
<br />As promised, I had a look at your paper. I think
<br />
it is well written and fun to read. I've got a few comments
<br />
though, mostly on the nature of math vs computation,
<br />
and why Goedel is sexy but not an issue
<br />
when it comes to identifying possible mathematical
<br />
structures / universes / formally describable things.
<br />
I think some of the comments are serious enough to affect
<br />
the conclusions. Some come with quotes from papers in
<br />
<a href="http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/computeruniverse.html">http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/computeruniverse.html</a>
<br />
where several of your main issues are addressed.
<br />
Some are marked by &quot;Serious&quot;.
<br />
<br />I am making a cc to the everythingers, although it seems
<br />
they are mostly interested in other things now - probably
<br />
nobody is really going to read this tedious response which
<br />
became much longer than I anticipated.
<br />
<br />1. An abstract &quot;baggage-free&quot; mathematical structure
<br />
does not exist any more than a &quot;baggage-free&quot;
<br />
computer - the particular axiomatic system you choose
<br />
is like the set of primitive instructions of the computer
<br />
you choose. Not very serious, since for general computers
<br />
and general axiomatic systems there are invariance theorems:
<br />
changing the baggage often does not change a lot, so to speak.
<br />
But it should be mentioned.
<br />
<br />2. p 11: you say that data sampled from Gaussian random variables
<br />
is incompressible - NOT true - give short codes to probable events
<br />
(close to the mean), long codes to rare events (Huffman
<br />
coding).
<br />
<br />3. same sentence: how to test what inflation predicts?
<br />
How to test whether the big bang seed was really random,
<br />
not pseudo-random? The second million bits of pi look
<br />
random but are not. We should search for short programs
<br />
compressing the apparent randomness:
<br />
<a href="http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/randomness.html">http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/randomness.html</a>
<br />
<br />4. p 15: Mathematical structure (MS)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;just exists&quot;. Is that so? Others will look at
<br />
your symbols and say they are  just heaps of chalk
<br />
on a blackboard, and you need a complex,
<br />
wet pattern recognition system to interpret them.
<br />
Here's where beliefs enter...
<br />
<br />5. p 18: &quot;mathematical structures, formal systems and
<br />
computations are aspects of one underlying
<br />
transcendent structure whose nature we don't fully understand&quot;
<br />
But we do! I'd say there are NO serious open problems with
<br />
your figure 5 - formal systems vs math vs computation
<br />
is a well-explored field. More about this below.
<br />
The 2000 paper (your nr 17) exploits
<br />
this understanding; it turns out the most convenient way to deal
<br />
with the measure problem is the computer science way (right
<br />
hand corner of your figure 5).
<br />
As I wrote in the 2000 paper:
<br />
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0011122">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0011122</a>
<br />
The algorithmic approach, however, offers several conceptual 
<br />
advantages: (1) It provides the appropriate framework for issues of 
<br />
information-theoretic complexity traditionally ignored in pure 
<br />
mathematics, and imposes natural complexity-based orderings on the 
<br />
possible universes and subsets thereof. (2) It taps into a rich source 
<br />
of theoretical insights on computable probability distributions 
<br />
relevant for establishing priors on possible universes. Such priors are 
<br />
needed for making probabilistic predictions concerning our own 
<br />
particular universe. Although Tegmark suggests that ``... all 
<br />
mathematical structures are a priori given equal statistical weight'' 
<br />
[#!Tegmark:98!#](p. 27), there is no way of assigning equal 
<br />
nonvanishing probability to all (infinitely many) mathematical 
<br />
structures. Hence we really need something like the complexity-based 
<br />
weightings discussed in [#!Schmidhuber:97brauer!#] and especially the 
<br />
paper at hand. (3) The algorithmic approach is the obvious framework 
<br />
for questions of temporal complexity such as those discussed in this 
<br />
paper, e.g., ``what is the most efficient way of simulating all 
<br />
universes?''
<br />
<br />6. Serious: run the sim, or just describe its program?
<br />
Are you sure you know what you want to say here?
<br />
What's the precise difference between program bitstrings
<br />
and output bitstrings? The bitstrings generated by the programs (the
<br />
descriptions) are just alternative descriptions of
<br />
the universes, possibly less compact ones. You as
<br />
an external observer may need yet another program
<br />
that translates the output bits (typically a less compressed
<br />
description) into video or something, to obtain the
<br />
description your eyes want.
<br />
Note that the 2000 paper and the 2002
<br />
journal variant don't really care for time
<br />
evolution, just for descriptions - within
<br />
the bitstrings maybe there is an observer
<br />
who thinks he knows what's time, but
<br />
to the outsider his concept of
<br />
time may be irrelevant. (Unlike the
<br />
1997 paper, the 2000/2002 papers do not focus on a
<br />
one to one mapping between physical
<br />
and computational time steps, otherwise we'd
<br />
miss all the universes where the concept
<br />
of time is irrelevant.) Here's what I wrote at  the end:
<br />
&quot;After all, algorithmic theories of the describable do
<br />
encompass everything we will ever be able to talk
<br />
and write about. Other things are simply beyond description.&quot;
<br />
<br />7. Serious:  p 18 CUH: what's your def
<br />
of computable? You mean by halting
<br />
programs? In theoretical CS there are these famous
<br />
computability hierarchies, and one should understand them
<br />
to see the relation between math and computability (also
<br />
in your figure 5):
<br />
Halting-computable is just a tiny part of
<br />
what's limit-computable, but limit-computable
<br />
still means constructively describable. This was a
<br />
major motivation of the 2000 paper, which
<br />
identified all the constructively describable
<br />
mathematical structures, i.e., those whose
<br />
descriptions can be generated by (possibly
<br />
non-halting) finite programs such that each
<br />
description prefix does not change any more
<br />
after finite time. (But you cannot predict when
<br />
it will cease to change, otherwise you could
<br />
solve the halting problem - but that's not an issue,
<br />
just like the whole Goedel stuff is fun but not at all
<br />
an issue - more on that below).
<br />
<br />8. Serious: p 19 your cite of 13, 17 (the
<br />
97 paper and the 2000 paper) is misleading:
<br />
Yes, I do mention halting universes in the 1997 paper
<br />
(mostly because of the sexy coding theorem for
<br />
halting programs), but even then I emphasize the
<br />
importance of non-halting programs (since you'd miss
<br />
out on a lot of constructively describable
<br />
universes without them). And the
<br />
2000 paper is really driven by a few new insights
<br />
about the nature of compressibility through non-halting
<br />
programs, clarifying which universes and math structures
<br />
are constructively describable,
<br />
and which are not (and thus cannot exist even under
<br />
the most relaxed constructive perspective).
<br />
<br />(Less relevant to what you are discussing:
<br />
in certain algorithmic TOEs computation time plays a
<br />
major role - the harder something is to compute, the smaller
<br />
its probability. This is more restrictive (and perhaps
<br />
more interesting) than the general case above
<br />
which is discussed at length. Novel
<br />
insights concerning the general case eventually
<br />
ended up in the 2002 IJFCS article
<br />
novel insights concerning
<br />
computation time in the 2002 COLT paper
<br />
<a href="http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/speedprior.html">http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/speedprior.html</a> )
<br />
<br />9. p 19/20: careful with Goedel - inconsistent is not
<br />
the same as omega-inconsistent.
<br />
BTW, inconsistent axiomatic
<br />
systems correspond to systematic theorem provers
<br />
(programs) listing all possible theorems, halting
<br />
once the first contradiction is discovered. Desirable
<br />
alternative: this search program does not halt.
<br />
Non-halting programs can be good...
<br />
<br />10. Serious. p 20 conclusion of C: IMO this focus on halting
<br />
computations is missing the point. Non-halting
<br />
computations are still constructive. If you want
<br />
to talk about all constructive MS / universes
<br />
you don't want to ignore universes compactly
<br />
describable by NON-halting programs! One of the main
<br />
points of the 2000 paper.
<br />
<br />11. Serious. p 21 item 4: Goedel-undecidability:
<br />
the 2000 paper is full of Goedel-undecidable
<br />
yet limit-computable examples of mathematical structures / computable
<br />
universes. Note that you don't really need infinitely many
<br />
steps to compute any prefix of any limit-computable
<br />
universe - you can do it in finite time, you just don't
<br />
know at which point you're done!  That's essentially
<br />
all Goedel &amp; Turing say. That's why Goedel does not
<br />
pose any obstacles whatsoever when the question is:
<br />
which are the formally describable universes?
<br />
Some of those universes do allow for observers
<br />
formulating undecidable questions - so what?
<br />
<br />As I wrote in the 1997 paper:
<br />
<a href="http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/everything/">http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/everything/</a>
<br />
&quot;Although we live in a computable universe, we occasionally chat about 
<br />
incomputable things, such as the halting probability of a universal 
<br />
Turing machine (which is closely related to Gödel's incompleteness 
<br />
theorem). And we sometimes discuss inconsistent worlds in which, say, 
<br />
time travel is possible. Talk about such worlds, however, does not 
<br />
violate the consistency of the processes underlying it.&quot;
<br />
<br />12. Serious. p 21 item 5: &quot;even more general structures&quot; - but you
<br />
cannot describe them constructively at all! For example,
<br />
most real numbers don't exist in the sense that you cannot describe
<br />
them formally. Even the uncountability of the entire set of real numbers
<br />
is not a formal consequence of the axioms of the real numbers
<br />
but just a matter of interpretation - the axioms do not imply
<br />
uncountability! They also have a countable model.
<br />
<br />As I wrote in the 2000 paper:
<br />
Much of this paper highlights differences between countable and 
<br />
uncountable sets. It is argued (Sections 6, 7) that things such as 
<br />
uncountable time and space and incomputable probabilities actually 
<br />
should not play a role in explaining the world, for lack of evidence 
<br />
that they are really necessary. Some may feel tempted to counter this 
<br />
line of reasoning by pointing out that for centuries physicists have 
<br />
calculated with continua of real numbers, most of them incomputable. 
<br />
Even quantum physicists who are ready to give up the assumption of a 
<br />
continuous universe usually do take for granted the existence of 
<br />
continuous probability distributions on their discrete universes, and 
<br />
Stephen Hawking explicitly said: ``Although there have been suggestions 
<br />
that space-time may have a discrete structure I see no reason to 
<br />
abandon the continuum theories that have been so successful.'' Note, 
<br />
however, that all physicists in fact have only manipulated discrete 
<br />
symbols, thus generating finite, describable proofs of their results 
<br />
derived from enumerable axioms. That real numbers really exist in a way 
<br />
transcending the finite symbol strings used by everybody may be a 
<br />
figment of imagination -- compare Brouwer's constructive mathematics 
<br />
[#!Brouwer:07!#,#!Beeson:85!#] and the Löwenheim-Skolem Theorem 
<br />
[#!Loewenheim:15!#,#!Skolem:19!#] which implies that any first order 
<br />
theory with an uncountable model such as the real numbers also has a 
<br />
countable model. As Kronecker put it: ``Die ganze Zahl schuf der liebe 
<br />
Gott, alles Übrige ist Menschenwerk'' (``God created the integers, all 
<br />
else is the work of man'' [#!Cajori:19!#]). Kronecker greeted with 
<br />
scepticism Cantor's celebrated insight [#!Cantor:1874!#] about real 
<br />
numbers, mathematical objects Kronecker believed did not even exist.
<br />
<br />13. Serious: p 21 conclusion of D: &quot;a mathematical object does
<br />
not exist unless it can be constructed from natural numbers in
<br />
a finite number of steps - this leads to item 3&quot;.
<br />
Careful here! Any finite thing can be computed
<br />
by a halting program, of course. But do you want
<br />
to forbid infinite descriptions whose every prefix
<br />
is limit-computable in finite time?
<br />
Then you'll lose many constructive mathematical
<br />
structures of the 2000 paper!
<br />
<br />The most general constructive way to
<br />
handle all descriptions really is the one mentioned above:
<br />
Universe descriptions can be finite or infinite,
<br />
but their shortest descriptions have to be finite.
<br />
These shortest descriptions, however, may correspond
<br />
to NON-halting programs that compute each prefix of
<br />
the possibly infinite &quot;unfolded&quot; description in finite
<br />
time, such that it remains stable thereafter, although
<br />
you may never know WHEN it's converged (because
<br />
of Goedel, but that's not at all important here). Ah,
<br />
I am in a loop, repeating myself...
<br />
<br />14. p 21  E: &quot;no aspect of our universe is undecidable...&quot;
<br />
This does not seem true: build a computer in our universe,
<br />
feed it with programs - it's generally undecidable by
<br />
a halting program which ones will halt - so there are undecidable
<br />
aspects of our universe. My old point: so what? This won't
<br />
destroy our universe.
<br />
<br />15. Serious. p 22 measure of computer programs: &quot;they depend
<br />
on the representation of structures or computations
<br />
as bitstrings, and no obvious candidate currently
<br />
exists for which rep to use&quot;. This is misleading.
<br />
The measures for different but fundamentally
<br />
equivalent computers /
<br />
programming languages / axiomatic systems are the
<br />
same save for multiplicative constants independent of
<br />
the objects to be measured, because of the invariance
<br />
theorems!
<br />
<br />16. p 22 G: equivalence classes - measure problem:
<br />
This is why those famous coding theorems are essential.
<br />
A good coding theorem says: ok, there are many
<br />
descriptions of a particular universe, but its measure
<br />
is dominated by the probability of the shortest
<br />
programs. Coding theorems for halting programs
<br />
and certain types of non-halting ones differ a bit though.
<br />
One must carefully state one's assumptions:
<br />
which computable universe descriptions are acceptable as TOEs?
<br />
Just the halting ones? Certain types of limit-computable
<br />
ones (there are various more or less general classes)?
<br />
Then check the corresponding coding theorem
<br />
to deal with the measure problem.
<br />
<br />17. p 23 main results: &quot;we found it important
<br />
to define mathematical structures precisely.&quot;
<br />
well, that's a main motivation of the 2000 paper:
<br />
what precisely does it mean to be formally
<br />
describable? Answer (see above): the
<br />
constructively describable mathematical structures
<br />
(or formally describable things) are those whose
<br />
descriptions can be generated by (possibly
<br />
non-halting) finite programs such that each
<br />
description prefix does not change any more
<br />
after finite time. (I told you I am in a loop...)
<br />
<br />18. p 23 &quot;it is unjustified to identify
<br />
the 1-dim comp sequence with 1 dim time.&quot;
<br />
Sure - who's arguing against that?
<br />
<br />Ok, that's much more than I wanted
<br />
to write originally. Hope it will help!
<br />
<br />Cheers,
<br />
