In his article, &quot;Investigations into the Doomsday Argument&quot;, Nick
<br />
Bostrom introduces the Doomsday Argument with the following example:
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt; Imagine that two big urns are put in front of you, and you know
<br />
that one of them contains ten balls and the other a million, but you
<br />
are ignorant as to which is which. You know the balls in each urn are
<br />
numbered 1, 2, 3, 4 ... etc. Now you take a ball at random from the
<br />
left urn, and it is number 7. Clearly, this is a strong indication
<br />
that that urn contains only ten balls. If originally the odds were
<br />
fifty-fifty, a swift application of Bayes' theorem gives you the
<br />
posterior probability that the left urn is the one with only ten
<br />
balls. (Pposterior (L=10) = 0.999990). &gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />The Use of Unnumbered Balls
<br />
<br />Let us first consider the case where the balls are not numbered. We
<br />
remove a ball from the left urn, and we wonder whether it came from
<br />
the urn containing ten balls or from the urn containing one million
<br />
balls.
<br />
<br />The ball was chosen at random from one of the two urns. Therefore,
<br />
there is a 50% probability that it came from either urn. It is
<br />
important to realize that this probability is based on the number of
<br />
urns, not the number of balls in each urn, which could be any number
<br />
greater than zero.
<br />
<br />There is nothing here to suggest a statistical limitation on the
<br />
maximum size of a group of balls.
<br />
<br />The Use of Numbered Balls
<br />
<br />Since the statistical limitation proposed by the Doomsday Argument is
<br />
not apparent with unnumbered balls, it may be a consequence of
<br />
numbering the balls.
<br />
<br />The balls in the ten-ball urn have been numbered according to the
<br />
series of integers used to count ten objects (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
<br />
9, 10). The fact that each of these integers has been written on one
<br />
of the balls suggests that the balls have been counted in the order
<br />
indicated by the numbers. But if the balls had been counted in any of
<br />
numerous other different orders, the sum would have always been the
<br />
same, so the actual order used is of no significance.
<br />
<br />Furthermore, if the physical distribution of the balls in the urn had
<br />
been arranged according to the series of integers written on the
<br />
balls, their distribution would not be at all random. If we imagine a
<br />
column of balls in each urn, ranging from 1 to 10 and from 1 to
<br />
1,000,000, the first ball selected at random from the two urns would
<br />
be numbered either 10 or 1,000,000. But we know from the statement of
<br />
Bostrom's example that the balls are arranged at random within the
<br />
urns.
<br />
<br />Naming the Balls Uniquely
<br />
<br />If the order in which the balls were counted is not significant, and
<br />
the balls have not been arranged physically in the order in which they
<br />
were counted, the numbers on the balls could still be used to identify
<br />
each ball uniquely, i.e., to give each ball a unique name. This idea
<br />
is supported by the fact that Bostrom wonders whether the ball 7
<br />
selected at random is the ball 7 from one urn or the other.
<br />
<br />Because of the naming scheme used in the example, we could be certain
<br />
that any ball with a number greater than 10 came from the million-ball
<br />
urn. But the naming scheme has the flaw that it provides ambiguous
<br />
names for balls 1 through 10, which are found in both urns. It is, I
<br />
believe, this ambiguity in the naming of the balls that produces the
<br />
statistical result mentioned by Bostrom. The very same effect could be
<br />
produced by filling both urns with unnumbered white balls, except for
<br />
a single unnumbered blue ball in each urn. The two blue balls would
<br />
produce the same statistical effect as the two ball 7's.
<br />
<br />If all of the balls had been numbered unambiguously from 1 through
<br />
1,000,010, the statistical effect produced by Bostrom's ambiguous ball
<br />
7 would vanish.
