<br />Well, sure, these examples are typical of the massive breakthroughs in 
<br />
our understanding of the universe, and of the core fields of 
<br />
mathematics, that came in the 19th and early 20th centuries, roughly 
<br />
from 1850 to 1950. (There was a similar phase a bit earlier, with 
<br />
Newton, Leibniz, Laplace, Lagrange, etc.)
<br />
<br />This is an example of how the rate of discovery is _slowing down_.
<br />
<br />(I'll wait a moment for the jeers to subside...)
<br />
<br />By slowing down I mean of course that we have basically mapped out the 
<br />
larger structure of physics, and also chemistry, geology, math, and so 
<br />
on. Biology is perhaps much less mapped out.
<br />
<br />It's not likely that any theory, whether algebraic topology or model 
<br />
theory or whatever is going to give us anything like QM or relativity, 
<br />
for the reason that we have them and we have no evidence that some 
<br />
large body of experimental evidence awaits explanation in the way that 
<br />
the early QM reearchers knew they were explaining aspects of reality 
<br />
all around them (hydrogen atom, electron diffraction, spectral lines in 
<br />
emissions, radioactive decay, new and obvious particles like alphas, 
<br />
neutrons, positrons, muons, etc., and so on. Likewise, Einstein and 
<br />
others knew full well the import of the Michelson-Morley experiment. 
<br />
And the bending of light around the sun was predicted and then observed 
<br />
less than 2 years later. Finally, both theories came together with the 
<br />
atom bomb.
<br />
<br />Theories today are much, much further removed from experiment and from 
<br />
everyday implications. I don't need to say more about this, I presume.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; sets in geometric nonlinear functional analysis, Godel's theorems, or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hoyle's Law or the Central Limit Theorems or the almost incredible 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theorems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of Nonsmooth Analysis and Kalman filters/predictors and Dynamic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Programming
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and the Calculus of Variations and Cantor's cardinals and ordinals and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Robinson's infinitesimals and Dirac's equations and Dirac's delta 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; functions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and Feynmann's path history integrals and diagrams and the whole new
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generation of continuum force laws and on and on.
</em><br />
<br />Here you're getting more modern areas, areas which in fact are deeply 
<br />
connected with topos theory, for example. Besides logic, which remains 
<br />
an active field with active researchers, you ought to look into 
<br />
&quot;synthetic differential geometry,&quot; explored by Anders Kock and others. 
<br />
SDE reifies the infinitesimals. I would strongly argue that the 
<br />
nonsmooth analysis and infinitesimal analysis you crave is _more_ 
<br />
closely related to Grothendieck toposes than you seem to appreciate.
<br />
<br />Likewise, check out papers by Crane, Baez, and others on the 
<br />
connections between Feynman diagrams and category theory. (One of them 
<br />
is &quot;Categorical Feynmanology. The arXive site has them all.
<br />
<br />Kalman filters are just an applied tool. Check out &quot;support vector 
<br />
machines&quot; to see that work continues on new and improved tools of this 
<br />
sort.
<br />
<br />Expecting category theory to be a theory of dynamic programming or 
<br />
linear algebra practical programming is not reasonable.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sure, category theory can go in to many fields and find a category and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; take credit for the field being essentially a category, and I can go 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; many fields and find plus and minus and division and multiplication 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; analogs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and declare the field as an example of Rare Event Theory [RET] or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Fairly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Frequent Event Theory [FFT or FET] or Very Frequent Event Theory [VFT 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or
</em><br />
<br />I confess that I have never understand your &quot;Rare Event Theory.&quot; 
<br />
Science is well-equipped to deal with events measured with large 
<br />
negative exponents, even probabilities with 10^-50 or whatever.
<br />
<br />I don't think the world's nonacceptance of &quot;RET&quot; means it is on par 
<br />
with category theory, just because some here don't think much of it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But string and brane theory are suffering from precisely what category
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory is suffering from - a paucity of predictions of the Einstein and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Schrodinger kind mentioned in the second paragraph back, and a paucity 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; depth.  Now, Tim, you certainly know very very much, but how are you at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; depth [question-mark  - my question mark and several other keys like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; parentheses are out].
</em><br />
<br />On your first point, yes, many current theories are very far from 
<br />
having testable predictions. Including, of course, the Tegmark theory, 
<br />
the Schmidhuber theory, and all sorts of universe-as-CA theories. 
<br />
String and loop quantum gravity theories may be hundreds of years away 
<br />
from being tested...or a test could surprise us within the next 10 
<br />
years, much as the evidence for black holes has mounted dramatically, 
<br />
faster than many of us 30 years ago thought it would.
<br />
<br />The reasons for this fall into two main categories (no pun intended). 
<br />
One, the low-hanging fruit point. A lot of bright minds have churned 
<br />
over things, with perhaps 1000 times as much effort as we had when 
<br />
Einstein was theorizing in his patent office, or even when the 
<br />
community of quantum mechanics experts was still small enough that they 
<br />
could meet a few times a year (a la Solvay Conferences) or meet with 
<br />
David Hilbert, Emmy Noether, Emil Artin, and John von Neumann in their 
<br />
offices at Gottingen and Heidelberg.
<br />
<br />The second reason is the energy one. It took a few thousand dollars's 
<br />
worth of equipment in 1900-1920 to produce interesting new particles, 
<br />
to prove the existence of electrons, protons, etc. Then it took maybe 
<br />
10-20 that to build Cockroft-Walton and Van de Graf accelerators to 
<br />
find more. Then another similar increment in cost and energy for the 
<br />
early cyclotrons to find the interesting particles of the 1930s. Then 
<br />
another such factor to build nuclear piles and larger cyclotrons. And 
<br />
thus the 1950s saw a huge expenditure to build the Bevatron, where the 
<br />
antiproton and other particles were discovered/confirmed/created. (By 
<br />
the way, Dirac's prediction of antiparticles was a very &quot;category 
<br />
theory&quot;-like process of looking at symmetries in a commutative diagram 
<br />
and essentially saying &quot;to make this diagram commute, I need this leg 
<br />
of the diagram.&quot;) And then we had multibillion dollar Brookhaven AGS 
<br />
machines, SLAC, and on to machines like Fermilab and CERN which cost 
<br />
many tens of billions. The Superconducting Supercollider was ultimately 
<br />
dropped due to incredible cost and low bang for the buck (perhaps only 
<br />
one new particle, according to many predictions.)
<br />
<br />Yeah, it's conceivable that the SSC would have produced some new realm 
<br />
of physics, as the enhancements going into CERN may still do. But the 
<br />
odds are against it. (John Cramer, he of the transactional 
<br />
interpretation of quantum mechanics, has some nice science fiction 
<br />
about this sort of thing: &quot;Twistor.&quot; But it's SF, not anything that is 
<br />
likely to come out of CERN.)
<br />
<br />_These_ are the reasons we are in a sense &quot;filling in the details,&quot; 
<br />
fleshing out the tree whose branches grew to nearly their present form 
<br />
by the 1970s.
<br />
<br />It's one reason, I think, a lot of us who got started in physics in the 
<br />
60s and 70s moved into other fields. (There was nothing of interest to 
<br />
me in S-matrix theory and Regge calculus, the &quot;hot&quot; areas of 
<br />
theoretical physics in 1972.)
<br />
<br />On your second point, about &quot;how are you at depth?&quot;, I hope this wasn't 
<br />
a cheap shot. Assuming it wasn't, I dig in to the areas that interest 
<br />
me. As I have said more than a few times here, I am just in the past 8 
<br />
months or so digging in deeply to areas of logic (especially modal), 
<br />
brushing up on my math (algebra, topology, algebraic topology, 
<br />
analysis, etc.), and using topos and category theory as my touchstones. 
<br />
When I have gone as far as I wish to, perhaps I will move on to other 
<br />
areas.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I will give an example.  Socrates would rank in my estimation as a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Creative
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Geniuses of Maximum Depth.    The world of Athens was very superficial,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; facially and bodily and publicly oriented but with relatively little 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; depth,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and when push came to shove, rather than ask what words meant, it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; preferred
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to kill the person making the inquiries.
</em><br />
<br />The death of Socrates notwithstanding, this does not sound like the 
<br />
Athens I studied. Socrates was a strange bird, and there is much 
<br />
evidence that he did everything he could to ensure his own death 
<br />
sentence. Equally profound thinkers like Plato and Aristotle faced very 
<br />
little pressure.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;   What it was afraid of was going
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deep, asking what the gods really were,
</em><br />
<br />This doesn't match my reading of history. Aristotle asked profound 
<br />
questions about the nature of reality, metaphysics, belief, etc.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You mentioned, Tim, that the Holographic Model is still very 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hypothetical.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Are we to understand that G. 't Hooft obtained the Nobel Prize for a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hypothetical idea [question-mark] among others.
</em><br />
<br />Ah, but 't Hooft did not get the Nobel for his work with Susskind and 
<br />
others on the holographic model. He got it for his work on the 
<br />
electroweak force.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I will conclude this rather long posting with an explanation of why I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Lawvere and MacLane and incidentally Smolin and Rovelli went in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wrong
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; direction regarding depth.  It was because they were ALGEBRAISTS - 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; specialty and life's work in mathematics was ALGEBRA - very, very 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; advanced
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ALGEBRA.  Now, algebra has a problem with depth because IT HAS TOO MANY
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ABSTRACT POSSIBILITIES WITH NO [MORE CONCRETE OR NOT] SELECTION 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; CRITERIA
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; AMONG THEM.   It is somewhat like the Ocean - if an explorer worships 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ocean, then he will go off in any direction that Ocean seems to be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; leading
</em><br />
...
<br />
<br />Sorry, but this is a silly argument. Smolin and Rovelli may in fact be 
<br />
wrong in their theory of loop quantum gravity (and the closely related 
<br />
theories of spin foams, etc., along with Penrose, Susskind, Baez, 
<br />
Ashketar, and the whole gang), but it is almost certainly not for some 
<br />
simplistic reason that they were &quot;ALGEBRAISTS.&quot;
<br />
<br />In fact, Penrose is a geometer's geometer. See, for example, the essays 
<br />
in his Festschrift. Now the geometry focus of Penrose does not prove 
<br />
_anything_ about either the internal consistency or the ultimate truth 
<br />
of some of his spin network and spinor models, nor about the truth or 
<br />
falsity of spin foams and so on.
<br />
<br />As for Lawvere and Mac Lane being &quot;ALGEBRAISTS,&quot; I neither see your 
<br />
point nor its relevance. What Mac Lane may or may not be is open to 
<br />
debate...his work on homology theory tends to mark him as an algebraic 
<br />
topologist. And Grothendieck and Lawvere were looking into 
<br />
generalizations of the concept of a space--and they succeeded. 
<br />
(Personally, and speculatively, when the concept of a space is 
<br />
generalized so nicely, I think in terms of &quot;this probably shows up in 
<br />
the physical world or its description someplace.&quot; If this ain't 
<br />
geometry affecting a physics outlook, what is?)
<br />
<br />Anyway, it's silly to argue along these lines. You ought to take a look 
<br />
at one of his recent books (co-authored when he was around 80): 
<br />
&quot;Sheaves in Geometry and Logic: A First Introduction to Topos Theory.&quot; 
<br />
I'd call sheaves, presheaves, and locales some pretty deep 
<br />
geometrical/topological ideas, albeit at a level of abstraction that 
<br />
takes a lot of effort to master.
<br />
<br />What the structure of reality really is depends on a couple of 
<br />
important things:
<br />
<br />1. What aspect we are looking at, whether the local causal structure of 
<br />
spacetime or the &quot;explanation&quot; of the particles and their masses, or 
<br />
even at some grossly different scale, such as fluid turbulence (still 
<br />
not understand, in many ways, and yet almost certainly not depending on 
<br />
theories of branes or strings or the Planck-scale structure of 
<br />
spacetime).
<br />
<br />2. Scales and energies, whether the cosmological or the ultrasmall.
<br />
<br />3. Our conceptual biases (if we only know geometry, we see things 
<br />
geometrically, and so on).
<br />
<br />One of the reasons I like studying math is to expand my conceptual 
<br />
toolbox, to increase the number of conceptual basis vectors I can use 
<br />
to build models with.
