<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But strictly speaking (I am also a stickler), the first person can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; never identify herself to *any* representation, she share this with

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the 0-person ONE, or the non differentiate (arithmetical) truth. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; knower does not know who he is. Relatively to probable histories, he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; makes bets &quot;all the time&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, I agree with this.  This is why I've always said that the One is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'personal' to some minimum but not-eliminable degree (0-personal in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your terminology).  The first person inherits the &quot;I&quot; from the One:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this is essential to make sense of duplicability and teleportation.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You know, in the &quot;machine theology&quot;, that is, in the interview of the  
<br />
Löbian machine (AUDA), the role of the ONE is aptly done by the notion  
<br />
of truth, as conceived in mathematical logic, and which is rather  
<br />
clear about arithmetical sentences. It is important to mention Tarski  
<br />
theorem, and to remember that no correct machine can ever even name  
<br />
its own truth predicate, so that such a ONE satisfy already a first  
<br />
&quot;axiom&quot; of Plotinus, which is that the ONE has no name.
<br />
You may be right attributing a personhood to &quot;truth&quot;, like Plotinus  
<br />
could be right in attributing a will. I don't know. What is clearer is  
<br />
that any singular first person (which is never really singular  
<br />
actually) inherited its soul from &quot;the universal soul&quot; which is the  
<br />
knower, and the one defined by Bp &amp; p. But the &quot;p&quot; of &quot;Bp &amp; p&quot; is  
<br />
inherit from the ONE (truth), like Bp is inherit
<br />
is inherit from Intellect. This makes consistent many assertion by  
<br />
Plotinus, and is basically what the machine can say and/or infer from  
<br />
its &quot;self-searching&quot;.
<br />
But we are really in AUDA here, and I feel like using authoritative  
<br />
argument, at this stage.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Beyond this, that the unique qualitative nature of the OFP *is* as  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; appears, is in principle outside the scope of explanation itself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; No! This is the &quot;miracle&quot; of comp. Machine cannot not discover the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; incommunicable part of their experience, but they can, assume of bet
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; on comp, and justify that why it has to be so. That is AUDA. The gap
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is justified from inside. It is a consequence from the fact that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; machine can prove their own incompleteness theorems, and even study
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the geometry of their ignorance.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Apparently we don't agree :-(
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The ultimate gap remains unavoidable,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; so you are right saying that the unique qualitative nature of the OFP
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is outside the scope of the explanation, but that fact, is an &quot;easy&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; theorem on and by  the machine which introspect herself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; To sum up:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The unique qualitative nature of the OFP *is* beyond the scope of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; explanation-comp theory. But that very fact *is* in the scope of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; theory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Apparently we DO agree :-)
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  IOW - as Bruno says above - they are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; theoretical constructions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, but this does not mean those construction does not refer to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; something real independently of us, and this is what I assume for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; comp
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; I agree, as above that it is the whole point of our endeavours to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; that the construction *refers* to something real.  But I think  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; perhaps
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; that the something thus referenced is not best characterised as  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; real *independently* of us, but rather *constitutive* of us and our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; (most general) environment.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I agree with you, but this can be said among enlightened people who
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; understand the whole stuff.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Before the reasoning, you could be suspected to put the horse behind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the car.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Or &quot;put the horse before the cart&quot;, in our delightfully archaic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; phrase.  I am doing this, would you say?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; With comp, numbers, or finite things like combinators etc. have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; clearly a relation with us, but a priori it is simpler to state their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; laws without referring to us.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree that simpler is better as long as we are clear on what is  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being assumed.
</em><br />
<br />The difficulty of the UDA could come from that at step 0, we somehow  
<br />
ask a question, independently of the ontology.
<br />
You can say &quot;yes&quot; to the doctor without having any definite opinion  
<br />
about the existence of primitive matter or not. You have to believe in  
<br />
some amount of consensual reality (which people do when sending a mail  
<br />
to a mailing list, usually).
<br />
The reasoning leads then to an extraction of a &quot;theory of everything&quot;.  
<br />
That theory does not postulate matter, but explain, actually by  
<br />
postulating number + addition and multiplication, why universal  
<br />
machine exists and observe eventually matter, and why primitive matter  
<br />
cannot interfere with it (so that by Occam, it is as useless as ether  
<br />
and phlogiston).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; A number is even if and only its square is even. This is a law about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; numbers. Those are the type of truth which we have to state as not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; depending on us &lt;here and now&gt;, even if it depends on us, or are us,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;there&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Even if the whole existence get annihilated, 17 would still be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; prime.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; I understand that it is justifiable to take this as your point of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; departure and don't really wish to make an argumentative point out  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; it.  Nonetheless, in passing, perhaps I have a more radical  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; intuition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; of annihilation than you.  One can waste a lot of breath speculating
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; on 'nothing' because, strictly I guess, there can be nothing at  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; all it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; can refer to.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; This I do not understand. There are many nothing everywhere, and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; absence, and I am open that absolute nothingness could be  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; conceivable,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; a bit like theories having no models. It seems you just point here on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; a difficult open question.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;  I could demonstrate this, given infinite time, simply
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; by flatly rejecting *any* survivor of such annihilation that you or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; anyone cared to propose, to the crack of doom.  On this basis, even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; '17 is prime' is a goner.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I still don't see why or how you could do that, except by convincing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; me that Peano Arithmetic is inconsistent.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think we're at cross-purposes, but it really doesn't count much for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our discussion here.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Ah, but my argument attempts to distinguish a computation  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; (immaterial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; dynamic object) and an implementation of a computation (material
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; dynamic process) - again, per standard physical theory - as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; refutation of standard comp *in these strictly physical terms*.  My
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; point is, that per physicalism, a computation must be implemented in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; some physical mechanism in order to have any real - i.e. physical -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; effects (at least this was true the last time I did any  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; programming).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Hence the existence of 'immaterial objects' in this case is simply
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; irrelevant to any effects that would be strictly justifiable as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; ontologically real, per physicalism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Actually I do disagree with this, and Peter Jones made good point
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; here. If you were true, UDA could be simplified a lot. Physicalism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; does not prevent dualism form/matter at all, like immaterial software
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and physical hardware. Physicalism can still explained the existence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of the many immaterial being like nations, countries, persons (being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; fuzzy on the 1-3 distinction), games, music, etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK, I hadn't realised that this point was quite so elusive, so now I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will have to insist a little more. There are two absolutely crucial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; differences IMO between the examples you cite above (which Peter also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appeals to) and computation - per strict physicalism - conceived as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *constitutive* of the OFP (as contrasted with 3-description):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) All of your examples are in principle hierarchically reducible (per
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physicalism) to *specific* nameable physical entities and relations,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and any change in these specifications produces an identifiable change
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the collective entity (e.g. different notes = different music).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One can't simply say e.g. that 'nation' is invariant in the face of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different collections of persons, since any such change is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unquestionably material to the persons actually constitutive of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nation - and this is the point (i.e. it's still different notes =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different music).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) None of your examples (and indeed NO immaterial entity other than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computation) is postulated to evoke a novel ontological category such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as the OFP i.e. a 'nation' isn't something with an ontology distinct -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and in a different category - from that of the persons who constitute
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Computationalism (i.e. when assumed to supervene on the activity of an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ontologically privileged physical substrate) violates both of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; above criteria: it is *invariant* (i.e. different notes = same music)
</em><br />
<br />Well this concern many more things than just computationalism, like  
<br />
(different restaurant, same price). here are many immaterial pattern  
<br />
in invariant in nature, even waves in general can be see in this way  
<br />
when you add a dynamic. Quantum field makes particles already   
<br />
immaterial in that sense I would say.  The only newness in  
<br />
computationalism is the presume digitalness. But OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; under inumerable different physical reductions (i.e. it is defined
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; functionally); and yet any such state of affairs (again excluding mere
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3-descriptions) is asserted somehow to evoke an *identical* - and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moreover completely *novel* - ontological category.
</em><br />
<br />I am not sure I follow this. Once you say yes to the doctor, you  
<br />
&quot;know&quot; that you are a number which moves itself, of you course you  
<br />
know just that you are a person who bet on its survival for digital  
<br />
annihilation-reconstitution. But this is already true for books and  
<br />
electronic mailings. I am not sure what is new. WE just get numerical,  
<br />
like say a symphony by Sibelius available from a numerical CD.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Consequently IMO the foregoing criteria make the computational theory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of mind a mere dogma under the criterion of strict physicalism,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; although the restrictiveness of this criterion usually passes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unrecognised precisely in consequence of this dogmatic blindness.
</em><br />
<br />?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Indeed it is precisely the contradiction implicit in the conjunction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of strict physicalism with the computational theory of mind that step
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 08 seeks to expose and correct.
</em><br />
<br />Yes. The epistemological contradiction.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The reversal of number and physics, by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contrast, privileges as efficacious the precise number relations upon
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which computational invariance depends.  In so doing it justifies comp
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as an ontological category, and thereby eludes this criticism.
</em><br />
<br />It justifies there is no sense to add any form of existence beyond  
<br />
arithmetical existence. It makes arithmetic the theory of everything,  
<br />
and it explains what is matter from the point of view of the universal  
<br />
numbers.
<br />
Comp does not introduce any new ontology. It uses the fact that  
<br />
computer science is embedded in &quot;truth&quot;. It exploits the necessary gap  
<br />
between computer science and computer's computer science. The gap  
<br />
contains what universal machine can hope and fear.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; BTW, when you refer to &quot;dualism form/matter&quot; I assume you aren't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appealling to mind-matter dualism in any literal sense,
</em><br />
<br />I was, locally, in defense of physicalism against your argument. Once  
<br />
the implication of comp is understood, this takes another sense, of  
<br />
course.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; although this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is IMO actually implied by any (non-3-description) computational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory of mind that uniquely privileges physical entities and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relations as ontologically efficacious.
</em><br />
<br />Yes. It is even the reason why materialist does not succeed to solve  
<br />
the mind-body problem. They introduce a notion of matter which  
<br />
eventually can be shown to be nonsensical. With comp, matter can still  
<br />
explains the mind (which explains why comp is the favorite theory of  
<br />
the atheist and the materialist), the problem is that, with comp,  
<br />
matter can no more explain matter, or more precisely: the postulation  
<br />
of matter acn no more justifies the appearance of matter in the mind  
<br />
of any universal machine. Physics become ultimately the study of the  
<br />
border of the ignorance of the universal person. This can be studied  
<br />
with math, and up to now, it seems to work.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'd like to dispose of this issue definitively, if possible.  Either
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm wrong in some point of the analysis (which I would be happy to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concede if clearly demonstrated), or something is being missed here.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But comp, pushed on its logical conclusion prevent physicalism to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; explain the 1-person stable observations. We have to explain the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; appearances of all observables protagonists from the relation between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; numbers. There is a problem of vocabulary deciding if matter  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; disappear
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; or not. It is easier to say that physicalism is shown inconsistent or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; epistemologically empty. But this is not an entirely trivial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; proposition to demonstrate; it is full of traps, and without QM, nor
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Post or Turing, I would never have believed this, nor find the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; argument. UDA needs the universal machine concept.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; UDA1-7 can be based on the physical implementation of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the devices presented in the protocol of the thought experiment.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; UDA-8
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; eliminates that assumption.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; When you say &quot;physical implementation&quot; here, do you mean in terms of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ontologically-primary physicalism?
</em><br />
<br />As you want. The seven first step work with comp, or with comp +  
<br />
physicalism. It is really like you prefer.
<br />
The assumption of physicalism is almost never use in the practice of  
<br />
science. It is just in the background.
<br />
The idea that physicalism is part of the science of today is an  
<br />
oversimplification. It belongs to the religious background more or  
<br />
less inherit from years of oversimplification of Aristotle Platonism.
<br />
A real scientist does just not commit itself ontologically at all,  
<br />
except for the local referents of the terms appearing in its theory.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Does this assume in this case that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; UDA1-7 could still be coherent per *some* theory of mind, but *not*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; under the assumption that &quot;I am a machine&quot;, as step 8 seeks to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; demonstrate?
</em><br />
<br />You may clarify. UDA1-7 needs &quot;I am a machine&quot;, so I have no idea of  
<br />
what could be UDA1-7 without &quot;I am a machine&quot;.
<br />
UDA1-7 is UDA0-7 with UDA-0 = &quot;I am a machine&quot; (material or not, it  
<br />
does change anything).
<br />
<br />UDA-8, which is really independent, just shows that once we attach the  
<br />
mind to a computation, we cannot attach the mind to the physical  
<br />
activity incarnating that computation. UDA1-7 do a sort of contrary:  
<br />
if we attach a physical activity to a mind, then the mind itself can  
<br />
attach itself only to an infinity of (primarily physical) computation.  
<br />
With both, you can, well, you must (to remain epistemologically  
<br />
coherent) drop &quot;primarily physical&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; When you say that &quot;activity is just a function from N to set of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; states&quot;, you again seem to refer to 'immaterial activity'.  It seems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; to me that what you are saying amounts to this:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; If it is the case that, per comp, it is the 'immaterial' activity of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; the running program, regardless of specific implementation,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Careful: the mind needs specific implementations, but below its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; substitution level, all implementations acts simultaneously, from its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; perspective (in case it decides to take a look below its level, he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; should see this).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Once the reversal is done the word &quot;physical&quot; is reduced to something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; very specific, which includes a (perhaps to high) first person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; indeterminacy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, I know, but at this point (i.e. before the reversal) I was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; referring to the fact that because a computation is deemed invariant
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the face of different valid implementations its implicit 'ontology'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is immaterial as contrasted with an assumption of a basically material
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ontology.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; implements the function and hence the mind, then this is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; indistinguishable by the machine from it simply *being* the function
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; and hence the mind.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The mind (the 1-mind, not the numbers) is distributed in the set of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; all computations, you cannot really attach it in any single
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; computation, unless you have reasons to think it is correlated to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; own histories. Remember that at UDA-8 we abandon the physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; supervenience for a comp supervenience, which is hard to describe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; without the minimum amount of math I was talking about.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I may insist that the 1-person, nor its consciousness, is never
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; attached to any thing which can be represented. Only its third person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; vehicles are, and the person can make relative and local bets on  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; vehices and their relative stabilities.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; This is recover and made consistent by the nuance between the prover
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Bp and the knower Bp &amp; p (and the feeler, Bp &amp; p &amp; Dt); which by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; construction are the same, yet they cannot know that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, forget 'mind', it's inessential to the argument here. How about:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If it is the case that, per comp, it is the 'immaterial' activity of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the running program, invariantly under different implementations,
</em><br />
<br />This is ambiguous. But frankly, I think I will be able to say much  
<br />
more when the seventh step will be completed.
<br />
The notion of implementation, like computation are typical  
<br />
mathematical notion, completely neutral about the existence of a  
<br />
physical world, or what what would be the ultimate implementation.  
<br />
Comp does not prevent relative implementations to play some key role,  
<br />
like when we share computational histories.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implements the function,
</em><br />
<br />&quot;we&quot; are more program or number than function, and our implementations  
<br />
count. Indeed, from the first person point of view, physical  
<br />
appearance is really a sum on all implementations.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; then this is indistinguishable by the machine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from it simply *being* the (equally immaterial) function.
</em><br />
<br />I can agree.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Standard
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comp is then seen to refute - or at least make irrelevant - its own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; basis in materiality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is this acceptable?
</em><br />
<br /><br />I would say it is much more than making the material basis irrelevant,  
<br />
it makes it deductible. It explains exactly how the physical laws  
<br />
emerge, and unlike physics, it explains exactly why it can hurt.
<br />
Matter remains relevant, but it is no more a primitive thing.
<br />
Comp gives a new physics. And this makes comp empirically testable.  
<br />
Just extract physics from comp, and compare to what we can observe. At  
<br />
first sight the comp physics seems to be completely exuberant, but  
<br />
computer science shows that its exuberance is already very quantum  
<br />
like. So it is too early to say if comp is refuted or not.
<br />
I provide a practical tool to measure our degree of non  
<br />
computationalism (but this statement is very weak, because, as I said,  
<br />
super-machines and other &quot;gods&quot; have the same physics. Only *very*  
<br />
near the ONE, physics begin to change, apparently.
