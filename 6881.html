<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;Sarfatti suggests some combination of Bohm's interpretation of QM (where

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;particles are guided by a 'pilot wave') with the idea of adding a

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;nonlinear term to the Schrodinger equation (contradicting the existing

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;'QM math', which is entirely linear), and he identifies the pilot wave

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;with &quot;the mind&quot; and has some hand-wavey notion that life involves some

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;kind of self-organizing feedback loop between the pilot wave and the

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;configuration of particles (normally Bohm's interpretation says the

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;configuration of particles has no effect on the pilot wave, but that's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;where the nonlinear term comes in I guess). Since Bohm's interpretation 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;is wholly deterministic, I'd think Sarfatti's altered version would be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;too, the nonlinear term shouldn't change this.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Seems to me you've described the &quot;qualia approach&quot; pretty well.
</em><br />
<br />But why do you call it that? It seems like it's just a philosophical add-on 
<br />
to interpret the pilot wave as &quot;mind&quot; and the particles guided by it as 
<br />
&quot;matter&quot;, even if Sarfatti's nonlinear QM theory were correct, and the idea 
<br />
that life depends on a self-organizing feedback loop between the pilot wave 
<br />
and particles could get beyond the pure hand-wavey stage (both of which seem 
<br />
very unlikely), there'd be no obligation to interpret the pilot wave in 
<br />
terms of mind/qualia.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;while on the other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;side we have those like Roger Penrose who (I think) take a mechanical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;view (microtubules in the brain harbor Bose-Einstein condensates.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;Penrose's proposal has nothing to do with consciousness collapsing the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;wavefunction, he just proposes that when a system in superposition 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;crosses a certain threshold of *mass* (probably the Planck mass), then it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;collapses automatically. The microtubule idea is more speculative, but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;he's just suggesting that the brain somehow takes advantage of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;not-yet-understood quantum gravity effects to go beyond what computers 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;can do, but the collapse of superposed states in the brain would still be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;gravitationally-induced.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Penrose has a *lot* of things to say about QM---and his new book has the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;best description of fibre bundles I've seen in quite a while---but no, I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;didn't mean to suggest his entire argument was based on BECs in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;microtubules.  I suggested Penrose because his approach seems diametrically 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;opposed to the qualia guys.
</em><br />
<br />But you brought him up in the context of the &quot;consciousness plays a critical 
<br />
role in understanding QM&quot; idea, when Penrose doesn't fall into this camp at 
<br />
all.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;   All this model-building (and discussion) is fine, of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;course, but there are a number of psychological experiments out there 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that consistently return counterintuitive and heretofore unexplainable 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;results.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Among them, is Helmut Schmidt's &quot;retro pk&quot; experiment which consistently 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;returns odd results.  The PEAR lab at Princeton has some startling 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;remote viewing&quot; results, and of course, there's Rupert Sheldrake's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;work.   As far as I know, Sheldrake is the only one who has tried to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;create a model (&quot;morphic resonance&quot;), and most QM folks typically avoid 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;discussing the experiments--except to deride them as nonscientific.  I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;think it may be time to revisit some of these &quot;ESP&quot; experiments to see 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;if the results are telling us something in terms of QM, i.e. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;decoherence.   Changing our assumptions about decoherence, then applying 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the model to those strange experiments may clarify things.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;RM
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;Here's a skeptical evaluation of some of the ESP experiments you mention:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040603153145/www.btinternet.com/~neuronaut/webtwo_features_psi_two.htm">http://web.archive.org/web/20040603153145/www.btinternet.com/~neuronaut/webtwo_features_psi_two.htm</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;Anyway, if it were possible for the mind to induce even a slight 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;statistical bias in the probability of a bit flipping 1 or 0, then simply 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;by picking a large enough number of trials it would be possible to very 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;reliably insure that the majority would be the number the person was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;focusing on. So by doing multiple sets with some sufficiently large 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;number N of trials in each set, it would be possible to actually send 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;something like a 10-digit bit string (for example, if the majority of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;digits in the first N trials came up 1, you'd have the first digit of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;your 10-digit string be a 1), something which would not require a lot of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;tricky statistical analysis to see was very unlikely to occur by chance. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;If the &quot;retro-PK&quot; effect you mentioned was real, this could even be used 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;to reliably send information into the past!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I spoke with Schmidt in '96.  He told me that it is very unlikely that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;causation can be reversed, but rather that the retropk results suggest many 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;worlds.
</em><br />
<br />But that is presumably just his personal intuition, not something that's 
<br />
based on any experimental data (like getting a message from a possible 
<br />
future or alternate world, for example).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;When these ESP researchers are able to do a straightforward demonstration 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;like this, that's when I'll start taking these claims seriously, until 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;then &quot;extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;The extraordinary claims---evidence rule is good practical guidance, but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;it's crummy science.  Why should new results require an astronomical Z 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;score, when &quot;proven&quot; results need only a Z of 1.96?  Think about the poor 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;fellow who discovered that ulcers were caused by helicobacter 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;pylori---took him ten years for &quot;science&quot; to take him seriously, and then 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;only after he drank a vial of h.pylori broth himself.   Then there's the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;fellow at U of I (Ames) who believed that Earth is being pummeled by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;snowballs--as big as houses--from space.  He was thoroughly derided (some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;demanded he be fired) for ten years or so---until a UV satellite saw the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;snowballs smack into the atmosphere.  And not too long ago, there was the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;cult of anthropologists that believed the New World was populated just 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;12,000 yrs ago (give or take a thousand or two)--even as the evidence 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;poured in refuting that view.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;On the other side, we have guys like Harvard Epidemiologist Ken Rothmann, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;who claims disease clusters are not worthy of study (Keynote address: CDC 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Cluster Buster&quot; conference Atlanta, 1989). There are other examples, but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;to insist on some ridiculously high standard of proof for &quot;new&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;results---extraordinary or otherwise, is merely being conservative to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;point of inertia.  In Jefferson's time, no reputable scientist believed 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;rocks fell from the sky---they would believe it (maybe) only when one 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;fell into their outstretched hand.  The odds against that happening by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;chance would involve a Z score of about 20 or so.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;Those who demand extraordinary evidence should have the courage of their 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;convictions---and announce their criteria for belief in terms of a Z 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;score---or probability.  For your convenience, here's a table (calculated 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;using Systat 10; n&gt;500).  If you want the entire table, you can find it

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />The issue is not the Z score in isolation, it's 1) whether we trust that the 
<br />
correct statistical analysis has been done on the data to obtain that Z 
<br />
score (whether reporting bias has been eliminated, for example)--that's why 
<br />
I suggested the test of trying to transmit a 10-digit number using ESP, 
<br />
which would be a lot more transparent--and 2) whether we trust that the 
<br />
possibility of cheating has been kept small enough, which as the article I 
<br />
linked to suggested, may not have been met in the PEAR results:
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />&quot;Suspicions have hardened as sceptics have looked more closely at the fine 
<br />
detail of Jahn's results. Attention has focused on the fact that one of the 
<br />
experimental subjects - believed actually to be a member of the PEAR lab 
<br />
staff - is almost single-handedly responsible for the significant results of 
<br />
the studies. It was noted as long ago as 1985, in a report to the US Army by 
<br />
a fellow parapsychologist, John Palmer of Durham University, North Carolina, 
<br />
that one subject - known as operator 10 - was by far the best performer. 
<br />
This trend has continued. On the most recently available figures, operator 
<br />
10 has been involved in 15 percent of the 14 million trials yet contributed 
<br />
a full half of the total excess hits. If this person's figures are taken out 
<br />
of the data pool, scoring in the &quot;low intention&quot; condition falls to chance 
<br />
while &quot;high intention&quot; scoring drops close to the .05 boundary considered 
<br />
weakly significant in scientific results.
<br />
<br />&quot;Sceptics like James Alcock and Ray Hyman say naturally it is a serious 
<br />
concern that PEAR lab staff have been acting as guinea pigs in their own 
<br />
experiments. But it becomes positively alarming if one of the staff - with 
<br />
intimate knowledge of the data recording and processing procedures - is 
<br />
getting most of the hits.
<br />
<br />&quot;Adding fuel to the controversy, sceptics have pointed to the strange 
<br />
behaviour of the baseline condition results. Theoretically, the baseline 
<br />
condition should show the same gently wandering pattern as the calibration 
<br />
trials with occasional excursions into areas of apparent significance. Given 
<br />
the number of baseline trial that have been run, the scoring should have 
<br />
broken through this statistical envelope at least half a dozen times by now. 
<br />
Instead, the baseline result has stuck unnaturally close to a zero deviation 
<br />
from chance.
<br />
<br />&quot;In noting these results, Jahn himself has remarked that what makes the 
<br />
situation even odder is that when the baseline statistics and the high and 
<br />
low scores are all added together, the abnormally wide variance of one 
<br />
nicely cancels out the abnormally narrow variance of the other to create a 
<br />
well-behaved Gaussian distribution. It is almost as if the extra hits found 
<br />
in the high and low scores had been taken from what would otherwise have 
<br />
been outliers of the baseline condition.
<br />
<br />&quot;Alcock says this is exactly the sort of pattern that might be expected if 
<br />
some sort of data sorting had been going on. If just a handful of extreme 
<br />
baseline trials had been wrongly identified as high or low trials - or, 
<br />
alternatively, a few middling high and low trials had been reassigned to the 
<br />
baseline pool - then it would be easy to create an apparently significant 
<br />
result. Given an effect size of just one in a thousand, it would not take 
<br />
many such swaps to distort Jahn's results. &quot;
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />Of course, both these concerns would be present in any statistical test, 
<br />
even one involving something like the causes of ulcers like in the quote you 
<br />
posted above, but here I would use a Bayesian approach and say that we 
<br />
should start out with some set of prior probabilities, then update them 
<br />
based on the data. Let's say that in both the tests for ulcer causes and the 
<br />
tests for ESP our estimate of the prior probability for either flawed 
<br />
statistical analysis or cheating on the part of the experimenters is about 
<br />
the same. But based on what we currently know about the way the world works, 
<br />
I'd say the prior probability of ESP existing should be far, far lower than 
<br />
the prior probability that ulcers are caused by bacteria. It would be 
<br />
extremely difficult to integrate ESP into what we currently know about the 
<br />
laws of physics and neurobiology. If someone can propose a reasonable theory 
<br />
of how it could work without throwing everything else we know out the 
<br />
window, then that could cause us to revise these priors and see ESP as less 
<br />
of an &quot;extraordinary claim&quot;, but I don't know of any good proposals 
<br />
(Sarfatti's seems totally vague on the precise nature of the feedback loop 
<br />
between the pilot wave and particles, for example, and on how this would 
<br />
relate to ESP phenomena...if he could provide a mathematical model or 
<br />
simulation showing how a simple brain-like system could influence the 
<br />
outcome of random quantum events in the context of his theory, then it'd be 
<br />
a different story).
