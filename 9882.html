<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definite prediction.
</em><br />
<br />IOW, if MMW heories worked, MMW theories would work.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Classical physicists din't WANT to make the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;implications that atoms are unstable and will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;implode; nonetheless, classical phsyics makes that

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;assumption.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, that is a definite prediction of classical mechanics, and therefore has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nothing to do with examples of theories that cannot make definite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; predictions about certain questions in the first place. A more analogous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; case would be the fact that string theory cannot at present predict the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; value of the cosmological constant; would you therefore conclude that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;string theory predicts all values of the cosmological constant are equally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; likely&quot;?
</em><br />
<br />That isnot really analogous becasue the CC can only have one
<br />
value at a time.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;Platonists about mathematical objects claim that the theorems of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;mathematical theories - sentences like '3 is prime' (a theorem of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;arithmetic) and 'There are infinitely many transfinite cardinal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;numbers' (a theorem of set theory) - are literally true and that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the only plausible view of such sentences is that they are ABOUT
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;ABSTRACT OBJECTS &quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(emphasis added)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What do the words &quot;abstract object&quot; mean to you? To me, if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;propositions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about numbers have a truth independent of human minds or beliefs,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;that's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; equivalent to saying they are true statements about abstract
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;objects--how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could a statement be objectively true yet not be about anything?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;By having sense but no reference, for instance.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_and_reference">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_and_reference</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; The sense/reference distinction is about the possibility of our having
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; multiple mentally distinct terms which map to the same real-world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; object...but what would &quot;sense but no reference&quot; mean?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;We can make &quot;sense&quot; of &quot;unicorns have horns&quot;, despite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;the lack of reference.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In this case I would say the reference would be to a certain concept which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; humans have collectively defined;
</em><br />
<br />No, that's the sense. Sense is in-hte-head , reference
<br />
is out-of-the-head.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is no way you could have a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mind-independent truth about whether unicorns have horns that's separate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from what people collectively believe about unicorns.
</em><br />
<br />The unicorn example is an example of sense without
<br />
reference. It is not an example of mind-indepnednet truth.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Senses are logically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;interelated in a way that allows us to confirm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;the truth-values of *some* sentences
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;without seaking theri references. Those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;kind of sentences are called apriopri, and it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;is almost universally held that mathematical sentences
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;are apriori.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Holding that they are a priori is not the same as holding that they lack
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; references; platonists would presumably agree they're a priori.
</em><br />
<br />Analycity explains apriority, and sense explains analycity.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; I don't see how there can be an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; objective, mind-independent truth about a term that doesn't refer to any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; coherent object or possibility.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;I am not asking you to. There are coherent possibilities that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;are not instantiated (or perphaps
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;I should say, pace many-worlders, not obviously instantiated).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Nonetheless, we can address many issues about these possibilites
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;without peaking into the universe next door. Many-world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;metaphysics is not needed to explain how abstrract reasoning
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;is possible.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree, and even a &quot;modal realist&quot; philosopher like David Lewis (see
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lewis_(philosopher">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lewis_(philosopher</a>) ), who thinks that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; propositions about possibilities can only be objectively true or false if we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assume all possible worlds actually exist, would not say that there is any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; kind of causal interaction between worlds needed to explain our ability to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reason about them.
</em><br />
<br />If we can reason about (for instance)
<br />
historical what-is without concrete ferefernces is parallel
<br />
dimensions, we can reason about maths without taking
<br />
a trip to Plato's heaven.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;  Can you think of any statements outside of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; math or logic that you would say have &quot;sense but no reference&quot; but also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; a mind-independent truth value?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;What difference does it make ? The topic is maths.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The question was to try to help me grasp what you meant by &quot;sense without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reference&quot; and &quot;mind-independent&quot;. If it's impossible to come up with any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; examples outside of math, that should make you suspicious whether
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematics really has the strange and marvellous property of there being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; objective mind-independent truths about mathematical terms even though they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lack any reference.
</em><br />
<br />No it shoudn't. Maths is obviously unique in a number of respects.
<br />
That is why there is such a subject as philosophy-of-mathematics.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  If you really believe this, you should at least be able
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to give an argument about *why* math is different from every other domain in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this respect.
</em><br />
<br /><br />It is on a deeper level of abstraction.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;The case for mathematical Platonism needs to be made in the first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;place; if numbers do not exist at all, the universe, as an existing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;thing, cannot be a mathematical structure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Again, what does &quot;exist&quot; mean for you?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Capable of interacting casually with me,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, I don't think the world obeys mathematical laws because it is causally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interacting with platonic forms, any more than I think the world obeys the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; law of noncontradiction because it is causally interacting with platonic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; laws of logic. I would say ontology is about the most exhaustive possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; list of objective truths, and any entity referred to in this exhaustive list
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of objectively true statements &quot;exists&quot; by definition.
</em><br />
<br />If you are going to claim we are already inside Plato's
<br />
heaven, as many on the list do, you are laready dealing
<br />
with a stronger definition of ontology than that,
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; With something like a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unicorn, once you have all true statements about peoples' *concepts* of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unicorns, you won't have any additional statements about what unicorns are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;really&quot; like; but with mathematics I think there can be statements that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would be true even if no human had thought about them, or if they had
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thought about them but concluded they were false due to some mental error.
</em><br />
<br />Yes. Mathematics is constrained by rigourous internal logic. Science
<br />
is constrained by observation. Fairy-tales aren't constrained by
<br />
anything.
<br />
They all work in quite different ways.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Incidentally, does your definition of &quot;exists&quot; mean that you don't think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anything exists beyond the boundaries of the observable universe
</em><br />
<br />That depends on what the &quot;able&quot; means in &quot;observable&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Tend to&quot;, although occasionally they can make mistakes. For the answer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; be really objective, you need to refer to some sort of ideal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;mathematician
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; or computer following certain rules, but that is just another form of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Platonism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Not really. You can understand how an ideal system
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;would behave by projecting from non-ideal ones. You
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;don't need an actual example of one.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Do you think there is any sense in which your projection could be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; objectively wrong, even if you believe it is correct?
</em><br />
<br />It could be wrong. So it doesn't necessarily
<br />
deliver objectivity, Hiwever it allows us to understand
<br />
what objectivity is.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;It certainly *could* be, at least. Platonism is *not* the only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;philosophy of mathematics!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; I think it's the only philosophy of mathematics that says that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; statements have a *mind-independent* truth-value, though.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Nope.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK, can you describe another?
</em><br />
<br />Formalism is a bit iffy. Apart from that, they all do.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  What I'm saying is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that it's necessarily ontological, as are any claims about the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;objective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (mind-independent) truth-value of a given proposition.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;So you are claiming that mathematical Platonism is not merely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;true but *necessarily* true ? That is quite a claim!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; No, you misunderstood. I'm saying that *if* you believe that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; statements have a mind-independent truth-value, that is necessarily is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; equivalent to what I understand &quot;mathematical Platonism&quot; to mean.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Then you are wrong. MP is an ontological thesis.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You are still misunderstanding, of course MP is an ontological thesis, where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do you think I was arguing otherwise? What I'm saying is that any statement
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the form &quot;there is a mind-independent truth about X&quot; is an ontological
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; statement, by necessity.
</em><br />
<br />It is obviously epistemoligcal, It deals with truth, not being.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  It is not a &quot;necessity&quot; to believe that statements
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about math are ontological ones, though, because you are free to deny that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is any mind-independent truth about them (in which case you are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; obviously not a mathematical platonist).
</em><br />
<br />I believe there is mind-independent truth about them AND deny they are
<br />
ontological
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But your claim that &quot;the truth
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; value of '17 is prime' is mind-independent&quot; is a &quot;purely epistemological&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; claim is what I'm disagreeing with, because again, any statement about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mind-independent truths is an ontological statement as I understand
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ontology.
</em><br />
<br />How can it be ontological when it says nothing about being, existence,
<br />
etc ?
<br />
<br />Bearing in mind that *my* definition of existence entails the
<br />
possibility
<br />
of causal interaction...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;  Of course,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; you may not in fact believe that mathematical statements have any such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; mind-independent truth-value.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;As I ahve stated, everybody believes that. You are talking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;as though it were an obvious fact that ontolical realsim
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;is the only explanation for epistemological objectivity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, but that's because my notion of &quot;existence&quot; is simply a shorthand for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an element of reality about which there exist objective truths.
</em><br />
<br />Oh come on, that's like defining God as a necessarily
<br />
existing being. You need to *show* that truth
<br />
implies existence, not just assert it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; debate is just a disagreement about word-definitions, but I suspect that any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other notion of existence would either be too poorly defined to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaningful, or would lead to bizarre conclusions like the notion that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nothing exists beyond the boundaries of the observable universe (or beyond
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your own past light cone).
</em><br />
<br />It is very much a disagreement about word-definitions.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But that would make &quot;existence&quot; local too, rather than objective. My light
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cones are different from yours, so if you want to say that the past is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;real&quot; in a sense that the future is not, that would make the reality of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; events different for each observer.
</em><br />
<br />Not if ptoetnial causal interaction is allowed to run in both
<br />
directions. There
<br />
is chain of ackward causes linking me to the BB; running forward again,
<br />
another chain connects to events outside my light-cone.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;<a href="http://www.geocities.com/peterdjones/met_time2.html">http://www.geocities.com/peterdjones/met_time2.html</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; His argument simply assumes that a moment can &quot;become existent&quot;, without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; addressing this question of whether we need a second time dimension to make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense of this
</em><br />
<br />We don't, since nothing changes once it has come into existence.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; . And as he admits, he is &quot;assuming that such a thing as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; becoming is possible without describing or explaining it&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />It is philoosphically respectable to regard tiem as fundamental.
<br />
something has to be fundamental.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Mathematical Platonism also doesn't (obviously) have the resources
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;to keep &quot;worlds&quot; separate.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sure it does. Different Turing machine programs are mathematical objects,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no?
</em><br />
<br />Different substrings within TM programmes can be identical, no ?
<br />
<br />Bearing in mind that the physical  universe provides us with a
<br />
mechanism --
<br />
spatio-temporal location -- which allows identical things to be kept
<br />
separate,
<br />
and which doesn't exit in Platonia.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  If you run a particular Turing machine program which contains
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intelligent beings, will they somehow have psychic knowledge of what's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happening in other distinct programs? Obviously not, we could run the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; program on a real computer
</em><br />
<br />uh-uh! Real programmes are run at distinct spatio-temporal
<br />
locations. They don't exist in Platonia.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  and see that the beings have no such mysterious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; knowledge, and barring errors the ideal &quot;Platonic&quot; program should have the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; same output as the 'physical' instantiation
</em><br />
<br />That is beside the point. The question is
<br />
waht it woould feel like to be in the programme.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; ('physical' from the perspective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the most fundamental laws of our universe, which could itself be a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; program running in a bigger universe or in 'Platonia').
</em><br />
<br />The laws of physics, then, are &quot;in&quot; the programme -- not vice--versa.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; No multiverse theory predicts that observers should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; have an omniscient view of all universes, they only see the one they are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; living in.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;All mathematical multiverse theories have the implication that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;I have many identical counterparts.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Identical&quot; only to the extent they are experiencing the exact same things
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you are.
</em><br />
<br />Nope. Also identical in that they share all my memories up
<br />
until time T , when things turn Harry Potter.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; There's no reason to think that counterparts basically similar to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you but having different experiences (say, of a hippogriff flying through
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the window) would have some sort of psychic knowledge of each other.
</em><br />
<br />They would share my memories, identify themselves as me,
<br />
and so on. There would be counterparts which have my memories
<br />
up to time T, then an outpurst of HP, then normal memories from time
<br />
T+1 onwards.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; I have my doubts that philosophers of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; mathematics would see the categories described here as mutually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;exclusive.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; For example, a formalist, to the extent he believes there is an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;objective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; truth about whether certain statements are derivable from a set of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;axioms
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; and rules of inference, is just a species of platonist as I would define
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;it;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;which is not how eeverybody else defines it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If not, then perhaps that's just because they don't in fact think that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;formalism&quot; means believing there's an objective truth about whether a given
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; statement is derivable from a given set of axioms.
</em><br />
<br />It's because they do think Platonism means numbers exist in some sense.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you are claiming that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;everybody&quot; does think that formalists believe this, yet they are still not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; considered &quot;Platonists&quot; in any way, I'd like to see some evidence for this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; claim.
</em><br />
<br />Formalism is alaways cited as a different position to Platonism
<br />
<br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mathematics">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mathematics</a>
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;But if any non-Platonic hteory is correct, truths do not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;need to refer.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Can you provide a quote or citation for the idea that any philosophers of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; math subscribe to a view where there are objective truths about mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; objects yet the statements do not refer?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />&quot;Logicism is the thesis that mathematics is reducible to logic, and
<br />
hence nothing but a part of logic (Carnap 1931/1883, 41). Logicists
<br />
hold that mathematics can be known a priori, but suggest that our
<br />
knowledge of mathematics is just part of our knowledge of logic in
<br />
general, and is thus analytic, not requiring any special faculty of
<br />
mathematical intuition&quot;
<br />
<br /><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mathematics">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mathematics</a>
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;The idea that mathematical truths cannot have been different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;can be supporte without any appeal to ontology.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Again, not if you define existence and ontology in the way I am doing, and I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have serious doubts that there is another way to define these terms in a way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that is coherent and which does not lead to a kind of ontological relativism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where what is &quot;objectively true&quot; can differ for different observers.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You are just building your conckusion into your definitions.
