<br />
<br />DN: It's interesting that you should perceive it in this way: I hadn't
<br />
thought about it like this, but I suspect you're not wrong.  I haven't
<br />
consumed very much of your 'diet', and I have indeed read quite a lot of
<br />
stuff in the style you refer to, although I often find it rather
<br />
indigestible!  But on the other hand, much of my professional experience has
<br />
been in the world of computer programming, right back to machine code days,
<br />
so I'm very aware of the difference between 'syntax' and 'semantics', and I
<br />
know too well how consequences can diverge wildly from a difference of a
<br />
single bit.  How often have I heard the beleaguered self-tester wail &quot;I
<br />
didn't *mean* that!&quot;
<br />
<br />So - to me - my process is a bit like: define a 'procedural language'; use
<br />
this to 'code' some 'problem'; 'run' it to see what happens; then 'debug'
<br />
and repeat.  This is no doubt excruciating for anyone else to follow, and my
<br />
attempts to 'comment' the code don't always help. Now that I'm re-reading
<br />
TON, it seems to me that I've been trying to re-interpret bits of it in this
<br />
way (in an attempt to reconcile what you and Colin were disputing) but only
<br />
succeeded in muddying the waters further, probably for the reasons you
<br />
suggest.
<br />
<br />However, in the spirit of the original topic of the thread, I would prefer
<br />
to ask you directly about the plausibility (which, unless I've
<br />
misunderstood, you support?) of an AI-program being in principle
<br />
'conscious'.  I take this to entail that instantiating such a program
<br />
thereby implements an 'observer' that can respond to and share a reality, in
<br />
broadly the same terms, with human 'observers'.  (I apologise in advance if
<br />
any paraphrase or short-hand I adopt misrepresents what you say in TON):
<br />
<br />TON, as you comment in the book, takes the 'idealist' stance that 'concrete'
<br />
notions emerge from observation.  Our own relative status as observers
<br />
participating in 'worlds' is then dependent on computational 'emergence'
<br />
from the plenitude of all possible bit-strings.  Let's say that I'm such an
<br />
observer and I observe a 'computer' like the one I'm using now.  The
<br />
'computer' is a 3-person 'concrete emergent' in my 1-person world, and that
<br />
of the 'plurality' of observers with whom I'm in relation: we can 'interact'
<br />
with it. Now, we collectively *impute* that some aspect of its 3-person
<br />
behaviour (e.g. EM phenomena in its internal circuitry) is to be regarded as
<br />
'running an AI program' (i.e. ISTM that this is what happens when we
<br />
'compile and run' a program).  In what way does such imputation entail the
<br />
evocation - despite the myriad possible 'concrete' instantiations that might
<br />
represent it - of a *stable* observer capable of participating in our shared
<br />
'1-person plural' context?  IOW, I'm concerned that two different categories
<br />
are being conflated here: the 'world' at the 'observer level' that includes
<br />
me and the computer, and the 'world' of the program, which is 'nested'
<br />
inside this.  How can this 'nested' world get any purchase on 'observables'
<br />
that are 'external' to it?
<br />
<br />As I re-read this question, I wonder whether I've already willy-nilly fallen
<br />
into the '2-cultures' gap again.  But what I've asked seems to be directly
<br />
related to the issues raised by 'Olympia and Klara', and by the substitution
<br />
level dilemma posed by 'yes doctor'.  Could you show me where - or if - I go
<br />
wrong, or does the 'language game' make our views forever mutually
<br />
unintelligible?

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This may be a nub of disagreement.  I'd be interested if you could

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; clarify.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; My characterisation of a narrative as '3-person' is when (ISTM) that

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it's an
</em><br />

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'participative'.  Do you disagree with this?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; By contrast, I've been struggling recently with language that engages
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; directly with 'participation'.  But this leads to your next point.....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Terminology is about describing communicable notions. As such, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only things words can ever describe are 1st person plural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things. Since you are familiar with my book, you can look up the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distinction between 1st person (singular), 1st person plural and 3rd
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person, but these concepts have often been discussed on this list. I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can use the term &quot;Green&quot; for instance, in a sentence to you, and we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can be sure of its meaning when referring to shared experience of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; phenomena, however I can never communicate to you how green appears to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; me, so that you can compare it with your green qualia.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; RS:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Terms
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; should have accepted meaning, unless we agree on a different meaning
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; for the purposes of discussion.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; DN:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But where there is no generally accepted meaning, or a disputed one, how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; we then proceed?  Hence my attempts at definition (which I hate BTW),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; which you find to be gibberish.  Is there a way out of this?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This sometimes happens. We can point to examples of what the word
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; means, and see if we agree on those. There are bound to be borderline
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cases where we disagree, but these are often unimportant unless we are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; searching for a definition.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; BTW, when I read 'Theory of Nothing', which I find very cogent, ISTM
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; virtually its entire focus is on aspects of a 'participatory'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; approach.  So
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I'm more puzzled than ever why we're in disagreement.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You are correct that it is 'particpatory', at least in the sense John
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Wheeler uses it. I don't think I ever really found myself in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; disagreement with you. Rather, what is happening is symptomatic of us

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rubbish or nonsense, just unintelligible.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I had my first experience of the modern academic humanities just two
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; years ago, and it was quite a shock. I attended a conference entitled
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;The two cultures: Reconsidering the division between the Sciences and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Humanities&quot;. I was invited to speak as one of the scientific
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; representatives, and basically spoke about the core thesis of my book,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which seemed appropriate. I kept the language simple and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interdisciplinary, used lots of pictures to illustrate the concepts,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and I'm sure had a reasonable connect with the audience. All of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other scientists did the same. They all knew better than to fall back
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; into jargon and dense forests of mathematical formulae (I have suffered
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; enough of those types of seminars, to be sure).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; By contrast, the speakers from the humanities all read their papers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; word-for-word. There were no illustrations to help one follow the gist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the arguments. The sentences were long-winded, and attempted to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cover every nuance possible. A style I'm sure you're very familiar
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with. I tried to ask a few questions of the speakers at the end, not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so as to appear smart or anything, but just to try to clarify some of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the few points I thought I might have understood. The responses from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the speakers, however, was in the same long-winded, heavily nuanced
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sentences.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The one thing I drew from this conference was that the divide between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Snow's two cultures is alive and well, and vaster than I ever imagined.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I've really been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; trying to say that points-of-view (or 'worlds') emerge from *structure*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; defined somehow, and that (tautologically, surely) the 'primitives' of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; structure (in whatever theoretical terms we choose) must be capable of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'animating' such povs or worlds.  IOW povs are always 'takes' on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whole
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; situation, not inherent in individuated 'things'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To say that a &quot;point of view&quot; (which I would translate as &quot;observer&quot;)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emerges from the worlds structure, is another way of saying that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer must supervene on observed physical structures. And I agree
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with you, basically because of the &quot;Occam catastrophe&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem. However, how or why this emergence happens is rather
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mysterious.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think is has something to do with self-awareness, without a self
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existing with the observed physical world, one cannot be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-aware. The corrolary of this is that self-awareness must be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessary for consciousness. Note this doesn't mean that you have to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be self-aware every second you are awake, but you have to be capable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of introspection.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; DN:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I certainly didn't mean to imply this!  I just meant that we seemed to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; counterposing 'abstracted' and 'participative' accounts, in the sense I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; indicate above.  Something would really help me at this point: could I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ask
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; how would you relate 'physical' levels of description you've used (e.g.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'oxygen and hydrogen atoms')  to the 'participative' approach of 'TON'?
</em><br />
