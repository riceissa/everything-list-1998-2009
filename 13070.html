Sorry, Danny, for my convoluted style. Also, for having missed you
<br />
'original' explanation of (your) God. I try to concentrate on SOME of the
<br />
texts, it is getting too much indeed, to memorize week long postings of
<br />
many.contributors..

----------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;I disagree and think you misunderstood the point of my original post.  I
</em><br />
don't really have time to get into it in detail now, but I was really trying
<br />
to get outside of any faith-based aspect of the question.  Perhaps the word
<br />
God should not be used.  The question I guess boiled down to its essence is
<br />
can you have an ensemble theory of any kind (everything exists) that does
<br />
not end up having intelligence playing an &quot;interesting&quot; role in the process.
<br />
&nbsp;For future reference, when I refer to &quot;God&quot; in a post I will not be
<br />
referring to anything relating to personal relationships (in the general
<br />
understood sense that I think you meant) or hallucinations, but will be
<br />
referring very specifically to an entity capable of emulating or creating in
<br />
one manner or another the &quot;universe&quot; we observe, either from a 3rd person
<br />
viewpoint or from the 1st person viewpoint.  The question is can you have
<br />
ensemble theories without having these entities, and if so, what assumptions
<br />
do you have to make about our underlying reality (or the ensemble theory) to
<br />
avoid them.
<br />
<br />I don't see those types of questions as being exclusive of some type of
<br />
tentative scientific scrutiny, but I guess you do or perhaps you thought I
<br />
meant something else when I said &quot;God&quot; (despite my defining the term in the
<br />
original post).
<br />
<br />It may be that I just totally don't understand you John.  To be honest I
<br />
more than occasionally have a difficult time understanding what you are
<br />
conveying in your posts.
<br />
<br />Danny
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------
<br />
<br />&quot;GOD&quot; is a historically overloaded word. Connotations are hard to eliminate.
<br />
I cannot 'free' the word from a smell of the burnt flesh of &quot;witches&quot;, or
<br />
the thousands of cadavers around Darfur, etc. -  all in that 'name'. Is
<br />
there a chance to invent a different group of letters for a different
<br />
connotation? If we learn your identification, we can learn the word for it
<br />
as well.
<br />
<br />The 'faith-based' aspect is not a privilege of 'godly' connotations. it is
<br />
also part of our mindset, although it irritates some if I assign it to
<br />
'science' as well.
<br />
<br />(Here comes the question &quot;WHAT science&quot;? Well: THEIRS. - 'Yours ad 'ours' is
<br />
free, clean cut and objective.
<br />
<br />I let it go now HOW do we &quot;observe the universe?&quot; and 'what' is 'underlying'
<br />
our image of it?
<br />
<br />Please, let me go free from my mistake to speak into the 'godly' topic what
<br />
I try to avoid most of the time. I used to be an altar-boy. (Was not
<br />
abused).
<br />
<br />Best regards
<br />
<br />John
