<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Indeed the link with quantum suicide and comp suicide are in my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; older paper &quot;Informatique théorique et philosophie de l'esprit,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Toulouse 1988&quot;. Also explained in my 1991 paper &quot;Mechanism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and personal identity&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So you say that that is your key paper to the quantum suicide ! So
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I will spend more time on that one. But I see that you claim a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Strong Mechanistic&quot; viewpoint. I take it from that and your other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comments that we therefore have to accept 'strong mechanism'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; through the series of papers. If it does not we probably need to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; know at this point.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />What I called &quot;strong mechanism&quot; in &quot;mechanism and personal identity&quot; 
<br />
is what I call &quot;computationalism&quot; today, or just comp. I have no idea 
<br />
if comp is true or false, but it is my working hypothesis. the 
<br />
advantage of that hypothesis is that we can reason about it and even be 
<br />
led to testable consequences.
<br />
<br />To repeat: comp is a digital form of Descartes-La Mettrie mechanist 
<br />
thesis. It is the  idea that we are &quot;machine&quot;, or more precisely that 
<br />
we would not been able to be aware of a substitution of our 
<br />
body/environment/universe in the case of a digitalizable subtitution 
<br />
done at some right level of substitution.
<br />
That hypothesis is far stronger than the &quot;strong AI&quot; thesis, which only 
<br />
presuppose that some machine can think (but not that &quot;we&quot; are machine ; 
<br />
although with OCCAM we could say that the truth of Strong AI would make 
<br />
plausible comp. Now comp itself is far weaker than the &quot;functionalist 
<br />
hyp&quot; in the cognitive science. This is because all functionalist 
<br />
presuppose some high level of substitution. Comp does not put any bound 
<br />
on the level, and that nuance changes many things.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To me, that is not an unreasonable point of view as physics is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very mechanical or mathematical subject.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Now a key point is that I don't make any physical assumption in my 
<br />
work. Moreover, the result is that, once we assume the comp hyp, 
<br />
physics can no more be the fundamental science. Physics is *entirely* 
<br />
reduced to a &quot;measure calculus&quot; pertaining only on mathematical objects 
<br />
of the type &quot;computational histories&quot; aka observer-moments.
<br />
<br />The Universal Dovetailer Argument (UDA) *is* the proof that physics is 
<br />
reducible to computer science. The proof is informal, non mathematical, 
<br />
yet complete in itself.
<br />
<br />Then I translate the argument in the language of a &quot;sufficiently rich 
<br />
proving machine&quot;, which I am used to call just &quot;lobian machine&quot; in 
<br />
honor of Lob. This is not done to add rigor to the UDA, it is done to 
<br />
make the proof constructive and to show exactly why and how the laws of 
<br />
physics emerge. At the place where the UDA predict I should find the 
<br />
logic of the physical propositions,  I got indeed sort of quantum 
<br />
logics, and I take this as a confirmation (not a proof) of comp. The 
<br />
results has recently been generalized for large portion of non-comp!
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But it does rather make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the presupposition that physics and all its applications are to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; grounded in old quasirationalist values.
</em><br />
<br />This is debatable. To put it roughly, I show that if comp is true, then 
<br />
we must backtrack 2300 years of Aristotelian Naturalism. In short Plato 
<br />
is correct and Aristotle is wrong, as far as we look on their 
<br />
conception of reality.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; That does not allow much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; space for epiphenomenalism even, let alone dualism if we need
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to use 'isms'. I am not bothered about a humanism aspect, it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more the logical and philosophical aspect
</em><br />
<br /><br />Epiphenomenalism and dulaism supposes two kind of reality. My approach 
<br />
is monist, but of the immaterialist kind. Space, time, matter, energy, 
<br />
etc. all emerge from relation between natural numbers as seen from 
<br />
varieties of machine points of view. (Even non-lobian machines, but the 
<br />
lobian one are the one which can effectively derive physics from the 
<br />
computer science, mainly from self-reference.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  1-death and 1-loss-of-consciousness have no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; meaning, I would say, although lack of coffee in the morning can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; create some trouble which we could easily confuse with some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; first person paradoxical apprehension of its own lack of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; consciousness, like a zombies complaining nobody want to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; believe they are zombies!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So you seem not to mind if people are zombies (in the sense of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Chalmers).
</em><br />
<br /><br />You mean that I *do* mind that some people could zombie. (Or I don't 
<br />
understand your inference).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 3-death and 3-loss of consciousness are alike, except we can have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; more hope in the latter.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Interesting. So 'hope' will somehow ultimately arise as a parameter in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the system or is it somehow disgarded as a relatively worthless
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; semantic concept, which I am sure is logically possible in such a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scheme.
</em><br />
<br /><br />&quot;Hope&quot; is very near the idea of betting on some realities. In that 
<br />
sense &quot;hope&quot; will not arise ultimately because it is atemporally there, 
<br />
in the consistent dreams' machines, and the physical world will emerge 
<br />
from it. I have already explained but I can do it again, but then I 
<br />
must explain more the modal logic and Solovay etc.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I begin to see &quot;the baby being thrown out with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bathwater&quot; in 'strict mechanism'.
</em><br />
<br /><br />If the baby is any &quot;primitive physicalness&quot; then you got it right. My 
<br />
point is really that physics is a branch of computer science, or even 
<br />
just number theory.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So we end up with 'no zombies' and 'no hope'.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I guess I have been unclear. I do believe comp coherent with some form 
<br />
of zombie but It is hard to explain what they are alike before you get 
<br />
the point that it is not the brain which generates consciousness, but 
<br />
the contrary.
<br />
Also for &quot;no hope&quot;. I would say the contrary: hope everywhere (but then 
<br />
despair is also possible everywhere ... when the hopes are not 
<br />
fulfilled.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Or possibly still 'we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't know'. Modern computer science is full of 'parameters
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which we will eventually sort out' but have not done in 100 years.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You are a bit quick here.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However the point here is that consciousness and related phenomena are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not easily categorised in your system. There are so many ways that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; individual consciousness can be eliminated or partly eliminated from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the system , by quantum suicide or otherwise.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I don't understand. In what sense does quantum suicide eliminate 
<br />
individual consciousness? I thought the point is that it does not.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It seems a very great weakeness to me that a simple statement like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  1-death and 1-loss-of-consciousness have no meaning, I would say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has to be made. There are so many intermediary conditions between life
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and death  that exist or are manmade.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes, but you need to be conscious of them in some way to talk about, 
<br />
and in that case they cannot be 1-death or 1-loss-of-consciousness (by 
<br />
definition!).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I mentioned two of them. Jail
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; imprisonment and hypnagogic myoclonus. Another could be simple
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dreaming. All these are different in your 3-system to what they would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be in a 1-system. This make your 3-system (if I can call it that) more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; immediately manageable but much less descriptive. SO MAYBE
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; YOUR 3-SYSTEM IS SOME MANY-ONE MAPPING FROM A
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;REAL&quot; SYSTEM !!!? (Maybe that can be stated in category theory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; terms).
</em><br />
<br />?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One problem with 'strong mechanism' is that it only allows
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 20th Century computer level explication of the human mind at this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I take the discovery of the Universal Machine by Babbage, Post, Turing, 
<br />
Markov and others as one of the big discoveries of all time. Of course 
<br />
there is a local sense in saying that &quot;nature&quot; (in which I don't 
<br />
believe in once comp is assumed though) has discover it many many many 
<br />
times, from the electron path, to the cells, to the brain, to the 
<br />
human, ...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is like assuming that the sun goes around the earth.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The fact that Occam's razor must be watched for in other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interpretations, does not prove their lack of validity, rather
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the converse.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Could you tell me what is a myoclonus?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; From <a href="http://ruv.net/infopedia/my/Myclonic_jerk.html">http://ruv.net/infopedia/my/Myclonic_jerk.html</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;A myclonic twitch or hypnagogic myoclonus consists of one or more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sudden full-body twitches, and often preceded by a sensation of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; falling. The twitches occur during very light sleep as the conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain relinquishes control of the body's motor functions. While not a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cause for medical concern, these twitches can be startling. The cause
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of myclonic twitching is unknown: they appear to be associated with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (a) anxiety and (b) faint stimulus.&quot;
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Ah! Thanks.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is a lot more that can be written on the topic. Some claim a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; similar effect occurs with 'lucid dreaming' as well.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Note that &quot;Conscience et Mécanisme&quot; contains a full chapter on lucid 
<br />
dreaming. But in the more recent work I have substituted it for the use 
<br />
of video (a-la &quot;matrix&quot;) in the reasoning because the notion of lucid 
<br />
dreaming is not yet well understood by the average scientists. And this 
<br />
despite lucid dreaming has been clarified and confirmed experimentally 
<br />
by the famous (independent) experiments of Hearne and LaBerge.
<br />
<br />To sum the key point: comp leads toward immaterialism.
<br />
And this should not be confused with solipsism. the comp immaterialism 
<br />
is of the form of objective idealism (like Pythagorism for example). 
<br />
Poetically: matter and time emerges from coherence conditions existing 
<br />
for large class of machine's possible &quot;dreams&quot;. A dream being 
<br />
essentially a computation viewed from some 1-person point of view.
