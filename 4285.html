<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From Osher Doctorow osher.domain.name.hidden, Tues. Dec. 3, 2002 1601
</em><br />
<br />Tim,
<br />
<br />I quote first your comment early in your posting on my RET theory.
<br />
<br />[TIM]
<br />
I don't think the world's nonacceptance of &quot;RET&quot; means it is on par
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with category theory, just because some here don't think much of it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />[OSHER]
<br />
Next, I quote your own apparent sensitivity to your belief that somebody
<br />
might be attacking you, from later in the same posting.
<br />
<br />[TIM] On your second point, about &quot;how are you at depth?&quot;, I hope this
<br />
wasn't
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a cheap shot. Assuming it wasn't, I dig in to the areas that interest
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; me....
</em><br />
<br />[OSHER] What in the world are you talking about - what does depth have to do
<br />
with a cheap shot [question mark - my question-mark key is out].  And what
<br />
kind of a pun is that some here not thinking much of RET thereby not putting
<br />
it on a park with category theory.  This last sentence, if it is not a cheap
<br />
shot, is definitely worthy of all the scientific research that can be
<br />
brought to bear on the typist of the sentence.  First of all, there has been
<br />
no discussion with me participating in which somebody previously told me
<br />
that they don't think much of RET theory.  Second, in the same posting, you
<br />
claim in effect to not understand RET theory.  Those two sentences
<br />
approximately are all you say in this posting on RET theory.  Then you go on
<br />
to generalize to quote some here not thinking much of RET unquote, which
<br />
gives the impression that there may be more than you, and you have not even
<br />
stated that you do not think much of it since you claim to not understand
<br />
it - which, incidentally, is far easier to explain than category theory [and
<br />
all my explanations of it are easier - that is the advantage of knowing
<br />
fuzzy multivalued logics, which apparently you do not], and so you have the
<br />
distinction of understanding what is harder to explain and not understanding
<br />
what is easier to explain - a phenomenon definitely worthy of the fullest
<br />
research to which science can be put.
<br />
<br />Still, your replies are worthy of commenting upon because they pioneer new
<br />
directions in errors but also give some interesting references as a
<br />
redeeming feature.    Your picture of Socrates is perhaps the funniest of
<br />
all your pictures, and that is especially interesting because you are
<br />
already in the non-fuzzy-multivalued-logic camp, so now you move into the
<br />
non-philosopher camp - which, believe it or not, is also where Smolin,
<br />
Rovelli, MacLane also are.  So you think that in essence Socrates was an
<br />
idiot, the citizens of Athens were heroes, and Plato was a hero, and Sir
<br />
Roger Penrose was a hero.  If you had the slightest background in philosophy
<br />
beyond philosophy 1 and 2, you would know that Plato wrote the biography of
<br />
Socrates - that nothing is known of Socrates beyond what his STUDENT Plato
<br />
wrote, and that Plato literally worshipped Socrates, and that Plato
<br />
described in detail how the horrible citizens of Athens destroyed Socrates
<br />
and forced him to take poison.    Then, toward the end of your posting, you
<br />
claim that this Athens was nothing like the Athens you studied - even though
<br />
you cite Plato as one of the great philosophers in effect.  One would have
<br />
to believe that you were there before Plato, somehow interposed between
<br />
Plato and his teacher Socrates, studying all this wisdom [from where, if I
<br />
may ask] and going around polling Athenians [certainly not examining the
<br />
psychology or culture or history of Athens - a poll would more likely
<br />
reflect the beliefs of conformists whether in science or politics].
<br />
<br />Your master step, however, was your discovery that G. 't Hooft obtained the
<br />
Nobel Prize not from the Holographic Principle but from his work on the
<br />
electroweak force, contrary to my claim that he obtained it for the
<br />
Holographic Principle among other things.   Most Nobel Laureates in physics
<br />
obtain their prizes for the so-called sum total of their work, although
<br />
specific highlights are often mentioned and apparently may be the only ones
<br />
mentioned.  I assumed that 't Hooft's Holographic Principle was included.
<br />
In any case, if you think as you claim that the Holographic model is still
<br />
very hypothetical, you are out of line of what is one of the core concepts
<br />
of string, brane, supersymmetry, TQFT, loop theory, and on and on at the
<br />
present time.   Since you keep referring me to your references, glance
<br />
through the arXivs in physics and mathematics from the 1997s through 2002.
<br />
Or read one of my explanations on one of the sites that I have cited in
<br />
previous postings.
<br />
<br />I will conclude this posting with a summary of what I think your orientation
<br />
is.   You, and your apparently closest hero John Baez, are COMPUTER PEOPLE.
<br />
Computer people, in my 64 years of experience in life, have almost always
<br />
near 0 verbal ability and about 50 percent quantitative ability on a scale
<br />
of 0 to 100.   They have NO philosophical ability, which computers also
<br />
don't have, and their use of logic is confined to reading proofs of theorems
<br />
that have already been invented by somebody else and making stupid machines
<br />
move faster.  They tend to like algebra, although even there they tend to
<br />
skip their assumptions since they don't have many of them.   This lack of
<br />
philosophical orientation interferes with their understand of themselves and
<br />
their relationships to others, so that verbal aggression is prevalent in
<br />
their writings when replying to more capable thinkers.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; where

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Field

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Equation, the Schrodinger Equation, Newton's Laws, Fermat's numerous

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Geometry, Euclidean Geometry, the Jacobsen radical, Gauss-Null and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; related
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, sure, these examples are typical of the massive breakthroughs in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our understanding of the universe, and of the core fields of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematics, that came in the 19th and early 20th centuries, roughly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from 1850 to 1950. (There was a similar phase a bit earlier, with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Newton, Leibniz, Laplace, Lagrange, etc.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is an example of how the rate of discovery is _slowing down_.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (I'll wait a moment for the jeers to subside...)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; By slowing down I mean of course that we have basically mapped out the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; larger structure of physics, and also chemistry, geology, math, and so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on. Biology is perhaps much less mapped out.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's not likely that any theory, whether algebraic topology or model
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory or whatever is going to give us anything like QM or relativity,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for the reason that we have them and we have no evidence that some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; large body of experimental evidence awaits explanation in the way that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the early QM reearchers knew they were explaining aspects of reality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all around them (hydrogen atom, electron diffraction, spectral lines in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emissions, radioactive decay, new and obvious particles like alphas,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; neutrons, positrons, muons, etc., and so on. Likewise, Einstein and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; others knew full well the import of the Michelson-Morley experiment.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And the bending of light around the sun was predicted and then observed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; less than 2 years later. Finally, both theories came together with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; atom bomb.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Theories today are much, much further removed from experiment and from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everyday implications. I don't need to say more about this, I presume.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; sets in geometric nonlinear functional analysis, Godel's theorems, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Hoyle's Law or the Central Limit Theorems or the almost incredible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; theorems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of Nonsmooth Analysis and Kalman filters/predictors and Dynamic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Programming
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and the Calculus of Variations and Cantor's cardinals and ordinals and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Robinson's infinitesimals and Dirac's equations and Dirac's delta
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; functions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and Feynmann's path history integrals and diagrams and the whole new
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; generation of continuum force laws and on and on.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here you're getting more modern areas, areas which in fact are deeply
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; connected with topos theory, for example. Besides logic, which remains
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an active field with active researchers, you ought to look into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;synthetic differential geometry,&quot; explored by Anders Kock and others.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; SDE reifies the infinitesimals. I would strongly argue that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nonsmooth analysis and infinitesimal analysis you crave is _more_
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; closely related to Grothendieck toposes than you seem to appreciate.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Likewise, check out papers by Crane, Baez, and others on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; connections between Feynman diagrams and category theory. (One of them
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is &quot;Categorical Feynmanology. The arXive site has them all.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Kalman filters are just an applied tool. Check out &quot;support vector
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machines&quot; to see that work continues on new and improved tools of this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sort.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Expecting category theory to be a theory of dynamic programming or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; linear algebra practical programming is not reasonable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Sure, category theory can go in to many fields and find a category and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; take credit for the field being essentially a category, and I can go
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; many fields and find plus and minus and division and multiplication
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; analogs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and declare the field as an example of Rare Event Theory [RET] or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Fairly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Frequent Event Theory [FFT or FET] or Very Frequent Event Theory [VFT
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I confess that I have never understand your &quot;Rare Event Theory.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Science is well-equipped to deal with events measured with large
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; negative exponents, even probabilities with 10^-50 or whatever.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't think the world's nonacceptance of &quot;RET&quot; means it is on par
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with category theory, just because some here don't think much of it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But string and brane theory are suffering from precisely what category
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; theory is suffering from - a paucity of predictions of the Einstein and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Schrodinger kind mentioned in the second paragraph back, and a paucity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; depth.  Now, Tim, you certainly know very very much, but how are you at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; depth [question-mark  - my question mark and several other keys like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; parentheses are out].
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; On your first point, yes, many current theories are very far from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; having testable predictions. Including, of course, the Tegmark theory,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Schmidhuber theory, and all sorts of universe-as-CA theories.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; String and loop quantum gravity theories may be hundreds of years away
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from being tested...or a test could surprise us within the next 10
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; years, much as the evidence for black holes has mounted dramatically,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; faster than many of us 30 years ago thought it would.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The reasons for this fall into two main categories (no pun intended).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One, the low-hanging fruit point. A lot of bright minds have churned
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; over things, with perhaps 1000 times as much effort as we had when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Einstein was theorizing in his patent office, or even when the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; community of quantum mechanics experts was still small enough that they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could meet a few times a year (a la Solvay Conferences) or meet with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; David Hilbert, Emmy Noether, Emil Artin, and John von Neumann in their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; offices at Gottingen and Heidelberg.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The second reason is the energy one. It took a few thousand dollars's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; worth of equipment in 1900-1920 to produce interesting new particles,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to prove the existence of electrons, protons, etc. Then it took maybe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 10-20 that to build Cockroft-Walton and Van de Graf accelerators to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; find more. Then another similar increment in cost and energy for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; early cyclotrons to find the interesting particles of the 1930s. Then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; another such factor to build nuclear piles and larger cyclotrons. And
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thus the 1950s saw a huge expenditure to build the Bevatron, where the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; antiproton and other particles were discovered/confirmed/created. (By
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the way, Dirac's prediction of antiparticles was a very &quot;category
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory&quot;-like process of looking at symmetries in a commutative diagram
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and essentially saying &quot;to make this diagram commute, I need this leg
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the diagram.&quot;) And then we had multibillion dollar Brookhaven AGS
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machines, SLAC, and on to machines like Fermilab and CERN which cost
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; many tens of billions. The Superconducting Supercollider was ultimately
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dropped due to incredible cost and low bang for the buck (perhaps only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one new particle, according to many predictions.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yeah, it's conceivable that the SSC would have produced some new realm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of physics, as the enhancements going into CERN may still do. But the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; odds are against it. (John Cramer, he of the transactional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interpretation of quantum mechanics, has some nice science fiction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about this sort of thing: &quot;Twistor.&quot; But it's SF, not anything that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; likely to come out of CERN.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; _These_ are the reasons we are in a sense &quot;filling in the details,&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fleshing out the tree whose branches grew to nearly their present form
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by the 1970s.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's one reason, I think, a lot of us who got started in physics in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 60s and 70s moved into other fields. (There was nothing of interest to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; me in S-matrix theory and Regge calculus, the &quot;hot&quot; areas of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theoretical physics in 1972.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; On your second point, about &quot;how are you at depth?&quot;, I hope this wasn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a cheap shot. Assuming it wasn't, I dig in to the areas that interest
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; me. As I have said more than a few times here, I am just in the past 8
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; months or so digging in deeply to areas of logic (especially modal),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brushing up on my math (algebra, topology, algebraic topology,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; analysis, etc.), and using topos and category theory as my touchstones.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; When I have gone as far as I wish to, perhaps I will move on to other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; areas.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I will give an example.  Socrates would rank in my estimation as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Creative
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Geniuses of Maximum Depth.    The world of Athens was very superficial,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; facially and bodily and publicly oriented but with relatively little
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; depth,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and when push came to shove, rather than ask what words meant, it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; preferred
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to kill the person making the inquiries.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The death of Socrates notwithstanding, this does not sound like the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Athens I studied. Socrates was a strange bird, and there is much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evidence that he did everything he could to ensure his own death
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sentence. Equally profound thinkers like Plato and Aristotle faced very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; little pressure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;   What it was afraid of was going
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; deep, asking what the gods really were,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This doesn't match my reading of history. Aristotle asked profound
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; questions about the nature of reality, metaphysics, belief, etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You mentioned, Tim, that the Holographic Model is still very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; hypothetical.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Are we to understand that G. 't Hooft obtained the Nobel Prize for a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; hypothetical idea [question-mark] among others.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ah, but 't Hooft did not get the Nobel for his work with Susskind and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; others on the holographic model. He got it for his work on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; electroweak force.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I will conclude this rather long posting with an explanation of why I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Lawvere and MacLane and incidentally Smolin and Rovelli went in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; wrong
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; direction regarding depth.  It was because they were ALGEBRAISTS -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; specialty and life's work in mathematics was ALGEBRA - very, very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; advanced
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ALGEBRA.  Now, algebra has a problem with depth because IT HAS TOO MANY
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ABSTRACT POSSIBILITIES WITH NO [MORE CONCRETE OR NOT] SELECTION
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; CRITERIA
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; AMONG THEM.   It is somewhat like the Ocean - if an explorer worships
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Ocean, then he will go off in any direction that Ocean seems to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; leading
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sorry, but this is a silly argument. Smolin and Rovelli may in fact be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wrong in their theory of loop quantum gravity (and the closely related
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theories of spin foams, etc., along with Penrose, Susskind, Baez,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ashketar, and the whole gang), but it is almost certainly not for some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simplistic reason that they were &quot;ALGEBRAISTS.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In fact, Penrose is a geometer's geometer. See, for example, the essays
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in his Festschrift. Now the geometry focus of Penrose does not prove
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; _anything_ about either the internal consistency or the ultimate truth
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of some of his spin network and spinor models, nor about the truth or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; falsity of spin foams and so on.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As for Lawvere and Mac Lane being &quot;ALGEBRAISTS,&quot; I neither see your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point nor its relevance. What Mac Lane may or may not be is open to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; debate...his work on homology theory tends to mark him as an algebraic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; topologist. And Grothendieck and Lawvere were looking into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generalizations of the concept of a space--and they succeeded.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Personally, and speculatively, when the concept of a space is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generalized so nicely, I think in terms of &quot;this probably shows up in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the physical world or its description someplace.&quot; If this ain't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; geometry affecting a physics outlook, what is?)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Anyway, it's silly to argue along these lines. You ought to take a look
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at one of his recent books (co-authored when he was around 80):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Sheaves in Geometry and Logic: A First Introduction to Topos Theory.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'd call sheaves, presheaves, and locales some pretty deep
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; geometrical/topological ideas, albeit at a level of abstraction that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; takes a lot of effort to master.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What the structure of reality really is depends on a couple of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; important things:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1. What aspect we are looking at, whether the local causal structure of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; spacetime or the &quot;explanation&quot; of the particles and their masses, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even at some grossly different scale, such as fluid turbulence (still
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not understand, in many ways, and yet almost certainly not depending on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theories of branes or strings or the Planck-scale structure of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; spacetime).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2. Scales and energies, whether the cosmological or the ultrasmall.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3. Our conceptual biases (if we only know geometry, we see things
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; geometrically, and so on).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One of the reasons I like studying math is to expand my conceptual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; toolbox, to increase the number of conceptual basis vectors I can use
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to build models with.
