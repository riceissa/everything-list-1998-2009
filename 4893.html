Hi,
<br />
----- Original Message ----- 
<br />
From: &quot;Hal Finney&quot; &lt;hal.domain.name.hidden&gt;
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Eric Cavalcanti, &lt;eric.domain.name.hidden&gt;, writes:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; In the case of non-destructive-copy experiment, the copy is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; made in a distinct place/time from the original. They could as well be
</em><br />
done
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 100,000 years in the future and in the Andromeda galaxy, and you should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; as well expect to have the subjective experience of being that copy with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the same probability as being the smooth continuation of yourself on
</em><br />
Earth.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, that makes sense.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But in the multiverse, there are certainly infinite other perfect copies
</em><br />
of
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; yourself which are not smooth continuations. We can imagine thousands of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ways how these copies could be made. In computer simulations, in a
</em><br />
distant
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;Earth&quot; in the Tegmark plenitude, or elsewhere.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, but keep in mind that there are also infinitely other copies which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *are* smooth continuations.  And these probably outnumber the ones which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are discontinuous (assuming that terms like &quot;outnumber&quot; can be generalized
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to infinite sets, or else that the sets involved are merely large and not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; infinite).
</em><br />
<br />I don't think so. Suppose you have at least one other perfect copy of
<br />
yourself,
<br />
such that you could expect that your next experience be one of that copies'
<br />
with the same probability as the smooth continuation. A moment dt from now
<br />
the original 'you' will have branched into a number N of possible future
<br />
states.
<br />
Since the copy is perfectly equal, the copy will also evolve to a number of
<br />
future
<br />
states that is of the same order of magnitude of N. According to your view,
<br />
each of these states is a continuation of yourself with equal probability,
<br />
so
<br />
that you should expect to have about 50% probability of being your copy.
<br />
But, if the Plenitude deserves the name, then we should expect to have
<br />
at least a Huge number of copies at any moment.
<br />
Therefore, either there are no other copies - i.e. the plenitude is not
<br />
real, and
<br />
there are no simulations of yourself anywhere in the multiverse, etc. - or
<br />
you
<br />
cannot experience being one of your copies, and QTI is not real. One of
<br />
these has to go.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But suppose you just stepped outside the Paris duplicator. Unaware of
</em><br />
the
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; experiment that is being made, your last memory is sitting in front of
</em><br />
your
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; computer, reading this email. Suddenly, you see the Eiffel Tower. That
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; would surely be a psychological experience that we don't have too often.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; And since there are infinite copies of yourself at any given moment, if
</em><br />
you
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; should expect to be any of them at the next moment, you shouldn't expect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to ever feel the continuous experience you do.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Rather, you should expect to feel both, with some probability.  And I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think that the multiverse holds a greater proportion of continuations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that are continuous than that are discontinuous.  Fundamentally this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is because the conditions that promote consciousness and therefore the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; formation of brains like mine will tend to involve continuous chains
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of experience.  Only in a relatively few universes will I be subject to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unknowing duplications.  Therefore I think it is highly unlikely but not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; impossible that I will suddenly experience a discontinuity.
</em><br />
<br />I have argued above about the proportion of smooth/discontinuous states.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let us suppose, though, that our society evolves to a state where such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; duplications are routine.  Anyone may have their brain scanned at any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time, without their knowledge, and new copies of them created.  Suppose I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; am such a copy, in fact, I am a 10th generation copy; that is, 10 times
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in my life I have found myself having an experience similar to what you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; described, a discontinuity where I was just walking along or sitting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there, and suddenly found myself stepping out of a duplicating machine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because someone copied me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think you will agree that my memories are reasonable; that is, that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anyone who has gone through such an experierence as I describe will in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fact remember these discontinuities.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Given my history, wouldn't it be reasonable for me to expect, at any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; future moment, to possibly face another such discontinuity?  It has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happened many times before, both to me and to other people that I know;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it is an often-discussed phenomenon of the world, in this scenario.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Just like anything else that happens occasionally to everyone, it would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be perfectly reasonable and rational to have an expectation that it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; might happen to you.
</em><br />
<br />It would be perfectly normal, in such a society, to expect to BE a clone,
<br />
if you have some reason to believe you are, such as a long-forgot
<br />
discontinuity of experience.
<br />
But one should not expect to ever BECOME a clone, for the reasons
<br />
I argued above.
<br />
<br />-Eric.
