<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to me.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; importance when you consider the entire ensemble of possible 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical structures. For instance, consider the infinitely many 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cellular automata that exist in the Mathiverse. We know of very simple 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1D, 2D, and 3D cellular automata that are computation universal, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; therefore (I believe) capable of containing SASs. Undoubtedly there an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; infinite number of 4D cellular automata that are computation universal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and contain SASs that perceive their surroundings as 4D. Ditto for CA 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with dimensions higher than 4.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps it's true that within the ensemble of all quantum-physical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universes in Mathspace, only those with 3+1 dimensionality contain 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; SASs. But what possible reason do we have for believing that these 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; SASs (or the observer-moments of those SASs) have a greater measure 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than those in the ensemble of all cellular automata?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
Notes:
<br />
1. All cellular automata which are computationally universal are 
<br />
reducible to each other, by the definition of universality, so it doesn't
<br />
matter which D the automaton program itself is. The subject matter that 
<br />
they can represent and compute is equivalent.
<br />
<br />2. SAS's which are part of a 3+1 space may not have higher measure than 
<br />
SAS's in other spaces, but perhaps the SAS's
<br />
in the other spaces wouldn't have &quot;a decent way to make a living&quot;. In 
<br />
other words, maybe they'd have a hard time
<br />
perceiving the things in their space, existing coherently &quot;physically&quot; 
<br />
in it, being able to &quot;incrementally impact and survival-optimize&quot;
<br />
their surroundings in the space etc.
<br />
In other words they'd be inhabiting (and trying to perceive and act on)
<br />
a world of NOISE, or of LIMITED DEGREES OF FREEDOM AND EVOLUTION,
<br />
or of UNRULY, untameable hyperbolic  physical laws and functions.
<br />
<br />So at the least the 2D or 4 or 5D sentient creatures would be frustrated
<br />
(remember, they are SUBSTRUCTURES, they're not computing the space 
<br />
itself, they're
<br />
part of the space and perceiving and acting on other parts of it).
<br />
<br />At worst, their own &quot;physical&quot; existence in the flat or unruly space 
<br />
would be impossible to define coherently, so
<br />
they couldn't BE anything that we would recognize as a perceiving-acting 
<br />
lifeform. Maybe there's still room for some
<br />
other ultra-weird form of self-contemplative (4Dimensional navel-gazing) 
<br />
Ent-lifeform thingy, but I don't think so.
<br />
----------
<br />
I, like Tegmark, believe that the constraints for life, and sentient 
<br />
life in particular, are are EXTREMELY ONEROUS.
<br />
There are so many constraints, I believe, that it is possible but only 
<br />
just so, and so expected to be extremely rare even
<br />
in a very large universe (note, the universe may be infinite but the 
<br />
event horizon of intercommunicable beings or parts
<br />
of beings and their environment is not (at any given time, for a 
<br />
finite-lifetime creature). Each &quot;liveable part&quot; of the universe
<br />
is constrained to that subspace reachable by lightspeed interaction.
<br />
Within each interreachable event horizon, i.e. each observable universe, 
<br />
life and sentience should be rare because of the
<br />
need to satisfy a very large number of constraints simultaneously to get 
<br />
environment-interactive
<br />
life and sentience and to retain them.
