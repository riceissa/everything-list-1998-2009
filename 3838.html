<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Causality is a fascinating topic and one I hope to learn more about,

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perhaps via the Pearl book Tim mentioned or another that someone might
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recommend.  Here are some very random and disorganized thoughts on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; topic.
</em><br />
<br />I may order the Jim Joyce book that Wei Dai is reading...the material 
<br />
overlaps a lot of the Pearl material, based on the Amazon summary and 
<br />
sample pages, but it never hurts to have two views of the same material. 
<br />
BTW, Pearl has a discusson of Newcomb's Paradox and Joyce even devotes 
<br />
an entire chapter to it (based on the TOC Amazon shows).
<br />
<br />(I haven't commented on Newcomb's Paradox. I read Martin Gardner's 
<br />
column on Robert Nozick's treatment of NP when it first came out, around 
<br />
1973. Fascinating then, fascinating now. Bu there are a thousand views 
<br />
of Newcomb's Paradox in the naked city, to coin a phrase.)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Googling on &quot;causality&quot; led to a brief web page that summarized
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2000 years of philosophical thought in a few paragraphs,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://www.helsinki.fi/~mqsalo/documents/causalit.htm">http://www.helsinki.fi/~mqsalo/documents/causalit.htm</a>.  Generally there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seem to be two schools of thought; one is that causality is an artifact
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of our minds' efforts to understand and interpret the world; the other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is that causality has objective reality.
</em><br />
<br /><br />One reason I like the recent scientific papers on causality, light 
<br />
cones, universes, toposes, etc. is to move beyond the b.s. college bull 
<br />
sessions about determinacy and suchlike.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The modern philosopher's definition of causality has always struck me as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; somewhat backwards: &quot;The cause of any event is a preceding event without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which the event in question would not have occurred.&quot;  This means that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;A causes B&quot; is equivalent to A happening before B, plus the logical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proposition, &quot;if B then A&quot;.  You'd think that A causes B would mean &quot;if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A then B&quot;.  But philosophers interpret it to mean &quot;if not-A then not-B&quot;,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as stated above (I've read this elsewhere also), which is equivalent to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;if B then A&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />That's the contrapositive, always true as stated. (If A then B is the 
<br />
same as if Not B then Not A.)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So if we say &quot;heavy rains cause flooding&quot; we mean that if there were no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; heavy rains then there would be no flooding; or equivalently, if there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is flooding then there must have been heavy rains.  This is consistent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with there being heavy rains and no flooding.  It really doesn't make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense to me.
</em><br />
<br />Pearl spends a lot of time discussing these sorts of issues.
<br />
<br />I regret that I can't summarize in a few paragraphs what it clearly 
<br />
takes Pearl much discussion to explicate.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The problem with judging causality is the well known cautionary rule
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that &quot;correlation is not causation&quot;.  Just because A and B always
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; occur together, and A comes before B, that doesn't mean that A causes B.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is a common danger that scientific researchers have to guard 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; against.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's easy to observe correlation but hard to determine what is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; true cause.  This is a reason to view causality as just a matter of our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perceptions.
</em><br />
<br />I don't think so. Causality is a lot more than just a matter of our 
<br />
perceptions.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A strange aspect of causality is that to a large degree our laws of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics appear to be time symmetric.  This means that you can reverse 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time sequence of events and get a physically valid (although possibly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unlikely) scenario.  If that is so, then if A causes B in the forward
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; direction, can we with equal validity say that B causes A when we look
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at things backwards?  In that case the causal roles are fundamentally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arbitrary.
</em><br />
<br />Only in fairly simple mechanical situations. A two urn experiment with 
<br />
one urn filled with white balls and the other urn filled with black 
<br />
balls is the classic illustration of increasing entropy expressed in 
<br />
terms of &quot;more ways to have things mixed than to have things all of one 
<br />
color.&quot; Locally, with just a couple of balls, the process is largely 
<br />
reversible. But not globally.
<br />
<br />A large literature on why time reversal is meaningful locally, but not 
<br />
globally. Usual example of gas expanding from a cylinder to fill a room 
<br />
versus reversed image of gas moving back into cylinder.
<br />
<br />(A couple of books: &quot;The Physics of Time Asymmetry,&quot; P.C.W. Davies, 
<br />
1974, 1977, and &quot;Asymmetries in Time,&quot; Paul Horwich, 1987.)
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course in most situations we have a strong arrow of time based on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the growth of entropy which allows us to break this apparent symmetry.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But this is not always the case.  Systems in thermodynamic equilibrium,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if considered in isolation, have no arrow of time.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, they look like random things bouncing around, which is what they 
<br />
are.  Most &quot;interesting things&quot; involve temperature differences, energy 
<br />
inputs, life surrounded by nonlife, and such.
<br />
<br />I don't claim to know the nature of time, or what produces the &quot;arrow of 
<br />
time.&quot; It's not a resolved question.
<br />
<br />Several of the &quot;physics of information&quot; conference papers, especially 
<br />
ones by W. Zurek and Charles Bennett, are useful.
<br />
<br /><br />(But, before I tackle the issue at a deeper level, I'm trying to learn 
<br />
the language of what I think temporal evolution is: time's arrow being 
<br />
one of the arrows of category theory, hence my interest, or one 
<br />
additional reason for it.)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; We can look at a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; microscopic part of such a system and see fluctuations which appear to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be describable in causal terms.  For example, a temporary void forms
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; randomly, causing matter at the edges to move towards the center.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Or in reverse we say that matter moved away from the center, causing a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; void to form.  Both are equally valid ways of describing the situation,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indicating that there is no true causality.
</em><br />
<br />Physicists would say that a lot of these explanations of random 
<br />
phenomena in terms of &quot;voids causing matter to move...&quot; are just abuses 
<br />
of language. Comparable to financial market babblers saying things like 
<br />
&quot;And then at 2 pm the market sensed an oversold situation and shifted 
<br />
its buying to tech stocks, causing a late rally in the NASDAQ.&quot; 
<br />
Nonsense, mostly.
