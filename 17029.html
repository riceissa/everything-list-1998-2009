<br />So they differ in how we perceive them, and the way we interact with

them.  We experience them differently.

</em><br />
<br />Is that the history of something like Bruno's beloved Mandelbrot set?
<br />
I honestly don't know, but your rather broad claim sounds somewhat
<br />
weak to me.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I don't see how you would visualize Shannon
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information
</em><br />
<br />&quot;H-BloX is a web-based JavaScript application that allows the
<br />
calculation and visualization of Shannon information content or
<br />
relative entropy (Kullback-Leibler ‘distance’) within sequence
<br />
alignment blocks.&quot;
<br />
<br />So obviously different types of visualizations would be useful in
<br />
different situations, and some visualizations might be possible but
<br />
not useful at all.  But it would seem to me that nearly anything can
<br />
be represented visually in one way or another.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; or strings in ten dimensional space.
</em><br />
<br />Well, given that &quot;strings&quot; aren't logico-mathematical objects, but
<br />
instead inferred (though not experimentally confirmed) physical
<br />
objects like quarks, I'm not sure what you're saying here.
<br />
<br />BUT, since you brought it up, here:  <a href="http://bccp.lbl.gov/Images/calabi-grid.gif">http://bccp.lbl.gov/Images/calabi-grid.gif</a>
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't think that's good example. Synesthesia comes from cross coupling in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain of concepts that are usually separate.  I synesthesia were like perception
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then all synesthesists would see the same numbers as having the same color, etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  The main thing that causes us to attribute a form of existence to mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; objects is that everyone who understands them agrees on their properties.
</em><br />
<br />If a race of &quot;synesthetes&quot; had evolved with a common &quot;cross-coupling&quot;
<br />
(shaped by natural selection), then they would have a shared
<br />
perception of numbers.  Possibly combining the various types of
<br />
synesthesia.  So to these synesthetes numbers would have color,
<br />
shapes, textures, and spatial locations (using the examples from the
<br />
wikipedia article).
<br />
<br />When the synesthetes began to develop physics, they would no doubt
<br />
notice a correlation between the numeric world and the physical world.
<br />
&nbsp;What kind of conclusions they would draw from the correlations, I've
<br />
no idea, but it seems reasonable to speculate that they might be
<br />
puzzled in the same way that we are puzzled by wave-particle duality
<br />
or the nature of time.  They might even conclude that the physical
<br />
world is &quot;caused&quot; by the very tangible (to them) mathematics that
<br />
describe it.
<br />
<br />So, since we KNOW that it is possible humans to perceive numbers in
<br />
this way (from synethesia), then there is no reason to think that it's
<br />
impossible to breed it into a population, which would then accept it
<br />
as the norm, and who would then have a different view of the reality
<br />
of numbers.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I think we can say (again, speaking in materialist/physicalist terms)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that it's purely an accident of evolution that numbers don't seem as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; intuitively real to us as chairs, or colors, or love, or free will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (ha!).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But numbers don't cause anything and they are not caused by other things.  So
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it's not an accident.
</em><br />
<br />My point is that we could have evolved with synethesia being a common
<br />
condition.  What type of selection pressures would have resulted in
<br />
that?  I don't know.  Some survival requirement that is satisfied by
<br />
those havin an intuitive feel for numbers I suppose.
<br />
<br />I assume your point is that since numbers are acausal, they couldn't
<br />
have contributed to those selection pressures in any direct way?  True
<br />
enough.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is more than just perceiving them differently.  For example mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; objects are not located in space or time.  They exist timelessly and in no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particular place.
</em><br />
<br />Okay, I'll grant you that.  Though it doesn't directly affect the
<br />
point I was making.
