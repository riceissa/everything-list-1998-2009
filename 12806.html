</em><br />
<br />In mentioning the idea of God deciding morality on a whim, you perhaps 
<br />
allude to the old counterargument to grounding morality in God in the first 
<br />
place, known as &quot;Euthyphro's Dilemma&quot; from one of Plato's dialogues--if God 
<br />
*chose* these supposed laws of morality, then they are ultimately arbitrary 
<br />
since God could have chose a completely different set of laws, but if moral 
<br />
truths are in some sense beyond God's ability to change, much like many 
<br />
philosophers would say the laws of mathematics or logic are, then it's not 
<br />
clear why you need &quot;God&quot; in your explanation at all, you could just cut out 
<br />
the middleman and postulate eternal platonic moral truths in the same way 
<br />
many on this list are prepared to postulate eternal platonic mathematical 
<br />
truths.
<br />
<br />The only way in which I could see that it would make sense to relate 
<br />
goodness to &quot;God&quot; is to imagine a sort of pantheist God that represents a 
<br />
sort of ultimate pattern or harmony connecting every individual part of the 
<br />
universe, so goodness would represent some kind of orientation towards the 
<br />
ultimate pattern which encompasses all of us, and which would override 
<br />
individual conflicting interests. A variation on this might be the &quot;Omega 
<br />
Point&quot; idea that every individual finite being is on some sort of long-term 
<br />
path towards being integrated into an infinite superorganism (perhaps only 
<br />
as a limit that can never actually be reached in finite time), or in the 
<br />
concepts of this list maybe a single infinitely complex observer-moment with 
<br />
memories of every other observer-moment, which could also be seen as an 
<br />
ultimate pattern connecting everything (one might say, as in Frank Tipler's 
<br />
speculations about the Omega Point, that an infinite mind would itself 
<br />
contain simulations of every possible history in every possible universe 
<br />
leading up to it, so that the Omega Point would both be an endpoint of 
<br />
history but also contain all history integrated within it). In this view, 
<br />
every instance of individuals trying to cooperate and to understand and 
<br />
connect with each other is an incremental &quot;step in the right direction&quot;, so 
<br />
one could ground &quot;ultimate goodness&quot; in that. I recently came across an 
<br />
interesting interview at 
<br />
<a href="http://www.wie.org/j34/swimme2.asp?%20from=lnk-zaadz">http://www.wie.org/j34/swimme2.asp?%20from=lnk-zaadz</a> discussing Teilhard de 
<br />
Chardin's thoughts on the Omega Point, and many on this list will be 
<br />
familiar with Frank Tipler's version which I mention above (even if Tipler's 
<br />
specific ideas about using the Big Crunch to do an infinite amount of 
<br />
computation in a finite time are proven wrong, as a transhumanist I'm still 
<br />
crossing my fingers that intelligence will find some loophole in the laws of 
<br />
physics that will allow it to continue forever without violating the laws of 
<br />
thermodynamics). But neither of these versions of &quot;God&quot; bears much 
<br />
resemblance to the creator-God separate from the rest of the universe that's 
<br />
imagined by most mainstream religions.
