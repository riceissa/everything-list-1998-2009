It's something of a semantic difference whether worlds should be said
<br />
to fuse in the MWI....One way of describing it is to say that there are
<br />
two worlds, one where the photon passes through one slit and one where
<br />
it passes through the
<br />
other.  Then the worlds fuse when the photons hit the screen and this is
<br />
the cause of the interference.

It has always seemed kind of circular to me:  that particle wave
<br />
functions are superpositions of worlds, and worlds are collections of
<br />
particles.  But perhaps it's circularity is somehow fundamental.
<br />
<br />Fusing is a fundamental process of nature and probably will eventually
<br />
explain why there is a QM probability density. Better not to consider
<br />
fusing worlds with the slit screen experiment. Instead consider defined
<br />
particle waves up to matter, moving toward comparing probable worlds
<br />
versus improbable worlds.
<br />
<br />An electron has a far more defined wave, highly defined in almost all
<br />
situations. A cue ball bouncing around a table comparatively has almost
<br />
no wave. Its future worlds split as we split, and yet, (the density) of
<br />
what is possible is narrowly defined. The reason our future is so
<br />
narrowly defined, compared to all the chaotic possibilities, is fusing.
<br />
For example, the reason the path of the cue ball makes no radical
<br />
departure from physical laws, why it doesn't suddenly zips across the
<br />
room in one of all possible directions, (like a photon) is because our
<br />
present is constantly being narrowed. That is a given. Why, the reason
<br />
is that even though there are many possible paths in the immediate
<br />
future there is only one inevitable distant future or final outcome of a
<br />
path of time. Thus there is convergence.
<br />
<br />The idea of convergence is that all paths of time move inevitably toward
<br />
the same future. It is based on the fact that there is a point of
<br />
balance within the set of all possible states, like zero on the
<br />
mathematical plane. That most balanced, or most neutral, point within
<br />
all possible states (worlds) acts like an attractor. It pulls time
<br />
toward it. It is literally made inevitable because of the simple fact it
<br />
is an ultimate point of balance. Being inevitable, it pulls time always
<br />
toward it, which means that it dictates what is possible for every path
<br />
of time. Not just ours, but all worlds, as all worlds begin with a Big
<br />
Bang. In other words, our present is shaped by the future.
<br />
<br />Imagine that you are suddenly informed that you must be in Paris
<br />
tomorrow at noon. Naturally, that future requires that you pack, tell
<br />
others you are leaving, buy an airline ticket, make arrangements for
<br />
someone to feed the cat. Suddenly that requirement dictates every minute
<br />
of your life. Now imagine hypothetically that there are many possible
<br />
immediate paths for you but only one possible future state. At twelve
<br />
noon you will be in Paris. The only future that exists for you is you
<br />
will be in Paris in one precise location. Now consider how that single
<br />
future dictates your past. You can take numerous different airlines,
<br />
different planes, eat different meals, talk to different people.
<br />
However, if that future is inevitable it will eliminate a myriad of
<br />
possible paths that branch outward seemingly in all directions away from
<br />
Paris. For example, all the paths where you miss your plane, get hit by
<br />
a bus, are made impossible. That inevitability for you to be in Paris
<br />
becomes for you a set of physical laws. It defines your QM waves. No
<br />
possible paths lie outside the myriad of paths that carry you to your
<br />
future destination in Paris.
<br />
<br />This is not just an idea. I have studied the idea of a cosmological
<br />
convergence for years, backwards and sideways. I may not be able to
<br />
explain it so that you can understand it, however, it doesn't require a
<br />
lot of study to recognize that if there is an inevitable future, one
<br />
single possible ending of time at a single balance point in the overall
<br />
set of all possibilities (state space), then that state would influence
<br />
the past of every path of time. It would shape the world in a way to
<br />
bring about itself. It would determine the laws of physics, determine
<br />
the probabilities that make one world path possible and another
<br />
impossible.
<br />
<br />What I have been trying to explain in prior posts is that before there
<br />
are physical laws, before there are many worlds or many paths of time,
<br />
even more elementary and excluding a chaotic infinitude, there is a
<br />
fundamental shape to nature, to what is possible of physical existence.
<br />
Regardless of differing physical or mathematical descriptions of a state
<br />
of infinite density, there is no meaning to the idea of a state of
<br />
greater density than infinite. The very basic concept of infinite
<br />
density, regardless of it being a single state or many states (of
<br />
different mass), is a boundary to what is possible in physical
<br />
existence.
<br />
<br />Furthermore, the universe can only expand to an ultimate extreme. A
<br />
circle can expand infinitely, becoming ever larger, with the curvature
<br />
of any distance along the circumference decreasing, moving ever nearer
<br />
toward a straight line. Yes, there is an infinite number of possible
<br />
measures of curvature, yet there is a single state, pattern, condition,
<br />
whatever, where the curvature of the line becomes zero, the point at
<br />
which a line through space is perfectly straight. Further, there is a
<br />
single state at which all lines are perfectly straight, what I refer to
<br />
as Flat Space or the state of Omega Zero. Perfectly straight lines and
<br />
the extreme of flat space correlate directly to a common physical
<br />
condition or the point in physics of absolute zero mass, density,
<br />
curvature, temperature, time, and volume. Flat space extends infinitely
<br />
in all directions. Flat space is a boundary.
<br />
<br />Infinite density and flat space are ultimate boundaries to a set of all
<br />
possible states. They are in essence the boundaries of a spectrum of all
<br />
possible states, a set that is infinite yet bordered by those extremes.
<br />
Such a spectrum is the most elementary model that can describe nature.
<br />
It is also polar, like the mathematical plane, with a positive and a
<br />
negative side, making absolute zero or flat space the balance of all
<br />
possible states, and our inevitable future.
<br />
<br />The universe is expanding not ever nearer to flatness, but rather
<br />
directly toward flatness. An inevitable future is why we live in such a
<br />
defined and consistent universe. However, all this has led me to realize
<br />
that the world we know isn't a single path of time, but rather
<br />
space-time is literally shaped by multiple and opposed directions of
<br />
time. As well as moving forward toward zero, within the very space that
<br />
surrounds us, time tries or does partially move backward toward
<br />
past-like states, toward density. The reason the universe expands, and
<br />
why positive and negative particles relate in they way they do,
<br />
polarized, is because of the inevitable flatness of the future and its
<br />
requirements of the present, but as well there are of course less
<br />
probable directions of time away from zero, mainly those that lead
<br />
backward toward the past or toward infinite density, or gravitation. The
<br />
world we know isn&#x2019;t one path of time but rather it is literally shaped
<br />
by multiple and opposing directions in time.
<br />
<br />Again, convergence toward flatness is what narrows what is possible for
<br />
us at every instant. It produces the consistency of the world and
<br />
defines the density of every probability wave, quantum and
<br />
gravitational. There are strict requirements upon our universe made by
<br />
the future. And thus I believe we do not live in an arbitrary universe,
<br />
one of all chaotic and ordered universes, defined only by the anthropic
<br />
principle. There are physical laws because of what is physically
<br />
possible. And what is possible in time is very defined and all temporal
<br />
worlds are ordered and rational.
