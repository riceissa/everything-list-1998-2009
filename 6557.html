<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [Here is] a neat way to define what is special about first

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person experience: it is the gap in information between what can be known 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from a description of an object and what can be known from being the object 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; itself. This is a personal thing, but I think it is at least a little 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; surprising that there should be such a gap, and would never have guessed had 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I not been conscious myself.
</em><br />
<br />&quot;Had you not been conscious&quot; yourself?  Do you think that this
<br />
is at all possible?
<br />
<br />That sufficiently complex entities capable of making their way
<br />
in the world ought to be conscious seems very natural to me,
<br />
for some reason. When I examine the animal world, for instance,
<br />
and see small creatures chasing one another, I would expect
<br />
them to be making maps of their environment; I would expect
<br />
them to have feelings; and I would expect at some level of
<br />
development that their maps would include a bit of self-reference.
<br />
(Just a tad, for the *lower* life forms.)
<br />
<br />Perhaps I am hard-wired to project my own thoughts and feelings
<br />
onto others, including animals.  Solipsism *really* seems unscientific
<br />
somehow. I myself have likes and dislikes, and so why shouldn't everyone
<br />
and everything else?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't think it is a good idea to simply ignore this gap,
</em><br />
<br />Well, I'd agree to call it a *difference*:  as I said in another
<br />
post, the way some of us see it is that there isn't an information
<br />
gap.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; but on the other hand, I don't think there is any need to postulate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mind/body dualism and try to explain how the two interact.
</em><br />
<br />Well, I think that everyone here agrees with that. But of course,
<br />
you are thinking about the resurgence of dualism. I probably agree
<br />
with you.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Aside from this one difference I have focused on, first person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience is just something that occurs in the normal course of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; events in the physical universe.
</em><br />
<br />Well said. I would like to quote that. I do also read that to
<br />
include consciousness, as I'm sure you meant. I would also
<br />
read it to include all the &quot;gaps&quot;.
<br />
<br />Lee
