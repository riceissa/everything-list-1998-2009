Hi Godfrey,
<br />
<br />I see we agree on many things. I comment only where we take distance.
<br />
<br />Le 12-août-05, à 19:33, kurtleegod.domain.name.hidden a écrit :
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [GK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Again I fully agree, though I am sure you are aware that &quot;mentality&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and &quot;identity&quot; are among the most difficult problems that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  science has tried to tackle and that what we think we know about such 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matters pales in comparison with what we are sure we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  don't know! Even just building theories may be more forthcoming in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some domains than others, irrespective of testing them.
</em><br />
<br /><br />BM: That is exactly why I have concentrate on a testable theory of the 
<br />
mind. Actually the testability is my first and most basic concern. I 
<br />
will say more in a reply to Lee.
<br />
Mentality and identity are difficult, sure. But the question of what is 
<br />
time, matter, space, etc. are difficult too. Modern physics has even 
<br />
made them more difficult.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [BM]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  This is just ignorance. Science is *the* most efficacious way to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; accept that we are ignorant.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  It is the motor of science. If you have a scientific interest in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; alien abduction you can always search for a piece of unknown metal, or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for tackling the plausibility problem of the account. Etc. As I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mentioned before one of my favorite text to illustrate what is the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scientific attitude is given in a book of parapsychology (the &quot;In 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; search of the light' by S. Blackmore). Of course the whishfull 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thinkers in parapsychology doesn't like it because it is negative (She 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shows the protocol errors in most parapsychologists experiments).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [GK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  That is a wonderful point you make above! But my own was that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; acknowledging something may not exactly be the same as admiting its 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality; it can in fact be just the oposite when what is acknowledge 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is someone else's belief for instance. How
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  (consensual) reality is acquired is a pretty complicated and still 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mysterious process. I would venture that a lot of what we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would count as &quot;subjective reality&quot; is just that! (more below)
</em><br />
<br /><br />I am not sure I understand you, and pêrhaps it is just a question of 
<br />
vocabulary. If I acknowledge a belief of someone, it seems to me that I 
<br />
take as real (or very plausible) that that someone has a belief, not 
<br />
that the belief is true.
<br />
Altough the subjective reality is just that, I guess, subjective. I 
<br />
take as objective the existence of &quot;subjective reality&quot;, or at least I 
<br />
take as objective the existence of the discourse and silence on 
<br />
subjective reality, and what I am searching an explanation on is 
<br />
exactly that, how to explain in objective term the subjective 
<br />
discourse, including the fact that we know we acnnot make objective 
<br />
that subjectivity. This is part of the so-called mind-body problem.
<br />
Saying, like Lee, that my subjective view is neurons firing is just 
<br />
false. To say that it is the sult of neurons firing is much more 
<br />
interesting but actually makes the problem worse (as serious 
<br />
philosopher of mind know very well). The reason is that if neurons 
<br />
firing explains all my behavior, it is just more enigmatic that 
<br />
something like consciousness has ever evolved.
<br />
The explanation is more subtle and demanding and eventually forces us 
<br />
to revised our oldest prejudices about the nature of reality.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; If that derivation is just a piece of your subjectivity that may 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dash &gt; your hopes to convey it to others...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [BM]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  By derivation I really mean &quot;demonstration&quot;. It is valid for anyone 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (accepting classical logic applies on the elementary arithmetical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; truth). Sorry if this looks contemptuous.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [GK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  It may very well be contemptuous but I cannot fault your 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;demonstration&quot; since I see no reason why materialism would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  be compatible with your hypothesis!
</em><br />
<br /><br />Good! Many people still confuse comp and materialism.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If I understand it correctly this is that one materially supported 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious entity could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  be entirely (and analytically) replaced by a digitally constructed 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one without it even being conscious of it. Am I right? Is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  this what you COMP ? If so you are right in one thing: it is one hell 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of a stronger contention than the strongest AI hyp
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (and that much more unlikely).
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK. But please note that 99,9% of the scientists take it for granted. 
<br />
Actually I know only Penrose postulating explicitly the negation of 
<br />
comp. This forces him to speculate about the falsity of both quantum 
<br />
mechanics and general relativity.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [BM]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  OK. This means you are serious like Lee. I certainly don't expect 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; people to understand it quickly! The people in this list does not know 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (I think) that they are one century in advance!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (and then they doesn't know I'm two centuries in advance ;-)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  (Don't infer I'm some sort of genius: it is just years and years and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; years of work + open mindedness).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [GK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Oh don't worry about that! There is genius in knowing that your are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not!
</em><br />
<br />I didn't say that either. I don't know if I am a genious, but I don't 
<br />
know if I am not a genious either ;-)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And since you are a machine your years and years
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  and years may surely add to two centuries! No wonder you outrun your 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; modesty...
</em><br />
<br /><br />I have never said that I am a machine. I have not the slightest idea if 
<br />
comp is true. But I am sure that if comp is true then physics emerges 
<br />
from the arithmetical relations, well, as sure as I am sure of the 
<br />
irrationality of the square root of 2. I give a proof.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [GK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Oh but you make it sound so easy! See: its is the &quot;derive physics 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from computer science&quot; that I have my first problem with!
</em><br />
<br /><br />That is the object of the proof I gave. The proof is 100% third person 
<br />
accessible, like any proof. What is hard, perhaps, is that the proof is 
<br />
done in a field which is in the intersection of theoretical physics, 
<br />
theoretical computer science and theoretical cognitive science.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Easier said than done, I'm afraid. Stephen Wolfram sent me his huge 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; book but I remain as unconvinced by it as everyone
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  else who has read it about his &quot;tinker bell&quot; version of Quantum 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mechanics. I heard Ed Fredkin a number of times and,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  though he is quite charming, I don't think he has any better answer 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to that question...
</em><br />
<br /><br />Wolfram, like Schmidhuber, entirely dismiss the 1/3 distinction. The 
<br />
proof I gave shows that Wolfram is just wrong on those matter. I am 
<br />
nearer Svozil and Chaitin (but well beyond, probably).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  More specifically: I believe QM puts a big kabosh into any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non-quantum mechanistic view of the physical world. If you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  don't get that, than maybe you don't get a lot of other things, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno. Sorry if this sounds contemptuous. It is meant
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to be.
</em><br />
<br /><br />It does not seem contemptuous, it seems just circular. If you have the 
<br />
two following axioms:
<br />
<br />1) There is a physical world
<br />
2) The physical world is described by QM
<br />
<br />Then it seems obvious to me that &quot;QM puts a big kabosh into any 
<br />
non-quantum mechanistic view of the physical world&quot;.
<br />
<br />Now don't worry, I believe more in the quantum than in comp! I thought, 
<br />
in the past, that I would quickly refute comp with quantum mechanics. 
<br />
But the fact are there, comp, as far as it has been tested implies 
<br />
everything we can deduce from the quantum. Comp is not yet refuted, and 
<br />
evidences add up that the quantum is derivable from comp (or from 
<br />
numbers through comp).
<br />
Of course, I believe in the quantum, but if comp is correct, I can no 
<br />
more believe in &quot;1)&quot;, i.e. I must abandon the existence of a physical 
<br />
world, and the quantum describes only the way machine dreams 
<br />
interference generate the stable illusion of solidity and time from 
<br />
arithmetical truth (under the form of confirmable bets, the Lobian Bp &amp; 
<br />
Dp).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Incidentally, the reverse reduction of computer science to physics 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seems to be a lot more hopeful specially since most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  computations seem to run a lot faster in physical computers than 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on... (what are the alternatives again?).
</em><br />
<br /><br />If you study the Universal Dovetailer Argument, you will see that any 
<br />
machine betting correctly and consistently on any piece of &quot;observable&quot; 
<br />
reality, will bet that to simulate that piece of reality exactly, there 
<br />
is a need of simulating an infinity of computations. Remember we don't 
<br />
know in which computations &quot;we are&quot;, and the &quot;physical&quot; appearances 
<br />
emerge from some probabilistic interference among all the possible 
<br />
computations. Without QM, for example, with just a Newtonian World I 
<br />
would directly interpret my proof as a refutation of comp.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK, no one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  has built a truly quantum computer just yet but a lot of people think 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they are about to do it!
</em><br />
<br /><br />I'm quasi sure they will!
<br />
And I'm quasi sure me or someone else will extract the existence of a 
<br />
quantum computer in the neighborhood of any &quot;conscious&quot; lobian machine, 
<br />
or refute comp. comp will provide really solid foundations for the 
<br />
quantum, if it is correct. In particular physical *laws* will be real 
<br />
general laws pertaining on all possible observers.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [GK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Sure will (take it with and entire salt mine)! My point is that we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; already have ways of explaining other people's experiences
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  on the basis of empathy or antipathy and in terms of direct causation.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Causation? Sorry but I consider such a notion as very vague (and very 
<br />
interesting).
<br />
There are ten thousands notion of causality, and a lot of them can be 
<br />
studied as necessary implication: B(p-&gt;q) in some modal logic. So I 
<br />
consider they are at least as many notion of &quot;causation&quot; than there are 
<br />
modal logics. And there is an infinity of modal logics ...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bill Clinton was found of saying &quot;I feel your pain&quot; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  no one called him on that obvious lie! I can think of some numbers 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that would tell me about the pain others are feeling
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (checked the price of gas today? $2.59 a gallon!!! That hurts!!!)
</em><br />
<br /><br />Quite cheap from here!
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Seriously, I see nothing wrong with what you saying as long as you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; couch it in that &quot;faith-based&quot; argumentation.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I think all theories are faith-based. But, yes, comp, is not only faith 
<br />
based, but it justifies why some part of it are necessarily 
<br />
faith-based, if true.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Your argument is cute and may very well be defensible that way. This 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; day and and age it may actually be better supported
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that way than as hard clad science, who knows?
</em><br />
<br /><br />It is hard clad science. I know of course that it could look 
<br />
&quot;philosophical&quot;  because I indeed tackle a &quot;philosophical problem&quot;. But 
<br />
I did actually chose purposefully special hypotheses for making the 
<br />
conclusion 100% testable, as it makes testable many variant of comp 
<br />
(like some weakening or strengthening).
<br />
Many people, including Bohr, qualified the Einstein Podolski Rosen 
<br />
paper as &quot;philosophical&quot;. But then (30 years later) Bell shows it to be 
<br />
testable (and Deutch: exploitable). My work is like EPR+BELL, although 
<br />
it bears on the mind body problem. The UDA part corresponds to EPR and 
<br />
the translation of the UDA in the language of a sufficiently rich 
<br />
machine theorem prover is the BELL part: I arrive to propositions as 
<br />
vulnerable as it is possible to be.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [GK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Oh, what a pity! I was kind of bracing to see that derivation! I am 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sure it would drive your point across a lot quicker.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Oh well, I could probably give you a couple of other outrageous 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hypothesis from which you could derive the whole
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  of physics, not constructively of course! You are the logician but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; isn't it the case that from an assuredly false premise
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you can derive anything?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Oh please! If you don't know the premise is false, then by deriving 
<br />
anything from the premise gives in any circumstances  interesting 
<br />
information. Take the case where I would derive the false from comp, 
<br />
then I would have derive a refutation of comp. (p -&gt; f is the same as 
<br />
~p). That would be something!
<br />
So non constructive proof can be interesting and informative!
<br />
Anyway, my proof *is* constructive.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [BM]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  The second part is a translation of that argument in the language of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the &quot;universal machine itself&quot;. This, by the constraints of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theoretical computer science, makes the proof constructive, so that it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; gives the complete derivation of physics from computer science. Of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; course God is a little malicious, apparently, and we are led to hard 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intractable purely mathematical questions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You are welcome,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [GK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Oh gosh! Another let down! Well maybe those pesky Quantum Computer 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; builders can rescue you after all one day.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Here you are right. This is actually predictable from comp. One of the 
<br />
quantum logics should be quantum tractable, and not classically 
<br />
tractable.
<br />
Also, I said to much when I say the questions are intractable. I should 
<br />
insist on the fact that I did solve one of the main decisive question 
<br />
(and comp succeed the test), and that, concerning many others, I have 
<br />
not yet really try to solve them, but professional logician does not 
<br />
find them easy, so I doubt I will get them. Now, I could prove that all 
<br />
of them are tractable in the sense that less than a CETI project could 
<br />
solve them (like you can simulate a  &lt;few-bits&gt;-quantum computer with 
<br />
enough classical bits.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  As
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I heard that you plan to become immortal (after a little digital 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; plastic surgery) you will have the time to wait for it!
</em><br />
<br /><br />It is the contrary. I plan to be mortal, but with comp this seems 
<br />
extremely hard if not impossible. This is the feature I dislike the 
<br />
most in comp. It is not clear there could be any hope of finding a way 
<br />
to get out. There could be  a whole arithmetical Bardo Thodol.
<br />
(This is already true with Everett QM). That's another reason to think 
<br />
about using the word &quot;theology&quot;, perhaps.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Bruno: you seem to hold quite estimable principles about the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fundamentals of scientific practice and you seem much less
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  threatening than your digitalist surgeon.
</em><br />
<br />Thanks.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; When I have a chance I'll check your papers out and see what I can 
</em><br />
