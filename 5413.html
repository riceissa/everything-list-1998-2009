</em><br />
<br />Have you ever REALLY tried, very hard, to think about nothing? Our
<br />
individual &quot;society of minds&quot; does not allow for it unless one turns a
<br />
deaf ear to the constant inner chatter - or one has gone flat line. We
<br />
are constantly trying to model in our minds what our limited senses
<br />
and what data from our investigative devices report to us. This model
<br />
is not reality, it is a very filtered approximation of reality, and
<br />
one limited at best to processes performed within and based upon a
<br />
very real nature. Insufficient processes, every time, as the model is
<br />
always lacking succicient data. But it doesn't much matter because
<br />
nature doesn't much care about how our minds model nature, and nature
<br />
will consistently do its thing regardless of a modeling process.
<br />
<br />True or false is not our judgement, it is our interpretation of an
<br />
actual reality. The interpretation is very likely to be flawed in some
<br />
respects, and therefore not itself a complete model of reality. If it
<br />
is not complete then its premise is not proved via self consistency.
<br />
The number zero is a model of a reality, its attribute is the lack of
<br />
anything measurable. Putting brackets around nothingness is like
<br />
trying to eat with an ear instead of with a mouth. Yes, you can stick
<br />
&quot;something&quot; in either model but only one model results in acceptable
<br />
repercussions.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perturb nothingness? as long as it &quot;doesn't&quot;?? I am sure you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have a better wording. Virtual particles (imagined?) are sthg
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sci-fi, especially within 'nothingness'. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is one type of fantasyland (narrative),
</em><br />
<br />There is pretty good experimental indication that virtual particles
<br />
really do pop in and out of our experiencable universe. To do away
<br />
with them requires some sci-fi explanation that I've not yet seen be
<br />
proven as decription of reality. But I can not claim that virtual
<br />
particles do or do not, or maybe just somethimes they do exist in our
<br />
universe. For now, it's the best model for me and many others. The
<br />
general concept really does seem to model very well with experimental
<br />
evidence.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I wrote another one,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which you rightfully scrutinized below. Read on.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But how can zero energy be expressed to have a factor called
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; eternity? In truth, it can not because space/time and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; matter/energy do not exist within zero energy. Such terms
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; belong only within the boundary of a perturbation. From the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; viewpoint of zero energy a perturbation both does, and does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; not, happen simultaneously (it is only a probability).
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;[JM]:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't know about probability. It depends on the model we cut
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for application. Cut it wider: Prob. will change. Same with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; statistical &quot;truth&quot;: depending on the (maybe wide) pattern we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; counted. Eternity is a temporal (nonsense) concept - I try to stay
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; away from temporal thinking (don't state: I can) so 'eternity' IMO
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is sthg atemporal. Infinitely short, e.g. Not 30,0...00+ years.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Matter/energy are terms in reductionist explanations of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reductionist observations in the physical domain. Cf: modeling. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;does and does not&quot; does perturb me.
</em><br />
<br />Well, that's because I allude to 2 entirely different frameworks? One
<br />
that is composed (or is not composed, take either viewpoint) of
<br />
nothingness = eternity? And another one where matter/energy = finite?
<br />
A little Alice in Wonderland conceptualization problem with this? What
<br />
I argue is very difficult to conceptualize, but it can be done.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; I conceptualize 'my' multiverse as fluctuations... &gt; &gt;SNIP
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;i.e. fluctuations into universes which re-dissipate... 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; SNIP 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; That is a lot to say in so few words! By total dynamic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; exchange, do you mean equilibrium? If so, could equilibrium
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; be equivalent to zero energy? What are the attributes of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; this symmetry? How to define that boundary of our universe?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; What causes existence of stress-seeds?
</em><br />
[JM]:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In my narrative I use the &quot;Plenitude&quot; as a necessary prop to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'get to a universe' - nothing more. Not describable features, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no 'info' to circumscribe or define. It is sthg outside our mind and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everything would be fantasy. 
</em><br />
<br />Aha! So if one does not perceive then the thing does not exist? Does
<br />
it exist if 2 out of 3 do perceive? Where does this line get drawn?
<br />
Only at a personal level? Doesn't that then infer that there can be
<br />
nothing known for sure beyond the self? Are we to be so lonely!? &quot;I
<br />
think, therefore the universe exists.&quot;  But I don't think so, so what
<br />
does that personal belief do to reality? I'd argue my beliefs per se
<br />
are of no consequence to the universe because they are models and not
<br />
the actual reality, even if the model is accurate it's still only an
<br />
independent model of the &quot;real thing&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;A bit more can be seen in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the central part of TA62 (Karl Jaspers Forum, Sept 2003)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://www.douglas.qc.ca/fdg/kjf/62-TAMIK.htm">http://www.douglas.qc.ca/fdg/kjf/62-TAMIK.htm</a> 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; All attributes I use are goal-oriented: to get to our world without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any 'other' narrative of e.g. perturbations of nothingness etc. &lt;G&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't think in 'equilibria' for visualizing unlimited
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interconnectedness and changes vs the clean-cut models of quantized
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; formalism, so necessary for equilibria. (Again: &quot;in so few
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; words...). SNIP &gt; What causes the dissipation of stress-seeds? I do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not yet &gt; understand why you disagree, as those questions are not &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; resolved to my benefit. 
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;[JM]: In this I agree. Even if 'satisfaction' instead of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'benefit'.What causes energy to do work? What IS energy? Mass? etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; etc.? [John Mikes]
</em><br />
<br />But, John! You dodge my questions, it seems, with yet more questions.
<br />
I think you're saying the universe is -- because that's the way it is,
<br />
end of story. Nobody argues that! We just argue that we're not so sure
<br />
that's the end of the story, and we want to know how it came to be
<br />
this way, and what its fate is to be. Yes, I can logically define what
<br />
causes energy to do work, what energy is, what mass is, and so on
<br />
within the scope of this topic (actually, I've already done so!) But
<br />
it is your definitions right now that are holding me at curiously
<br />
captive attention! &lt;grin&gt;
