<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I don't think that's a good counterargument, because the whole concept of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;probability is based on ignorance...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;No, I don't agree! Probability is based in a sense on ignorance, but you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;must make full use of such information as you do have.
</em><br />
<br />Of course--I didn't mean it was based *only* on ignorance, you must 
<br />
incorporate whatever information you have into your estimate of the 
<br />
probability, but no more. Your argument violates the &quot;but no more&quot; rule, 
<br />
since it incorporates the knowledge of an observer who has seen how much 
<br />
money both envelopes contain, while I only know how much money one envelope 
<br />
contains.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;If you toss a fair coin, is Pr(heads)=0.5? According to your argument, it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;could actually be anything between zero and one, because it is possible I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;am lying about it being a fair coin!
</em><br />
<br />My argument implies nothing of the sort. But your argument would seem to 
<br />
imply that if I am watching a videotape of a fair coin toss, then if someone 
<br />
else has already watched the tape, it would be permissible to incorporate 
<br />
their knowledge of the outcome of the toss into a probability calculation, 
<br />
even if I myself don't have this knowledge.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Here is another &quot;two envelope&quot; example:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Two envelopes, A and B, contain two doses of the drug Lifesavium, the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Correct Dose and the Half Dose. If you give the patient more than 1.5 times 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the Correct Dose you will certainly kill him, while if you give him the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Half Dose you will save his life, although he won't make an immediate 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;recovery as he would if you gave him the Correct Dose. If you don't give 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;him any medication at all, again, he will surely die. Once you open an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;envelope, the medication in in such a form that you must give the full 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;dose, or nothing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;You are faced with the two envelopes, the above information and the sick 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;patient, with no other help, on a desert island. There is one further 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;complication: if you open the first envelope, and then decide to open the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;second envelope, you must destroy the contents of the first envelope in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;order to get to the second envelope.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;OK: so you open envelope A and find that it contains 10mg of Lifesavium. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;You don't know whether this is The Correct Dose or the Half Dose; so 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;envelope B may have either 5mg or 20mg, right? And if 10mg is the Correct 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Dose, then if you discard envelope A in favour of envelope B, there is a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;50% chance that envelope B will have double the Correct Dose and you will 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;kill the patient - so you had better stick with envelope A, right?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I think you can see the error in the above argument. You already know that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the amount in each envelope is fixed, so even though you have no idea of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the actual dosages involved, or which envelope contains which dose, even 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;after opening the first envelope, there is NO WAY you can give the patient 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;an overdose. There is no way envelope B can contain 20mg of Lifesavium, but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;even though you cannot know this, you can use the above reasoning to deduce 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that there is no expected benefit from choosing a strategy of switching or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not switching - as you can also see intuitively from the symmetry of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;situation, whether you choose envelope A or B first.
</em><br />
<br />This case is not analogous to the two-envelope problem, because in this case 
<br />
it is part of *my* knowledge that one envelope contains the Correct dose and 
<br />
the other contains the Half dose, and neither contains a Double dose. In 
<br />
contrast, your analysis of the two-envelope problem relied on information I 
<br />
don't have, namely whether the two envelopes contained $50 and $100 or $25 
<br />
and $50.
<br />
<br />Suppose I know that the envelope-stuffer flipped a fair coin to decide 
<br />
whether to put $25 or $50 in one envelope, then put double that amount in 
<br />
the other. I randomly choose one envelope and open it, and find $50. Do you 
<br />
disagree that my average expected return from switching would now be 
<br />
(0.5)(25) + (0.5)(100) = 62.5? If this experiment was repeated many times 
<br />
and we looked only at the subset of cases where the first envelope I opened 
<br />
contained $50 and I chose to switch, wouldn't my average winnings in this 
<br />
subset of cases be $62.50?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In the game with the envelopes and the money, the analogous error is to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;think that there is a possibility of doubling your money when you have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;actually picked the envelope containing the larger sum first.
</em><br />
<br />But *you* don't know that the envelope you picked was the one with the 
<br />
larger sum. This is akin to arguing that it is an &quot;error&quot; to think there is 
<br />
a possibility of winning if you bet $100 on heads in a videotaped coin toss, 
<br />
since someone who's already watched the tape knows it comes up tails, even 
<br />
though you don't know that. Would you indeed say it's an error to believe my 
<br />
average expected return is $50 in this case?
<br />
