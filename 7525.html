<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Bruno,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; After reading your Universal Dovetailer  Argument (UDA) I'd like to give
</em><br />
you my reaction.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Thanks,
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It seems to me that the trick is hidden in your  assumptions.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Certainly. In a mathematical theory the theorems are  always &quot;hidden&quot; in 
</em><br />
the axioms.
<br />
<br />As such, I appreciate your willingness to  have a discourse on the 
<br />
assumptions in the UDA.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I think you've  even stated that before (using “embedded” rather than “
</em><br />
hidden”), referring  especially to comp. But I'd say that the trick is hidden in 
<br />
your assumptions  about the universe or “physical reality”. It is the 
<br />
assumption that “physical  reality” is limited to what we can imagine (“
<br />
communicable physical laws”, with  emphasis on communicable) and sense (“incommunicable 
<br />
physical knowledge”) it to  be, i.e. in our conscious brains.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Be careful. At that stage I don't  have conscious brain. Actually I don't 
</em><br />
have brain, which are physical object and  physics is not yet derived from the 
<br />
relation between numbers.
<br />
<br />Instead of  &quot;conscious brain&quot; I should have said &quot;consciousness&quot;.  The 
<br />
yes-doctor  hypothesis in comp tells me that you are assuming the existence of  
<br />
consciousness.  Also, is not the &quot;psychology&quot; that you are reducing physics  to 
<br />
&quot;consciousness&quot; (or an equivalent approximation)?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; This is  stated in your definition of “Fundamental Physics” as being “the 
</em><br />
&nbsp;correct-by-definition discourse about observable and verifiable anticipation 
<br />
of  possible relatively evolving quantities and/or qualities.”
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is a  very neutral definition of a &quot;perfect physics&quot;. At that stage 
</em><br />
the &quot;correct  physics&quot; could still be even a Newtonian physics, like &quot;there is 
<br />
universe and  objects in it obey such and such laws.&quot; At that stage, that could 
<br />
be the correct  physics. In the word &quot;discourse&quot; I include its intended 
<br />
meaning. It can still be  a physicalist discourse! But then, through comp, 
<br />
physicalism will be jeopardized  in a completely testable way.
<br />
<br />Is not your use of the word &quot;discourse&quot;,  even though it is a 
<br />
&quot;correct-by-definition discourse&quot;, and also your use of the  words &quot;observable&quot; and 
<br />
&quot;verifiable&quot;, meant to portray something that can be  observed by, imagined by, and 
<br />
encoded into our consciousness?  So is not  your assumption that we can fit this 
<br />
&quot;fundamental/perfect physics&quot; into our  consciousness?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; So if A=“physical reality” and B=“consciousness”,  then the assumption 
</em><br />
is A=B.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is much too vague. You identify  physics and discourse. But I said 
</em><br />
&quot;correct discourse&quot; and this includes the  semantics (meaning) of the discourse.
<br />
<br />(Actually I should have said that  the assumption seems to be that A is a 
<br />
subset of B.)  Are you  saying that &quot;correct-by-definition discourse&quot; refers to a 
<br />
discourse that does  not necessarily fit into our consciousness?  If so, then 
<br />
why call it  &quot;discourse&quot;?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It seems that the rest is extraneous because with  A=B you've already 
</em><br />
practically reached your conclusion, even without  comp.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You would be right if I was defining literally physics by the  physical 
</em><br />
discourse, but I define it by the correct discourse. It could be  &quot;string theory&quot; 
<br />
or &quot;QM&quot;, etc. Then comp shows we have no choice, and eventually  the
<br />
comp-physics is given by a precise things all lobian machine can find by  
<br />
introspection. To test comp we can then compare that &quot;comp-physics&quot; with the  
<br />
verified part of empirical physics. If the comp-physics predicts Bell's  
<br />
inequality cannot be violated then comp would be refutated, etc. This shows the  rest 
<br />
is not extraneous.
<br />
<br />I am not assuming that our consciousness is  necessarily physical, but again 
<br />
I still don't see why you use the term  &quot;discourse&quot; if it does not refer to 
<br />
something that can be grasped by our  consciousness.  Why not just say &quot;correct 
<br />
physics&quot; or &quot;the way things  really are, independent of our consciousness&quot;?  
<br />
But then, if you did that,  wouldn't you lose any chance of coming to the 
<br />
conclusion of the  UDA?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Am I missing something?
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You have make a  confusion between &quot;discourse&quot; and &quot;correct (by definition) 
</em><br />
discourse.&quot; I know it  is subtle (and many thanks to point to the fact that a 
<br />
misunderstanding can  occur already there). I would say that by progressing 
<br />
in the UDA could help you  to see this subtle point. When I translate the UDA 
<br />
in the language of a Lobian  machine, a similar difficulty appears making at 
<br />
first sight believe that physics  will just be the &quot;classical tautologies&quot; (and 
<br />
that would make physics, with  comp, a purely geographico-historical matter, 
<br />
but then incompleteness entails it  is not so, we get sort of quantum 
<br />
tautologies.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno
</em><br />
<br />I've read  the UDA but not the second part of the SANE paper where you 
<br />
interview the  machine.  Is not the result from the UDA needed to start the second  
<br />
half?  I am wary of being persuaded by an argument further down the line  
<br />
where the UDA is assumed.  It would seem that I should be able to  understand the 
<br />
assumptions/axioms of the UDA first.
<br />
