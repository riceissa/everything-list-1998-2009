<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From: &quot;Hal Finney&quot; [mailto:hal.domain.name.hidden]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Another way to think of it is that all bit strings
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;exist, timelessly; and some of them implicitly specify computer programs;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and some of those computer programs would create universes with observers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;just like us in them.  You don't necessarily need the machinery of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the computer to run the program, it could be that the existence of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;program itself is sufficient for what we think of as reality.
</em><br />
<br />Brent Meeker replies:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In what sense does &quot;the program&quot; exist if not as physical tokens?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is it enough that you've thought of the concept?  The same &quot;program&quot;,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; i.e. bit-string, does different things on different computers.  So how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can the program instantiate reality independent of the computer?
</em><br />
<br />Yes, I think it is enough that I have thought of the concept!  Or more
<br />
accurately, I think it is enough that the concept is thinkable-of.
<br />
<br />What I mean is, a bit string plus the concept of a computer is enough
<br />
to imply a universe with a time coordinate (or more than one!)  and all
<br />
the complexity we perceive.  In the Platonic sense both the bits and
<br />
the computer-concept exist in the abstract, as both are informational
<br />
entities.  So in principle that should be enough.
<br />
<br />Now, as to the problem of which computer to use to interpret a given
<br />
bit string, what I think you also need to do is to imagine all possible
<br />
(abstract) computers as well as all possible bit strings.  Then these
<br />
produce all possible universes.
<br />
<br />So this exposes a weakness, which is that we seem to need a measure over
<br />
all the computers, in order to compute a measure over the universes they
<br />
compute.  And if we look at this more closely, we see that I have glossed
<br />
over another assumption, which is an implied measure over bit strings.
<br />
Robin Hanson on another list challenged me on this point: we need to know
<br />
which bit strings are more likely in order to deduce which universes are
<br />
more likely.
<br />
<br />In the case of the bit strings, there is an obvious symmetric choice,
<br />
which is that each bit has independent, equal probability of 1/2.
<br />
This is not the only possibility, though, and we might get different
<br />
probability assignments for our universes if we assume a different measure
<br />
over bit strings.  But this measure is certainly staring us in the face
<br />
and has an obvious appeal.
<br />
<br />For computers, it is much harder to come up with a natural measure which
<br />
will tell us that some computers are &quot;more likely&quot;, have more measure,
<br />
than others.  My hope is that with further understanding and philosophical
<br />
exploration of this issue, we will either come up with an obvious measure
<br />
(as in the case of bit strings) or decide that it doesn't matter.
<br />
<br />The theory of algorithmic complexity shows that, from a sufficiently
<br />
removed perspective, almost all computers compute essentially the
<br />
same complexity for a universe.  These wiggle words &quot;almost all&quot; and
<br />
&quot;essentially&quot; do leave room for the fact that certain computers compute
<br />
completely different complexities for a given universe.  But that's
<br />
only a small fraction of computers - at least, I'd like to say that,
<br />
but that again seems to require a measure over computers.
<br />
<br />So I do think this is an area where some work is needed, but certainly
<br />
this result from AIT gives hope for a solution.  It cannot be a
<br />
coincidence that almost all computers work almost the same on almost
<br />
all universes.  That comes really close to letting us say, the computer
<br />
doesn't matter.  Maybe future philosphers will give us better grounds for
<br />
letting us be agnostic about the choice of computers.  And maybe we will
<br />
even find that the question of bit string measure is similarly irrelevant.
