<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Could you please elaborate. Why can't you just say it in the context of COMP?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Or maybe you can say it.
</em><br />
<br />I can say it indeed. With comp (or some weakening) I *must* say it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; BM: But COMP implies MWI (Note that Schmidhuber and me agree on that,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; but we disagree on what *are* the (many) worlds MW).
</em><br />
<br />More precisely: COMP implies MWI in two senses.
<br />
<br />1) Everett's sense: SE + COMP gives MW.
<br />
2) COMP sense: COMP gives SE + MW (my thesis, look at my CC&amp;Q paper)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This is interesting and I just want to clarify this in my mind... You say 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you and Schmidhuber do not agree on the &quot;size&quot; of the MW...what it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;includes...
</em><br />
<br />No. Basically we agree with the size of the &quot;ontology&quot;. We disagree on
<br />
the meaning of the word &quot;world&quot;. I pretend that with comp a world is a
<br />
first person (plural) construct. He does not defined them but he 
<br />
associates
<br />
them with their generating programs. Observers belongs to worlds, with
<br />
Schmidhuber. I pretend with comp that observers's infered worlds are 
<br />
defined by the set of the consistent extensions. I think at it as some
<br />
kind of model (in the logician sense). I don't get classical (boolean)
<br />
realities, but some sort of quantum one.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Schmidhuber associate worlds to some programs, I associate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; worlds on machine's projection from shared computational histories
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The projection is first person plural.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Again to clarify... the word &quot;machine&quot; means that consciousness arises from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;simple (Turing-like) computations. This is the COMP hypothesis.
</em><br />
<br />In first approximation YES. In second approximation NOT REALLY.
<br />
By comp I mean I survive with an artificial digital brain/body/universe.
<br />
As a counter-intuitive conclusion, consciousness does not really
<br />
supervenes on a computation but on an infinite cloud of &quot;similar&quot; 
<br />
computations existing in UD*. Locally a brain/body/universe only makes it
<br />
possible for a person (the one conscious) to accelerate himself 
<br />
relatively to its most probable possible extensions. Note that this gives
<br />
a role to consciousness : self-speeding up abilities. 
<br />
And this is linked to another result by Godel. If you add an undecidable
<br />
true statement to the theory (in which that sentence is undecidable), not
<br />
only an infinity of new formula become decidable, but an infinity of
<br />
provable formula get shorter proofs.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I am not sure I understand  &quot;shared computational histories&quot;. Why would past
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computational states be relevant? A current state could be reached from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;different past points (OMs) unless &quot;merging&quot; is not allowed
</em><br />
<br />Merging is allowed through amnesia. In some sense personal memories
<br />
help you to stay into no merging histories. There is something
<br />
similar with quantum mechanics and the quantum eraser. Saibal Mitra
<br />
proposes a similar idea in the discussion.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;...Isn't the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;current
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;state only of relevance?
</em><br />
<br />Relevance with respect to what? A state is not enough, you need a 
<br />
universal
<br />
machine to support it. Now a single state defines its accessible 
<br />
consistent
<br />
extensions in UD*, in that sense you are (platonically) right.
<br />
State are relative, in both Everett or Comp.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;In addition, &quot;shared computational histories&quot; seems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to imply that two people have &quot;now&quot; the same thought pattern. 
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;I was meaning *partially* shared computational histories. Like
<br />
telepathic dreamers (if that exists!) or like a video game net where 
<br />
different persons interact with a program.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Do you mean that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a &quot;world&quot; is the view (of the plenitude) by two observers sharing a &quot;common
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;frame of reference?&quot; 
</em><br />
<br />It is more &quot;sharing a common history&quot; like the bifurcation W and M.
<br />
Biological multiplication gives a simple model of tree like
<br />
developpement where individuals share a long common history. The more you
<br />
leave the leaves (!) the more the histories are shared. This is an image
<br />
because both with comp and/or QM, we must take into account merging.
<br />
(I know you agree with that).
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From inside UD* (i.e. from the average first person point of view of
</em><br />
machines) I make the conjecture that there is no ultimate well-defined
<br />
trunk for these barnches and leaves. From the third person view there
<br />
is one which is just the trivial one: UD.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;How is this frame of reference defined? 
</em><br />
<br />All the histories are in the block comp universe (UD* or just 
<br />
platonic numberland). But they makes sense as &quot;histories&quot; only 
<br />
viewed by the machines inside. It is the main purpose of the UDA TE
<br />
to explain that. Mathematical logic is needed for defining 
<br />
formally those inside views. 
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Should they have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the same thinking mechanism and laws of nature, but not necessarily the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;specific thoughts? 
</em><br />
<br />Er... Yes like W and M.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;(It's hard to know where to draw the line... 
</em><br />
<br />It is *impossible* to draw the line with certainty and from a third
<br />
person point of view. Of course if you feel pain or joy you can know
<br />
it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;One could argue
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that two different people sharing the same laws of nature and thinking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mechanisms, but having different specific thoughts will perceive different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;worlds...)
</em><br />
<br />*partially* different. They can both refer to a common moon of 
<br />
things like that.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Why the word &quot;projection?&quot;
</em><br />
<br />Or &quot;common anticipation&quot;. Like F=ma, or SE, ... We take it as a trunk,
<br />
when it is perhaps just a branch. See above.
