<br /><br />There are hundreds of religions flourishing around the world:
<br />
Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Sikhism, Hinduism, Judaism, Bahaism,
<br />
Babism, Zoroastrianism, Mormonism, Jehovas Witnesses, Jainism,
<br />
Confucianism etc. And each of these religions claim that their
<br />
scripture is preserved from the day it was revealed (written) until
<br />
our time. A religious belief is as authentic as the authenticity of
<br />
the scripture it follows. And for any scripture to be labeled as
<br />
authentically preserved it should follow some concrete and rational
<br />
criteria.
<br />
<br />Imagine this scenario:
<br />
<br />A professor gives a three hour lecture to his students. Imagine still
<br />
that none of the students memorized this speech of the professor or
<br />
wrote it down. Now forty years after that speech, if these same
<br />
students decided to replicate professor's complete speech word for
<br />
word, would they be able to do it? Obviously not. Because the only two
<br />
modes of preservation historically is through writing and memory.
<br />
<br />Therefore, for any claimants to proclaim that their scripture is
<br />
preserved in purity, they have to provide concrete evidence that the
<br />
Scripture was written in its entirety AND memorized in its entirety
<br />
from the time it was revealed to our time, in a continuous and
<br />
unbroken chain. If the memorization part doesn't exist parallel to the
<br />
written part to act as a check and balance for it, then there is a
<br />
genuine possibility that the written scripture may loose its purity
<br />
through unintentional and intentional interpolations due to scribal
<br />
errors, corruption by the enemies, pages getting decomposed etc, and
<br />
these errors would be concurrently incorporated into subsequent texts,
<br />
ultimately loosing its purity through ages.
<br />
<br />Now, of all the religions mentioned above, does any one of them
<br />
possess their scriptures in its entirety BOTH in writing AND in memory
<br />
from the day of its revelation until our time.
<br />
<br />None of them fit this required criteria, except one: This unique
<br />
scripture is the Qur'an - revelation bestowed to Prophet Muhammad
<br />
(p.b.u.h) 1,418 years ago, as a guidance for all of humankind.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />Lets analyze the claim of the preservation of the Quran...
<br />
<br />Memorization
<br />
<br />'In the ancient times, when writing was scarcely used, memory and oral
<br />
transmission was exercised and strengthened to a degree now almost
<br />
unknown' relates Michael Zwettler.(1)
<br />
<br />Prophet Muhammad (S): The First Memorizer
<br />
<br />It was in this 'oral' society that Prophet Muhammad (S) was born in
<br />
Mecca in the year 570 C.E. At the age of 40, he started receiving
<br />
divine Revelations from the One God, Allah, through Archangel Gabriel.
<br />
This process of divine revelations continued for about 22.5 years just
<br />
before he passed away.
<br />
<br />Prophet Muhammad (S) miraculously memorized each revelation and used
<br />
to proclaim it to his Companions. Angel Gabriel used to refresh the
<br />
Quranic memory of the Prophet each year.
<br />
<br />'The Prophet (S) was the most generous person, and he used to become
<br />
more so (generous) particularly in the month of Ramadan because
<br />
Gabriel used to meet him every night of the month of Ramadan till it
<br />
elapsed. Allah's Messenger (S) use to recite the Qur'an for him. When
<br />
Gabriel met him, he use to become more generous than the fast wind in
<br />
doing good'. (2)
<br />
<br />'Gabriel used to repeat the recitation of the Qur'an with the Prophet
<br />
(S) once a year, but he repeated it twice with him in the year he
<br />
(Prophet) died'. (3)
<br />
<br />The Prophet himself use to stay up a greater part of the night in
<br />
prayers and use to recite Quran from memory.
<br />
<br />Prophet's Companions: The First Generation Memorizers
<br />
<br />Prophet Muhammad (S) encouraged his companions to learn and teach the
<br />
Quran:
<br />
<br />'The most superior among you (Muslims) are those who learn the Qur'an
<br />
and teach it'. (4)
<br />
<br />'Some of the companions who memorized the Quran were: 'Abu Bakr, Umar,
<br />
Uthman, Ali, Ibn Masud, Abu Huraira, Abdullah bin Abbas, Abdullah bin
<br />
Amr bin al-As, Aisha, Hafsa, and Umm Salama'. (5)
<br />
<br />'Abu Bakr, the first male Muslim to convert to Islam used to recite
<br />
the Quran publicly in front of his house in Makka'. (6)
<br />
<br />The Prophet also listened to the recitation of the Qur'an by the
<br />
Companions: 'Allah Apostle said to me (Abdullah bin Mas'ud): &quot;Recite
<br />
(of the Quran) to me&quot;. I said: &quot;Shall I recite it to you although it
<br />
had been revealed to you?!&quot; He Said: &quot;I like to hear (the Quran) from
<br />
others&quot;. So I recited Sura-an-Nisa' till I reached: &quot;How (will it be)
<br />
then when We bring from each nation a witness and We bring you (O
<br />
Muhammad) as a witness against these people?&quot;' (4:41) 'Then he said:
<br />
&quot;Stop!&quot; Behold, his eyes were shedding tears then'. (7)
<br />
<br />Many Quranic memorizers (Qurra) were present during the lifetime of
<br />
the Prophet and afterwards through out the then Muslim world.
<br />
<br />'At the battle of Yamama, many memorizers of the Quran were martyred.
<br />
'Narrated Zaid bin Thabit al Ansari, who was one of those who use to
<br />
write the Divine Revelations: Abu Bakr sent me after the (heavy)
<br />
casualties among the warriors (of the battle) of Yamama (where a great
<br />
number of Qurra were killed). Umar was present with Abu Bakr who said:
<br />
&quot;Umar has come to me and said, the people have suffered heavy
<br />
casualties on the day of (the battle of) Yamama, and I am afraid that
<br />
there will be some casualties among the Qurra (those who memorized the
<br />
entire Quran) at other place...&quot;' (8)
<br />
<br />'Over the centuries of the Islamic Era, there have arisen throughout
<br />
the various regions of the Islamic world literally thousands of
<br />
schools devoted specially to the teaching of the Quran to children for
<br />
the purpose of memorization. These are called, in Arabic, katatib
<br />
(singular: Kuttab). It is said that the Caliph 'Umar (634-44) first
<br />
ordered the construction of these schools in the age of the great
<br />
expansion'. (9)
<br />
<br />Second Generation Memorizers:
<br />
<br />&quot;...Quranic schools were set up everywhere. As an example to
<br />
illustrate this I may refer to a great Muslim scholar, of the second
<br />
Muslim generation, Ibn 'Amir, who was the judge of Damascus under the
<br />
Caliph Umar Ibn 'Abd Al-Aziz. It is reported that in his school for
<br />
teaching the Quran there were 400 disciples to teach in his absence&quot;.
<br />
(10)
<br />
<br />Memorizers in Subsequent Generations:
<br />
<br />The Number of Katatib and similar schools in Cairo (Egypt) alone at
<br />
one time exceeded two thousand. (11)
<br />
<br />Currently both in the Muslim and non-Muslim countries thousands of
<br />
schools with each instructing tens of hundreds of students the art of
<br />
memorizing the entire Quran. In the city of Chicago itself, there are
<br />
close to 40+ Mosques, with many of them holding class for children
<br />
instructing them the art of Quranic memorization.
<br />
<br />Further Points of Consideration:
<br />
<br />* Muslims recite Quran from their memory in all of their five daily
<br />
prayers. * Once a year, during the month of Fasting (Ramadan), Muslims
<br />
listen to the complete recitation of the Quran by a Hafiz (memorizer
<br />
of the entire Quran) * It's a tradition among Muslims that before any
<br />
speech or presentation, marriages, sermons, Quran is recited.
<br />
<br />Conclusion:
<br />
<br />Quran is the only book, religious or secular, on the face of this
<br />
planet that has been completely memorized by millions. These
<br />
memorizers range from ages 6 and up, both Arabic and non-Arabic
<br />
speakers, blacks, whites, Orientals, poor and wealthy.
<br />
<br />Thus the process of memorization was continuous , from Prophet
<br />
<br />Muhammad's (S) time to ours with an unbroken chain.
<br />
<br />&quot;The method of transmitting the Quran from one generation to the next
<br />
by having he young memorize the oral recitation of their elders had
<br />
mitigated somewhat from the beginning the worst perils of relying
<br />
solely on written records...&quot; relates John Burton (12)
<br />
<br />&quot;This phenomenon of Quranic recital means that the text has traversed
<br />
the centuries in an unbroken living sequence of devotion. It cannot,
<br />
therefore, be handled as an antiquarian thing, nor as a historical
<br />
document out of a distant past. The fact of hifz (Quranic
<br />
Memorization) has made the Qur'an a present possession through all the
<br />
lapse of Muslim time and given it a human currency in every generation
<br />
never allowing its relegation to a bare authority for reference alone&quot;
<br />
reflects Kenneth Cragg (13)

<br /><br /><br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br /><br />Written Text of the Quran
<br />
<br />Prophet's Time:
<br />
<br />Prophet Muhammad (S) was very vigilant in preserving the Quran in the
<br />
written form from the very beginning up until the last revelation. The
<br />
Prophet himself was unlettered, did not knew how to read and write,
<br />
therefore he called upon his numerous scribes to write the revelation
<br />
for him. Complete Quran thus existed in written form in the lifetime
<br />
of the Prophet.
<br />
<br />Whenever a new revelation use to come to him, the Prophet would
<br />
immediately call one of his scribes to write it down.
<br />
<br />'Some people visited Zaid Ibn Thabit (one of the scribes of the
<br />
Prophet) and asked him to tell them some stories about Allah's
<br />
Messenger. He replied: &quot;I was his (Prophet's) neighbor, and when the
<br />
inspiration descended on him he sent for me and I went to him and
<br />
wrote it down for him...&quot; (14)
<br />
<br />Narrated by al-Bara': There was revealed 'Not equal are those
<br />
believers who sit (home) and those who strive and fight in the cause
<br />
of Allah' (4:95). The Prophet said: 'Call Zaid for me and let him
<br />
bring the board, the ink pot and scapula bone.' Then he (Prophet)
<br />
said: 'Write: Not equal are those believers...' (15)
<br />
<br />Zaid is reported to have said: 'We use to compile the Qur'an from
<br />
small scraps in the presence of the Apostle'. (16)
<br />
<br />'The Prophet, while in Madinah, had about 48 scribes who use to write
<br />
for him'. (17)
<br />
<br />Abdullah Ibn 'Umar relates:... 'The Messenger of Allah (S) said: &quot;Do
<br />
not take the Qur'an on a journey with you, for I am afraid lest it
<br />
should fall into the hands of the enemy&quot;' (18)
<br />
<br />During the Prophet's last pilgrimage, he gave a sermon in which he
<br />
said: 'I have left with you something which if you will hold fast t it
<br />
you will never fall into error - a plain indication, the Book of God
<br />
(Quran) and the practice of his Prophet...' (19)
<br />
<br />'Besides the official manuscripts of the Quran kept with the Prophet,
<br />
many of his companions use to possess their own written copies of the
<br />
revelation'. (20)
<br />
<br />'A list of Companions of whom it is related that they had their own
<br />
written collections included the following: Ibn Mas'ud, Ubay bin Ka'b,
<br />
Ali, Ibn Abbas, Abu Musa, Hafsa, Anas bin Malik, Umar, Zaid bin
<br />
Thabit, Ibn Al-Zubair, Abdullah ibn Amr, Aisha, Salim, Umm Salama,
<br />
Ubaid bin Umar'. (21)
<br />
<br />'The best known among these (Prophet's Scribes) are: Ibn Masud, Ubay
<br />
bin Kab and Zaid bin Thabit'. (22)
<br />
<br />'Aisha and Hafsa, the wives of the Prophet had their own scripts
<br />
written after the Prophet had died'. (23)
<br />
<br />Conclusion:
<br />
<br />The complete Quran was written down in front of the Prophet by several
<br />
of his scribes and the companions possess their own copies of the
<br />
Quran in the Prophet's lifetime. However the written material of the
<br />
Quran in the Prophet's possession were not bounded between the two
<br />
covers in the form of a book, because the period of revelation of the
<br />
Qur'an continued up until just a few days before the Prophet's death.
<br />
The task of collecting the Qur'an as a book was therefore undertaken
<br />
by Abu Bakr, the first successor to the Prophet.
<br />
<br />Written Quran in First Generation:
<br />
<br />At the battle of Yamama (633 CE), six months after the death of the
<br />
Prophet, a number of Muslims, who had memorized the Quran were killed.
<br />
Hence it was feared that unless a written official copy of the Quran
<br />
were prepared, a large part of revelation might be lost.
<br />
<br />Narrated Zaid bin Thabit al-Ansari, one of the scribes of the
<br />
Revelation: Abu Bakr sent for me after the casualties among the
<br />
warriors (of the battle) of Yamama (where a great number of Qurra
<br />
(memorizers of the Quran, were killed). Umar was present with Abu Bakr
<br />
who said: &quot;Umar has come to me and said, the people have suffered
<br />
heavy casualties on the day of (the battle) of Yamama, and I am afraid
<br />
that there will be some casualties among the Qurra at other places,
<br />
whereby a large part of the Quran may be lost, unless you collect it
<br />
(in one manuscript, or book)...so Abu Bakr said to me (Zaid bin
<br />
Thabit): You are a wise young man and we do not suspect you (of
<br />
telling lies or of forgetfulness) and you used to write the Divine
<br />
Inspiration for Allah's Apostle. Therefore, look for the Qur'an and
<br />
collect it (in one manuscript)'...So I started locating the Quranic
<br />
material and collecting it from parchments, scapula, leafstalks of
<br />
date palms and from the memories of men (who know it by
<br />
heart)...&quot; (24)
<br />
<br />Now, a committee was formed to under take the task of collecting the
<br />
written Quranic material in the form of a book. The committee was
<br />
headed by Zaid bin Thabit, the original scribe of the Prophet, who was
<br />
also a memorizer of the complete Quran.
<br />
<br />'...Zaid bin Thabit had committed the entire Quran to memory...' (25)
<br />
<br />The compilers in this committee, in examining written material
<br />
submitted to them, insisted on very stringent criteria as a safeguard
<br />
against any errors.
<br />
<br />1. The material must have been originally written down in the presence
<br />
of the Prophet; nothing written down later on the basis of memory
<br />
alone was to be accepted. (26) 2. The material must be confirmed by
<br />
two witnesses, that is to say, by two trustworthy persons testifying
<br />
that they themselves had heard the Prophet recite the passage in
<br />
question. (27)
<br />
<br />'The manuscript on which the Qur'an was collected, remained with Abu
<br />
Bakr till Allah took him unto Him, and then with Umar (the second
<br />
successor), till Allah took him unto Him, and finally it remained with
<br />
Hafsa, 'Umar's daughter (and wife of the Prophet)'. (28)
<br />
<br />This copy of the Quran, prepared by the committee of competent
<br />
companions of the Prophet (which included Memorizers of the Quran) was
<br />
unanimous approved by the whole Muslim world. If they committee would
<br />
have made a error even of a single alphabet in transcribing the Quran,
<br />
the Qurra (memorizers of the Quran) which totaled in the tens of
<br />
hundreds would have caught it right away and correct it. This is
<br />
exactly where the neat check and balance system of preservation of the
<br />
Quran comes into play, but which is lacking for any other scripture
<br />
besides the Quran.
<br />
<br />Official written copy by Uthman
<br />
<br />The Quran was originally revealed in Quraishi dialect of Arabic. But
<br />
to facilitate the people who speak other dialects, in their
<br />
understanding and comprehension, Allah revealed the Quran finally in
<br />
seven dialects of Arabic. During the period of Caliph Uthman (second
<br />
successor to the Prophet) differences in reading the Quran among the
<br />
various tribes became obvious, due to the various dialectical
<br />
recitations. Dispute was arising, with each tribe calling its
<br />
recitation as the correct one. This alarmed Uthman, who made a
<br />
official copy in the Quraishi dialect, the dialect in which the Quran
<br />
was revealed to the Prophet and was memorized by his companions. Thus
<br />
this compilation by Uthman's Committee is not a different version of
<br />
the Quran (like the Biblical versions) but the same original
<br />
revelation given to the Prophet by One God, Allah.
<br />
<br />Narrated Anas bin Malik: Hudhaifa bin Al-Yaman came to Uthman at the
<br />
time when the people of Sham (Syria) and the people of Iraq were
<br />
waging war to conquer Armenia and Azherbijan. Hudhaifa was afraid of
<br />
their differences in the recitation of the Quran, so he said to
<br />
Uthman, 'O chief of the Believers! Save this nation before they differ
<br />
about the Book (Quran) as Jews and Christians did before'. So Uthman
<br />
sent a message to Hafsa saying, 'Send us the manuscripts of the Quran
<br />
so that we may compile the Quranic materials in perfect copies and
<br />
return the manuscripts to you'. Hafsa sent it to Uthman. 'Uthman then
<br />
ordered Zaid bin Thabit, 'Abdullah bin Az-Zubair, Said bin Al-As and
<br />
Abdur Rahman bin Harith bin Hisham to rewrite the manuscripts in
<br />
perfect copies. Uthman said to the three Quraishi men, 'In case you
<br />
disagree with Zaid bin Thabit on any point in the Quran, then write it
<br />
in their (Quraishi) tongue'. They did so, and when they had written
<br />
many copies, Uthman sent to every Muslim province one copy of what
<br />
they had copied and ordered that all the other Quranic materials
<br />
whether written in fragmentary manuscripts or whole copies, be
<br />
burnt...&quot; (29)
<br />
<br />Again a very stringent criteria was set up by this Committee to
<br />
prevent any alteration of the Revelation.
<br />
<br />1. The earlier recension (Original copy prepared by Abu Bakr) was to
<br />
serve as the principal basis of the new one. (30) 2. Any doubt that
<br />
might be raised as to the phrasing of a particular passage in the
<br />
written text was to be dispelled by summoning persons known to have
<br />
learned the passage in question from the Prophet. (31) 3. Uthman
<br />
himself was to supervise the work of the Council. (32)
<br />
<br />When the final recension was completed, Uthman sent a copy of it to
<br />
each of the major cities of Makka, Damascus, Kufa, Basra and Madina.
<br />
<br />The action of Uthman to burn the other copies besides the final
<br />
recension, though obviously drastic, was for the betterment and
<br />
harmony of the whole community and was unanimously approved by the
<br />
Companions of the Prophet.
<br />
<br />Zaid ibn Thabit is reported to have said: &quot;I saw the Companions of
<br />
Muhammad (going about) saying, 'By God, Uthman has done well! By God,
<br />
Uthman has done well!&quot; (33)
<br />
<br />Another esteemed Companion Musab ibn Sad ibn Abi Waqqas said: &quot;I saw
<br />
the people assemble in large number at Uthman's burning of the
<br />
prescribed copies (of the Quran), and they were all pleased with his
<br />
action; not a one spoke out against him&quot;. (34)
<br />
<br />Ali ibn Abu Talib, the cousin of the Prophet and the fourth successor
<br />
to the Prophet commented: &quot;If I were in command in place of Uthman, I
<br />
would have done the same&quot;. (35)
<br />
<br />Of the copies made by Uthman, two still exist to our day. One is in
<br />
the city of Tashkent, (Uzbekistan) and the second one is in Istanbul
<br />
(Turkey). Below is a brief account of both these copies:
<br />
<br />1. The copy which Uthman sent to Madina was reportedly removed by the
<br />
Turkish authorities to Istanbul, from where it came to Berlin during
<br />
World War I. The Treaty of Versailles, which concluded World War I,
<br />
contains the following clause:
<br />
<br />'Article 246: Within six months from the coming into force of the
<br />
present Treaty, Germany will restore to His Majesty, King of Hedjaz,
<br />
the original Koran of Caliph Othman, which was removed from Madina by
<br />
the Turkish authorities and is stated to have been presented to the ex-
<br />
Emperor William II&quot;. (36)
<br />
<br />'This manuscript then reached Istanbul, but not Madina (Where it now
<br />
resides)'. (37)
<br />
<br />2. The second copy in existence is kept in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. 'It
<br />
may be the Imam (master) manuscript or one of the other copies made at
<br />
the time of Uthman'. (38)
<br />
<br />It Came to Samarkand in 890 Hijra (1485) and remained there till 1868.
<br />
Then it was taken to St.Petersburg by the Russians in 1869. It
<br />
remained there till 1917. A Russian orientalist gave a detailed
<br />
description of it, saying that many pages were damaged and some were
<br />
missing. A facsimile, some 50 copies, of this mushaf (copy) was
<br />
produced by S.Pisareff in 1905. A copy was sent to the Ottoman Sultan
<br />
'Abdul Hamid, to the Shah of Iran, to the Amir of Bukhara, to
<br />
Afghanistan, to Fas and some important Muslim personalities. One copy
<br />
is now in the Columbia University Library (U.S.A.). (39)
<br />
<br />'The Manuscript was afterwards returned to its former place and
<br />
reached Tashkent in 1924, where it has remained since'. (40)
<br />
<br />Conclusion:
<br />
<br />'Two of the copies of the Qur'an which were originally prepared in the
<br />
time of Caliph Uthman, are still available to us today and their text
<br />
and arrangement can be compared, by anyone who cares to do, with any
<br />
other copy of the Quran, be it in print or handwritten, from any place
<br />
or period of time. They will be found identical'. (41)
<br />
<br />It can now be proclaimed, through the evidences provided above, with
<br />
full conviction and certainty that the Prophet memorized the entire
<br />
Quran, had it written down in front of him through his scribes, many
<br />
of his companions memorized the entire revelation and in turn possess
<br />
their own private copies for recitation and contemplation. This
<br />
process of dual preservation of the Quran in written and in the memory
<br />
was carried in each subsequent generation till our time, without any
<br />
deletion, interpolation or corruption of this Divine Book.
<br />
<br />Sir Williams Muir states, &quot; There is otherwise every security,
<br />
internal and external, that we possess the text which Muhammad himself
<br />
gave forth and used&quot;. (42)
<br />
<br />Sir William Muir continues, &quot;There is probably no other book in the
<br />
world which has remained twelve centuries (now fourteen) with so pure
<br />
a text&quot;. (43)
<br />
<br />This divine protection provided to the Quran, the Last Reveled Guide
<br />
to Humanity, is proclaimed by One God in the Quran:
<br />
<br />We* (Allah) have, without doubt, send down the Message; and We will
<br />
assuredly Guard it (from corruption)' (Quran - Chapter 15, Verse 9).
<br />
*('We' is the plural of Majesty, and not the Christian plural of
<br />
trinity)
<br />
<br />Compare this divine and historical preservation of the Quran with any
<br />
literature, be it religious or secular and it becomes evident that
<br />
none possess similar miraculous protection. And as states earlier, a
<br />
belief is as authentic as the authenticity of its scripture. And if
<br />
any scripture is not preserved, how can we be certain that the belief
<br />
arising out of this scripture is divine or man made, and if we are not
<br />
sure about the belief itself, then our salvation in the hereafter
<br />
would be jeopardized. Thus this above evidence for the protection of
<br />
the Quran from any corruption is a strong hint about its divine
<br />
origin. We request all open hearted persons to read, understand and
<br />
live the Quran, the 'Manual for Mankind'.
