Le 05-janv.-07, à 05:55, Stathis Papaioannou a écrit :
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Bruno: If consciousness supervenes on all physical processes a case 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; can be  made that matter could be relevant for consciousness. (I see 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Peter  Jones makes a similar remark).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Stathis: Except that you could say the same for the Maudlin example, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in which it is shown that conscious can differ in two objects which do 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not differ in physical activity: it does not strictly show that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical activity (or more generally, matter) is unnecessary, just 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the usual definition of supervenience does not apply.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK, I guess that by &quot;usual supervenience&quot; you mean &quot;physical 
<br />
supervenience&quot;. Both Maudlin and the movie graph show that the comp hyp 
<br />
is incompatible with usual (physical) supervenience. We both show (~ 
<br />
comp OR ~ physical supervenience). This is equivalent with (comp -&gt; ~ 
<br />
physical supervenience) or with (physical supervenience -&gt; ~ comp).
<br />
Now I take comp, and I prove more (the UDA + Movie graph) gives more 
<br />
information than just the movie graph or Maudlin, and  the acomp
<br />
shows more and less. More in the sense that it gives the precise logic 
<br />
of comp-physical proposition; less because without much remaining work 
<br />
it gives only that. But the puzzle pieces fit enough together to expect 
<br />
some quantum computing provable to appear in the neighborhood of any 
<br />
lobian machines.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You take comp and supervenience as two separate theories, but I would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bet that most computationalists take them as a package deal.
</em><br />
<br />Of course. But they are wrong. That package deal is made of sand. That 
<br />
is my point. Comp and physical supervenience is a bit little &quot;molecular 
<br />
biology&quot; + vitalism.
<br />
The point of the UDA in 8 steps (that is UDA including the 
<br />
movie-graph/maudlin point) is really that nobody can be serious by 
<br />
keeping both comp and physical supervenience. But physical 
<br />
supervenience is obviously an invention of materialist (monist or 
<br />
dualist).
<br />
If we keep comp you can easily understand that we have to go back on 
<br />
computational supervenience, and then we have to explain the origin of 
<br />
the physical laws from that.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; I wonder if we are talking about the same thing, because it doesn't 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;  &gt; seem to me that an empirical proof is needed to show that any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; physical  &gt; process could be seen as implementing any computation.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; This is not obvious at all. You need both empiry + a physical theory  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; about that empiry, just to say that there is a physical process  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; implementing if only one computation (to say nothing about all  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; computations).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; All you need is one physical process.
</em><br />
<br />That is enough for my point.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If consciousness is in no way dependent on the details of this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical process, then the actual physics is irrelevant.
</em><br />
<br />What does that means?  If physical supervenience is correct 
<br />
consciousness has to be described by a non turing emulable *physical 
<br />
process* whatever details are needed or not, a part of it have to 
<br />
include an infinity of details (or it will be computationalist).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Do you see how, aside from one small detail, this is equivalent to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; saying that consciousness is not dependent on any physical process at 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all?
</em><br />
<br />I don't see this (but I see that this is going in the direction I argue 
<br />
it should go).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It doesn't matter if the machine loops, because the one physical state 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can map to many different computational states.
</em><br />
<br />I can only *imagine* this, and this only together with some physical 
<br />
assumption. Remember that one of my goal is to explain what a &quot;physical 
<br />
state&quot; can possibly be. As you know I do not assume physics. I do not 
<br />
assume any physics.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Semantics is arbitrary.
</em><br />
<br />Hmmm... here I see what you mean, but I disagree. You consider some 
<br />
physical state (a fuzzy thing imo) and then *you* consider all the 
<br />
semantics, which *you* interpret as any or many computational states. 
<br />
Perhaps we should go back on the basic assumption.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But if you consider a physical computer the actual states 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; corresponding to the steps of the computation can be arbitrary. They 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will be ordered in a certain consistent way, so we can utilise the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine, but that is just a practical requirement. The natural number 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3 does not have to be written as &quot;3&quot; nor even as &quot;III&quot;; it could be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; written as &quot;II&quot; on a Wednesday, &quot;IIII&quot; if the moon is full and &quot;I&quot; the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rest of the time. This has no effect on the platonic object 3, but it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does affect our ability to communicate and do arithmetic unless we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; keep track of the notation. Similarly with a computation, we need to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be aware of the meaning of the states on a physical computer in order 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to use it, but our awareness of the computer semantics does not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;create&quot; the computation or imbue it with consciousness (if 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computations can be conscious) any more than our awareness of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical notation creates the number 3.
</em><br />
<br /><br />The computational states just need to be *relatively* coherent. I have 
<br />
no idea what you mean by a &quot;physical computer&quot; for the reason that the 
<br />
term &quot;physical&quot; denotes different things relatively to the assumption 
<br />
we do.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why can't the black page contain everything that can possibly be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; written, i.e. it can be a superposition of an infinite number of pages 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with an infinite amount of ink?
</em><br />
<br />You mean a quantum superposition? (then with comp such a superposition 
<br />
really describes an infinity of immaterial computational histories in 
<br />
which each page contains a finite amount of ink. Well it is rather 
<br />
similar with the quantum mechanical superposition).
<br />
<br />The only sense in which (both with quantum field theory AND with the 
<br />
comp-physics) I can accept an infinite information on a black page is 
<br />
related to renormalization problem, spurious infinite energies ....
<br />
<br />But then why to assume a physical world with all those infinities when 
<br />
comp forces us to deal with already enough infinities?
<br />
You loss me I'm afraid. Are you trying to save both comp AND the 
<br />
physical supervenience? We have not yet derive the whole of physics 
<br />
from comp, but we can already expect the &quot;mind-matter&quot; mapping to be 
<br />
something quite complex. For me it is obvious that to a mind state 
<br />
there will be an infinity of &quot;computational states and histories&quot; going 
<br />
through that mind state. The reverse is harder because we are unable 
<br />
(assuming comp) to singularize a &quot;comp-physical states&quot;. Physical 
<br />
states *are* already first person plural (inter-subjective) appearances 
<br />
emerging from the gluing and overlapping of infinities of computations 
<br />
(and thus immaterial(*)). Unless I am wrong, standard computationalism 
<br />
is flawed, like both the monist and dualist doctrine of materialism are 
<br />
flawed.
<br />
It would be wrong to say that comp makes materialism refutated, but for 
<br />
a similar reason that it is wrong to say that bilogy has proves that 
<br />
vitalism is refutated. But biology has made vitalism 
<br />
explanation-useless, and computationalism makes materialism explantion 
<br />
useless too.
<br />
<br />Of course it remains the possibility that comp is incorrect. If comp is 
<br />
true, we have to live with that possibility forever.
<br />
<br />Bruno
