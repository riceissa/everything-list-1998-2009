<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;You ARE doing something speculative whether you admit it or not! And I 
<br />
don't really have to study your argument because
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;it is derived from premises that, you already admitted, are 
<br />
incompatible with the conclusions you claim.
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Please explain what you mean. I have never say I got conclusions 
<br />
incompatible with the premises. I would have concluded the negation of 
<br />
comp. I am open that such event could occur of course, and that is why 
<br />
I say my derivation shows that comp is testable. I try hard to 
<br />
understand what you miss in my posts (not my work!). We are not yet at 
<br />
the point of agreeing about what we are not agreeing upon.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;To be clear my derivation does not involve an atom of speculation. 
<br />
Perhaps you could tell me what is the object of my speculation, but I'm 
<br />
afraid you are only confusing hypothetico-deductive reasoning and 
<br />
speculation (in which case all theories are speculative: in that large 
<br />
sense I agree.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Speculation for me is not a pejorative term, to begin with. Yes, there 
<br />
is a sense in which all theories are speculative but
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;some have ceased to be purely so because either empirical or heuristic 
<br />
evidence was found in their favor. That is the sense
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;in which they are no longer considered speculative. So QM, for 
<br />
example, is no longer called a speculative theory, though
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;people do speculate a lot around it since it poses some serious 
<br />
intepretative problems. The Everett version of QM is either
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;an interpretation of QM or a better theory (let us call it EQM) 
<br />
depending on whom you ask, and that is actually another
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;item of speculation, btw. But the people who claim that EQM is a 
<br />
theory need to come up with feasible empirical tests for
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;which EQM gives predictions distinct from QM. Until these tests are 
<br />
proposed and are performed EQM remains a speculative theory!!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, you start with a number of what you call hypothesis (YD,CT,AR) 
<br />
from which you claim you can derive the *whole of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;physics*. Since I don't know what the *whole of physics* is but I 
<br />
think that QM is likely to be included in it since is the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;less speculative theory we have ever found I take your claim is that 
<br />
you either (1) derive QM as we know it or (2) derive
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;a better theory than QM by which I understand some theory that makes 
<br />
all the same predictions that QM where QM
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;makes right predictions and makes others that QM does not predict or 
<br />
predicts wrong.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;You are also speculating in a narrower sense and that is where I have 
<br />
concentrated my objections, thus far. Though two
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;of your premises (CT &amp; AR) seem quite legitimate to me because, though 
<br />
they remain conjectural, there is some heuristic
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;evidence that favors them, there is one of them, YD, which is purely 
<br />
speculative. To make it precise this is the claim that
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;one can replace the entire experience of a human being by that of a 
<br />
&quot;digital computer&quot; without prejudice to that experience&quot;.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though you seem ambivalent about how necessary this hypothesis is to 
<br />
your derivation of the *whole of physics* you
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;cannot deny that you currently use it as an axiom! You seem also aware 
<br />
of the fact that QM invalidates this hypothesis,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;in other words, if QM is true physics than you cannot accomplish such 
<br />
replacement (which I assume might involve some
<br />
&nbsp;physical interventions).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;From this I see only a couple of ways out: Either
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;1) your derivation leads you not to QM but to a better physical theory 
<br />
with testable empirical predictions that falsify
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;those of QM, presumably including those that lead to the invalidation 
<br />
of YD. I would very much like to see that
<br />
&nbsp;theory if you have it!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;2) you actually prove (by non-QM means, I assume) that YD is 
<br />
empirically implementable and that would only require
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;that you replace the experience of one human being (may I suggest 
<br />
yours?) by a digital computer version of the same.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Of course you can always claim that it has already occurred, as you 
<br />
sometimes suggest and that is cute but just plain silly,
<br />
&nbsp;too. )
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Which is it?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to show you I am not mean spirited may I make the following 
<br />
suggestive question: &quot;Could your argument be
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;made on the basis of something not as drastic as YD, say a Turing Test 
<br />
type argument, which would not require
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;you to take someone apart but just produce a convincing simulation?&quot;. 
<br />
Just a thought...
