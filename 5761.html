<br />
It seems (to me, et al.) that the (supposed) information
<br />
Afshar gets about the &quot;which way&quot; at the screen, is
<br />
different from the usual information about the &quot;which way&quot;
<br />
one gets at the slits, or from the (probabilistic) information
<br />
about the &quot;which way&quot; one can have even before the slits
<br />
(in case of asymmetry). This seems to be the point.
<br />
<br />So there is a problem here. Because we know that information
<br />
about the &quot;which way&quot; at (or before) the slits does destroy
<br />
the interference pattern completely (partially if the
<br />
information has a probabilitic nature).
<br />
<br />On the contrary the &quot;which way&quot; information Afshar thinks he
<br />
gets (via those lenses) at the screen, does not destroy the
<br />
interference pattern (at the wires, which is a different place
<br />
and time from the screen). So how Afshar gets this information?
<br />
Via optics, geometrical optics, straight lines.
<br />
<br />That is to say that a photon goes following straight lines
<br />
between the slit and the detector, but (apparently) goes
<br />
&quot;interferential&quot; at the wires. (I wrote apparently because
<br />
at the wires, imo, there is no measurement, but a &quot;negative&quot;
<br />
or &quot;non-demolitive&quot; or &quot;weak&quot; measurement). All that seems
<br />
not consistent. So the information  Afshar gets at the screen,
<br />
via those lenses, is not real, or proper. Because the conservation
<br />
of momentum (the conservation of distribution of momentum)
<br />
forbids all that, imo.
<br />
<br />----------------
<br />
<br />[fwding what Basil Hiley thinks ...]
<br />
<br />Thanks for the copy of the New Scientist's article about Afshar's
<br />
experiment.  Unfortunately it is no challenge to Bohr's position.
<br />
How on earth does he know the photons arriving at detector 1 come
<br />
from pinhole 1 when both pinholes are open?  You cannot use ray
<br />
optics in the region where the light from the two pinholes overlap
<br />
so you cannot draw any such conclusion.
<br />
<br />Lets look at the claim a little more closely. Afshar is quoted as
<br />
saying &quot;According to my experiment one of the key assumptions about
<br />
quantum theory is wrong.&quot;  Ok what assumption?  The article doesn't say.
<br />
It mutters something about Bohr and goes on to say &quot;When faced with
<br />
a classical apparatus these mysterious quantum entities will either
<br />
show a particle-like or a wave-like face.&quot;  Where has this sloppy
<br />
thinking come from?
<br />
<br />Bohr never said any such thing.  What Bohr actually said was 'However,
<br />
since the discovery of the quantum of action, we know that the classical
<br />
ideal cannot be attained in the description of atomic phenomena. In
<br />
particular, any attempt at an ordering in space-time leads to a break
<br />
in the causal chain, since such an attempt is bound up with an essential
<br />
exchange of momentum and energy between the individuals and the measuring
<br />
rods and clocks used for observation; and just this exchange cannot be
<br />
taken into account if the measuring instruments are to fulfil their purpose.
<br />
Conversely, any conclusion, based in an unambiguous manner upon the
<br />
strict conservation of energy and momentum, with regard to the dynamical
<br />
behaviour of the individual units obviously necessitates a complete
<br />
renunciation of following their course in space and time'. [Bohr, Atomic
<br />
Theory and the Description of Nature, pp. 97-8, Cambridge University Press,
<br />
1934]
<br />
<br />Notice the phrase 'following their course in space and time'. This is
<br />
not a discussion about particles 'behaving only like waves or only like
<br />
particles'. It is about 'following' or 'looking at' the process using
<br />
some suitable instrument.  So if you 'look at' each photon as it passes
<br />
through one pinhole you won't get an interference pattern. Even the Bohm
<br />
approach agrees with that.
<br />
<br />OK after that little rebuff we finally come to Afshar's real claim. It
<br />
is that his experiment is &quot;recording the rate at which photons are coming
<br />
through each pinhole&quot;.  If this statement was correct then it would
<br />
imply that &quot;there should be no interference pattern&quot; where the beams
<br />
overlap. &quot;But there is, Afshar says&quot;.
<br />
<br />Sure there is an interference effect simply because Afshar's
<br />
experiments do not 'follow' anything and they do not 'look at' each
<br />
photon as it  passes through a pinhole. He is simply collecting and
<br />
counting the distribution of photon arrivals at his two detectors.
<br />
Then he makes inferences about what could possibly be going on and
<br />
concludes, incorrectly that a photon detected in the 'photon detector
<br />
for pinhole 1' came from pinhole 1.  However that conclusion is based
<br />
on the assumption that the rays emanating from pinhole 1 arrive at
<br />
the 'photon detector for pinhole 1'. But the ray picture breaks
<br />
down as soon as you enter the region of overlap of the two beams and
<br />
you cannot conclude that the photon entering pinhole 1 arrives at the
<br />
'photon detector for pinhole 1'. You haven't measured which pinhole
<br />
each photon passed through so you have not contradicted Bohr.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately Afshar's conclusion,  &quot;According to my experiment one of
<br />
the key assumptions about quantum theory is wrong&quot; is incorrect.  His
<br />
conclusion is wrong simply because he doesn't understand the physical
<br />
optics that lies behind the experiment he is doing.
