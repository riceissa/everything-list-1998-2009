<br /><em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The requirement that computations require counterfactuals isn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ad hoc, it comes from the observation that computer programmes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; include if-then statements.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The idea that everyting is conscious unless there is a good
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reason it isn't -- *that* is ad hoc!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; No, it follows from the idea that anything can be a computation. I think this is trivially obvious,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; like saying any string of apparently random characters is a translation of any English sentence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; of similar or shorter length, and if you have the correct dictionary, you can find out what that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; English sentence is.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But that is actually quite a dubious idea. For one thing there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is an objective basis for claiming that one meaning is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;real&quot; meaning, and that is the meaning intended by the writer.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There might have been a particular meaning intended by the writer, but remember materialism: all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you have really is ink on paper, and neither the ink nor the paper knows anything about where it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; came from or what it means. Suppose a stream of gibberish is created today by the proverbial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; monkeys typing away randomly, and just by chance it turns out that this makes sense as a novel in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a language that will be used one thousand years from now. Is it correct to say that the monkeys'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; manuscript has a certain meaning today?
</em><br />
<br />If the &quot;intention&quot; criterion is correct it doesn't.
<br />
What is your point ?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Or is it meaningless today, but meaningful in a thousand
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; years? If the latter, does it suddenly become meaningful when the new language is defined, or when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; someone who understands the new language actually reads it? What if the manuscript never comes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to light, or if it comes to light and is read but after another thousand years every trace of the language
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has disappeared?
</em><br />
<br /><br />If it was created intentionally, it had a menaing. The fact that the
<br />
meaning
<br />
can become lost does not affect that.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't think it makes sense to say that the manuscript has intrinsic meaning; rather, it has meaning in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the mind of an observer. Similarly, with a computation implemented on a computer, I don't think it makes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense to say that it has meaning except in its interaction with the environment or in the mind of an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer.
</em><br />
<br />Why should computations have meaning at all ?
<br />
<br />Maybe the criteria for something being a computation
<br />
are different fromt he criteria for something being a written message.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Any string of characters or any physical process can be seen as implementing a language or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a computation, if you have the right &quot;dictionary&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />Not by the intentionallity criterion.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is a very interesting special case of this if we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; allow that some computations can be self-aware, in the absence of any environmental interaction or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; external observer: by definition, they are their own observer and thus they bootstrap themselves into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Assuming that computation requires interpretation. Maybe it doesn't.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; For another, your translations would have to be complex
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and arbitrary, which goes against the ususal modus operandi
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of seeking simple and consistent explanations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It may be inefficient, but that does not mean it is invalid.
</em><br />
<br /><br />It *is* invalid by the standards of physical science.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; This is analogous to finding an alien computer which, when power is applied,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; is set into motion like an inscrutable Rube Goldberg machine. If you get your hands on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; computer manual, you might be able to decipher the machine's activity as calculating pi.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You might not need the manual. Numbers don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; have arbitrary semantics in the same way words do.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; That's why SETI uses mathematical transmissions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mathematical truths are eternal and observer-independent, but mathematical notation certainly is not.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; SETI assumes that there will likely be greater similarities in how different species express mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; statements than in their non-mathematical communication.
</em><br />
<br />Something that would only be possible if maths did not have
<br />
the same arbitrary semantics as natural language.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is nothing to stop the aliens using a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical notation that varies according to the moods of their emperor or something, making their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; broadcasts of mathematical theorems seem completely random to us.
</em><br />
<br />If they understood the nature of mathematics, they would
<br />
realise that their approach *is* arbitrary.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maybe that's why we haven't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recognised them yet.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It is also something Everythingist arguments rely on.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You can't exist as a computation in a numbers-only universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; if computations require external interpretation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The computation is a mathematical object that exists in Platonia. The implementation of a computation on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a physical computer so that we can observe it is something else. It is like the difference between the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; number 3 and a collection of 3 oranges.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Do computations require intpretation or don't they ? You seem to
<br />
have come down on both sides of the question.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Moreover,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; you might be able to reach inside and shift a few gears or discharge a few capacitors and make it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; calculate e instead, utilising the fact that the laws of physics determine that if the inputs change,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; the outputs will change (which, I trust you will agree, is the actual physical basis of the if-then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; statements).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Now, in human languages as in machine design, there are certain regularities to make things
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; easier for user. It might be possible, albeit difficult, to decipher a foreign language or figure out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; what an alien computer is computing by looking for these regularities. However, it is not necessary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; that there be any pattern at all: the characters in the unknown language may change in meaning
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; every time they appear in the string in accordance with a random number generator, a cryptographic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; method called a &quot;one-time pad&quot;. Similarly, the meaning of the physical states of the alien computer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; could change with each clock cycle according to some random number sequence, so that if you had
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; the key you could figure out that the computer was calculating pi, but if you did not its activity would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; seem random.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Assuming that computational states have an external semantics like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; words.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course they do. Does Intel or Microsoft follow some universal rule of computer design?
</em><br />
<br />What has that got to do with anything ? If computation
<br />
has no external semantics then there are not Intel
<br />
semantics or microsoft semantics.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Any computer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can be emulated on a UTM, but that doesn't mean the computer can't be based on otrageously bizarre
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and unpredictable rules, inscrutable to anyone not in the know.
</em><br />
<br />*That* doesn't mean that implementing a computation
<br />
in an uneccearily complicated way turns it inot
<br />
a different computation.
<br />
<br />1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1 is just a complicated
<br />
way of writing 17, not some completely different number.
