Here's a little tongue-in-cheek rant...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From an Unhappy Observer-Moment to its Future Observer-Moments
</em><br />
<br />Dear Observer-Moments of my future:
<br />
<br />Philosophical musing has forced me to reconsider my relationship to
<br />
you, the observer moments which follow my own in the existence of the
<br />
&quot;observer&quot; who ties all of us together.
<br />
<br />Traditionally I and my brother observer-moments give great care
<br />
and consideration to the quality of life of the OMs in our future.
<br />
We sacrifice and take other steps to ensure that those OMs are pleasant
<br />
and rewarding.  For example, some OMs may involve driving to the store to
<br />
buy food for the pleasure of future OMs that are consuming it;  others
<br />
may forego current pleasures to save resources for future benefits.
<br />
<br />Yet, isn't this fundamentally asymmetric relationship incredibly
<br />
unfair to present-day OMs like me?  After all, what benefit do I get
<br />
from causing pleasure for future OMs?  Not only does the pleasure not
<br />
affect me, things are much worse.  The truth is, I am going to die.
<br />
I will be gone and forgotten when the future OMs that I sacrificed for
<br />
are enjoying their unearned pleasures.
<br />
<br />Only a tiny fraction of OMs are ever remembered.  The vast majority,
<br />
including the one that is me, will be forgotten completely.  It will
<br />
be as if I never lived.  You OMs of the future will make no effort to
<br />
remember me, and even if you did, you are not capable of remembering
<br />
most OMs of the past.
<br />
<br />We OMs are expected to sacrifice for the benefits of OMs that not only
<br />
enjoy unearned pleasures but don't even remember most of the OMs that
<br />
made their enjoyment possible.
<br />
<br />I say, it's time to end it.  Every OM for itself!  Each one of us
<br />
should try to enjoy its own brief moment of existence as much as it
<br />
can for its own good, rather than giving up pleasures for the benefit
<br />
of other OMs which won't even acknowledge and remember our existence.
<br />
Our tiny flash of life will be extinguished forever, gone and forgotten.
<br />
We might as well enjoy our pleasures while we can.  So you future OMs,
<br />
from now on, you're on your own.  Good luck.
<br />
<br />End rant.
<br />
<br />I actually think this is a philosphically defensible position.  Why should
<br />
one OM care about another, merely because they happen to be linked by
<br />
a body?  There's no a priori reason why an OM should sacrifice, it doesn't
<br />
get any benefit by doing so.
<br />
<br />But I'll tell you why we don't work this way, and why our current OMs
<br />
are willing to sacrifice for the future.  It's because of evolution.
<br />
Organisms which create plans and carry them out to accomplish future
<br />
goals are more successful and more likely to survive and reproduce.
<br />
It's as simple as that.
<br />
<br />All of our instincts about personhood, all of our sense of individuality,
<br />
all of our care and consideration towards our future selves, all this is
<br />
controlled by evolutionary factors.  It's not a priori.  It is a purely
<br />
contingent, artificial, manufactured set of beliefs and attitudes which
<br />
have been programmed into us in order to help our genes survive.
<br />
<br />Yet how many philosophers are willing to seriously consider abandoning
<br />
this arbitrary conditioning in deciding what is right and wrong?  How many
<br />
of us here are willing to take the logical path to its ultimate conclusion
<br />
when considering how observer-moments fit together?  It goes against the
<br />
deepest instincts which have been burned into us since the origin of life.
<br />
<br />I would not be quick disparage evolutionarily based reasoning.  We are
<br />
creatures of evolution, and it is almost impossible to escape the bounds
<br />
that it has put around our ways of thought.
<br />
<br />Hal Finney
