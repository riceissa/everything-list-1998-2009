<br />
When Bruno spoke of the &quot;ASSA&quot; I looked up some messages in this list
<br />
dealing with the ASSA and RSSA. My message does not aim at initiating
<br />
yet another controversial discussion of the subject. But I rather hope
<br />
that you will assist me resolving a misunderstanding.
<br />
<br />Searching for the self-sampling assumption in Wikipedia leads to the
<br />
definition:
<br />
<br />&quot;Each observer moment should reason as if it were randomly selected
<br />
from the class of all observer moments in its reference class.&quot;
<br />
<br />What remains unclear in this definition is the term &quot;reference class&quot;
<br />
which is also the source of the ASSA/RSSA debate. When we want to know
<br />
which observer moment to expect &quot;next&quot;, we look at the class of all
<br />
observer moments provided with a measure. The ASSA applies a uniform
<br />
measure over all observer moments, whereas supporters of the RSSA may
<br />
for example apply the Born rule to the class of observer moments given
<br />
by quantum theory. That's an outline of how I understand it.
<br />
<br />I have serious problems with this kind of reasoning. It suggests the
<br />
misleading idea of some entity (let's call it the &quot;self&quot;) jumping from
<br />
one observer moment to the next. In general, this is a very
<br />
questionable concept, of course. I feel satisfied with the idea that
<br />
the observer moments don't come up with a measure by themselves and
<br />
that nothing at all is jumping.
<br />
<br />We will introduce measures for practical reasons depending on the
<br />
problem we are concerned with. The same holds for the study of chains
<br />
of observer moments. In each case, I will find it useful to introduce
<br />
different concepts that will show resemblance to the ASSA or RSSA.
<br />
<br />1st problem: &quot;What will I experience next?&quot;
<br />
<br />I refused the idea of the 'self' being an entity jumping between
<br />
observer moments. So the word &quot;I&quot; does not refer to something fixed.
<br />
It is a vague perception of self-identification (e.g. to be Youness
<br />
Ayaita) that is part of the current observer moment. If we consider
<br />
the evolution of the observer from a third person perspective (within
<br />
our world and its usual dynamics), then we will see how the observer
<br />
changes with time. Though, as far as his capacity for remembering did
<br />
not disappear, the observer will still find within himself the old
<br />
self-identification. This self-identification makes the observer have
<br />
the feeling that his identity is something constant which is
<br />
preserved. This feeling gives a meaningful understanding of the word
<br />
&quot;I&quot; in the question of interest. By the word &quot;I&quot; the question
<br />
restricts the class of observer moments to those who share the
<br />
mentioned self-identification, e.g. to be Youness Ayaita. This class
<br />
probably consists for the most part of observers that other observers
<br />
would identify as Youness Ayaita, too.
<br />
<br />The word &quot;next&quot; (despite of the fact that it makes only sense in
<br />
worlds with time) leads to a further restriction to the class of
<br />
observer moments: The observer moment to choose must include the
<br />
memory that the last experience was to ask the question: &quot;What will I
<br />
experience next?&quot; The small subclass we have now typically corresponds
<br />
to what we would expect from quantum theory. The measure that comes up
<br />
with it corresponds to the Born rule.
<br />
Nonetheless, the Born rule is not of general applicability here. For
<br />
example, if the observer falls into coma and wakes up some years later
<br />
or if he is frozen for some time in some futuristic machine, the
<br />
observer moments waking up at a later time must have a nonzero measure
<br />
as well. On the contrary, if the observer experiences a dangerous
<br />
accident losing his capacity for remembering, the observer moment
<br />
after the accident has a zero measure for the question of interest.
<br />
<br />To summarize, we see that a specific question leads to a specific
<br />
measure. In this case, we get a result usually assigned to the RSSA.
<br />
<br />2nd problem: Having had an accident that led to the loss of his
<br />
capacity for remembering, an observer asks himself (before noticing
<br />
his environment): &quot;Who am I?&quot;
<br />
<br />In this case, the self-identification process failed. Thus, the word
<br />
&quot;I&quot; cannot be refered to a self-identification but rather to the
<br />
identification by other observers. The class of observer moments of
<br />
interest is restricted: We are only interested in conscious observers
<br />
that don't have a self-identification process. Thus, in worlds similar
<br />
to ours we would assign a non-zero measure to all observer moments
<br />
waking up after such an accident or having lost their capability of
<br />
self-identification due to some kind of mental illness. This measure
<br />
has nothing in common with the quantum mechanical Born rule.
<br />
<br /><pre>
----
So, I don't see any need for some kind of fundamental measure for
observer moments. Whenever we have a restriction defining a subclass
of observer moments that are of interest, we are naturally driven to
the RSSA and to a specific measure. If we have no restriction, then we
assign equal measure to all observer moments leading to the ASSA. I do
not see the categorical difference between the two concepts. Can you
make clear where the difference lies?
Thank you
Youness Ayaita
