<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;How about this? For ten million dollars, would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;you agree to have the last ten minutes of your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;memory erased, where you are now?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; These are all interesting questions that have bothered me for a long time. I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think the most useful suggestion I can make about how to decide whether 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other versions of a person are or aren't &quot;continuers&quot; or the &quot;same person&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is to avoid a direct answer at all and ask - as you have done - how much 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; memory loss a person would tolerate before they felt they would not be the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;same&quot; person.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, it's a key question. All we can assert for sure is
<br />
that gradually between 0% and 100% it pays less and less
<br />
to think that you're the same person. The same answer
<br />
obtains if we measure in terms of how much recent memory
<br />
could be lost: on this, I happen to feel that I am about
<br />
fifty percent the same person at 18 that I am now.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 10 minutes of memory loss for ten million dollars is an offer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would definitely take up; in fact, people pay 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to get drunk on a Friday night and suffer more memory loss than this.
</em><br />
<br />Right.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Before you ask, this raises another interesting question: would I agree for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the same amount of money to be painlessly killed 10 minutes after being 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; duplicated? Given that I believe my duplicate provides seamless continuity 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of consciousness from the point of duplication, this should be the same as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; losing 10 minutes of memory. However, I would probably balk at being 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;killed&quot; if it were happening for the first time, and I might hesitate even 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if I knew that it had happened to me many times before.
</em><br />
<br />Well, the biggest point of philosophy for me is that it be
<br />
prescriptive.  Suppose that you have to figure out all this
<br />
ahead of time---or would you prefer just to go with a gut
<br />
instinct when the time comes?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yet another variation: for 10 million dollars, would you agree to undergo a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; week of excruciating pain, and then have the memory of the week wiped?
</em><br />
<br />No.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What if you remember agreeing to this 100 times in the past; that is, you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; remember agreeing to it, then a moment later experiencing a slight 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discontinuity, and being given the ten million dollars (which let's say you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; gambled all away).
</em><br />
<br />This is a horrific situation that I would put a stop to
<br />
if I could. One of my old thought experiments was that
<br />
you start noticing a $1000 increase in your bank account
<br />
every day.  Then after a month or so, you learn that you
<br />
are every night being awakened and tortured for an hour,
<br />
and then the memory is erased.
<br />
<br />My way of looking at it provides a clear answer: you are
<br />
your duplicates, and so just because you don't remember
<br />
something doesn't mean that it didn't happen (or isn't
<br />
happening) to you.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; These are not trivial questions. The basic problem is that our minds have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evolved in a world where there is no copying and no memory loss (memory loss 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; may have occurred naturally, of course, but evolution's answer to it would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have been to wipe out the affected individual and their genes), so there is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a mismatch between reason and intuition.
</em><br />
<br />Well, it's time to at least be verbally able to prescribe what
<br />
one would do. The flat, linear model suggests that more good
<br />
runtime for me is good, less is worse, and bad runtime is worst
<br />
of all.
<br />
<br />I think that if it is given that either you or your duplicate
<br />
must die, then you should willingly sacrifice yourself if it will
<br />
enrich your duplicate.
<br />
<br />Either way, I think you wake up the next morning very satisfied
<br />
with the outcome.
<br />
<br />Lee
