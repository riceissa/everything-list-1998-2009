Hi Abram,
<br />
<br />I agree mostly with Brent's reply. Other precision should appear in my  
<br />
explanation of the UDA to Kim, and in my answer to Ronald (Sunday).
<br />
I will just add general remarks to Brent's reply.
<br />

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [Sorry if this is a duplicate, I think that I did not send correctly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the first time.]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno, everyone,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I've decided that it will be more productive/entertaining to post my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; various concerns as a new topic.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What is time?
</em><br />
<br />Third person sharable time could be an illusion. It seems to me that  
<br />
QM + General Relativity could lead to the idea that there is no real  
<br />
&quot;physical time&quot;. With MEC this is a direct consequence of the UDA.
<br />
First person time, or subjective, akin to Bergson notion of &quot;duration&quot;  
<br />
can be explained in the AUDA. It appears that the formal notion of  
<br />
first person leads naturally toward a temporal logic. Like in  
<br />
Plotinus, the &quot;soul&quot; is the creator of time.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm going to ask a bunch of questions; for the sake of brevity, I'm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; going to skip my arguments (which would mostly be reasons why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particular answers don't work). I'll argue once someone replies.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If all possible universes exist, does that mean every possible moment,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or every possible timeline of moments? If &quot;moments&quot; is the answer,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then how are the moments connected? How would it matter, since the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moments already are what they are? If &quot;timeline&quot; is the answer, then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is a similar question of how it matters.
</em><br />
<br /><br />What do you mean by &quot;how it matters&quot;? It is a bit like free will. It  
<br />
exists because from our points of view we cannot know the &quot;end of the  
<br />
novel&quot;.
<br />
That ignorance, and thus free will is preserved by the mechanist  
<br />
hypothesis. It is even made intrinsical.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If there is a physical universe, then is there some sort of basic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical connection behind time?
</em><br />
<br />Open and difficult problem for the physics you can extract from comp.  
<br />
Of course, if there is a primary physical universe, we have to resolve  
<br />
the problem of marrying QM and GR before being able to answer your  
<br />
question. Very difficult question.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If the universe is mathematical in nature, then what is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical connection between moments? What sort of mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; connection counts as time?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I would say that it is logic-mathematical connections. With MEC those  
<br />
relations eventually originates with the natural number successor  
<br />
relation.
<br />
I will say a bit more sunday in my answer to Ronaheld. The problem is  
<br />
that it is hard not being a bit technical here. You have to understand  
<br />
the mathematical concept of computation, and then to understand that  
<br />
those computations exists in arithmetic, and indeed are accessible  
<br />
through proof in a very tiny part of arithmetic: the theorems of  
<br />
Robinson Arithmetic (RA). RA is Peano Arithmetic *without* the  
<br />
induction axioms.
<br />
PA is the lobian machine. And RA generated all the histories which  
<br />
notably contain all the Lobian machines. RA simulates PA like I can  
<br />
simulate Einstein's brain, or a Chinese brain. This is a subtle point  
<br />
where people do sometimes the Error of Searle with his Chinese Room.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If (as was recently suggested, in connection with relativity) time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cannot really be divided into individual moments, then what is it?
</em><br />
<br /><br />It is an ordering on machine knowledge states, and/or observation  
<br />
states.  It is a very complex ordered structure (should be isomorphic  
<br />
to the lattice of open sets in a complex topological space and/or  
<br />
Hilbert Space). I approach the math of those spaces with the modal  
<br />
logic of self-reference and their intensional variants.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why do we experience time passing?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Each of our knowledge state are relative state generated by &quot;a most  
<br />
probable computation&quot; (generated by the UD, or living in arithmetic).  
<br />
Mainly by ignorance, we feel our knowledge being divided into a sort  
<br />
of past-certainty, and sort of future-uncertainty. Those things can be  
<br />
described by modal logic. I argue all those modal logic arise from  
<br />
self-reference in arithmetic.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is it legitimate to think as if the next moment we experience will be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; chosen randomly in some sense?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes. I believe everyone in this list agree with this, but differ on  
<br />
the distribution law, the relative or absolute nature of the  
<br />
probabilities, and about the nature of the events on which the  
<br />
probability bears on.
<br />
In the case of comp, I argue (through UDA+AUDA) that our next  
<br />
experience is chosen randomly on the set of all computations going  
<br />
through our actual state which have been generated by the UD, or are  
<br />
&quot;living&quot; in that tiny arithmetic.
<br />
There are 2^aleph_0 histories. The measure should be non constructive  
<br />
(thus physics cannot be entirely described by a program or machine)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Does probability or randomness have a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; role to play in the flow of time?
</em><br />
<br /><br />I would say yes, given that once a universal machine observes itself  
<br />
it separates a growing &quot;past&quot; from a growing &quot;future&quot;.
<br />
There is a sort of self-diffraction: the better a machine observes  
<br />
itself, the bigger is the set of possible futures (consistent  
<br />
continuations of computations) she gets.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In connection with UDA: what is the meaning of a first-person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probability due to uncertainty of the future?
</em><br />
<br /><br />I will explain this soon to Kim. I suggest you ask in the case this  
<br />
remains unclear, or if you have objection. It is not possible to  
<br />
explain this shortly.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is there any sense in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which such estimates can be more or less accurate if all possible next
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moments do in fact occur?
</em><br />
<br /><br />All what we have to do consists in finding discrepancies between the  
<br />
theory and the observations. I bet QM is correct, so I tend to bet  
<br />
that the comp estimation of the possible moments will give the same  
<br />
estimation than QM.  This would explain where QM comes from. This  
<br />
remains to be seen of course, but formally, preliminary modest results  
<br />
are going in that direction. Bits and Qubits comes from each other.
<br />
<br />Hope this short answer to difficult questions can help. I will say  
<br />
more to Ronald Sunday, and I invite you to follow the KIM thread where  
<br />
I explain UDA. And perhaps then I can explain AUDA with the amount of  
<br />
technical details demanded.
<br />
<br /><br />Bruno
