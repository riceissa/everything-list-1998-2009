&quot;Jesse Mazer&quot; &lt;lasermazer.domain.name.hidden&gt;:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [Position 1]  makes the belief that a system *has* subjective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience a subjective matter...whereas I believe that the fact that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am conscious is an &quot;objective&quot; truth, in the sense that it would be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; true regardless of what anyone else believes.
</em><br />
<br />YOU (as conventionally interpreted) believe you are conscious, we
<br />
agree on that.  The existence of your consciousness under the
<br />
interpretation is objective.  And YOU most always (with exceptions
<br />
like unconsciousness and perhaps some meditative states) maintain
<br />
that interpretation.
<br />
But you don't seem to agree with me that the interpretation itself is
<br />
a subjective matter.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I think it's possible a system that is attributed subjective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience might not actually have it, at least not in the way people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think.  For example, I doubt that a lookup table would have much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subjective experience,
</em><br />
<br />The reward for legitimizing interpretations in which the humongous
<br />
lookup table is as conscious as any other implementation of a given AI
<br />
program is consistency and evaporation of much of the elusiveness of
<br />
consciousness.  I've become very comfortable with that, at first blush
<br />
counterintuitive, consequence.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the same way that a recording of a person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probably doesn't have its own subjective experience.  Likewise, if I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attribute feelings to a stuffed animal, I'm probably wrong.
</em><br />
<br />Why do you think you're wrong?  I argued as forcefully as I could
<br />
about a year ago on this list and also in the last chapter of my
<br />
&quot;Robot&quot; book that allowing interpretationions like these (and
<br />
arbitrarily more extreme cases like Putnam's rock) does not lead to
<br />
intellectual or moral disaster.  On the contrary, it makes sense of
<br />
issues that the intuitive positions endlessly muddle.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  But #1 says it's meaningless to talk about the &quot;truth&quot; of these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; questions, just like it's meaningless to ask whether Shakespeare is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;really&quot; a better author than Danielle Steele.
</em><br />
<br />It's not meaningless, but you have to agree on an interpretation to
<br />
get a meaning.  My wife and I often discuss the feelings and
<br />
motivations of characters in fiction.  These are not meaningless
<br />
discussions: there interpretations (which I can claim to be Platonic
<br />
worlds as solid as any) in which the characters are as real as you or
<br />
I.  It is possible to gain emotional therapy by unloading one's
<br />
innermost concerns on a teddy bear interpreted as thoughtful listener.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But #1 doesn't just say that conducting a long personal relationship
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with a system is a good test of consciousness (which I believe)...it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; says that there's nothing to test, because attributing consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to a system is a purely aesthetic decision.  Even an omniscient God
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could not tell you the &quot;truth&quot; of the matter, if #1 is correct.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I have come to strongly believe there is no truth to the matter that
<br />
is independent of interpretation.  But within an interpretation ...
<br />
<br />Aesthetic decisions matter, in life as in house decorating!
<br />
Different contexts reward different interpretations.  Movies are more
<br />
enjoyable if you interpret the characters as consciously real.  Teddy
<br />
bears are better listeners.  But if you're a movie maker, you will be
<br />
more effective if you spend a lot of your time in interpretations
<br />
where the movie is a sequence of contrived scenes and dialog spoken by
<br />
carefully cued actors.  And if you're a teddy bear engineer, much of
<br />
the time you will interpret the bears as contrived assemblies of inert
<br />
materials.
<br />
<br />If you interpret the human beings you meet everyday as nothing more
<br />
than ugly bags of mostly water, you'll likely be led to acts that will
<br />
land you in jail or worse.  Human consciousness is a socially agreed
<br />
on and enforced interpretation, which I'm happy to go along with.
<br />
<br />But it is not a uniquely valid interpretation, and there are
<br />
circumstances in which other interpretations are more useful.  For
<br />
instance, while you're undergoing surgery it's probably best for the
<br />
medical team to interpret you as a physical mechanism, a chain of
<br />
cause and effect, whose normal functioning they strive to restore, a
<br />
class of interpretation will become ever more effective as computer
<br />
models of the human body become more accurate and detailed.
