<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;I'm not sure what you mean by much of the above.  e.g. 3rd person,

<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Just take 3rd person as &quot;objective&quot; like in Everett thesis, and 1st
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;person as Everett &quot;subjective&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everett is discussed below; he does _not_ believe in your &quot;1st person&quot; 
<br />
by another name &quot;subjective&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;BM: Implementation must be some sort of relative computations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;I don't know what you mean by the above
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;But what do *you* mean by implementation ?
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A relationship between a computation and another mathematical structure, 
<br />
in which the properties of the latter are similar in the right ways 
<br />
(presumably a mapping satisfying restrictions) to the former that for many 
<br />
practical purposes (such as consciousness) we can regard the existance of 
<br />
the latter as having the same effect as the existance of the former, in 
<br />
addition to any other possible effects such as those due to considering more 
<br />
than one implementation mapping.  You know where to find my thoughts on how 
<br />
to restrict the mappings.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;OK. What I was trying to say is that I take arithmetical truth as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;something independent of myself, although I am &quot;in there&quot; with all the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;rest.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sounds like Platonism, but doesn't define existence.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;It is not always obvious whether a given description is consistent or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not, and one way discussion of such a question is often framed is in terms 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of whether the hypothetical structure that would be described 'exists'.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(e.g. &quot;Does a power series expansion for f(x) exist?&quot;)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;OK. What's the point?
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does &quot;exist&quot; mean in the above?  Does it suggest a weak form of 
<br />
existence?  That's the point.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I don't take a word like Earth as granted in a metaphysical argument.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But I agree that the ten thousand earth and their variants exists in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Plato's heaven.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is 10,000 such an important number for you?  Surely 666 is the only 
<br />
# that holds the key to existence.  (Just kidding!)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Except that U is undefined. All Universes are indeed in Plato's heaven, but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;none are material. They appears material to their inhabitant, that's all.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suppose instead they are all &quot;material&quot; by hypothetical logical 
<br />
necessity.  Tell me what would be different.  (i.e. define &quot;material&quot;.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Unlike the classical position, this requires a unique and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;inevitable *measure distribution* on the set of mathematical structures.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;No. measure are relevant for inhabitant relatively to their computational 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;histories. And that need &quot;trans-univers&quot; reasoning. (A good thing, because 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;without that there would be no hope for a computationalist explanation of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;quantum interferences).
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess by &quot;relatively&quot; you mean there is no objective measure 
<br />
distribution.  Sorry, that won't cut it.  Without an objective measure 
<br />
distribution you can say nothing about what a typical observer would see.  
<br />
(For example, you can't explain Darwin.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;    We would certainly like to be able to do that.  Unfortunately, as I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have argued in other posts, the AUH is not falsifiable, so even if we prove 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that F=ma is very unlikely for us to see with the AUH, we are still stuck 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with the AUH.  But it would be very unsatisfactory, of course.  We need to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;derive F=ma not to prove the AUH, but to make ourselves happy with it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The &quot;All Computation + comp&quot; *is* quasi-falsifiable. Mmmh...
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How?  (I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;comp&quot; though, since you like to 
<br />
talk about whether &quot;you&quot; survive substitutions but did not define &quot;you&quot;.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;    For me the key word is &quot;appearances&quot;.  I am sure Everett did NOT 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;believe in any discontinuous or probabilistic elements in his 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interpetation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;First I agree with Bryce Dewitt that Everett did not propose an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interpretation of QM. Everett proposes only a new formulation which is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;essentially SE+COMP.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Then he explicitely derives the Wave reduction as a subjective process, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;from an analysis of the memories of normal (Gaussian) classical machines, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;embedded in a universal quantum computation. (I show the last is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;redundant).
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are throwing out undefined terms left and right.  Everett never 
<br />
defined &quot;machines&quot;, which is why his formulation leads to &quot;paradoxes&quot; like a 
<br />
stationary state being able to be &quot;conscious&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;    My interpretation of Everett is proved by his statement that &quot;The 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;behavior of these observers shall always be treated within the framework of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;wave mechanics.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Exactly. Behavior is typically objective/third person. I agree with this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reading of Everett.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not mean just externally observable behavior, BTW.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;This indicates that he did NOT intend to introduce any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;&quot;mind-like hidden variables&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Obviously.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; - and thus, no &quot;1st person&quot; merde about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;consciousness &quot;flowing&quot; from one observer-moment to another.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The flowing of consciousness is part of the appearances.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I still don't figure out why you want dismiss those appearances so much.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Especially talking on Everett who cares so much about it.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, memory (which he deals with) is nothing like the kind of &quot;flow&quot; 
<br />
QTI freaks talk about.  Certainly &quot;1st person probabilities&quot; are in no way 
<br />
created by the illusion that what you remember is being another thought than 
<br />
you really are.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;In my thought experience (UDA and the like) I use *exactly* the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;Everett notion of subjective/objective. I call them first person and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;third person as in classical philosophy of mind.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;    You just don't understand Everett, it appears.  As far as I can tell, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;his beliefs were normal (as opposed to crackpot/1st person/mind-like hidden 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;variable/QTI).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Everett derives the first person plural probability from the third
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;person SE.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NO!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He 'derived' objective effective probabilities, &quot;3rd person&quot; in your 
<br />
strange language (and I don't mean French).  ('' indicate his derivation 
<br />
itself was flawed, but that's not important here.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Why do you mix hidden variable into that. You *know* I think that hidden 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;variable *are* crackpot.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You need to realize that the notion of &quot;1st person&quot; used on this list is 
<br />
just an extra-crackpot version of mind-like hidden variables that has no 
<br />
basis in objective reality:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consciousness does _not_ magically &quot;flow&quot; from one thought to any other 
<br />
thoughts that could concievably take place in a future version of a computer 
<br />
that could have given rise to the first thought.  If a person is killed, the 
<br />
total measure decreases; his &quot;soul&quot; (hidden variable) does not jump into his 
<br />
twin.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember, if we are given the state of the universe at a time after the 
<br />
first guy was killed, we may never know he even existed.  Therefore, only a 
<br />
hidden variable could explain an alleged increase in the measure of the 
<br />
twin.  Remember also that determinism is maintained at all times even in 
<br />
matters of consciousness.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;there is an objective measure distribution, therefore no QTI or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;other '1st person' nonsense.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I agree there is an objective measure distribution on the possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;relative consistent extension of my computational histories.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's not an objective measure distribution if it depends on you.  I 
<br />
said there is one unique objective measure distribution - if you don't 
<br />
believe it you must believe in hidden variables and other crackpot nonsense. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no other consistent possibility (except, you could believe in 
<br />
both).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;If you say, prior to the duplication &quot;I will either end up
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;    It all really depends on the definition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;of &quot;me&quot;.  At this point I can think of three reasonable ways to define 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it, but none of them would lead to that statement.  The simplest definition 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is to define 'me' as a thought; then I exist only for a moment and never 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;leave my home city.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Ridiculous, I am not talking to a thought.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For practical purposes, of course we identify a person with a body that 
<br />
gives rise to many thoughts.  But that's not fundamental and breaks down in 
<br />
cases like the duplication experiment.  Your reaction is itself ridiculous, 
<br />
not the conservative definition of 'me' as a thought.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;    The closest to what you want would be to define 'me' as a particular 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;implementation of a computation.  I believe that in this case, some of 'us' 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would die, some of us would end up in Moscow, while the rest of 'us' would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;end up in Washington.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;With comp you cannot be a particular implementation of a computation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;You can perhaps say that you are an infinity of similar computation all 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;speculating apparently about the existence of some magical singularising 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;implementation&quot;. With comp, below our level of substitution, we live (or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;we&quot; supervene) on all possible implementations. That is why we &quot;discover&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;parallel histories when we look &quot;outside&quot; or &quot;inside&quot; close enough.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sounds a bit like my third proposed definition, but since you reject 
<br />
that below, I don't know what you mean.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;    Finally, I could define 'me' as the set of all such implementations.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Then I should say &quot;I will feel myself ending up in Washington and not in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Moscow, _as well as_ in Moscow and not in Washington.&quot;  (In different 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observer-moments, of course.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;And this makes sense for the &quot;panscient spectator&quot;, in a third person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sense. Nothing really related to you.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't see why it's any differently related to you than the past is.  
<br />
It's all just definitions.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; What does differentiate different people?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Memories. Cosmological, genetical, individual memories. I would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;say. Most of the time there are organized into histories, so I could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have said simply: Histories. Isn't it?
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suppose my memory is a set of bits.  A cosmic ray comes in and flips one 
<br />
bit.  Did the ray kill me and create a new person?  If so, OK, but no QTI.  
<br />
If not what if it keeps happening?  I could end up with identical memories 
<br />
to a completely different person.  So, really, there is no distinction 
<br />
between 2 people.
