<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am an Italian student of Cosmology and it is the first time I write
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something in this mailing list. I didn't have the time to read all your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; messages, so I don't know if my thought about multiverses is a new one or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not. Anyway I would like to propose you my reflection about this topic.
</em><br />
<br />Welcome to the list!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; My reasoning is rather simple. Dealing with an infinite level 1
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multiuniverse, if an event, even an improbable one, doesn't violate any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pshysical laws, it necessarly has to happen infinite times and in infinite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different points of the space.
</em><br />
<br />I think your reasoning is valid, there will be observers who see various
<br />
physical laws being violated.  However I disagree with some of your
<br />
conclusions:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  From all these examples we should deduce that, if all the infinite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observers we have considered took advantage of the same approach we have,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they would obtain very different interpretations. So the model seems to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; admit in itself the chance of being wrong. It is consistent with its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; foundamental hypotheses the fact that it is inconsistent. So here we have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the paradox. But shall we put into discussion our experimental method just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because some unlucky observers are not in the condition to understand the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe and the way it works?
</em><br />
<br />What is the paradox here?  Are you saying that our deduction that we
<br />
live in a level 1 multiverse (i.e. one which is infinitely large and
<br />
full of stars and planets much like our own) is possibly wrong?  That may
<br />
be true but it doesn't strike me as a paradox.  All of our reasoning is
<br />
potentially wrong; we may be delusional, we may be misinterpreting our
<br />
results, we may be unlucky and atypical (for example, earthlike planets
<br />
may be enormously less likely than we imagine).  The possibility of
<br />
being wrong is fundamental to scientific and philosophical inquiry.  I
<br />
don't see that this new source of potential wrongness rises to the
<br />
level of a paradox.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  At last we could object that all of this is admitted by our own model
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and, if this absurdity really happened, we should only notice that we live
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in a very improbable universe. But if it was true, it would be completely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unuseful for us to keep our mathematics and physics. For instance, if we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; started, by chance, to obtain number 6 any time we throw a die, and if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this would be like that till the end of time, it would be unuseful for us
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to go on considering the theory of probability as valid. There would be no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense for us to think of having 1/6 of chances to obtain number 6, seen
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that we would obtain it in any case.
</em><br />
<br />The problem with this reasoning is that there are many more observers
<br />
who see the laws of physics violated only rarely than those who see them
<br />
violated continually.  Let's suppose that suddenly we start observing
<br />
a violation, like suddenly we get a 6 every time anyone throws a dice.
<br />
Now, looking forward, there are universes where that odd behavior
<br />
continues forever, and universes where that behavior stops and we go
<br />
back to the normal laws of probability.  The point is that the second
<br />
set of universes is overwhelmingly more numerous than the first.  (If you
<br />
are concerned about comparing infinite universes, consider looking at a
<br />
large but finite volume of the universe, as the volume goes to infinity.)
<br />
<br />So in fact we would be correct at every point to expect the normal laws
<br />
of physics to resume, because enormously more copies of ourselves will
<br />
find that to happen than those who find the violations to continue.
<br />
