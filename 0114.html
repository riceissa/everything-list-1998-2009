I found an especially interesting paragraph in David Albert and Barry
<br />
Loewer's paper on their many-minds interpretation of quantum mechanics.
<br />
The paper is &quot;Interpreting the Many Worlds Interpretation&quot; in Synthese 77
<br />
(1988) 195-213.
<br />
<br />(begin quote)
<br />
One assumption, perhaps the most disturbing aspect of the dualism, is that
<br />
there is a matter of fact concerning whether or not a mind associated with
<br />
a brain at one time is the same mind as one associated with the brain at a
<br />
different time. This assumption violates the supervenience of the mental
<br />
on the physical since the evolution of the physical state of the universe
<br />
does not determine such identities. (On the other hand, as we previously
<br />
saw, the proportion of minds in various mental states associated with a
<br />
brain at a given time does supervene on the physical state of the brain,
<br />
or brain plus environment.) We could effect a partial retreat from this
<br />
dualism by postulating that associated with a brain at any one time is a
<br />
set of &quot;momentary minds&quot; while not postulating that there is a matter of
<br />
fact that a mind (associated with a particular brain) at one moment is
<br />
trans-temporal identical with a mind (associated with the same brain) at
<br />
another moment. However, the cost of surrendering the &quot;trans-temporal
<br />
identy of minds&quot; would seem to be that we can no longer make sense of
<br />
statements like &quot;the probability that *I* will observe spin up on
<br />
measurement is p&quot; since such statements seem to presuppose that it makes
<br />
sense to talk of a single mind persisting through time. Perhaps, however,
<br />
it could be argued (though we will not do so here) that the conception of
<br />
a mind persisting through time is an illusion; one that results from the
<br />
fact that &quot;most&quot; momentary minds will be associated with brain states
<br />
which record a &quot;personal&quot; history and so it will seem to such a mind that
<br />
it has existed as a persisting entity.
<br />
(p 210-211)
<br />
<br />It seems to me the situation is worse than Albert and Loewer suppose. Not
<br />
only does the quantum mechanical formalism not determine trans-temporal
<br />
identity of minds (in the sense of the many-minds interpretation), it does
<br />
not even determine the trans-temporal identity of brains, because at
<br />
different moments a brain could be made of completely &quot;different&quot;
<br />
particles, thus one could not say (without some nonphysical theory of
<br />
brain identity) that two brain states at different times belong to the
<br />
same brain. This is obvious if for example the brain is implemented as
<br />
a computational process that migrates to a different computer after each
<br />
state evolution. Without trans-temporal identity of brains, we would need
<br />
an explicit theory of trans-temporal mind identity, which Albert and
<br />
Loewer do not give, instead of simply supposing that such identities
<br />
exist. But things are even worse than that. Even if we *did* have
<br />
a theory of trans-temporal brain/mind identity, we would still not be able
<br />
to consistently assign probabilities to statements like &quot;I will observe
<br />
spin up&quot; because of the possibility of death or brain duplication.
<br />
<br />So perhaps we should take the &quot;momentary minds&quot; view more seriously. The
<br />
fact that we can't make sense of the probability of &quot;I will observe X&quot; on
<br />
this view should not count against it because we can't assign these
<br />
probabilities in any case. However all is not lost. Although we can't make
<br />
sense of predictive probabilities, probability theory can still be used
<br />
for explanation. The &quot;momentary minds&quot; view gives us a probability
<br />
distribution for current perception and memories, so we can talk about the
<br />
probability for &quot;I observe X given that I remember perceiving Y.&quot; I
<br />
propose that we will have explained &quot;why I observe X&quot; if we understand the
<br />
process that generates the probability distribution and can show that the
<br />
probability for observing X is high compared to the probabilities for
<br />
other possible perceptions.
