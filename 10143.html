Dear Stathis,
<br />
you touched a 'conscious/' nerve in me.
<br />
Let me concentrate on your text and interleave my remarks and questions.

Stathis's text:
<br />
----------------
<br />
It's one thing to say that consciousness has evolved to interact with
<br />
the world, would not develop in a particular individual without the
<br />
appropriate interaction, and wouldn't be of much use without the
<br />
possibility of such interaction, but quite another thing to say that
<br />
therefore it *must* be this way. We can only deduce that there is a
<br />
physical world out there on the basis of patterns of neurons firing in
<br />
our cerebral cortex.
<br />
<br />[JM]:
<br />
&quot;to interact&quot; looks to me as a purpose, what I don't find in the natural 
<br />
processes, only consequences (for change). And does your &quot;on the basis&quot; mean 
<br />
origination - source? or at the most a parallel phenomenon to who knows 
<br />
what? I know you meant it, but you ose us to point out the 'reasons' for 
<br />
those firings. In this way somebody could think on an 'inside' generated 
<br />
image of &quot;reality&quot; one thinks about.
<br />
*
<br />
St:
<br />
Are you suggesting that a brain with the same
<br />
pattern of neurons firing, but without the appropriate environmental
<br />
stimulus, would not have exactly the same conscious experience?
<br />
<br />[JM]:
<br />
Show me, I am an experimentalist.  First show two brains with the same 
<br />
pattern of  (ALL!)   neuron firings. Two extracted identical firings in a 
<br />
superdupercomplex brain is meaningless.
<br />
Then, please, show me (experimentally) the non-identity of environmental 
<br />
impacts reaching 2 different brains from the unlimited interaction of the 
<br />
totality.
<br />
(I wrote already that I do not approve thought-experiments).
<br />
You felt like that in the following sentence:
<br />
*
<br />
St:
<br />
That would imply some sort of extra-sensory perception, and there is
<br />
no evidence for such a thing. It is perfectly consistent with all the facts
<br />
to say that consciousness results from patterns of neurons firing in the
<br />
brain, and that if the same neurons fired, the same experience would
<br />
result regardless of what actually caused those neurons to fire.
<br />
<br />[JM]:
<br />
regardless also of the 'rest of the brain'? Would you pick one of the 
<br />
billions copmpleting the brainwork complexity and match it to a similar one 
<br />
in a different complexity?
<br />
But the more relevant question (and I mean it):
<br />
What would you identify as (your version) of &quot;consciousness&quot; that &quot;results 
<br />
from neuron-fiting&quot; consistent with all the facts?
<br />
*
<br />
St:
<br />
As for consciousness being fundamentally irreducible, I agree
<br />
completely.
<br />
<br />[JM]:
<br />
Consider it a singularity, a Ding an Sich? Your statement looks to me as 
<br />
referring to a &quot;thing&quot;. Not a process. Or rather a state? (Awareness??)
<br />
*
<br />
St:
<br />
It is a fact that when neurons fire in a particular way, a conscious 
<br />
experience results; possibly, complex enough electronic activity in a 
<br />
digital computer might also result in conscious experience, although we 
<br />
cannot be sure of that. But this does not mean that the conscious experience 
<br />
*is* the brain or computer activity, even if it could somehow be shown that 
<br />
the physical process is necessary and sufficient for the experience.
<br />
<br />[JM]:
<br />
I hope you could share with us your version of that &quot;conscious experience&quot; 
<br />
as well, which &quot;could&quot; be assigned to a digital computer? What &quot;other&quot; 
<br />
activity may a digital computer have
<br />
beside &quot;electronic&quot;?
<br />
It is hard to show in 'parallel' observed phenopmena whether  one is 
<br />
'necessary' for the other, or just observervable in parallel? Maybe &quot;the 
<br />
other&quot; is necessary for the 'one'?
<br />
If you find that the 'physical' process (firing, or electronic) is 
<br />
SUFFICIENT then probably your definition is such that it allows such 
<br />
sufficiency.
<br />
I may question the complexity of the assigned situation
<br />
for such simplification,.
<br />
*
<br />
St:
<br />
Consciousness is something entirely different and, if you like, mysterious, 
<br />
in a category of its own.
<br />
<br />[JM]:
<br />
Now you are talking! Thanks
