<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Please consider the plight of the zombie scientist with a huge set of
</em><br />
sensory feeds and similar set of effectors. All carry similar signal
<br />
encoding and all, in themselves, bestow no experiential qualities on the
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; zombie.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Add a capacity to detect regularity in the sensory feeds.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Add a scientific goal-seeking behaviour.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Note that this zombie...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; a) has the internal life of a dreamless sleep
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; b) has no concept or percept of body or periphery
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; c) has no concept that it is embedded in a universe.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I put it to you that science (the extraction of regularity) is the
</em><br />
science
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of zombie sensory fields, not the science of the natural world outside
</em><br />
the
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; zombie scientist. No amount of creativity (except maybe random choices)
</em><br />
would ever lead to any abstraction of the outside world that gave it the
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ability to handle novelty in the natural world outside the zombie
</em><br />
scientist.
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; No matter how sophisticated the sensory feeds and any guesswork as to a
</em><br />
model (abstraction) of the universe, the zombie would eventually find
<br />
novelty invisible because the sensory feeds fail to depict the novelty
<br />
.ie.
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; same sensory feeds for different behaviour of the natural world.
</em><br />
Technology built by a zombie scientist would replicate zombie sensory feeds,
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; not deliver an independently operating novel chunk of hardware with a
</em><br />
defined function(if the idea of function even has meaning in this
<br />
instance).
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The purpose of consciousness is, IMO, to endow the cognitive agent with
</em><br />
at
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; least a repeatable (not accurate!) simile of the universe outside the
</em><br />
cognitive agent so that novelty can be handled. Only then can the
<br />
zombie
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; scientist detect arbitrary levels of novelty and do open ended science
</em><br />
(or
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; survive in the wild world of novel environmental circumstance). In the
</em><br />
absence of the functionality of phenomenal consciousness and
<br />
with
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; finite sensory feeds you cannot construct any world-model (abstraction)
</em><br />
in
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the form of an innate (a-priori) belief system that will deliver an
</em><br />
endless
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ability to discriminate novelty. In a very Godellian way eventually a
</em><br />
limit
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; would be reach where the abstracted model could not make any prediction
</em><br />
that
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; can be detected. The zombie is, in a very real way, faced with 'truths'
</em><br />
that
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; exist but can't be accessed/perceived. As such its behaviour will be
</em><br />
fundamentally fragile in the face of novelty (just like all computer
<br />
programs are).
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; -----------------------------------
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Just to make the zombie a little more real... consider the industrial
</em><br />
control system computer. I have designed, installed hundreds and wired up
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; tens (hundreds?) of thousands of sensors and an unthinkable number of
</em><br />
kilometers of cables. (NEVER again!) In all cases I put it to you that the
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; phenomenal content of sensory connections may, at best, be
</em><br />
characterised
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; whatever it is like to have electrons crash through wires, for that is
</em><br />
what
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is actually going on. As far as the internal life of the CPU is
</em><br />
concerned...
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; whatever it is like to be an electrically noisy hot rock, regardless of
</em><br />
the
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; program....although the character of the noise may alter with different
</em><br />
programs!
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I am a zombie expert! No that didn't come out right...erm....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; perhaps... &quot;I think I might be a world expert in zombies&quot;.... yes,
</em><br />
that's
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; better.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; :-)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Colin Hales
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I've had another think about this after reading the paper you sent me.
</em><br />
It
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seems that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you are making two separate claims. The first is that a zombie would not
</em><br />
be able to
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behave like a conscious being in every situation: specifically, when
</em><br />
called upon to be
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scientifically creative. If this is correct it would be a corollary of
</em><br />
the
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Turing test, i.e.,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if it behaves as if it is conscious under every situation, then it's
</em><br />
conscious. However,
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you are being quite specific in describing what types of behaviour could
</em><br />
only occur
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the setting of phenomenal consciousness. Could you perhaps be even
</em><br />
more
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; specific
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and give an example of the simplest possible behaviour or scientific
</em><br />
theory which an
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unconscious machine would be unable to mimic?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The second claim is that a computer could only ever be a zombie, and
</em><br />
therefore could
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; never be scientifically creative. However, it is possible to agree with
</em><br />
the first claim and
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reject this one. Perhaps if a computer were complex enough to truly
</em><br />
mimic
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the behaviour
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of a conscious being, including being scientifically creative, then it
</em><br />
would indeed be
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious. Perhaps our present computers are either unconscious because
</em><br />
they are too
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; primitive or they are indeed conscious, but at the very low end of a
</em><br />
consciousness
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; continuum, like single-celled organisms or organisms with relatively
</em><br />
simple nervous systems
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like planaria.

<br />COLIN:
<br />
Hi.... a bunch of points...
<br />
<br />1) Re paper.. it is undergoing review and growing..
<br />
The point of the paper is to squash the solipsism argument ...in
<br />
particular the specific flavour of it that deals with 'other minds' and as
<br />
it has (albeit tacitly) defined science's attitude to what is/is not
<br />
scientific evidence. As such I am only concerned with scientific
<br />
behaviour. The mere existence of a capacity to handle exquisite novelty
<br />
demands the existence of the functionality of phenomenal consciousness
<br />
within the scientist. Novel technology exists, ergo science is possible,
<br />
ergo phenomenal consciousness exists. Phenomenal consciousness is proven
<br />
by the existence of novel technology. More than 1 scientist has produced
<br />
novel technology. Ergo there is more then 1 'mind' (=collection of
<br />
phenomenal fields) ergo other minds do exist. Ergo solipsism is false. The
<br />
problem is that along the way you have also proved that there is an
<br />
external 'reality'...which is a bit of a bonus. So all the philosophical
<br />
arguments about 'existence' that have wasted so much of our time is
<br />
actually just that...a waste of time.
<br />
<br />2) Turing test. I think the turing test is a completely misguided idea.
<br />
It's based on the assumption that abstract (as-if) computation can fully
<br />
replicate (has access to all the same information)  of computation
<br />
performed by the natural world. This assumption can be made obvious as
<br />
follows:
<br />
Q. What is it like to be a human? It is like being a mind. There is
<br />
information delivered into the mind by the action of brain material which
<br />
bestows on the human intrinsic knowledge about the natural world outside
<br />
the human....in the form of phenomenal consciousness. This knowledge is
<br />
not a model/abstraction, but a literal mapping of what's there (no matter
<br />
how mysterious its generation may seem). The zombie does not have this.
<br />
Nor does the Turing machine. A turing machine is a zombie. No matter what
<br />
the program, it's always 'like a tape and tape reader' to be a Turing
<br />
machine. The knowledge provided by phenonmenal cosnciousness is not an
<br />
abstraction (programmed model)...it is a direct mapping.
<br />
<br />3) RE:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and give an example of the simplest possible behaviour or scientific
</em><br />
theory which an
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unconscious machine (UM) would be unable to mimic?
</em><br />
<br />I think this is a meaningless quest. It depends on a) the
<br />
sensory/actuation facilities and b) the a-priori knowledge bestowed upon
<br />
the UM by its human progenitor.
<br />
<br />No matter how good the a-priori abstraction given by the human the UM will
<br />
do science on its sensory feeds until it can no longer distinguish any
<br />
effect because the senses cannot discriminate it (if the UM has any idea
<br />
what this means anyway - remember it has no internal likfe, no idea it is
<br />
in any universe, no experience of its sensory feeds...has no idea there's
<br />
any thing around it, like a human...it's 'not there'). So this poor UM
<br />
will learn within the confines of its ecological niche that it doesn't
<br />
even know it is in, reach a point where no matter what it does nothing
<br />
novel can be detected through its sensory feeds...Then it will stay that
<br />
way for good. To an outide observer it would look very weird. It would
<br />
also fall victim to any perceptual failure not consistent with its
<br />
survival.
<br />
<br />5) Re a fatal test for the Turing machine? Give it exquisite novelty by
<br />
asking it to do science on an unknown area of the natural world. Proper
<br />
science. It will fail because it does not know there is an outside world.
<br />
Get it to make/guide the creation of novel technology. This is a human
<br />
behaviour that a Turing machine will never be able to do...because the
<br />
humans have not done it yet either.... put the Turing Machine and a human
<br />
scientist together and get them to do science on true novelty. The Turing
<br />
machine cannot have any a-priori knowledge of the natural world in
<br />
question because the humans who would give it to the machine dont have it
<br />
either!
<br />
<br />This is the real test. Can a Turing machine do science? No way. There is
<br />
no 'mimicking' consciousness.... it is an oxymorom as a statement.
<br />
--------------------------------
<br />
BTW I completeley agree about the continuum of consciousness. I believe it
<br />
started with eukaryotes having 'proto-experiences'. In a generalised model
<br />
of cognition and consciousness all critters have varying levels of
<br />
phenomenal consciousness and intellectual faculties for using that to
<br />
survive in an ecological niche.... however... this is not the point of my
<br />
paper... the paper was to prove that phenomenal consciousness is necessary
<br />
for scientific behaviour...
<br />
<br />Having reached that point in a proof...you can then look at other
<br />
behaviours (like tennis!) and other species (like bats and zombies). The
<br />
key aspect to the idea is that truly scientific behaviour is the only one
<br />
we can use as a real proof in respect of the existence of consciousness,
<br />
as it makes real demands of the external world and relates them directly
<br />
in a structured way to the internal life of the scientist in a way that
<br />
has nothing to do with the scientist (it's about unknown/novel natural
<br />
laws operating outside the scientist).
<br />
<br />Nobody has ever thought about this like this, have they?.... I just had
<br />
this shivery feeling... that maybe I've tripped over something useful... I
<br />
have found it so weird lately talking to scientists, standing there...the
<br />
evidence for consiousness in front of me...saying &quot;there's no
<br />
evidence...&quot;...:-)  is it any wonder scientists can't see the
<br />
evidence...they ARE the evidence!
<br />
<br />regards,
<br />
