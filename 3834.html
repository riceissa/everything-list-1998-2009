<br />I'm sure you've heard of the phrase &quot;correlation is not causation&quot;. Yet
<br />
before the formulation of causal decision theory, there was no way to
<br />
express within the framework of decision theory that you do not believe
<br />
some correlation indicates a causal relationship. In Newcomb's Paradox,
<br />
with causal decision theory you're still allowed to take only one box (if
<br />
you believe that taking only one box causes more money to be in the box)
<br />
however you're no longer forced to. You can now take both boxes and not be
<br />
considered irrational. So this is yet another instance of decision theory
<br />
being generalized to be usable by more people.
<br />
<br />If you look at the history of decision theory, you see that it keeps
<br />
getting generalized so that more choices can be considered rational. 
<br />
(See <a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m3675.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m3675.html</a>.) That
<br />
makes more sense if the purpose of decision theory is to justify the use
<br />
of probabilities in science, rather than to constrain people's actions by
<br />
labeling certain choices irrational. It basically says you can use
<br />
probability theory even if your utility function is not linear in
<br />
wealth, even if you don't believe in objective probabilities,
<br />
even if you don't believe correlation equals causation (and I argue even 
<br />
if the value of an exerience to you depends on what your copies 
<br />
experience, although I still haven't had time to write down why in 
<br />
light of the thought experiment I posted earlier in the thread 
<br />
&quot;self-sampling assumption is incorrect&quot;).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have looked ahead a little bit at this part of the book, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unfortunately it appears that the discussion of causality is rather
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; abbreviated and mostly brings in some rather complex results from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; literature.  The philosophical literature on causality is quite large
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in itself and probably some familiarity with that would help to see how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it relates to decision theory.
</em><br />
<br />Perhaps Pearl's book Causality that Tim mentioned talks more about
<br />
causality itself. (Although I haven't read it myself yet.) I noticed that
<br />
Joyce references Pearl's book in one of his papers so their ideas of
<br />
causality are probably quite similar. But I think Joyce book is 
<br />
sufficiently self-contained on this topic. I had to read the relevant 
<br />
sections several times, but I did eventually understand what he means by 
<br />
causality.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Overall I am not sure how to relate the ideas in this book to the issues
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we deal with.  One connection is that the causal aspect sheds light on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; soem of the paradoxes we have discussed, such as the paradox of Adam
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and Eve which Nick Bostrom covers in his thesis.  In this situation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Adam wants a deer to come along so he can eat it, and to arrange this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; he plans never to mate with Eve if that happens.  If the deer doesn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; come along then he will mate with Eve and create the whole human race,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in which case it is highly unlikely that his particular observer-moments
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would be chosen.  So he reasons that from his perspective, since he is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in fact experiencing his observer-moments, it is likely that no large
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; human race will be produced and hence that the deer will come along.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There are various resolutions to this seeming paradox, but based on this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; book I can see it as a Newcomb problem.  Adam is giving himself evidence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the deer will come, he is not causing the deer to come.  So from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the perspective of causal decision theory, he is wrong to try this plan.
</em><br />
<br />That's a very good point. You should forward that observation to Nick 
<br />
directly. I think he is no longer following this mailing list very 
<br />
closely.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; However this reasoning does require you to accept the causal prescription
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in all Newcomb problems, which may be a harder nut to swallow than other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; solutions to the Adam and Eve paradox.
</em><br />
<br />If you're not completely convinced that causality needs to be taken into 
<br />
account in making decisions, then by all means read the rest of the book.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; More directly, the book provides various proposed axioms for rationality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and choice.  I have tried to consider how they might relate to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence of multiple universes, but I don't see much connection.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It seems that one is still faced with the simple prescription of choosing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the outcome that maximizes the expected utility, with considerable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; freedom for the utility functions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One question is whether we can restrict or limit the decisions people make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in some of the paradoxes of copying.  I am going to have some duplicates
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; made, and then they will have some experiences, and then some of those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; duplicates get further duplicated, etc.  Can we constrain the decisions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a rational person will make in these experiments?  For example, if he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is given a chance to be duplicated to two people, and one will have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something good happen and one will have something bad, can we argue that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; he should agree to this based on a 50% mixture of the utilities of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; two experiences?  If we can make these kinds of statements, or even some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; weaker ones, then I think this theory may be helpful in shedding light
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on the issues we have dealt with.
</em><br />
<br />As I argued earlier, I don't think we can make these kinds of statements.  
<br />
But again, it makes more sense if you think of the purpose of decision
<br />
theory as providing meaning for probabilities, rather than restricting
<br />
people's decisions. For example, in my recent exchanges with Bruno, I've
<br />
been arguing that probabilities related to his concept of first person
<br />
indeterminancy are not really meaningful, because they can't be used in
<br />
decision theory (at least I haven't figured out how) and do not seem
<br />
necessary for it.
