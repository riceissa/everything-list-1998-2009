<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; experiment. Whose satisfaction are you talking about? If you are

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; talking about average satisfaction among the actual instances of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; experimenter that will exist after the experiement, and all you care 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; about is this average (you don't care at all about how many instances 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; are enjoying this satisfaction) then you might indeed get the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; implication that you should play Russian roulette in your thought 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; example, but what's so paradoxical about that? It wouldn't mean that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I would have any reason to play Russian roulette in that situation, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; for I don't think I have the goals that your argument presupposes. I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; care about how many branches I will continue to exist on/how many 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; copies there will be of me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; These things are part of the outside view. They will remain the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; same no matter what you do, so how does it make sense to have a goal of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; changing them?
</em><br />
<br />Isn't it the case that on the AUH, *everything* remains the same no 
<br />
matter what I do?
<br />
<br />In one sense, yes; in another sense, no. I think it's the same as 
<br />
with any other physical theory.
<br />
<br />The sense in which I *can* make a difference,on the AUH, is I think 
<br />
the following: If I choose to do action X, then that indicates that X 
<br />
is a rather probable thing to happen (it has a big measure, even 
<br />
though in some universes I will not do X in a similar situation). It 
<br />
might not matter whether we say that I &quot;cause&quot; X to have a big 
<br />
measure by wanting it, or we say that the ground why I want X  is 
<br />
that the event of me bringing X about by wanting it has a relatively 
<br />
big measure.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; That's how you define the probability, yes, but how do you define the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; proposition &quot;I will perceive X.&quot;?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't know how to define it directly, but its meaning is implicit in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definition of the probability.
</em><br />
<br />It looks to me now as if your definition of this probability agrees 
<br />
with the (second) one I suggested (and which you say that Tegmark 
<br />
also uses), except that I assumed a finite number of discrete 
<br />
universes, whereas you stated the definition in terms of measures.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But your argument, it seems, presupposes that I can't care about how 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; many instances there will exist of me. That seems wrong.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Part of my argument is that it doesn't make sense to have goals that refer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the outside view because the outside view is fixed. But I also showed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (with the first paradox) that Tegmark's definition of probability is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-consistent. I think that is the more serious problem, since if we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have a consistent definition of probability that isn't compatible with our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; current version of decision theory, we can always modify decision theory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or change our ideas of what is rational.
</em><br />
<br />I've just reread your post about the first paradox and will comment 
<br />
on it later.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Well I think that's problematic. How do we interpret these 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;measures&quot;? I.e. what does it mean to say that a certain instance of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; experience has a certain measure m?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One possible interpretation is that every string has an infinite number of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instances, but some have relatively more instances than others. This is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; somewhat analagous to intervals of real numbers between 0 and 1. There are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an infinite number of real numbers in every such interval, but some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intervals have relatively more real numbers than others.
</em><br />
<br />Some intervals may have a greater measure, but surely they have 
<br />
equally many real numbers in them. That follows from the fact that R 
<br />
is a dense order-type.
