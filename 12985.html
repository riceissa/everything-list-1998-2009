<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have a problem with the very premise of asking why we are being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simulated.  Having been a member of this list for years, I have seen
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; objections to the simulation argument raised repeatedly that are along the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lines of &quot;it is presumptuous to assume anyone would want to simulate us,&quot; or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;it is entirely speculative and not based in science&quot;, etc.  I have also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seen a fair amount of discussion about how the simulation could be done.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To me, the logical chain is straightforward.  If you accept a MWI
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interpretation or some other ensemble theory, then everything that can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happen does happen.  There is maybe a little wiggle room here, as perhaps
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you can have a MWI with an enormous number of universes versus and infinite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; number, depending on the nature of the underlying implementation, but as I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand it from earlier discussions and from my reading, most interpret
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MWI as requiring an actual infinity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
There is a big difference between an infinite and a merely very large MWI:
<br />
for one thing, QTI requires an actual infinity of worlds.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, after you have the MWI as the underlying foundation, there is really
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only one additional question that needs to be answered.  Is there something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fundamentally primitively &quot;physical&quot; and non-reproducible about my existence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that would forever prohibit any attempt at reproduction?  When I say &quot;my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence&quot; you have to include two possibilities.  First, if you want to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hold onto the &quot;primitive physical&quot; viewpoint you have to assume that there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is something about the nature of our apparent reality in the third person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that is simply not capable of emulation or simulation.  Second, you ALSO
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have to assume there is something about our first person experience that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; also not capable of emulation or simulation.  This is where the &quot;primitive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical&quot; proponents lose me.  I have thought about this a great deal, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just can't figure out why I should assume there is something so special
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about my experiences, memories, and thought process that it under no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; circumstances could ever be capable of reproduction anywhere else in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence (other than the &quot;naturally&quot; occurring copies of myself in other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; parts of the multiverse, which are of course under this line of thinking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; occurring at a &quot;primitive physical&quot; level).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am an attorney, so I guess I look at this at a little different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perspective than most on here with science related backgrounds.  I think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; once you get to a certain level, whether it be with MWI, or string theory or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any other concept that can not be directly tested or observed, science loses
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; its ability to take you further and you have to look into other areas such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as logic and philosophy to finish the journey.  However, there is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; circumstantial case to be made for things even beyond strict science.  For
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instance, I believe the circumstantial case for our universe being emulable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or simulable is strong given what we know about how our universe works so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; far.  The reasons for this have probably been discussed around here
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; extensively, for instance the close relationship between math and physics,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and our ability to describe the things we observe in mathematical terms.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To my way of thinking, the opponents to a simulation viewpoint are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; basically left arguing a concept that there is something &quot;magical&quot; or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;spiritual&quot; about human thought.  That it is a supernatural function that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; forever beyond the realm of science.  Either that or they do not accept an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ensemble theory.    I could not disagree more with your statement that it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;arrogant to assume that we are somehow the center of the simulation.&quot;  On
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the contrary, what is arrogant is to assume that in a universe in which it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is possible to simulate environments and universes (and this we know, just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; check out a Playstation 3 game I will say only partially tongue in cheek),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is that we occupy a special location at the very top (or bottom depending on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; how you look at it) of this hierarchy of natural and artificial creations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
I'm not opposed to the idea that we may be part of a simulation. The only
<br />
way to exclude the possibility is, as you suggest, if there is something
<br />
magical about human thought (not just mysterious - we know it's mysterious).
<br />
However, it seems you are both agreeing and disagreeing with my statement
<br />
that we shouldn't assume we are at the centre of the simulation. There is a
<br />
tendency to think that if we are in a simulation someone has painstakingly
<br />
hand-coded every aspect of us and our environment, whereas it seems to me
<br />
much more likely that our universe is a product of a UD type program. A UD
<br />
need only be run once on an infinite computer and it would swamp out any
<br />
more deliberate simulations.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I think one thing that hangs a lot of people up on this concept is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; idea that somewhere there IS a primitive, physical universe, and that we are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just a digital simulation being run in that &quot;more real&quot; universe.  This is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; NOT necessary nor is it part of my thinking on the subject.  Maybe there is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some &quot;more real&quot; or &quot;primitive physical&quot; reality out there that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simulating our entire quantum mechanical multiverse, but this is entirely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; speculative and presumably beyond the realm of any potential scientific
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discussion.  When I refer to our being simulated, I am assuming the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simulation is occurring in every way that is logically and physically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible in the multiverse, just as every other part of the multiverse is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being likewise simulated in every way that is logically and physically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible in some other part.  This is required, in fact is logically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessary if you assume it is capable of simulation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
It would be really neat if no physical universe is needed to implement the
<br />
simulation. For one thing, it would get around the question of the
<br />
contingency of physical existence, a problem even for God.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;That is as far as I think logic can take us.  All the different
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theoretical ways that we can be emulated or simulated or of course
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interesting discussion.  Why some intelligent beings in some other part of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the multiverse may want to simulate or emulate our part of the multiverse is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interesting as well, but is entirely unrelated to the logic of whether the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entire entity is at least in part a simulation as set forth above.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
Right, it's the anthropocentric psychology and programming methods of the
<br />
potential simulators that I disagree with.
