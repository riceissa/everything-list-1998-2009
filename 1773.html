1:1

<br />Fred has put his finger on one of the most important issues involving MWI and 
<br />
quantum immortality. The meaning of probability in the context of the MW 
<br />
branching.
<br />
<br />Either the Shroedinger wave function splits into a finite number of branches 
<br />
or into an infinite number of branches. 
<br />
<br />If the split is finite, calculating the probability of a given outcome x, 
<br />
given a starting situation S is trivial. Let's assume that the total number 
<br />
of branchesfrom S is N, of which n&lt;N contain the given outcome. Then, 
<br />
assuming a **random** selection of any branch from the set of N branches,  
<br />
the probability of outcome x is given by:
<br />
<br />P{x} = n/N  
<br />
<br />When the split is infinite, the probability calculation is not so obvious. 
<br />
Consider an infinite split of cardinality aleph null. Let's index each branch 
<br />
so that branch index = natural number.  So we have branches &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, 
<br />
&quot;3&quot;,..... Now let us define the outcome x as (branch index = even). Let's 
<br />
calculate the probability of outcome x.
<br />
Common sense indicates that total number N of branches (all natural numbers) 
<br />
=  twice number n of branches with outcome x (i.e., even branches). Common 
<br />
sense however is misleading. 
<br />
<br />Here is the key issue. Depending how the branches are sorted and the 
<br />
**random** selection is performed, the probability calculation will produce 
<br />
different results. If we sort the branches in the order &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;,... 
<br />
then it seems that the even outcome x will occur 50% of the time. However, 
<br />
this particular sorting is entirely arbitrary. I could have sorted the 
<br />
branches as &quot;1&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, &quot;7&quot;, &quot;4&quot;, &quot;9&quot;, &quot;11&quot;, &quot;6&quot;, &quot;13&quot;, &quot;15&quot;, &quot;8&quot;,... 
<br />
that is having the density of the odd numbers = twice the density of the even 
<br />
numbers. With this arrangement all natural numbers are guaranteed to occur in 
<br />
the series. Yet a **random** sampling will generate a probability of picking 
<br />
an even number = 1/3. It seems then that the definition of probability in the 
<br />
context of infinite sets must include the specification of how these sets are 
<br />
ordered! In addition, it is not clear how a random sampling can be performed 
<br />
over the natural number, since we seems always to be biased toward the 
<br />
beginning of the scale (near zero) since for any finite number that is 
<br />
selected, we are guaranteed to have many more numbers above it than under it!
<br />
<br />In an attempt to find a way out of this dilemma, we could assume that the 
<br />
branching is really a continuum. So let us consider a line interval from 0 to 
<br />
1 as a model. Consider an outcome x specified for every real real number. 
<br />
That is any real number either has property x or does not have it. This 
<br />
property could be for example the 2nd digit = 3. The sorting problem crops up 
<br />
again! I could order my reals any way I please with all the reals containing 
<br />
property x crowded in a tiny subinterval, say between 0 and 0.001. Any 
<br />
**random** sampling over interval (0,1) will be very unlikely to pick any 
<br />
real with the property 2nd digit = 3. So assuming a continuum does not solve 
<br />
the dilemma!.
<br />
<br />We know from experience that probability calculations in the MW do make 
<br />
sense!!! There must be something wrong with the math. Does any one of you 
<br />
know what? In this context the concept of limit seems to be suspect.  I don't 
<br />
know if probability theory has been extended to cover infinite sets. Does any 
<br />
one of you know what the state of the art is in this subject?
