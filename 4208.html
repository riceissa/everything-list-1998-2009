<br />
hi all. in a recent msg I talked about emergence as
<br />
a theme for the algorithmic revolution &amp; CH zooms in &amp; comments on that,
<br />
spurring some more of my thoughts. 
<br />
this is a very tricky idea that I feel I definitely have not wrapped
<br />
my own brain around, nor has anyone else. but, imho, its a genuinely
<br />
new idea. &quot;emergence&quot; as a buzzword does seem to
<br />
be a key element of a new TOE &amp; the algorithmic revolution.
<br />
<br /><br />flash: &quot;emergence&quot; is the opposite of reductionism. just as
<br />
the 20th century and most of all prior science is about
<br />
reductionism, we can now study emergence. perhaps that
<br />
will be a key theme of 21st century science, physics, etc.
<br />
the algorithm/computer is the breakthrough new tool that allows
<br />
us to study emergence.
<br />
<br />emergence &lt;=&gt; reductionism are not mutually exclusive.
<br />
its a feedback loop, a dichotomy, a bohrian complementarity.
<br />
the forest versus the trees.
<br />
mathematics underlies both, but in a different sense. the approaches
<br />
&amp; techniques are different. emergence tends to be a more qualitative
<br />
than quantitative picture, rules or equations that one can write down 
<br />
but not so easily derive from the basic principles of the
<br />
system.
<br />
<br />also, the clockwork universe theme seems to encourage reductionism.
<br />
whereas maybe the algorithmical metaphor encourages &quot;emergencism&quot;.
<br />
<br />what is emergence? its a very loaded word. we all pretty much
<br />
feel we understand &quot;reductionism&quot; probably, but emergence
<br />
is a new concept. I would argue its being defined as we speak
<br />
&amp; that science is coming to grips with an accurate definition.
<br />
perhaps people here will contribute to that definition.
<br />
<br /><br />my favorite examples of emergence that Ive noticed recently
<br />
&amp; can expand on if there is interest.
<br />
<br />- I have a web site that catalogs over 4000 known gliders for
<br />
the game of life. **breathtaking**. can you predict these given
<br />
the life rules? or how about, find a theory that predicts
<br />
the gliders from a given set of rules?? this ties in with
<br />
a brilliant proof that rule 110 is a universal TM, mentioned
<br />
in wolframs book, which is very much oriented around glider
<br />
physics of the rule.
<br />
<br />- oscillons. emergent behavior from many particles. a picture
<br />
is worth a thousand words. check em out. still under the radar
<br />
of just about everyone, but a quite exquisitely beautiful
<br />
example. I believe it will be shown to predict all particle
<br />
dynamics in the not-too-distant future.
<br />
<br />- fractals. another good metaphor for emergence. who would
<br />
predict the equation z &lt;- z^2 + c could lead to such incredible
<br />
artwork &amp; tapestries. cosmic.
<br />
<br />- robotics. imagine the aibo software, and then how that
<br />
software animates the bot. and imagine putting aibos together.
<br />
the behavior is emergent, unpredictable, intelligent, dynamic.
<br />
<br />- the cyberspace web. thriving, pulsing, growing, changing, 
<br />
constantly. all built out of basic building blocks like HTML,
<br />
HTTP, apache servers, microsoft, whatever.
<br />
<br />- biology. ecosystems. parasites &lt;=&gt; hosts. predator &lt;=&gt; prey
<br />
etcetera. biologists are just now starting to get an idea 
<br />
of how the whole fabric is woven together. a zillion interactions.
<br />
unexpected findings.
<br />
<br />- graph theory is now starting to study &quot;small world graphs&quot; which
<br />
have many extraordinary properties entailing emergence (&quot;six degrees
<br />
of separation&quot;). several new books on the subject.
<br />
a buzzword in the making.
<br />
<br /><br />and so on!! so I am out of ideas at the moment
<br />
until someone else says something else..
