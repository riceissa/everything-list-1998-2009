<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I was attempting to -invalidate- that argument against the existence of the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Physicists can't rule out as being the more accurate logic of their

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe, the argument &quot;reductio ad absurdum&quot; is not a tautology and,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; therefore, can't necessarily be applied.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, in binary logic, the Physicist's universe (or whatever Everything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; means) can't exist.
</em><br />
<br />I take your point about the reductio not working in three valued
<br />
logic.
<br />
<br />I am not convinced that the problem you are attempting to solve is
<br />
necessarily a problem since I haven’t been able to construe the
<br />
proposed reductio ad absurdum argument in a way that seems coherent to
<br />
my way of thinking.
<br />
<br />However, you may be on to something with the general program that you
<br />
have embarked upon. Maybe there is a need for a mathematics to
<br />
describe the everything ensemble. Something along those lines is
<br />
likely the only way to define the everything with any sort of rigor. I
<br />
think it is a good idea.
<br />
<br />Set theory does seem to be too rich for the job. Determining what type
<br />
of formalism is apropriate is a task. I think that such a mathematical
<br />
formalism may be precisely what is called for in order to define the
<br />
everything, as well as analyze it any useful sort of way.
<br />
<br />I am still confused by what you mean by certain terms. What is meant
<br />
by the Physicist’s universe? Even more to the point, what is meant by
<br />
saying that it cannot exist in binary logic? The propositional
<br />
calculus, for example, does not even satisfy the conditions the Godel
<br />
theorems, i.e. there are no undecidable propositions possible in it.
<br />
To think that the axioms of any two valued logic could be sufficient
<br />
to produce a physical existence for self-aware substructures is
<br />
distinctly overstepping what Max Tegmark suggests in his metaphysical
<br />
theory.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I doubt self-reference is inherently the problem in light of things like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Tarski's fixed point theorems which provide concrete examples of wffs that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are self-referencing, in terms of Godel numbers, if I recall.  That proof I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was exposed to was not an existence proof of self-referencing wffs merely by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;logical flamboyancy&quot; but by the providing an example of an actual -class-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of self-referencing wffs.  Obviously, the above argument does not explicitly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; involve wffs (it does, however, implicitly), and I am -only- making a case
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for plausibility at this particular moment.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I see no problems with the argument given that in binary logic, their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe can't exist; this, to me, convinces me that the Physicist's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe can't operate on binary logic by Occam's Razor as -none- of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; data in any experiment would fit the result that confirms their speculation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that their universe exists.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ergo, the Physicist's universe must operate on at least three truth values.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Consequently, it exists.)  This to me is a more elegant solution to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argument than citing self-referencing issues as automatically damning.  If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; natural language can be used to prove the Heine-Borel theorem, without the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; need for wffs, then why must a statement about Everything be formalized in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine-level code with wffs?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If there is further objection to my line of thinking, -please- point it out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to Everyone (which I hope is well-defined or else no one would know what I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mean, right?)  ;)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thank you for your remarks; I find all input extremely productive!!
</em><br />
<br />I too appreciate the chance to talk about such interesting ideas.
