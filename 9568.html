Le 20-juin-06, à 08:47, Hal Finney a écrit :
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'll offer my thoughts on first-person indeterminacy.  This is based
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on Wei Dai's framework which I have called UD+ASSA.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I guess you mean your UDist here.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am working on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some web pages to summarize the various conclusions I have drawn from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this framework.  (Actually, here I am going to in effect use the SSA
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rather than the ASSA, i.e. I will work not with observer-moments but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with entire observer lifetimes.  But the same principles apply.)
</em><br />
<br /><br />Why? How? This is not obvious, and in some context even not consistent.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let us consider Bruno's example where you are annihilated in Brussels
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and then copies of your final state are materialized in Washington and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Moscow, and allowed to continue to run.  What can we say about your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subjective first-person expectations in this experiment?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here is how I would approach the problem.  It is a very straightforward
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computational procedure (in principle).
</em><br />
<br /><br />I don't think so. See below.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Consider any hypothetical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subjective, first person stream of consciousness.  This would basically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be a record of the thoughts and experiences of a hypothetical observer.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let us assume that this can be written and recorded in some form.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK. I would add that such a record is annihilated in personal use of 
<br />
teleportation. If not you can no more distinguish it from a third 
<br />
person record.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps it is a record of neural firing patterns over the course of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer's lifetime,
</em><br />
<br />This hides some ambiguity.  &quot; neural firing pattern&quot; does not typically 
<br />
belongs to first person experience (unlike pain pleasure ...).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; or perhaps a more compressed description based on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such information.
</em><br />
<br />? (such a compression has nothing to do with the experience, so I don't 
<br />
understand).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The question I would aim to answer is this: for any proposed, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hypothetical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; first-person lifetime stream of consciousness, how much measure does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this hypothetical subjective lifetime acquire from the third-person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; events in the universe?
</em><br />
<br />Which universe?  And how do you link first person experience and third 
<br />
person description. You are talking like if the mind body problem was 
<br />
solved.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The answer is very simple: it is the conditional Kolmogorov measure of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the subjective lifetime record, given the universe as input.
</em><br />
<br /><br />(Conditional) Kolmogorov measure is not computable (even in principle) 
<br />
unless you have an oracle for the halting problem. It is well defined, 
<br />
and does not depend on the chosen Universal machine (except for a 
<br />
constant), but it is not computable. Still it is computable &quot;in the 
<br />
limit&quot;, but for using that feature, you need to take into account the 
<br />
invariance for delays in &quot;reconstitutions&quot;, but this changes the whole 
<br />
frame of reasoning.
<br />
I am not sure I can figure out what do you mean by &quot;universe&quot; here, nor 
<br />
how could a universe be an input (nor an output actually).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  In other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; words, consider the shortest program which, given the universe as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; input,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; produces that precise subjective lifetime record as output;
</em><br />
<br /><br />There is no algorithm for finding that shortest programs. (part of the 
<br />
price of Church thesis like in the diagonalization posts).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; if the length
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of that program is L, then this universe contributes 1/2^L to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of that subjective lifetime.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Note that I am not trying to start from the universe and decide what 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; first-person stream of consciousness is; rather, I compute the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; numerical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; degree to which the universe instantiates any first-person stream of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness.  However, this does in effect answer the first question,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; since we can consider all possible streams of consciousness, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; determine which one(s) the universe mostly adds measure to.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Only with an oracle for the halting problem. Still, I don't understand 
<br />
what you mean (in this context) by &quot;this universe&quot;.
<br />
Also, minimal complexity is a prior akin to ... classical physics. Even 
<br />
quantum mechanician does not really need it, because they can derive 
<br />
such minimization from the quantum phase randomization, as Feynman 
<br />
discovered (see a concise explanation of this in my 2001 paper 
<br />
&quot;Computation, Consciousness and the Quantum&quot; (cf url below)).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  These would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be the ones that we would informally say that the universe 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instantiates.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, let me illustrate how this would be applied to the situation in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; question, and some other thought experiments.  Specifically, let us
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; imagine three hypothetical streams of consciousness: B goes through 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; life
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; until the moment the subject is annihilated in Brussels, then stops.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; W goes through life as does B but continues with the life experiences
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from Washington.  And M is like W, going through life until the event
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in Brussels but then continuing with the events in Moscow.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Normally we only consider first-person experiences like M and W when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we discuss this experiment, where the consciousness &quot;jumps&quot; to Moscow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or Washington respectively, but it is also useful to consider B, which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; corresponds to dying in Brussels.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Dying? (so you reintroduce &quot;cul-de-sac&quot; assumptions like if a person 
<br />
could be aware of not being aware, so here you clearly reject comp or 
<br />
its consequences. But this is problematic given that you are using 
<br />
Kolmogorov measure, which although not computational, is a 
<br />
computationalist notion.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let me first deal with a trivial case to illustrate one of the issues 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arise when we compare first-person experiences that stop at different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; times.  Imagine a conventional lifetime where a person lives to a ripe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; old age of 90.  Now imagine the truncated version of that which we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cut off arbitrarily at age 50.  Obviously the universe will contribute
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; significant measure to both of these first-person experience streams.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Which one will get more?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would suggest that it is actually the 90 year old lifespan which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will have more measure.  The reason is because any program to turn the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; third-person record of all events into a meaningful, compact record of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the lifetime experience is going to have to deal with the enormous gap
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between the fundamental events of physics, which happen at the Planck
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scale,
</em><br />
<br /><br />Here you are presupposing a physical universe (so again you are in 
<br />
trouble with comp or at least with the UD-Argument). The Planck scale 
<br />
is very different if you accept the whole quantum idea or if you take 
<br />
some deterministic account of it (a la t'hooft). Comp saves us for 
<br />
making that kind of choice, I think.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and the fundamental events of consciousness, which although
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; small to us are at an enormously larger scale compared to physics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This means that the program to do this conversion is going to have to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be intensively data driven; it will have to identify tenuous and rather
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; amorphous patterns of physical events, in order to translate them into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the neurophysiological events that we would want to record.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Given this structure, the (approximate) moment of physical death will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be easily recognized, as it is that moment when the structure which the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; program has been built to track disappears.  The simplest program is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; going to be one that has its own built-in, implicit stopping rule.
</em><br />
<br />This is not obvious.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In contrast, a program which stops at some arbitrary time, like age 50,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is goint to have to be larger, because we are going to have to build in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the stopping rule.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Very few bits more are needed here (like a counter + a &quot;if-then-else&quot; 
<br />
condition).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  And given that the average human lifetime is enormous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; when expressed in the most natural physical units, the Planck time,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it means that expressing the time to stop is going to take substantial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; program space.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Some very big number needs substantial program space, but much bigger 
<br />
number than that will not. A random string like  
<br />
&quot;9579210055822309227007732586654794&quot; is longer to describe than 10^100. 
<br />
Big numbers can have quite short programs outputting them (cf the fairy 
<br />
puzzle).
<br />
Also, I cannot understand a reasoning which depends on the chosen units.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The conclusion is that, for a conventional life experience, the largest
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure is contributed to first-person subjective records which span
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the whole range of lifetime from start to end.  Arbitrary subsets of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that subjective lifespan will have less measure than the whole thing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, back to B, W and M.  As just discussed, the measure of B, which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; corresponds to a life which ends in Brussels, is likely to be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relatively
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; substantial.  However this hypothetical teleporting or copying machine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; works, we stipulate that the guy who started in Brussels is not there a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moment later.  It's likely that a straightforward program which has 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tracking neural events by virtue of their exceedingly slight impact
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on the Planck scale is going to be thrown off by this new process.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Therefore a relatively simple program can output subjective record B.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; When we consider W and M (revivals in Washington and Moscow 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; respectively)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is still probably a fairly small program that can produce those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; records.  The main additional complication is that the program has to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; somehow be designed to be able to pick up the trail in the new city,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to jump from recording neural events in Brussels to recording them in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Washington or Moscow.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This could be done in a couple of ways.  The simplest would be to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hard-code the location of the new version of the person, perhaps
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as a vector from the old one.  But this could take quite a bit of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information, as it might have to be accurate to the size of a synapse,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a few nanometers.  Probably a better way would be to track whatever
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical event carries the causal signal from Brussels to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; destination.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Presumably something has to travel between the cities, carrying the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information about the person, to allow him to be reconstructed at the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; destination(s).  Whatever this effect or principle is, we could write a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; program which was able to follow this signal, as the neural activities 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Belgium are being scanned or whatever.  This would allow identifying 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; location of the new instance of the person, without having to hard-code
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the precise coordinates.  The third-person universe data would tell us
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where to look.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This would probably not be too complicated a program, but it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nevertheless going to be substantially larger than program B.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I don't see how this follows. What if &quot;I&quot; am computationally determined 
<br />
(in the normal histories) to do that duplication Moscow and Washington. 
<br />
Then dying in Brussels (accepting your &quot;non-comp&quot;) would, according to 
<br />
your own reasoning above, make the B experience more exceptional, 
<br />
contradicting your case.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; B only had
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to track neural events.  W and M have to be able to track both neural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; events and whatever physical principles are utilized by this copying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and transmission process.  W and M are therefore going to have to have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; two different analysis methods, compared to one for B.  They should not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have to be twice as big, since they don't have to actually track 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thought
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; during the transmission (we assume that thought is suspended during 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time),
</em><br />
<br /><br />I would say OK except that this idea implies the non-cul-de-sac 
<br />
principle, which you need to throw out for giving sense to the notion 
<br />
of dying in Brussels.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  they just have to figure out where the new brain is being built.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But chances are it is going to make W and M quite a bit larger than B.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Compared to each other, W and M are probably almost identical.  The 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; difference is that they make arbitrary different choices for which 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; signal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to follow in tracking the copying information, in order to find where 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; new instance is located.  Maybe one has a 1 bit where the other has a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 0.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In all other respects the two programs are identical, and their measure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should be the same.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But, as noted above, B is substantially smaller, and as a result, B has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a substantially larger measure.  This means that the contribution of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; third-person record of universe events to a subjective, first-person 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; life
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience that ends in Brussels is much larger than to an experience
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which continues in either Washington or Moscow.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If we consider these as three hypothetical people, one who dies in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Brussels, one who continues in Washington, and one who continues in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Moscow, it is the first one who is instantiated to the substantially
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; greatest degree by the operation of such a copying machine as we are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; considering.  Informally, we could say that your most likely experience
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is that you will die in Brussels (bearing in mind the formal statement
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the previous sentence).  That is how I would analyze it based on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computational principles.
</em><br />
<br />You should make clearer when you talk on programs (finite piece of 
<br />
code), program's states,
<br />
computations (finite or infinite redundant strings with some grammar) 
<br />
and output or inputs
<br />
of programs. Those things, although related,  are different and obeys 
<br />
different mathematics.
<br />
<br />Honestly, here I have the feeling that you are using both comp and 
<br />
non-comp at once.
