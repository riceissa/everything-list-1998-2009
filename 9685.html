<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What I argued was that it would be easier to find the trace of a person's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thoughts in a universe where he had a physically continuous record than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where there were discontinuities (easier in the sense that a smaller
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; program would suffice).  In my framework, this means that the universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would contribute more measure to people who had continuous lives than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; people who teleported.
</em><br />
<br />Just out of curiosity, does a person who saw a chance TV show on Chaucer
<br />
and now reads Chaucer have less measure than if he'd been  just as 
<br />
influenced by a TV show about Harry Potter?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Someone whose life ended at the moment of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; teleportation would have a higher measure than someone who survived
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the event.  Therefore, I would view teleportation as reducing measure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; similarly to doing something that had a risk of dying.  I would try to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; avoid it, unless there were compensating benefits
</em><br />
<br />That is, you would avoid it more than you avoid crossing the street
<br />
more often than you have to (*with* the stop lights; far be it from
<br />
me to accuse you of unlawful behavior)?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If we wanted to create a physical record where this framework would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be compatible with saying that people die often, it would be necessary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to physically teleport people thousands of times a second.  Or perhaps
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the same thing could be done by freezing people for a substantial time,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reviving them for a thousandth of a second, then re-freezing them again
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for a while, etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If we consider the practical implications of such experiments I don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think it is so implausible to view them as being worse than living a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; single, connected, subjective life.  It would be quite difficult to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interact in a meaningful way with the world under such circumstances.
</em><br />
<br />But it may be that this is a simulation, and the &quot;destruction&quot; amounts
<br />
to erasure of data from working memory, and the &quot;restoration&quot; the
<br />
retrieval from a distant part of the network bus. Thus, the interaction
<br />
of people with people left in working memory would go completely
<br />
unnoticed.
<br />
<br />Equivalently, we could find out that the Martians operate millions of
<br />
times faster than we do, and employ something a little more advanced
<br />
than superconducting that copies my body information, stores it a
<br />
few meters away, then disintegrates my body, copies my data back from
<br />
where they stored it, and fabricates a new copy.  This should not
<br />
be evident to people with such slow senses as us animals.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, if one were so unfortunate as to be put into such a situation,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then it would no longer be particularly bad to teleport.  You're being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; broken into pieces all the time anyway, so the event of teleportation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would presumably not make things any worse.  Particularly if you were
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; somehow being teleported thousands of times a second, then adding a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; teleportation would basically be meaningless since you're teleporting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anyway at every instant.  So I don't agree with Lee's conclusion that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in this situation people would still resist teleportation.
</em><br />
<br />I meant it in the way that today many people resist air travel, i.e.,
<br />
a part of them knows that they are not being rational in a way.
<br />
