<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hi Bruno.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thanks for the link. As an physicist and computer researcher I have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; knowledge of some of the fields involved in UDA, but at the first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sight I fear that I will have a hard time understanding it.
</em><br />
<br /><br />We can do the reasoning step by step if you want. I am not sure why  
<br />
you feel that you have will have an hard time understanding it.  
<br />
Usually people find the 6th first step easy. Some have problem with  
<br />
the idea that comp makes us, in principle, duplicable, and that if we  
<br />
are duplicated we cannot predict the personal outcome of the  
<br />
experience, but up to now, it always appear that it is either a  
<br />
problem of misunderstanding of the distinction between first and third  
<br />
person I give there, or it happens they just dislike or are shocked by  
<br />
that first person indeterminacy, and I agree it is a bit shocking---it  
<br />
already forces some reflexion on personal identity. Some just quit the  
<br />
reasoning at step 3, considering those three steps as a refutation of  
<br />
the computationalist hypothesis That is a form of wishful thinking. I  
<br />
use comp because it is plausible, assumed by many people, and it leads  
<br />
to a deep insight into the nature of &quot;what there could be&quot;.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not interested in the question of the truth of comp. Of course  
<br />
I like to criticize invalid argument against comp.  Some deduce,  
<br />
invalidly, that I defend comp, but I don't. (as a logician I like to  
<br />
demolish all invalid argument, it appears that comp, (like the domain  
<br />
of the relation between drugs and health), attracts many invalid  
<br />
arguments ...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; and my subjective experience is  the most objective fact
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; that I can reach.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; t
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I see what you mean, but the subjective experience, although real and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; true, and undoubtable, is subjective. It exists as far as you cannot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; prove to an other that it exists.  To communicate you have to bet on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; tools and on others, and other many doubtable (yet plausible) mind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; constructions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hence, qualia are subjective ...
</em><br />
<br /><br />Of course.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; ... and, as such,  I cannot assure that you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have it.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Right.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I'm sure that you have it
</em><br />
<br /><br />Thanks God!
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and therefore that my knowledge
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of qualia is objective
</em><br />
<br /><br />? Perhaps we have a vocabulary problem. I would say that knowledge is  
<br />
always subjective and never sharable. But we can share beliefs and  
<br />
develop objective theories. As far as they are objective and clear,  
<br />
they are probably false, and we can, and usually do, refute them, so  
<br />
science can progress. A tiny part of science develop some sharable  
<br />
&quot;knowledge&quot;, which still cannot be communicated as such.  It is the  
<br />
hard condition of the consistent entities: they can have develop their  
<br />
internal knowledge only by communicating their doubtable beliefs.
<br />
With comp fundamental science is akin to a &quot;negative theology&quot;. As  
<br />
soon we have unified theory we learn it to be false. We learn that  
<br />
Reality is not this, not that, neither this or that, ...
<br />
Comp provides the simplest explanation, in the form of a simple third  
<br />
person sharable reality (the number) why the &quot;Inside Reality&quot; has to  
<br />
behave like that. Why it contradicts us all the time.
<br />
<br />There is a question of taste here.
<br />
Those who like to believe they can control everything, and search for  
<br />
security, hates such views.
<br />
Those who like surprises and love let it go, and search for freedom  
<br />
should appreciate.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; simply for one causal reason: natural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; selection;
</em><br />
<br />Here you are terribly quick. And although I do accept the main line of  
<br />
&quot;natural selection&quot; as an explanation of our biological history, I am  
<br />
not happy at all with the explanation or absence of explanation of  
<br />
everything needed to have a reality where natural selection can exist.  
<br />
I don't take granted the notion of physical world, nor any physicalist  
<br />
notion of causality. I do agree with many things asserted in physics,  
<br />
but not as an ultimate explanation.
<br />
The reason I like comp is that it assures us that indeed we have to  
<br />
dig deeper with respect of what we see, observe and measure.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Our brains, shaped by very similar genetic programs, share
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the same architecture and therefore produce very similar
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; phemomenologies.
</em><br />
<br />I mostly agree.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This follows of course if you admit matter-&gt; mind (or better math-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; matter-&gt;mind)
</em><br />
<br />math-matter-mind is indeed already far better, and, this makes even  
<br />
more bizarre you fear UDA, because UDA8, the more complex step, is  
<br />
just the step which force to put math at the beginning (even  
<br />
arithmetic, but OK). Now, comp makes &quot;matter&quot; a subtle first person  
<br />
plural notion, and it will appears that, in such rough description  
<br />
math-mind-matter is more correct. But look, it is still possible that  
<br />
we have something like (with UM = universal machine, and HU = Human):
<br />
<br />math -&gt; UM-mind -&gt; Matter- HU-mind
<br />
<br />But this could mean that our comp level of substitution is very low,  
<br />
and it would be a threat of &quot;natural selection&quot;. So the picture is a  
<br />
bit more difficult.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and admit natural selection as the &quot;entropic pump&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that creates structure and function (and computer structures) in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; living beings. I know no other testable alternative.
</em><br />
<br />It is more a filtration among structure already existing (in platonia  
<br />
for example), and which have already important mathematical properties  
<br />
playing a non trivial role. but I think I see what you mean, and with  
<br />
your open-mindness to the idea that math &quot;precedes&quot; matter, you should  
<br />
not have difficulties to accept the &quot;filtration idea&quot;. the advantage  
<br />
is really that you can see that comp extends darwinism to the origin  
<br />
and development of the physical laws, which result from a &quot;universal-- 
<br />
thropic&quot;  competition of pieces of &quot;many-dreams&quot; by universal number/ 
<br />
machine, in the way they can coherently glue. Some physicist have seen  
<br />
this, like Wheeler who suggest that physics arise from a  
<br />
&quot;protogeometry&quot;. And Wheeler is well inspired in giving a role to self- 
<br />
reference. This happens with the comp hyp.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; I cannot support this Kantian notion consciousness -&gt; matter.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The problem is that if you are ready to attribute consciousness to a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; device, by its virtue of simulating digitally a conscious brain at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; some correct level of description, you will be forced to attribute
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that consciousness to an infinity of computations already defined by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the additive and multiplicative structure of the numbers (by UDA). A
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; quasi direct consequence is that if a machine look at herself below
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; its substitution level, it will build indirect evidences of a flux of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; many (a continuum) of computational histories (a typical quantum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; feature, I mean for QM without wave collapse). But comp forces the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; structure of those many realities (or dreams) to be determined by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; specifiable number theoretical relations.  Those relations are either
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; extensional relations (like in number theory), or intensional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; relations (like in computer science, where number can also points
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; toward other numbers, and effective set of numbers). It makes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; computationalism testable. The genral shape of QM confirm it, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; cosmogenesis remains troubling ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I cannot understand this until I read your paper, but, just one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; question ¿what is the nature of the process that reduces local entropy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (sculpt chaos, poetically speaking) so that in creates life and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intelligence starting from unanimated matter along the arrow of time?.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is it of a mathematical nature; is it some general principle of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; change? Is it natural selection with some additional principle? I just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; want to know what your context in relation with mine is. Of course if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you support Mind-&gt; matter -&gt; math,
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Careful! I have never supported Mind -&gt; matter -&gt; math. I support Math  
<br />
-&gt; mind - matter.
<br />
Indeed assuming comp I support Arithmetic -&gt; Mind -&gt; Matter
<br />
I could almost define mind by intensional arithmetic: the numbers when  
<br />
studied by the numbers. This does not work because I have to say:
<br />
the numbers as studied by the numbers relatively to their most  
<br />
probable local universal number, and this is how matter enters in the  
<br />
play: an indeterminacy bearing on an infinity of possible universal  
<br />
machines/numbers.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes I said that this is all that I can say without pretending to solve
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the problem. That is because the problem qualia is so interesting.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But in the absence of natural selection, as I said, I can not be sure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if you have such qualia. I cannot be sure either you are zombies or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not. In fact the main school of sociology , based on cultural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; determinism, persist in the error of thinking that people of different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cultures have completely different qualia.
</em><br />
<br />I can imagine qualia varies from person to person, and from person to  
<br />
non human animals, in way our bodies differ, but I can argue they  
<br />
already obeys the same logic. The logic of the qualia of any self- 
<br />
referentially correct machines. I extract one, well more than one.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, matter is a sort o sharable qualia, and the objectivity of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; knowledge is assured by our common brain architecture (and this is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; base of evolutionary epistemologists notion of objectiveness) .
</em><br />
<br />I can agree but things are deeper. In a nutshell you can associate a  
<br />
mind (a person, even) to an objective (third person) available (with  
<br />
respect to you and colleagues). If not true, it is at least polite,  
<br />
and it makes sense in firt person plural realities where we can share  
<br />
a big computational history. Both QM and natural selection plays a key  
<br />
role in confirming this. But the problem, for the mind-body problem,  
<br />
is that from our personal (even plural) perspective we cannot  
<br />
associate a singular body to our mind, we can only associate an  
<br />
infinity of possible computational histories, and what we call matter  
<br />
is the result of the statistical interference of those histories. They  
<br />
obey to the law of computer science/numbers, and this makes the comp  
<br />
hyp testable. It gives also an explanation realm where we can  
<br />
understand where the physical realities come from.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mind perceive in a specie-specific way an external reality that has no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaning without such brain processing.. In fact trees, persons, atoms
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and so on are shared creations of our minds because they have an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; adaptive/utilitarian nature.
</em><br />
<br />OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The external reality, at the deepest
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; level, may be just mathematical, so are our bodies. Mind maybe then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the process where the reification of matter from math occurs.
</em><br />
<br />OK. All what I say, is that such talk is necessary, assuming comp, and  
<br />
can be described in such a precise way that it makes the mind-body  
<br />
comp (partial) solution testable.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then, math-&gt;mind-&gt; matter.
</em><br />
<br />OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Has this last point of view something in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; common with yours?
</em><br />
<br /><br />It *is* mine (even the day I don't believe in comp). But my point is  
<br />
that computer science and mathematical logic makes this testable.  
<br />
Scientific. In the Popper sense (by UDA).
<br />
<br />And then I can put it in another way: it is NOT *mine*. It is the  
<br />
solution of the mind body problem given by the average self- 
<br />
referentially correct (and platonist) universal machine, when you  
<br />
listen to that machine (by AUDA).
<br />
<br />By platonist a mean any entity believing that a closed arithmetical  
<br />
proposition is either true, or false.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I do appreciate your willingness of not treating a self-referentially
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; correct machine as a zombie, but providing a machine with the correct
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; behavior and the relevant discourse does not yet explain the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; *meaning*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of those discourses. Some could argue that on the contrary it makes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; those meaning illusory.  Theories remains to be done, and if  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is true and unexplainable, this has to be justified too. Amazingly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; you can extract both the communicable and incommunicable part of that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; discourse from an interview of the machine , and this has  already be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; done (thanks to Gödel Post Turing ... and computer science/logic). It
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is the AUDA part: the (admittedly rough, concerning only ideally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; correct machines) translation of UDA in the language of a universal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; machine, like (Peano) Arithmetic.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; And given that physics is testable, this makes comp testable (well in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; AUDA the definition of the internal points of view are debatable, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; better solution could be imaginable, I have used the old definition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; you can find in the Theaetetus of Plato. They work very well thanks  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the subtleties of the Gödel-Löb self-reference logic.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; UDA is easy (except the step 07 and 08 which asks for more work).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; AUDA is difficult because you have to study Mathematical Logic to get
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the point, and Quantum Mechanics to believe it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; UDA+AUDA leads to McGuin Mysterianism, as explained and justified by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the &quot;betting, praying&quot; machine. There is a gap of explanation, which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; can be justified almost completely from the first person point of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; view.  From the third person point of view there is no gap at all.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Machines can already see this, and this should please you, if I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; understand you well.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Matter then play a special role in the dreams, especially those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;collective dreams&quot;, but it is part of the dreams. We are in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; number matrix, if you want a short description. My point is not that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; this is true, but that this is Popper-refutable. It is not a question
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of liking it or not, but of making the math and the experiments. All
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; in all,  it makes many fundamental question less obvious that many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; think.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Still processing that
</em><br />
<br /><br />Take it easy, and don't hesitate for asking any question. I am aware  
<br />
that some people confuse computations and description of computations.  
<br />
It is an intrinsically hard and confusing matter. Mathematical  
<br />
logician have an advantage, because it is a kind of confusion they  
<br />
study in detail. But eventually, in the arithmetical translation of  
<br />
the UDA, you can even understand why the nuance between computation  
<br />
and description of computation are normal. There is a sense why even  
<br />
self-referentially correct machine get easily trapped here. What save  
<br />
the machine from the trap is the inescapable gap between self- 
<br />
referential provable statement and the true one.
<br />
<br />Penrose argues that (sound) humans are not (sound) machines, because - 
<br />
he says- *we* can see the trap in any such machine, and no such  
<br />
machine can see her own trap. But the truth is that all machine can  
<br />
see the trap of any given (third person presented at a correct level  
<br />
of description) machine, and even study the creative geometry of that  
<br />
trap, and what is common for all machines.
<br />
We can still be machine, because we don't know and then cannot know,  
<br />
which machine we are. We cannot even know if we are sound, nor can we  
<br />
known our correct level of description.
<br />
But by betting we are machine, we can deduce the sharable laws of our  
<br />
observable realities from an infinite sum of arithmetical histories,  
<br />
and justified the appearance from arithmetic, like Everet comp+QM  
<br />
justifies already the appearance of a classical selection from  
<br />
Schroedinger equation.
<br />
<br />You can see UDA+AUDA as a refinement of Penrose which leads to a  
<br />
radicalization of Everett. A correction of Penrose leads to an  
<br />
extension of Everett on Arithmetic. A coming back to Pythagorus (minus  
<br />
the superstitions).
<br />
<br />I must go. Apology for the length and the spelling.
<br />
<br />Best,
<br />
