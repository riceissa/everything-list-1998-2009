<br />
Caveat: This post will likely demonstrate my complete lack of advanced 
<br />
physics education.
<br />
<br />But here goes anyway.
<br />
<br />Is it possible to model gravity as space being filled with an 
<br />
all-directional flux of &quot;inverse gravitons&quot;? These would be
<br />
particles which:
<br />
1. Zoom around EVERYWHERE with a uniform distribution of velocities (up 
<br />
to C in any direction).
<br />
2. Interact weakly with matter, imparting a small momentum to matter (in 
<br />
the direction that the &quot;iGraviton&quot;
<br />
was moving) should they collide with a matter particle. The momentum 
<br />
comes at the cost that the
<br />
&quot;iGraviton&quot; which collided with mass either disappears or at least 
<br />
reduces its velocity relative
<br />
to the mass's velocity.
<br />
<br />So note that:
<br />
1. If there was just a single mass,  it would not receive any net 
<br />
momentum by collisions from iGravitons
<br />
because iGravitons with an even distribution of velocities impact it 
<br />
from all sides with equal probability,
<br />
no matter what the mass's velocity. (This is true because C is the same 
<br />
for each mass no matter how
<br />
it's travelling, so &quot;even distribution of velocities up to C&quot; is also 
<br />
the same from the perspective of each
<br />
mass regardless of its velocity.
<br />
<br />2. If two masses are near each other, they shadow each other from the 
<br />
flux of iGravitons which
<br />
would otherwise be impacting them from the direction in between them. 
<br />
This shadowing would
<br />
be proportional to the inverse square of the distances between the 
<br />
masses, and would be proportional
<br />
to the probability of each mass colliding with (i.e. absorbing) 
<br />
iGravitons, and this probability would
<br />
be proportional to the amount of each mass.   
<br />
(So the iGraviton shadow between the masses would have properties like a 
<br />
gravitational field).
<br />
<br />3. The mutual shadowing from momentum-imparting flux from all directions 
<br />
means that net momentum
<br />
would be imparted on the masses toward each other (by nothing other than 
<br />
the usual collisions
<br />
with iGravitons from all other directions.)
<br />
<br />4. The deficit of iGravitons (or deficit in velocity of them) in between 
<br />
absorbtive masses
<br />
could be viewed as inward curvature of space-time in that region. Amount 
<br />
or velocity distribution
<br />
of iGraviton flux in a region could correspond in some way with the 
<br />
dimensionality of space in that region.
<br />
<br />I find this theory appealing because
<br />
1. it's fundamental assumption for causation of gravity is simple (a 
<br />
uniformly-distributed-in-velocity-and-density
<br />
flux of space-involved (i.e. space-defining) particles.)
<br />
2. The paucity of iGravitons (or high iGraviton velocities) in a region 
<br />
corresponding to inward-curving space
<br />
is an appealingly direct analogy. You can visualize iGravitons as 
<br />
&quot;puffing up&quot; space and a lack of them
<br />
causing space there to sag in on itself.
<br />
<br />I'd be willing to bet that someone has thought of this long before and 
<br />
that it's been proven that
<br />
the math doesn't work out for it. Has anyone heard of anything like 
<br />
this? Is it proven silly already?
<br />
<br />Cheers,
<br />
&nbsp;Eric
