<br />We can say with precision that a certain sequence of rational numbers 
<br />
(generated by looking at larger and larger finite sets of integers from 0 - 
<br />
n) converges to 0.5. What we can't say with precision is that this result 
<br />
means that &quot;the probability that a given integer is even is 0.5&quot;. I don't 
<br />
think it's even coherent to talk about &quot;the probability of a given 
<br />
integer&quot;. What could that mean? &quot;Pick a random integer between 0 and 
<br />
infinity&quot;? As Jesse recently pointed out, it's not clear that this idea is 
<br />
even coherent.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;For me, there *is* an intuitive reason why the probability that an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;integer is a perfect square is zero.  It simply relates to the fact that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the squares become ever more sparse, and in the limit they become so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sparse that the chance of finding a perfect square approaches zero.
</em><br />
<br />Once again, I fully agree that, given the natural ordering of the integers, 
<br />
the perfect squares become ever more sparse. What isn't clear to me is that 
<br />
this sparseness has any affect on &quot;the probability that a given integer is 
<br />
a perfect square&quot;. Your conclusion implies: &quot;Pick a random integer between 
<br />
0 and infinity. The probability that it's a perfect square is zero.&quot; That 
<br />
seems flatly paradoxical to me. If the probability of choosing &quot;25&quot; is 
<br />
zero, then surely the probability of choosing &quot;24&quot;, or any other specified 
<br />
integer, is also zero. A more intuitive answer would be that the 
<br />
probability of choosing any pre-specified integer is &quot;infinitesimal&quot; (also 
<br />
a notoriously knotty concept), but that's not the result your method is 
<br />
providing. Your method is saying that the chances of choosing *any* perfect 
<br />
square is exactly zero. Maybe there are other possible diagnoses for this 
<br />
problem, but my diagnosis is that there's something wrong with the idea of 
<br />
picking a random integer from the set of all possible integers.
<br />
<br />Here's another angle on it. Consider the following sequence of integers:
<br />
<br />0, 1, 2, 4, 3, 9, 5, 16, 6, 25 ...
<br />
<br />Here we have the perfect squares interleaved with the non perfect-squares. 
<br />
In the limit, this represents the exact same set of integers that we've 
<br />
been talking about all along - every integer appears once and only once in 
<br />
this sequence. Yet, following your logic, we can prove that the probability 
<br />
that a given integer from this set is a perfect square is 0.5. Can't we?
<br />
