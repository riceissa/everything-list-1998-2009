Hello Mirek,
<br />
<br /><br />Le 05-déc.-07, à 23:08, Mirek Dobsicek a écrit :
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; thank you for your post. I read it a couple of times in order to more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; less grasp it, but it worth it. I have some questions...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Suppose there is a secure universal machine M. The set of expressions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; it can compute provide a secure universal language L. That set is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; only enumerable (given that it is a subset of an enumerable set) but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; above all, it can be enumerated effectively (by the &quot;ashole&quot;).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What do you mean here by effectively? I understand it as you just want
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to emphasize that the set is really enumerable.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I guess I will come back on this in the next post. But the point is 
<br />
that a set can be enumerable, yet NOT effectively enumerable. 
<br />
Effectively enumerable means enumerated by following unambiguous 
<br />
instructions in some language (universal or not). A dumb idiotic can do 
<br />
that.
<br />
<br />To sum up a bit:
<br />
<br />Recall that by a function from A to B, I always mean a function defined 
<br />
for all elements of A having value in B. In particular a function from 
<br />
N to N is defined on all natural number. To emphasize on this I will 
<br />
say sometimes &quot;TOTAL function&quot;. Then I will say &quot;strictly partial 
<br />
function for a function from S to N, when S is a proper subset of N.
<br />
<br />Cantor's diagonal on N^N shows that the set of functions from N to N, 
<br />
i.e. N^N,  is not enumerable (uncountable, ... mathematician have a lot 
<br />
of synonyms). So there is no bijection from N to N^N.
<br />
<br />Let us define N^N-comp as the set of computable functions in the sense 
<br />
described in the &quot;key post&quot;. It is the set of total computable 
<br />
functions, or better described (but less usual) it is the total 
<br />
functions which are computable.
<br />
Then N^N-comp is enumerable (indeed their corresponding 
<br />
set-of-instructions is a subset of all expressions in the language, 
<br />
which is already enumerable).
<br />
<br />Diagonalisation on N^N-comp shows that, although N^N-comp is 
<br />
enumerable, it is *not effectively enumerable*. The bijection between 
<br />
N^N-comp and N exist, yes, but is not a computable function. If it was, 
<br />
then the diagonal function g (with g(n) = f_n(n) +1) would be 
<br />
computable, in the list, and then 0 = 1, as I have try to explain. So 
<br />
it is really the bijection sending n on f_n which is not computable, 
<br />
and which makes g not computable.
<br />
<br />We can still believe there is a universal language in which we can 
<br />
define all total computable function, but then the language has to 
<br />
define more than the total computable one. In that case we get a 
<br />
language L which defines a more general class of &quot;computable 
<br />
functions&quot;, the one which are no more defined on all inputs. In that 
<br />
case the diagonal function g can be defined in the language, but then 
<br />
such function has to be undefined on its &quot;godel number k&quot;, that is, the 
<br />
number k such that g = f_k.
<br />
<br />And the key point is that no set of instructions at all can help the 
<br />
universal machine to distinguish in all case a code of a total function 
<br />
from a code of a strictly partial function. For if that was possible, 
<br />
then we could &quot;securise&quot; the universal machine making it computing only 
<br />
total functions, and then the diagonal will strike again and prove 0 = 
<br />
1.
<br />
<br />Note this discovery:
<br />
<br />If A is enumerable, and if B is included in A, then B is enumerable.
<br />
<br />But if A is effectively enumerable (meaning really that the ass..., er 
<br />
I mean the dumb one can enumerate A), it DOES NOT follow that any 
<br />
subset of A is effectively enumerable.
<br />
<br />There is a bijection between the set of code (instructions, 
<br />
expressions) of total computable function and N, but what the second 
<br />
diagonalization shows, is that such a bijection is not a computable 
<br />
bijection. The set of code of total function is an enumerable, but not 
<br />
effectively enumerable subset of the set of code of the partial (strict 
<br />
and not strict) functions.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; So, as you know, Church did *define* a computable function by a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; function computable by a lambda expression, in its conversion 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; calculus.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why do you introduce here the term 'lambda expression'? I'm asking this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because in the sequel you work just with 'a well specified language
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which is promised to be universal' and you prove that such a promise is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not ruled out.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I do not see how you reached the conlusion:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;But thanks to that crashing, *Church thesis remains consistent*. I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would just say &quot;An existence of a universal language is not ruled out&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />OK. But Church thesis says that Lambda is universal, and so a weaker 
<br />
form of Church thesis (the one which asserts the existence of a 
<br />
universal language) remains consistent. OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Each expression like that denotes now either a computable function 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; N to N, or as we have to expect something else. And we have to expect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; they are no computable means to distinguish which U_i represents
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; functions from N to N, and which represents the other beast.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Can I say that the other beasts are only and only infinite loops? I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assume that the machine cannot destroy itself, so it either stops after
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computing a computable function or enters some silly loop.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Despite universal machine are finite entity (like us with comp), we let 
<br />
them write on wall, papers, or magnetic tape, ....
<br />
So as Russell said, the machine could enter in a infinite and never 
<br />
repeated task. Of course if the machine ask for more memory, and if its 
<br />
sadic user just say no, well the machine will have problem. later I 
<br />
will insist heavily that universal machine are finite object. There are 
<br />
important reason of not putting the &quot;infinite tape&quot; in the machine. The 
<br />
tape of a Turing machine (for those who met her) is not part of the 
<br />
machine.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Indeed, the diagonalisation above, where now the f_i are the *partial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; computable functions*, meaning they are from N to N, OR from a subset
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of N to N, does no more lead to a contradiction.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have a problem with this paragraph, could you please write more on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this? I understand to partial computable functions as to functions 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are not *defined* for every possible input (total functions are defined
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for all inputs, in my limited understanding).
</em><br />
<br /><br />That is correct. Note that such a definition makes the total function a 
<br />
particular case of the partial function.
<br />
Total function: they are defined for any n.
<br />
Partial function: they are defined for any n, or not. It is possible 
<br />
that for some n, they will be undefined.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Do you say in that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; paragraph that beasts are only and only these partial functions?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Huh, now what do I mean by *defined* ... maybe I should say 'which are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not computable for every possible input'. I am really lost here...
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />OK I see the ambiguity in the wording.
<br />
Let me try another wording: a function is a total function (from N to 
<br />
N) if it is defined on all N. Example, the factorial function, the 
<br />
successor function, etc.  Then a function will be said to be a partial 
<br />
function from N to N, if it is a (total) function from a subset of N to 
<br />
N. Now, just remember that N is a particular case of subset of N (a non 
<br />
*proper*) subset, it is said. So a total function from N to N is a 
<br />
particular case of partial function.
<br />
That N is a subset of N, follows from the fact that x belongs to N 
<br />
implies that x belongs to N.
<br />
(A is included in B iff (by definition) x b A  -&gt; x b B   (b = belongs).
<br />
<br />Did this help? Don't worry. Some problem can occur because the word 
<br />
function is not used with the same meaning in the world (flemish and 
<br />
french talker already use different definition). We can decide to be 
<br />
clear on that given the international character of the mailing list. I 
<br />
am sure people use different version, and that is why I have always 
<br />
(re) define the notion, but I should have insisted that such a word has 
<br />
just no standard definition). Even mathematicians does not always use 
<br />
the term function with always the same meaning, when they go from one 
<br />
branch of math to another, like when going from arithmetic to analysis. 
<br />
But all serious mathematician are aware of that and usually redefine 
<br />
such terms before using them.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And my last question, consider the profound function
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; f such that f(n) = 1 if there is a sequence of n consecutive fives in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the decimal expansion of PI, and f(n) = 0 otherwise
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is this an example of a partial computable function? Or is this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; function
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as such already considered as un-computable function?
</em><br />
<br /><br />This is &quot;certainly&quot; an example of a total function from N to N. I put 
<br />
&quot;certainly&quot; in quote because I am using the principle of the excluded 
<br />
middle.
<br />
If you agree that for each n, either there are n consecutive fives in 
<br />
the decimal expansion of PI, or they are not n consecutive fives in the 
<br />
decimal expansion of PI, then you agree that, on, your function f is 
<br />
equal to 1 or to 0.
<br />
So the function, for a platonist, is perfectly well define on each n. 
<br />
It is a total function from N to N.
<br />
Is such a function computable?
<br />
That is an open problem. What is clear, is that nobody can compute it 
<br />
today, but this really proves nothing. Open question.
<br />
Note that for the bijection between the set of codes of total function 
<br />
and N, we are in a different situation: such a function has been shown 
<br />
(in the key post btw) to be not computable by any universal machine, as 
<br />
defined even just informally like I have done. With Church thesis (the 
<br />
half of comp) such a function will never been computable (by finite 
<br />
humble creature).
<br />
<br />Hope this helps a bit.  I have to go, so I will not *add*  spelling 
<br />
mistakes, this time (g). Don't hesitate to ask any question. Take the 
<br />
needed time for digesting.
<br />
<br />Best,
<br />
<br />Bruno
