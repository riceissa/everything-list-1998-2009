2009/8/17 Flammarion &lt;peterdjones.domain.name.hidden&gt;:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am trying to persuade Bruno that his argument has an implict
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumption of Platonism that should be made explicit. An  assumption
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of Platonism as a non-observable background might be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; justifiiable in the way you suggest, but it does need
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to be made explicit.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, this is why I felt it might help the discussion to make the
<br />
possibility of such an assumption explicit in this way.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno's theory may well be falsifiable. But then it is hardly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a disproof of materialism as it stands.
</em><br />
<br />Agreed - not as a knockdown blow - although as you know his argument
<br />
is that materialism is incompatible with the computational theory of
<br />
mind; and of course I've also been arguing for this, although my
<br />
alternative (i.e. a theory, rather than an intuition) wouldn't
<br />
necessarily be the same as his.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I think the core of the problem is a tendency to mentally conjure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; platonia as a pure figment;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am not sure what you mean by that. Anti-Platonic philsoophies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of maths, such as formalism, are considered positons supported by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arguments, not vague intuitions.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, I don't dispute that.  But aside from this, perhaps one could say
<br />
that we tend to assume that ideas about 'platonias' have sense but no
<br />
reference.  However, some physicists - Julian Barbour for one - use
<br />
the term in a way that clearly has reference, as I think does Bruno.
<br />
One should perhaps recall that the appeal to number as a causal
<br />
principle (to use the logic of 'paraphrase') can't be met by any
<br />
merely human concept of number.  IOW for reality to emerge from
<br />
number, whatever the putative referents of human number terminology
<br />
may be, they must at some level be uniquely cashable in terms of
<br />
RITSIAR.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; this will not do; nor is it presumably
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; what Plato had in mind.  Rather, platonia might be reconceived in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; terms of the preconditions of the observable and real; its theoretical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; entities must - ultimately - be cashable for what is RITSIAR, both
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'materially' and 'mentally'.  On this basis, some such intuition of an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'immaterial'  (pre-material?) - but inescapably real - precursory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; state could be seen as theoretically inevitable, whether one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; subsequently adopts a materialist or a comp interpretative stance.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don;t see why it is necessay at all, let alone why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it was inevitable. You were earlier comparing it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to a hypothetical background ontology. How did
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it jump form (falsifiable) hypotheiss to necessary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and inevitable truth?
</em><br />
<br />It didn't.  I was just suggesting that embracing some more 'agnostic'
<br />
background schema of this kind might actually be helpful in
<br />
appreciating the scope and limits of explanation.  For example, just
<br />
how far down the explanatory hierarchy do we have to go before it
<br />
starts making less and less sense to insist on characterising the
<br />
explanatory entities as 'material'?  Are superstrings material?  Is
<br />
quantum foam material?  Are
<br />
whatever-are-conceived-as-the-pre-conditions for their appearance in
<br />
the scheme of things material?  What is surely at issue is not their
<br />
'essential' materiality but their properties as appealed to by theory
<br />
(i.e. the ones to which we would resort by paraphrase).  Perhaps our
<br />
ultimate explanatory entities need be conceived as no more 'material'
<br />
than necessary for us to depend on them as plausible pre-cursors of
<br />
the more obviously material; but of course, no less so either.
<br />
<br />While I've got you here, as it were - I don't see why this wouldn't
<br />
apply equally to the mental: IOW our explanatory entities need be
<br />
conceived as no more 'mental' than necessary for us to depend on them
<br />
as plausible precursors of the more obviously mental; but no less so
<br />
either.
