<br /><br />1.1 Mechanist Philosophies
<br />
<br />1.1.1 Different types of Mechanism
<br />
<br />I distinguish the following mechanist hypotheses:
<br />
<br />BEHAVIOURIST MECHANISM
<br />
<br />Some machines can behave as thinking beings (living, conscious etc.)  
<br />
(BEH-MEC)
<br />
<br />STRONG MECHANISM
<br />
<br />Some machines can think (living beings, conscious beings, have a  
<br />
private life etc.) (STR-MEC)
<br />
<br />INDEXICAL MECHANISM
<br />
<br />I am a machine (or - you are a machine, or again - human beings are  
<br />
machines) (IND-MEC)
<br />
<br />By replacing &quot;machine&quot; by &quot;digital machine&quot; one obtains the  
<br />
corresponding digital theses.
<br />
<br />The behaviourist digital mechanism BEH-DIG-MEC corresponds largely to  
<br />
that of Turing in his 1950 article. In the same way, the strong  
<br />
digital mechanism STR-DIG-MEC corresponds to what is called in the  
<br />
literature the strong artificial intelligence thesis (strong AI).
<br />
<br />In this work I am exclusively interested in indexical and digital  
<br />
mechanism (IND-DIG-MEC or just IDM). &quot;Digitality&quot; necessitates  
<br />
Church's Thesis, which is why the digital aspect is explained in its  
<br />
turn in the second part. There, I will show how a procedure, due  
<br />
essentially to Goedel, permits an indexical treatment of machines in  
<br />
general.
<br />
<br />Proposition:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IND-MEC =&gt; STR-MEC =&gt; BEH-MEC, and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BEH-MEC ≠&gt; STR-MEC ≠&gt; IND-MEC.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(with or without the hypothesis of digitality)
<br />
<br /><br />Reasoning:  One admits that humans know how to think (conscious  
<br />
beings, having private lives etc.) In this case IND-MEC entails STR- 
<br />
MEC and STR-MEC entails BEH-MEC. That BEH-MEC does not entail STR-MEC  
<br />
is supported by Weizenbaum (1976) (see also Gunderson {footnote 1}  
<br />
1971). STR-MEC does not entail IND-MEC, since the fact that machines  
<br />
are able to think does not entail that they alone are able to think.  
<br />
It is conceivable that machines are able to think without we ourselves  
<br />
being machines. Wang (1974) presents a similar reasoning.  
<br />
Nevertheless, numerous philosophers make implicit use of an opposing  
<br />
opinion: STR-MEC =&gt; IND-MEC, see for example Arsac 1987.
<br />
<br />{Footnote 1: Gunderson 1971 criticises the Turing Test. The Turing  
<br />
Test is a test for BEH-MEC. Simply put, a machine (hidden) passes the  
<br />
test if it is able to pass itself off as a human being during a  
<br />
&quot;conversation&quot; by means of a computer keyboard terminal.}
<br />
<br />1.1.2 Mechanist Philosophy: Historical Summary
<br />
<br />Contemporary digital mechanist philosophy is due in large measure to  
<br />
Descartes and Hobbes {footnote 2} (see Rogow 1986, Bernhardt 1989).  
<br />
Descartes wanted to distinguish Man from the animals. He argues that  
<br />
animals, as much as Man's body (including the brain), are/is a  
<br />
machine. He intended by this a finite assembly of material components  
<br />
that unequivocally determines the behaviour of the whole. Descartes  
<br />
surmises that the soul is not mechanical. In separating the soul from  
<br />
the body in this way, and thus the mind from matter, he is the  
<br />
originator of the dualist position, widely encompassed by the  
<br />
philosophy of mind. One speaks of Cartesian Dualism.
<br />
<br />Following are three arguments that Descartes presented in favour of  
<br />
his distinction of Man from the animal-as-machine (note that this  
<br />
distinction entails the negation of IND-MEC.)
<br />
<br />{Footnote 2: One can detect some mechanist affirmations or questions  
<br />
among (pre and post-Socratic, though not necessarily materialist)  
<br />
philosophers, from Greek antiquity (cf Timaeus and Plato, see also  
<br />
Odifreddi 1989). Among Chinese philosophers, for example Lao-Tzu, a  
<br />
certain monk is admired for having passed off his &quot;automated&quot; servants  
<br />
as flesh and blood beings. Among Hindu philosophers for example, in  
<br />
the &quot;Questions to the King Milinda&quot;, the human body is compared to the  
<br />
chariot, and the human mind is compared to the different parts of the  
<br />
chariot, similar to Hume's (1739) manner of tackling the problem of  
<br />
identity with his boat. The temptation to set up artefacts in the  
<br />
image of Man is also a component of several myths, (for ex. the Golem  
<br />
in Jewish culture, see for ex. Breton 1990). It is no exaggeration to  
<br />
maintain that the very idea of mechanism appears wherever and whenever  
<br />
machines themselves are developed.}
<br />
<br />1) Animals are not endowed with reason and cannot engage in linguistic  
<br />
communication
<br />
<br />This argument is losing credibility since language and reason seem  
<br />
more accessible to today's machines than for example, emotion which is  
<br />
communally allowed in the case of certain animals (see for ex. Lévy  
<br />
1987). Here Descartes takes Aristotle's position which asserts that  
<br />
Man is a &quot;reasoning animal&quot;.
<br />
<br />2) Machines are finite beings. A finite being cannot conceive of the  
<br />
infinite. Now, I am able (said Descartes) to conceive of the infinite.  
<br />
Thus I am not a machine.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;This argument against IND-MEC brings into relief two fundamental  
<br />
questions:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Can Man conceive of infinity?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Can a machine conceive of infinity?
<br />
<br />Question a) differentiates Hobbes' point of view from Descartes'.  
<br />
Hobbes concludes that he cannot in effect conceive of infinity.
<br />
<br />3) A machine can only carry out particular tasks, as it turns out,  
<br />
those tasks for which it was constructed. In effect, Descartes is  
<br />
saying:
<br />
<br />&quot;Since, in the case that reason is a universal instrument that  
<br />
participates in every sort of encounter, these organs need a certain  
<br />
particular disposition for each and every action; from this comes the  
<br />
idea that it is morally impossible that a machine might possess  
<br />
sufficient diversity such that it might act in every living occurrence  
<br />
in the same way that our reason assists our actions (Descartes,  
<br />
&quot;1953&quot;, page 165).
<br />
<br />The idea of a universal machine had nevertheless crossed the mind of  
<br />
Raymond Lulle (1302) whom Descartes studied. This same idea will  
<br />
reappear with Leibnitz, culminating in the work of Turing, and this  
<br />
will be explained in the second part.
<br />
<br />La Mettrie will rehash Descartes' animal-as-machine for the purpose of  
<br />
extending it to Man (La Mettrie 1748, see also Gunderson 1971).
<br />
<br />In parallel with Descartes, Hobbes himself develops the mechanist  
<br />
hypothesis (Rogow 1986). One can date Hobbes' motivation toward  
<br />
mechanism from the time of his discovery of geometry. Having been  
<br />
particularly impressed by the fact that he may have been convinced by  
<br />
a *finite communication* based on logical geometrical reasoning,  
<br />
Hobbes conceives of the mechanistic character of thought. He then  
<br />
reasons that it should be possible to reduce thinking to addition and  
<br />
subtraction. (see Webb 1980). He is thus very close to the  
<br />
*functionalist* position in the philosophy of mind: that the additions  
<br />
and multiplications might be realisable by a *telegraphic network* , a  
<br />
*hydraulic system*, an *electromagnetic device* , or even *a  
<br />
windmill*, a *catapult* or a *calculating device* (ordinateur), to  
<br />
cite Searle's enumeration (Searle 1984). Thought is thereby reduced to  
<br />
operations not necessarily equipment-dependent, and to the constituent  
<br />
matter employed to realise these operations. La Mettrie, in his own  
<br />
way argues in something like the same sense:
<br />
<br />&quot;Thus a Soul of mud, discovering in the twinkling of an eye the  
<br />
relations and the consequences of an infinity of ideas difficult to  
<br />
conceive, would be preferable evidently to an ignorant and stupid  
<br />
Soul, which might be made of all the more precious Elements&quot; (La  
<br />
Mettrie 1748).
<br />
<br />Similarly, Lafitte engages us on the subject of Babbage, precursor of  
<br />
19th century information processing, to which we will return in the  
<br />
second part:
<br />
<br />&quot;For Babbage, all machines being a composition of different organs  
<br />
linked together in a complex manner, the important thing to fix is  
<br />
less the very form of the organs than the sequencing of their  
<br />
functions, which relates to organic linkages causing the ensemble to  
<br />
function.&quot; (Lafitte 1930).
<br />
<br />Differing with Descartes, Hobbes concludes that it is not possible  
<br />
that Man - whom he considers as a finite being - might conceive of the  
<br />
infinite. Hobbes' motivation, being finitist and indexical (human  
<br />
thought is mechanisable) is therefore opposed to Descartes' animal-as- 
<br />
machine and is, in this sense much closer to the contemporary  
<br />
motivation in the direction of artificial intelligence. Soon I will  
<br />
return to the relation existing between mechanism and functionalism.
<br />
<br />1.1.3 What is a machine?
<br />
<br />Given the familiar connotations of the word &quot;machine&quot; - locomotives,  
<br />
electric kettles, automobiles, computers, microscopes, dish-washers,  
<br />
sewing machines, rice-cookers, time-pieces - (the concept of)  
<br />
mechanism may well seem grotesque.
<br />
<br />Even if machines are considered to be artefacts of exclusively human  
<br />
construction, in other words artificial, the concept of the machine is  
<br />
difficult to define. Lafitte, in 1911 argues that just such a  
<br />
definition can only be made in vain:
<br />
<br />&quot;To claim to be able to define the concept of a machine is to suppose  
<br />
that the science of machines has come about, or that it might one day  
<br />
come about in all it's perfection. Other than what amounts,  
<br />
chimerically-speaking, to assigning limits to the development of  
<br />
mechanical forms, it really is to suppose in the first place an entire  
<br />
and complete knowledge of the character of every individual present  
<br />
and future mechanism, followed by the perfection of a measuring  
<br />
instrument capable of situating each into a definitive category  
<br />
according to the ensemble of characteristics. But, this again  
<br />
implicitly admits to a massive division of sorts, conforming entirely  
<br />
to those contours that we can cleanly envisage, having no link  
<br />
whatsoever with other bodies.&quot; (see also further on 2.3)
<br />
<br />Similarly, La Mettrie, in &quot;Man as Machine&quot; writes:
<br />
<br />&quot;Man is a Machine composed in such a way that it is frankly impossible  
<br />
to initially get a clear idea of it and consequently to arrive at a  
<br />
definition&quot;
<br />
<br />What Hobbes and Descartes have in common is that a machine is a  
<br />
locally finite being. Its global behaviour is determined by the  
<br />
behaviour of its elementary constituents, these being finite in number  
<br />
at each instant (call this the &quot;digital aspect&quot;). The number of  
<br />
components can nonetheless grow according to the work performed by the  
<br />
machine.
<br />
<br />A philosophy called &quot;Mechanical Philosophy&quot; developed not only under  
<br />
influence of Newton's works but also under those of Boyle (see  
<br />
Broukère 1982), was more materialist and determinist (in the vague  
<br />
contemporary sense) than finitist. Action at a distance which seems to  
<br />
exist between material bodies in Newton's mechanics which in addition  
<br />
worried Hobbes, seemed to exclude any finite component (see  
<br />
Metaxopoulos 1986). Similarly, Searle - who I do not classify as a  
<br />
mechanist philosopher - argues that a machine alone such as (according  
<br />
to him) the human brain, is capable of thought, but he is unclear as  
<br />
to the nature of the identifying factors. The difficulty inherent in  
<br />
defining machines is reflected in the difficult task of circumscribing  
<br />
mechanist philosophy.
<br />
<br />Gandy (1980) isolated 4 principles capturing the intuitive idea of a  
<br />
machine (digital or effectively digitisable):
<br />
<br />1) Determining Principle: a machine may be described by the givens  
<br />
within a hierachical structure S, equally by a function F such that  
<br />
iteration F(S), F(FSS)), F(F(F(S))),....specifies the evolution of  
<br />
that machine.
<br />
<br />2) Limiting Hierachical Principle: a structure S is hierarchised via a  
<br />
finite number of levels.
<br />
<br />3) Principle of Unique Reassembly: a structure S can be disassembled  
<br />
into limited parts and reconstituted in a unique way according to  
<br />
those parts, following a guide or plan (which itself must be finite).
<br />
<br />4) Locality Principle: the hierarchical structure of a machine admits  
<br />
a topological description such that the state of a part of the machine  
<br />
Fn(S) stemming from its evolution only depends on the state of parts  
<br />
in the immediate vicinity in Fn-1(S) (no &quot;action at a distance&quot;).
<br />
<br />Gandy and Shepherdson (1988) give a much more precise formulation in  
<br />
terms of groups deemed finite by heredity. Gandy demonstrates (and  
<br />
Shepherdson generalises) the equivalence between this definition and  
<br />
Turing's conceptual definition (with oracle), so that a generalised  
<br />
version of Church's Thesis will permit (in the second part) that we  
<br />
can do without Gandy's explicit principles. I have nonetheless laid  
<br />
bare these principles informally since they fall back on Descartes'  
<br />
and Hobbes' conceptions and illuminate the biological pretext for  
<br />
(digital) mechanism, as well as certain doubts arising from chemistry.
<br />
<br />1.1.4 Biological Incentives
<br />
<br />These concern indexical mechanism directly since they stem from self- 
<br />
observation, unlike incentives arising from the contemplation of  
<br />
engineering work (see for ex. Lafitte 1930, Vèsale 1543, Ambroselli  
<br />
1987).
<br />
<br />Wanting to show that animals are machines, Descartes runs up against a  
<br />
problem that he can never resolve.
<br />
<br />1* Descartes'problem
<br />
<br />How could an animal-as-machine be capable of reproduction? How could a  
<br />
machine construct a self-same and identical machine? It would have to  
<br />
contain a complete description or plan of itself, and this seems  
<br />
impossible. {footnote 3}. The fact that cellular division is, broadly  
<br />
speaking, understood to take place at the molecular level (Cairns,  
<br />
Watson and Crick, (see Watson (1965, 1989) for detailed references)  
<br />
constitutes a contemporary biological incentive for mechanism.
<br />
<br />(Footnote 3: This argument is used from time to time, as in Cossa in  
<br />
1955: &quot;Were machines to find themselves - via an impossible form of  
<br />
reasoning - endowed with reproductive power, these irregularities,  
<br />
these defects - although tiny at the start and without functional  
<br />
consequences - would undergo an amplification from generation to  
<br />
generation such that the machine would rapidly cease to work at all.&quot;
<br />
<br />2* Driesch's problem
<br />
<br />Similarly, when Driesch conducted his first experiments in embryology,  
<br />
cellular division seemed to him at this point to be a surprising  
<br />
phenomenon which he would go on to use as a decisive argument in  
<br />
favour of vitalism, arriving at a counter-mechanist {footnote 4}  
<br />
conception of life {footnote 5}.
<br />
<br />(Footnote 4: The difference between the non-mechanist and anti- 
<br />
mechanist view is identical to that of the agnostic to the atheist.)
<br />
<br />(Footnote 5: By way of reaction, Helmholtz proposes a mechanist theory  
<br />
of perception - something we will in a certain sense rediscover - and  
<br />
opts for an anti-vitalist pact ( de Broukère 1982)
<br />
<br />By the same token, how might we explain the flexibility exhibited by  
<br />
cells in the analogous phenomenon of cellular regeneration? Think for  
<br />
a moment of the cloning of a frog (see Watson et al 1989 p. 835) or  
<br />
yet, of the stupefying example of the planarian, small flatworm  
<br />
roughly 1cm in length which lives in certain freshwater habitats (see  
<br />
the drawing, following page) which qualifies as a kind of champion of  
<br />
tissue regeneration among animals possessing a central nervous system  
<br />
(Buchsbaum 1938, Buchsbaum et al. 1987). Phenomena of genetic  
<br />
regulation with regard to mechanism are eloquent [elegant?=poss.  
<br />
error:] Kim) (Jacob and Monod 1961, Thomas 1978, Thomas and van Ham  
<br />
1974).
<br />
<br />Here again is what Diderot said in his conversation with d'Alembert,  
<br />
in confronting Cartesian mechanism and the development of the embryo:
<br />
<br />&quot;Do you see this egg? With this, one can upend every school of  
<br />
theology and every temple on Earth. What is this egg? Before the germ  
<br />
(of life) is introduced, no more than an insensate mass; and after  
<br />
it's introduction, what is it then? An insensate mass, since the germ  
<br />
itself is but an inert and coarse fluid. How might this mass progress  
<br />
to another form of organisation, toward the sensation of feeling,  
<br />
toward life itself? By warmth. What produces this warmth? Movement.  
<br />
What will be the successive effects of movements? Instead of my  
<br />
response, sit here and together we will follow these movements from  
<br />
moment to moment. Starting with a point that oscillates, a thread that  
<br />
extends and gathers colour, to the flesh which forms; a beak, tiny  
<br />
wing-ends, eyes, feet appear; a yellow-tinged matter that divides and  
<br />
which produces intestines; behold an animal. An animal that moves,  
<br />
becomes agitated, sounds its voice; I hear its squawking through the  
<br />
shell; it grows its downy coat; it sees. The weight of its head, which  
<br />
bobs back and forth, unceasingly brings its beak against the inner  
<br />
rampart of its prison; this now breaks; it leaves, it walks, it flies,  
<br />
it registers irritation, it flees, it returns, it complains, it  
<br />
suffers, it loves, it desires, it experiences joy; it possesses each  
<br />
of your affects; all of your actions, it can perform them all. Can you  
<br />
claim, with Descartes that it is no more than a purely imitative  
<br />
machine? In that case, tiny children laugh at you with derision and  
<br />
the philosophers' rejoinder is that if such is a machine, then you are  
<br />
but another.&quot; {footnote 6}
<br />
<br />(Footnote 6: We note here the essentially modernist mindset of Diderot  
<br />
who places the animal on the same rung as the human, thus rejecting  
<br />
Descartes' distinction. In general, with the notable exception of La  
<br />
Mettrie, mechanism will face a poor reception. This brings to mind  
<br />
Pascal's argument. This genre of &quot;argument&quot; is not all that far from  
<br />
what Turing called &quot;head in the sand objection&quot; qualifying more as  
<br />
&quot;consolation&quot; than refutation. (Turing 1950)
<br />
<br />The contemporary biologist may surmise that - relative to the laws of  
<br />
chemistry - the problem of biological reproduction is solved. The  
<br />
discovery by biochemists and molecular geneticists of the plan or  
<br />
description of the cell and the fashion by which this map is  
<br />
chemically represented, decoded and executed within the organism  
<br />
constitutes cause for the application of the Principle of Unique  
<br />
Reassembly, the Determining Principle and the Limiting Hierachical  
<br />
Principle (this last appearing already with classical genetics, see  
<br />
Cuny 1969). In the same way, the older discovery of the importance of  
<br />
particle exchanges with the surrounding environment or between  
<br />
organisms - as happens during breathing, during digestion, during  
<br />
conception, favours the application of the Locality Principle (Van  
<br />
Helmont, Mendel, Lavoisier, Vesale - to cite the more well known ones;  
<br />
see de Broukère 1982, Ambroselli et al 1987, Vesale 1543).
<br />
<br />1.1.5 Doubts Arising from Chemistry
<br />
<br />Watson has said &quot;the cell obeys the laws of chemistry&quot;, and the  
<br />
preceding incentives perhaps justify a belief in indexical mechanism  
<br />
relative to those laws. If these laws prove themselves to be non- 
<br />
mechanisable, mechanism will thereby find itself weakened, perhaps  
<br />
even refuted but certainly relativised.
<br />
<br />This suggestion is all the more well-founded in that the laws of  
<br />
chemistry are captured by quantum mechanics. Despite its name  
<br />
(&quot;mechanics&quot; is here used in the Newtonian sense), philosophers and  
<br />
theologians are attracted to QM and see in the factual descriptions  
<br />
(up to here confirmed) of this theory an empirical justification of  
<br />
the non-mechanist nature of the world and/or of consciousness.  
<br />
{footnote 7}
<br />
<br />(Footnote 7: Letovski 1987 takes up a (too?) rare encounter between  
<br />
cognitivists open to computational approaches to consciousness and  
<br />
neuroscientists open to the use of QM to resolve the brain/mind gap.)
<br />
<br />Anti-mechanist arguments founded on QM are various. We shall briefly  
<br />
examine several:
<br />
<br />a) The oldest argument: QM provides evidence of an intrinsic  
<br />
indeterminism in the world (or more precisely concerning the relations  
<br />
between the observer and the world. Mechanism is determinist. Thus,  
<br />
our relation to the world is not mechanist.
<br />
<br />Those who use this argument are tempted to &quot;explain&quot; such a free  
<br />
interpretation by means of this indeterminism. This argument has  
<br />
already been refuted by Carnap or Mackay or Schroedinger. In addition,  
<br />
I will show that mechanism *is not* determinist.
<br />
<br />a) The most recent argument: QM makes possible very particular forms  
<br />
of material, for example the quasi-crystals of Penrose and Schectman  
<br />
(see Penrose 1989). Penrose suggests, though without any seeming  
<br />
conviction, that the brain could be a *sort* of quasi-crystal.  
<br />
Similarly, Margenau 1984 and Squires 1990 seek to utilise QM to  
<br />
develop a dualist and non-mechanist theory of the mind (see also Stapp  
<br />
1993).
<br />
<br />The following arguments merit close and detailed examination since the  
<br />
(indexical) mechanist hypothesis considerably clarifies them. To this  
<br />
end, I will make use of a bare minimum of assumed quantum mechanical  
<br />
knowledge to allow the reader to follow the argument.
<br />
<br />Newton conceived of matter and light as constituted of particles  
<br />
interacting with one another. Huygens was more prepared to reserve  
<br />
this way of seeing things for matter alone. He develops a successful  
<br />
wave theory of light which takes account of a number of luminous  
<br />
phenomena. Einstein will provide evidence, in his work on the photo- 
<br />
electric effect, of the corpuscular aspect of light, without  
<br />
dethroning the wave theory in the process. He also arrives at the  
<br />
quantum theory of light. De Broglie extends the wave-particle aspect  
<br />
of light to matter.  This permits the taking into account of the  
<br />
behaviour of electrons in Bohr's description of atoms and signals the  
<br />
birth of the quantum theory of matter.
