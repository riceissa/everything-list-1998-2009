<br />
<br />Thanks for the very useful summary and the warning that we might be  
<br />
zooming in on fractal infinity - no way will that happen from here on!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The mechanist hypothesis is the hypothesis that we are machine so  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that, in principle, any part of us can be replaced. There is no  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; special organ or part of us which should not be replaceable by an  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; equivalent (artificial or natural) part. All right?
</em><br />
<br /><br />No problem
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, there is a natural an objection which we can hear from times to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; times. If my heart is broken, I can survive with the heart of Mister  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; X, who died accidentally in a car crash. But if my brain is broken  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or is threatening to break, can I really expect to survive with  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mister X's brain? If we accept the lesson of neurophysiology it  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; looks more like the fact that  Mister X survives, with its own  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; memory and brain, and with my body.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK. In order for me to survive with Mister X brain, we will have to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; clean its memories from his brain, and to reconfigure Mister X's  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain with the data collected in my own brain. The situation is the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; same with a computer. We can exchange the keyboard, but we have to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be cautious not exchanging too rapidly the hard disk. If we exchange  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the hard disk, we have to make a backup of my computer  before, then  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we have to be sure we got a new clean hard disk on which we can load  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the backup. All right?
</em><br />
<br /><br />No question
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So if you are a machine, it means you can survive with an artificial  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain, or with an entire artificial body. We have just to be  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cautious of retaining the right configuration of the elementary  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; parts, at some level of description. In the case of the brain, this  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is a tremendous work, but we will need only the idea that Mechanism  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; makes such thing possible in principle, at some level. All right?
</em><br />
<br /><br />All right
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So, now, let me offer you, for your unbirthday feast, a new brain.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Oh! You don't seem to happy. You already got  six artificial brains!  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And you already have six artificial bodies. My gift is not so much  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; original, sorry.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I could go a really fantastic high-end stereo system though
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yet, now, each morning you can choose which body you will hang on  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (and have a different body for each day of the week now!). Of course  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the evening you make a backup of the entire plan of the whole  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machinery which constitutes yourself, and in the morning (after  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; having made the &quot;plan&quot;  running on your big home computer for the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; delight of dreaming, for example) you have the ability to choose  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which body and which brain suits better for the day, a bit like you  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can choose which clothes suit you better. All right?
</em><br />
<br /><br />entendu - I think the Japanese have close to a working version of this  
<br />
right now
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But if you can choose which body (including the brain) you can use,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this means you are NOT your body. Your body is much more like a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; vehicle, like a car.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You can also dispose your seven different bodies in seven different  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; planets, and use the internet as a locomotion transport. You can  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; travel at the speed of light (except for the month of encoding- 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; uploading and downloading-decoding, alas, we are only in the year  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2508!).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The point is that you are more of the type of an immaterial pattern  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or information structure. You still need some material world around  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you (apparently), for interpreting that information pattern, so that  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your experience can be manifested relatively to that material world,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but, it seems to me, *you* are immaterial, as immaterial as a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; number, which can encode your soul on a disk.
</em><br />
<br /><br />That appears to be the deal right there, yep - up to here the score is  
<br />
kind of:
<br />
<br />Religion 1
<br />
<br />Science 1
<br />
<br />Isn't it great that we may soon be able to capture the soul to  
<br />
disk!!!! You could have a Catholic soul, try an Islamic soul, reboot  
<br />
as a Buddhist - any religion you want
<br />
<br />there are immense practical applications in this. Just an engineering  
<br />
problem now. Brent!!
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is *digital* mechanism, the machine's plan is what count, as  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; far as it captures the relevant instantaneous state from which you  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hope to survive the substitution that the plan makes relatively  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Are you saying the machine may not be &quot;good enough&quot;? - that it could  
<br />
somehow fail to &quot;capture the relevant instantaneous state&quot;? What might  
<br />
the implications of that be?
<br />
<br />Don't answer that - I will shut up
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A less fictionful argument in favor of (relative) digital mechanism  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is the discovery of a plan of the molecular organization which  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; supports us, and the fact that by eating and defecating and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; breathing we change quasi-completely our molecular structure every  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seven years. Actually a much shorter time for most organ, but the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bones are slower; I think. I guess Stathis knows more on this.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Molecular biology is what has made most biologist convinced that our  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bodies are organic (&quot;natural&quot;) machines, self-repairing and self- 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; transforming through a rather incredible giant chemical reaction,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; itself evolving through a long chemical history.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But once we make precise the hypothesis, fictionful argument are no  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; less valid, and you see that once a machine bet she is a machine, by  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explicitly embracing a complete substitution of the (relative) body,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; she has to bet &quot;she&quot; is not material.
</em><br />
<br /><br />If &quot;she&quot; has enough brains and imagination to think it through, that is
<br />
<br />OK - I have seen the shining light of understanding
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; *she* can be better captured by an invariant patten, or by a slowly  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; variant pattern, capable to survive wherever the correct plan is  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instantiate with respect to the expected context.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Xenocrates said: &quot;the soul is a number which moves itself&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><br />The hammer hits itself
<br />
The eye sees itself move
<br />
The tongue tastes itself
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Here the &quot;plan of the machine&quot;, codable by a number (and may be  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; downloadable on the net), plays a role similar to Xenocrates' soul.
</em><br />
<br /><br />what if I download a corrupted version or one with a virus?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In some sense I disagree with Xenocrates, but at this stage of the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reasoning, you can identify yourself with the number which encodes a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; description of your body and mind, and in that sense, you are a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; number, which each evening put itself on a disk, and each morning  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; choose among seven bodies to fit the day.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; With mechanism, you can save your soul on a disk.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; All right?
</em><br />
<br /><br />So that means we already exist on a disk somewhere, right...
<br />
<br />I hope these disks are in safe hands
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is almost the definition of the comp hyp. You say &quot;yes&quot; to the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doctor who proposes to you an artificial, and actually digital, brain.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The mechanist assumption is that, with all the usual by default  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumptions, you do survive, in the usual sense of surviving an  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hospital operation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But then *you* can choose your body, so you are not your body. All  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; right?
</em><br />
<br /><br />I am not my body - I am not my brain
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Do you see in which sense I am saying that *you* are immaterial,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; once you assume Mechanism?
</em><br />
<br /><br />I can change everything and anything I want about me and still remain me
<br />
<br />ergo &quot;I&quot; am an immaterial something: probably a number or a very long  
<br />
bitstring which can, like any data, be crunched
<br />
<br />I see and agree - there is nobody who would argue fiercely against you  
<br />
up to here? Is everyone in accord with the details up to here?
<br />
<br />Is there anything like as convincing an alternate stance?
<br />
<br />Just wondering
<br />
<br /><br />cheers,
<br />
<br /><br />Kim
