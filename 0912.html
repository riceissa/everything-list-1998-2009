<br />
Hi all,
<br />
<br />Great number of interesting and deep posts. I will try to comment some
<br />
now (actually I will answer only Chris), and  others later. 
<br />
For exemple SLP and Hans' discussion on
<br />
consciousness is very interesting but bears on difficult questions that 
<br />
I want not to dwelve into now if only because I want to think 
<br />
a little more ...
<br />
For a little &quot;quasi-objective&quot; theory of consciousness, look at 
<br />
my (godelian) chapter 5.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Christopher Maloney (about my post to &quot;Romanos Avaqian&quot;):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Bruno, when I read your posts, I feel small!  Thanks for this,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you have swelled my reading list yet more.
</em><br />
<br />I don't intend to make you feeling small and 
<br />
I am sorry if I have donne so :-(
<br />
<br />I feel that Romanos Avaqian's question is a very fundamental one.
<br />
Fair enough, Romanos' question &quot;can the subject become an object for
<br />
himself?&quot; gives me an opportunity to give, not *my* answer but the answer
<br />
any one will get from an interview of a  self-referentially correct 
<br />
machine, 
<br />
modulo the  &quot;theetetic definition of knowledge&quot;. (An *avant gout* of my 
<br />
chapter 5,  which is self-implying independant).
<br />
<br />The anwer is no. No subject can recognize itself as an object.
<br />
<br />But I should mention you can get the same answer &quot;in a self-implying 
<br />
way&quot;, by using a thought experiment in which you imply yourself both in 
<br />
first
<br />
person (subject) view and in third person view like your own duplication
<br />
thought experiment (see your URL) which shows, among other things, that 
<br />
duplicated people cannot recognize themselves in their respective doubles 
<br />
(doppelgangers).
<br />
A machine can only BET that &quot;itself&quot; is an object from another machine's
<br />
(first person) point of view. Like a patient relatively to his surgeon, 
<br />
or a
<br />
computationalist (practionners) in front of his classical 
<br />
teletransportation
<br />
machine.
<br />
This reflection is also linked to Lucas-Penrose misuse of Godel's theorem,
<br />
and Benacerraf wonderfull and super-important paper (although wrong from 
<br />
the
<br />
very beginning to the very end as Benacerraf himself recognizes): 'God, 
<br />
the devil and Godel', the monist 51, 9-32, 1967.
<br />
<br />Concerning my swelling of your reading list. I'm afraid it's only
<br />
a beginning. The mind-body problem and the everything stuff belongs
<br />
to a new (not yet named) field which is at the intersection of all fields 
<br />
! 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Christopher Maloney (to Steve Price) :
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Ugh, I don't even want to *talk* about zombies.  I find the whole
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;concept patently absurd, and in a way, ethically repugnant.  By 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that I mean that it seems to me awfully grandiose and anthro-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;centric to even presume that some other creature that exhibits
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;all the traits of consciousness and thoughtfulness, could some-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;how not be conscious or thoughtful.
</em><br />
<br />I have the same ethical aversion of the zombie notion, Chris, but ...
<br />
But sometimes for logical purpose it is useful to go beyond your
<br />
feelings. As a matter of fact the notion of zombie IS very useful
<br />
in philosophy of mind, ... if only to address the &quot;consciousness&quot; 
<br />
problem. I agree with Steve Price's anwer to your post here.
<br />
<br />For exemple, some philosopher of mind take the zombie as an absurd
<br />
concept (like you and me, indeed), SO if someone argue that a theory X 
<br />
leads to the existence of zombie, she gives a kind of reductio ad 
<br />
absurdum against the theory X.
<br />
<br />As an illustration I think zombies are unavoidable for those who
<br />
defends the De Broglie-Bohm interpretation of QM. (Hint: AI and quantum
<br />
computing, you can help yourself with Deutsch's argument that MWI is
<br />
experimentally testable, you can find it at the Michael Clive Price FAQ
<br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hedweb.com/manworld.htm#detect">http://www.hedweb.com/manworld.htm#detect</a>).
<br />
<br />In fact those &quot;De Broglie-Bohm&quot; zombies are even incorporeal !
<br />
They are not made with particules !
<br />
Nevertheless most of them acts like us, including long talk on 
<br />
consciousness and bodies, they makes love and children, and all this,
<br />
without consciousness and without
<br />
bodies. And all these uncorporeal bodies and unconscious talks interfere 
<br />
with our real quasi-newtonian-like unique universe, full of particules !
<br />
Surely you were joking mister Bohm !
<br />
It is indeed my dislike of the idea of zombie which makes me sceptical
<br />
about any no-wave-packet-reduction-but-single-world interpretation
<br />
of either QM or COMP. Bohm's theory is a kind of cosmic solipsism and 
<br />
&quot;zombie&quot; are useful for making that statement clear.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Christopher Maloney (to Hal):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Thanks for this post.  Very well written.  How can I get a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;copy of Maudlin's paper?  Is it in English?
</em><br />
<br />Yes, the paper is in English. How to get it ? You must confront
<br />
yourself with the dragon and other evils you will surely meet in
<br />
your local (university) library. The reference are in the 1989 
<br />
Journal of Philosophy, page 407.
<br />
(Follow the exemple of Jacques M Mallah, Hal Finney and ...Lara Croft!).
<br />
<br />... if the dragon is too much angry with you, tell me and I will send
<br />
you a copy :-)
<br />
By the way, I appreciate very much Hal's outline of Maudlin paper. That
<br />
will be useful.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Christopher Maloney :
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Please explain this, if you have time.  I'm sorry if you've already
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;given more detail in other posts, perhaps you could point me to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;archives.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;What exactly is &quot;the computationalist hypothesis&quot;?
</em><br />
<br />It is the hypothesis that it is in principle possible to survive
<br />
with an artificial digitalisable brain. (Note that this principle uses
<br />
a minimal amount of folk psychology for the daily interpretation of 
<br />
the word &quot;I&quot; and &quot;survive&quot;, and this is what I eliminate in my chapter 5).
<br />
Brain can be defined here as the portion of the universe you need, 
<br />
at the level of description you need, which make the hypothesis 
<br />
very weak. 
<br />
You can take it simply as the hypothesis that you are a &quot;computer&quot;.
<br />
Nevertheless comp is 
<br />
logically stronger than the traditional STRONG AI thesis 
<br />
(machine can think). Both COMP and
<br />
STRONG AI are stronger than the most traditional Behavioristic Thesis 
<br />
(cf The Turing test). This can be proved by using ZOMBIES !.
<br />
The thesis can be made more precise with CHURCH's Thesis and some
<br />
form of (arithmetical) platonism, a weaker form of Tegmark's mathematical
<br />
platonism.
<br />
<br />You can search COMP in the archive, (or PE-OMEGA to get less answers).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I gather from the above that &quot;the physical supervenience thesis&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;has something to do with explaining consciousness as a software
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;program, but I'm confused.  I would have *guessed* that that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the &quot;computationalist hypothesis&quot;, but you say that those are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;incompatible, so it can't be.
</em><br />
<br />The physical supervenience thesis is the thesis that
<br />
1) there is a physical world.
<br />
2) there is consciousness (whatever it is, but it is aknowledged that it
<br />
is not typically decribable in physical or 3d-person terms).
<br />
3) that consciousness is associate (not necessarily in a causal way)
<br />
with the physical activity of the brain (or a computer with comp).
<br />
<br />To be sure, there are other version of the supervenience thesis. It is
<br />
a not so simple notion. There is a book by KIM on supervenience, but 
<br />
I don't recommand it here (to sophisticate from the philosophy of mind 
<br />
point of view, and to naive from the physical science point of view). 
<br />
May be more on this later. (All this IMHO, needless to say).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Anyway, Bruno, when I read your posts, I must admit that I feel
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;completely ignorant.  I'm coming to this list as a software
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;engineer who happens to have taken a little bit of QM, but I don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;know anything about these heady issues of the mathematically 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;rigorous computationalist theory (hell, I don't even know what to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;call it).  Could you suggest any introductory textbooks on this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;topic?  I am definitely convinced that your (and others on and off
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this list) approach is a valid and powerful technique for exploring 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;these issues.
</em><br />
<br />There are a lot of excellent introductory book. You force me to make 
<br />
&nbsp;difficult choices.
<br />
I guess that the best book on logic and computability, including
<br />
the modal use in godelian provability, is 
<br />
<br />Boolos G. S. and Jeffrey R. C., COMPUTABILITY AND LOGIC, 1989 (3d 
<br />
edition),
<br />
Cambridge University Press.
<br />
<br />A classical very nice and little introduction to theoretical computer
<br />
&nbsp;science is:
<br />
<br />N. J. CUTLAND, Computability, an introduction to recursive
<br />
function theory, Cambridge University Press, 1980 (repr. 1983).
<br />
<br />A very good introductory text to mathematical Logic + Computability 
<br />
is also:
<br />
<br />MENDELSON Elliott, Introduction to Mathematical Logic, 3d ed. 1987,
<br />
Wadsworth &amp; Brooks Inc..
<br />
<br />But relatively to this list (and my thesis!), I think Boolos &amp; Jeffrey is 
<br />
the best you can find.
<br />
<br />I urge everyone interested in my chapter 5 to read Smullyan penguin
<br />
book &quot;Forever Undecided&quot;. It is one of the best simple introduction
<br />
to &quot;self-referentially correct&quot; reasoners.
<br />
<br />I guess people in this list will also appreciate a lot his &quot;the tao is 
<br />
silent&quot;  and &quot;5000 B. C&quot;. In this last book he uses 
<br />
the &quot;dream&quot; concept to illustrate a relativistic approach to many-reality 
<br />
and immortality. It is better than Platon !
<br />
I discover this recently. More on Smullyan later. (Without Doubt).
<br />
<br />BTW, people, do you know the book by Jozef Gruska on Quantum Computing.
<br />
I find it very good ! Even on the philosophical level !
<br />
(Quantum Computing, McGraw-Hill, 1999).
<br />
<br />In my next post I will answer/comment to Jacques M Mallah, Devin Harris, 
<br />
Hal Finney,  and Wei Dai ...
<br />
<br />Bruno.
