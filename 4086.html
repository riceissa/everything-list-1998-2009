<br />
I was disappointed in the thin, banal issue of SciAm on &quot;Time,&quot; but now 
<br />
there's a new special issue devoted to &quot;The Once and Future Cosmos.&quot;
<br />
<br />It's very good, filled with excellent illustrations of models of 
<br />
cosmology, key experiments, and what we currently know about the 
<br />
structure of the cosmos. Some of the graphics are so good that I am 
<br />
tempted to buy a second copy just so I can clip the graphics and put 
<br />
them up in places where I can ponder them.
<br />
<br />For this list, there's a little bit of discussion of the 
<br />
Rees/Linde/Vilenkin/Barrow/Smolin/Tegmark sort of model where new 
<br />
universes are created with slightly different laws of physics. This is 
<br />
mentioned in a fanciful figure showing such hypothetical pocket 
<br />
universes being formed:
<br />
<br />&quot;Multiple universes are continuously being born, according to some 
<br />
cosmologists. Each universe is shown here as an expanding bubble 
<br />
branching off from its parent universe. The changes in color represent 
<br />
shifts in the laws of physics from one universe to another.&quot; [Figure on 
<br />
page 85]
<br />
<br />By the way, I'm reading Smolin's &quot;Life of the Cosmos,&quot; where he makes a 
<br />
good case for his thesis that the cosmos we are in is one strongly 
<br />
rigged (basic laws, parameters) so as to have a very high production 
<br />
rate of black holes. The idea is similar to the Boostrum sort of 
<br />
Bayesian argument about assuming the world we find ourselves in is 
<br />
&quot;typical.&quot;
<br />
<br />Smolin argues that if a universe creates few or no black holes (for 
<br />
example, it expands and collapses in a Planck time, or has no 
<br />
aggregations of matter worth mentioning, and so on), it leaves no (or 
<br />
just one) children. A universe which creates, say, 10^18 black holes, 
<br />
leaves 10^18 children, some of which may leave even more children, and 
<br />
so on. Thus, there's a fitness landscape with the x and y axes (in a 
<br />
simple diagram) being some set of parameters which affect black hole 
<br />
formation and the vertical or z axis being the number of black holes 
<br />
(and hence universes, a la Linde, others) created.
<br />
<br />While there is no &quot;competition amongst the universes&quot; directly, that we 
<br />
know of, differential reproduction is enough, in general, to produce 
<br />
evolutionary effects.
<br />
<br />After some number of &quot;bounces or black hole formations with slightly 
<br />
different laws of physics&quot; the result will be that nearly all universes 
<br />
in some multiverse are ones where black hole formation is commonplace.
<br />
<br />Smolin argues that we will be able to measure the number of black 
<br />
holes, from small (stellar masses) to larger (recently found, it is 
<br />
believed, 1000-sun mass black holes, to massive galactic core black 
<br />
holes, and, he thinks, reach the conclusion that we are in a universe 
<br />
which is &quot;selected&quot; for maximum ease of black hole formation.
<br />
<br />Maybe.
<br />
<br />By the way, it may also be the case that universes in which 
<br />
intelligence is possible are dominant. My notion, refecting some of the 
<br />
fantastical fiction of Steven Baxter and Greg Egan, is that advanced 
<br />
civilizations will be able to _make_ black holes, possibly in vastly 
<br />
greater abundance than astrophysical sources can.
<br />
<br />(Yeah, of much smaller mass. And presumably of very short duration. The 
<br />
weirdness of spacetime and the insides of black holes are enigmas, but 
<br />
it is speculated by some that even a microscopic black hole could have 
<br />
a &quot;full cosmos&quot; inside. We don't, at least, have any compelling 
<br />
evidence that a galactic core black hole with 10,000 solar masses is 
<br />
going to produce a richer or more complete &quot;cosmos inside&quot; than a 
<br />
microscopic black hole made up of a few grams or less of our matter.)
<br />
<br />Using the same kind of reasoning Smolin uses, a civilization which has 
<br />
special accelerators cranking out 10^30 black holes per second, say, is 
<br />
going to &quot;outbreed&quot; and thus be more represented, than universes where 
<br />
only astrophysical processes are making only a relatively paltry 10^18 
<br />
or 10^25 black holes in the age of that universe.
<br />
<br />(And, even more speculatively, the difference is not great between the 
<br />
number of black holes a single civilization can make and the number a 
<br />
million civilizations can make, so it's more significant that a 
<br />
universe supports AT LEAST SOME advanced intelligence/civilization than 
<br />
that it supports UBIQUITOUS intelligence/civilization. But this 
<br />
reasoning is speculative and needs a lot more thought...maybe. Someone 
<br />
could probably write a nice Baxterian story with this theme.)
<br />
<br />--Tim May, Occupied America
<br />
&quot;They that give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary 
<br />
safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.&quot; -- Benjamin Franklin, 1759.
