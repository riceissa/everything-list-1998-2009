Hi Abram,

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno,

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It seems to me that this runs head-on into the problem of the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definition of time...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here is my argument; I am sure there will be disagreement with it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Supposing that Alice's consciousness is spread out over the movie
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; billboards next to the train track, there is no longer a normal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; temporal relationship between mental moments. There must merely be a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;time-like&quot; relationship, which Alice experiences as time.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Assuming MAT (and MEC). OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But, then,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we are saying that wherever a logical relationship exists that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time-like, there is subjective time for those inside the time-like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relationship.
</em><br />
<br /><br />With MAT,  (in a block view or not). OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, what might constitute a time-like relationship? I see several
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; alternatives, but none seem satisfactory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; At any given moment, all we can be directly aware of is that one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moment. If we remember the past, that is because at the present moment
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our brain has those memories; we don't know if they &quot;really&quot; came from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the past. What would it mean to put moments in a series? It changes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nothing essential about the moment itself; we can remove the past,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because it adds nothing.
</em><br />
<br /><br />With MAT! As Stathis said, once consciousness supervenes on  
<br />
mathematical computations (up to some equivalence class), you can no  
<br />
more remove a past than you can remove the number 13 from elementary  
<br />
arithmetic.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The connection between moments doesn't seem like a physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; connection; the notion is non-explanatory, since if there were such a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical connection we could remove it without altering the individual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moments, therefore not altering our memories, and our subjective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience of time.
</em><br />
<br /><br />All right.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Similarly, can it be a logical relationship? Is it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the structure of a single moment that connects it to the next? How
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would this be? Perhaps we require that there is some function (a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;physics&quot;) from one moment to the next?
</em><br />
<br /><br />It is here that we have to take into account what I think to be a  
<br />
major discovery, if not THE first big(**)  discovery of humanity:  the  
<br />
discovery of the (mathematical) Universal Machine (of Turing, if you  
<br />
want, but with Church thesis it is considerably more general).
<br />
<br />That concept makes it possible to define a &quot;space&quot; of all  
<br />
computations. It is defined unambiguously by the Universal Dovetailer,  
<br />
a program itself. Or equivalently by the set of sigma_1 sentences and  
<br />
their proofs (note that the false sigma_1 sentences inherit infinite  
<br />
proofs).
<br />
<br />Now, consider some trace of that program. It executes all  
<br />
computations. But (see the UDA), from our personal point of view, even  
<br />
between just two distinguishable computational states, there will be a  
<br />
continuum of computations going through those states, if only due to  
<br />
the &quot;dumbness&quot; of the UD, who re-execute each step of any computation  
<br />
by dovetailing them on all &quot;real&quot; oracle. And MEC predict that this  
<br />
&quot;mutiplication&quot; of computations appearing below our substitution level  
<br />
is indirectly observable.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But, this does not exactly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; allow for things like relativity in which there is no single universal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; clock.
</em><br />
<br /><br />(Sure, but we were trying to suppose here only MEC + MAT (not MEC +  
<br />
MAT + relativity). And this points to a little weakness of the second  
<br />
argument I gave.
<br />
But I would find only funny to just conclude that the falsity of  
<br />
relativity would safe &quot;MAT&quot;.  That would be a type of ad hoc move I  
<br />
was hoping to exclude in some dreamy &quot;MGA 5&quot; some posts ago.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course, relativity could be simulated, creating a universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that was run be a universal clock but whose internal facts did not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; depend on which universal clock, exactly, the simulation was run from.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You have to read the UDA here I'm afraid: no &quot;emulable physical  
<br />
reality&quot; can save the problem. With MEC, &quot;physical reality&quot; has to  
<br />
emerge from ALL emulable histories, and this, as viewed by any  
<br />
universal machine, is really an infinite sum. That sum is hardly  
<br />
emulable, a priori, but I agree that quantum mechanics seems to show  
<br />
that such a sum is perhaps emulable (albeit with exponential slow  
<br />
down) by the sharable indeterminate part making our probable sharable  
<br />
neighborhood.
<br />
MEC has everything to justify it, or to refute it (in which case the  
<br />
success of quantum computing would confirm or refute MEC). Up to now,  
<br />
QM confirms MEC (I can say more precise technical things here if  
<br />
interested).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My problem is, I suppose, that any particular definition of &quot;timelike
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relationship&quot; seems too arbitrary.
</em><br />
<br /><br />There is a big difference between first person non sharable time, and  
<br />
sharable local (clock measurable) time. The first you experience, the  
<br />
second you guess, and you guess it only from an implicit bet on your own
<br />
<br /><br />consistency. It makes a big &quot;modal&quot; difference.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; As another example, should any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probabilistic elements be allowed into physics? In this case, we don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have a function any more, but a relation-- perhaps a relation of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; weighted transitions. But how would this relation make any difference
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from inside the universe?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />We are supported by infinity(*) of computations.  We can only bet on  
<br />
our most probable &quot;histories&quot;, above our level of constitution. Those  
<br />
historie which can multiplie themselves from below, and thus in front  
<br />
of pure probabilistic event (noise) can win the measure game (on the  
<br />
computations or the OMs). The question is: can we explain from MEC, as  
<br />
we have too, why, as we can see empirically, the &quot;probabilities&quot; can  
<br />
also be subtracted. To we get here too classical mechanics in the  
<br />
limit? Open problem of course.
<br />
<br />Now the crazy thing is that we can already (thanks to Gödel, Löb,  
<br />
Solovay ...) interview a (Lobian) universal machine on that subject,  
<br />
and she gives a shadow of reason (and guess!) why indeed subtraction  
<br />
occurs. And thanks to the Solovay split between G (the provable part  
<br />
of self-reference, and G*, the true but unprovable part of self- 
<br />
reference, some intensional variant of G and G* split temselves into  
<br />
the sharable physics (indeteminate quanta) and unsharable physics (the  
<br />
qualia? the perceptible field, what you can only be the one to confim:  
<br />
a bit like being the one in Moscow after a self-duplication experiment).
<br />
<br /><br />Bruno
<br />
<br /><br />(*)  Even infinitIES, from the &quot;third person point of view on the  
<br />
first person points of view. Hmmm do you know the first person comp  
<br />
indeterminacy? (step 3 of UDA).
<br />
(**) The second BIG discovery being the quantum computer !  (don't  
<br />
hesitate to use grain salts if it helps to swallows what I say). of  
<br />
course &quot;nature&quot; made those discoveries before us. Well, with MEC we  
<br />
have to consider that elementary arithmetic did those &quot;discoveries&quot;  
<br />
even out of time and space.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I realize MGA is complete, as I thought it was, but I was doubting

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; recently. We don't need to refer to Maudlin, and MGA 4 is not

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; necessary.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Maudlin 1989 is an independent argument of the 1988 Toulouse

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; argument (which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I present here).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Note that Maudlin's very interesting &quot;Olympization technic&quot;  can be  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; used to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; defeat a wrong form of MGA 3, that is, a wrong argument for the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; assertion
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that  the movie cannot be conscious. (the argument that the movie  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; lacks the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; counterfactual). Below are hopefully correct (if not very simple)  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; argument.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ( I use Maudlin sometimes when people gives this non correct form  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of MGA 3,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and this is probably what makes me think Maudlin has to be used, at  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; point).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; MGA 1 shows that Lucky Alice is conscious, and MGA 2 shows that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;luckiness&quot; feature of the MGA 1 experiment was a red herring. We can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; construct, from MEC+COMP, an home made lucky rays generator, and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; use it at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; will. If we accept both digital mechanism, in particular Dennet's  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; principle
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that neurons have no intelligence, still less prescience, and this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; *together with* the supervenience principle; we have to accept that  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Alice
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; conscious dream experience supervenes on the projection of her brain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; activity movie.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Let us show now that Alice consciousness *cannot* supervene on that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; *physical* movie projection.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I propose two (deductive) arguments.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 1)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Mechanism implies the following tautological functionalist  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; principle: if,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; for some range of activity, a system does what it is supposed to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; do, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; this before and after a change is made in its constitution, then  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the change
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; does not change what the system is supposed to do, for that range of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; activity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Example:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; - A car is supposed to broken but only if the driver is faster than  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 90
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; miles/h. Pepe Pepito NEVER drives faster than 80 miles/h. Then the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; car is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; supposed to do what she is supposed to do, with respect of its  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; range of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; activity defined by Pepe Pepito.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; - Claude bought a 1000 thousand processors computer. One day he  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; realized
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that he used only 990 processors, for his type of activity, so he  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; decided to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; get rid of those 10 useless processors. And indeed the machine will  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; satisfy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Claude ever.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; - Alice has (again) a math exam. Theoreticians have correctly  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; predict that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; in this special circumstance, she will never use neurons X, Y and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Z.  Now
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Alice go (again, again) to this exam in the same condition, but  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; neurons X, Y, Z removed. Again, not only will she behaved like if she
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; succeed her exam, but her consciousness, with both MEC *and* MAT  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; still
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; continue.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The idea is that if something is not useful, for an active process  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to go on,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; for some range of activity, then you can remove it, for that range of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; activity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; OK?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Now, consider the projection of the movie of the activity of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Alice's brain,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;the movie graph&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Is it necessary that someone look at that movie? Certainly not. No  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; more than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; it is needed that someone is look at your reconstitution in Moscow  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; for you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to be conscious in Moscow after a teleportation. All right? (with MEC
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; assumed of course).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Is it necessary to have a screen? Well, the range of activity here  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; one dynamical description of one computation. Suppose we make a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; hole in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; screen. What goes in and out of that hole is exactly the same, with  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the hole
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and without the hole. For that unique activity, the hole in the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; screen is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; functionally equivalent to the subgraph which the hole removed.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Clearly we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; can make a hole as large as the screen, so no need for a screen.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But this reasoning goes through if we make the hole in the film  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; itself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Reconsider the image on the screen: with a hole in the film itself,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; you get
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; a &quot;hole&quot; in the movie, but everything which enters and go out of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the hole
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; remains the same, for that (unique) range of activity.  The &quot;hole&quot;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; trivially the same functionality than the subgraph functionality  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; whose
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; special behavior was described by the film. And this is true for any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; subparts, so we can remove the entire film itself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Does Alice's dream supervene (in real time and space) on the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; projection of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the empty movie?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Remark.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 1° Of course, this argument can be sum up by saying that the movie  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; lacks
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; causality between its parts so that it cannot really be said that it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; computes any thing, at least physically. The movie is just an  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ordered record
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of computational states. This is neither a physical computation,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; nor an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (immaterial) computation where the steps follows relatively to some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; universal machine. It is just a description of a computation, already
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; existing in the Universal Deployment.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 2° Note this: If we take into consideration the relative destiny of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Alice,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and supposing one day her brain broke down completely, she has more  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; chance
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to survive through &quot;holes in the screen&quot; than to the &quot;holes in the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; film&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The film contains the relevant information to reconstitute Alice  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; from her
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; brain description, contained on this high resolution film. Keeping  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; comp, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; abandoning the physical supervenience thesis, means that we do no  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; associate consciousness, neither on the movie, NOR on the brain  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; special
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; activity in a computation, but to the computation itself directly.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; A brain,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and even a film,  will &quot;only&quot; be a way to make bigger the probability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; for a consciousness to manifest itself relatively to a &quot;probable&quot;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; universal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; computational history.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Strictly speaking, running the movie dimimish Alice chance to have  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; her
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; conscious experience (life) continue, at least relatively to you,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; because of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the many scratches the projector makes on the pellicle, which remove
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; relevant information for a safe reconstitution later (again  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; relatively to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; you).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 2)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I give now what is perhaps a simpler argument
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; A projection of a movie is a relative phenomenon. On the planet  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 247a, nearby
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; in the galaxy, they don't have screen. The film pellicle is as big  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; screen, and they make the film passing behind a stroboscope at the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; right
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; frequency in front of the public. But on planet 247b, movies are  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; only for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; travellers! They dress their film, as big as those on planet 247a,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; in their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; countries all along their train rails with a lamp besides each  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; frames, which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is nice because from the train, through its speed, you get the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; usual 24
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; frames per second. But we already accepted that such movie does not  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; need to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; be observed, the train can be empty of people. Well the train does  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; not play
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; any role, and what remains is the static film with a lamp behind  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; each frame.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Are the lamps really necessaries? Of course not, all right? So now  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; we are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; obliged to accept that the consciousness of Alice during the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; projection of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the movie supervenes of something completely inert in time and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; space. This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; contradicts the *physical*  supervenience thesis.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Exercises.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; a) Someone could propose an alternate argument that a movie does  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; not compute
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (and so consciousness does supervene on it) by alluding to the lack  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; causality in the movie:  the movie does not handle the counterfactual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; existing implicitly in computations (physical or not).  Use Maudlin's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Olympization technic to refute that argument.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; b) Make fun by using a non dreaming Alice. Shows that the movie  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (film or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; screen) graph border is needed to get the accidental zombies (the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; puppet).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; And then the &quot;important&quot; exercise (the original goal).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; c) Eliminate the hypothesis &quot;there is a concrete deployment&quot; in the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; seventh
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; step of the UDA. Use UDA(1...7) to define properly the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; computationalist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; supervenience thesis. Hint: reread the remarks above.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Have a good day.
