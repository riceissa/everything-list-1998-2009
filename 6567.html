I've recently been reading the archive of this group with great interest 
<br />
and noted a lot of interesting ideas. I'd like to kick off my contribution 
<br />
to the group with a response to a comment made in numerous posts that a 
<br />
single observer-moment can have multiple pasts, including macroscopically 
<br />
distinct pasts, e.g. in one memorable example, pasts which differ only 
<br />
according to whether a single speck of dust was or was not on a 
<br />
confederate soldier's boot in 1863.
<br />
<br />Does anybody believe that this is consistent with the many-worlds 
<br />
interpretation of QM? If so, please think again! Even such an apparently 
<br />
minor change is sufficient to split the universal wave function into two 
<br />
distinct branches (i.e. branches peaking in vastly-separated regions of 
<br />
configuration space), which can recombine with probability effectively 
<br />
zero. The reason for this is &quot;decoherence&quot; in the technical sense used by 
<br />
Zurek and others.
<br />
<br />To counter one obvious rejoinder, I'm not denying that micro-histories can 
<br />
recombine, as in the two-slit experiment. Rather, decoherence ensures that 
<br />
states with macroscopic (or even mesoscopic) entropy spread their 
<br />
information so effectively that it is practically impossible to erase it 
<br />
(&quot;practically&quot; in the sense that even the entire resources of the universe 
<br />
would be insufficient, as emphasised by Omnes).
<br />
<br />Of course, many of you (maybe all) may be defining pasts from an 
<br />
information-theoretic point of view, i.e. by identifying all 
<br />
observer-moments in the multiverse which are equivalent as perceived by 
<br />
the observer; in which case the above point is quite irrelevant. (But you 
<br />
still have to distinguish the different branches to find the total measure 
<br />
for each OM).
