</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Bruno,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'll rephrase the problem - let me know if I get it wrong. It is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proposed that all the functions f with certain attributes &quot;A&quot; be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; enumerated in a list: f1, f2, f3 etc. It looks like &quot;A&quot; in the example 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; under consideration means &quot;all the computable functions&quot;, but in fact 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is a further implicit restriction: the list can only contain all 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the computable functions which will fit into the labelling scheme 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; chosen for the list.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />If I remember correctly I did make this explicit (but then it is easy 
<br />
to miss a post or a paragraph in a post or just a line:). I have 
<br />
defined a *computable* function (from N to N) as a function f such that 
<br />
there is a language (labeling sheme as you say) L in which it can be 
<br />
explained finitely and without ambiguity how for each n to compute 
<br />
f(n).
<br />
<br />Now, I have defined the notion of Universal Language UL as a language 
<br />
in which *all* computable function can be defined. (I also define a 
<br />
Universal Machine as a machine capable to &quot;understand&quot; the Universal 
<br />
Language, and thus capable of computing *all* computable function from 
<br />
N to N.
<br />
<br />And then Church Thesis is the statement that there is a Universal 
<br />
Language, in particular, that programming languages like FORTRAN, LISP, 
<br />
Java, c++, etc. are universal languages.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, when we say that g(k) is the kth function in the list +1, we are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; defining an apparently computable function that does not have a place 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on the list, since if g were the ith function on the list we would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have fi(i)=fi(i)+1.
</em><br />
<br /><br />At this stage: you really should say what the fi are meant for. To be 
<br />
sure I will treat one+three cases under the form of 1+3  lists:
<br />
<br />0) r1 r2 r3 r4 r5 r6 r7 r8 ...
<br />
This is an arbitrary list of functions from N to N  (not necessarily 
<br />
computable one);
<br />
<br />1) h0 h1 h2 h3 h4 h5 h6 ...
<br />
This is a list of total computable functions from N to N that we can 
<br />
generate mechanically (I mean we can generate their codes). It means 
<br />
that we can generate the codes of each hi, written in some language, 
<br />
and that, for some reason, we are sure that each hi is total 
<br />
computable. Examples: Caylor last funny enumeration; all the 
<br />
(transfinite collection of) sequences of growing functions we have 
<br />
defined in this thread (since &quot;Smullyan Smullyan ...&quot;);
<br />
<br />2) f0 f1 f2 f3 f4 f5 f6 f7 ...
<br />
This is a list of *all* total computable functions;
<br />
<br />3) F0 F1 F2 F3 F4 F5 F6 F7 F8 ...
<br />
This is the list of all programmable things in some &quot;universal 
<br />
language&quot; like fortran.  CT asserts fortran is universal so that the 
<br />
total computable function fi will be dispersed *among* those Fi things, 
<br />
so that a universal machine can really compute all the fi, among other 
<br />
things.
<br />
<br /><br />Now the same diagonalization argument proves 4 different propositions 
<br />
according to which list we are talking about. Which one?
<br />
<br />Before answering, I let people muse a little about what are those 4 
<br />
different consequences,  given that the only way to really grasp those 
<br />
propositions consists in rediscovering them by oneself.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, this is only a contradiction if we say that the list contains 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all the computable functions; it is not a contradiction if we say that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the list contains all the computable functions which fit into the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; labelling scheme chosen for the list, as I think we must.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />(perhaps to read or reread after the musing suggested above).
<br />
<br />It depends what sorts of &quot;labeling scheme&quot; you are interested in. The 
<br />
key is that:
<br />
<br />1) either you want only total functions (so that you can be sure your 
<br />
machine will not crash): in that case the diagonal g is total 
<br />
computable but cannot belong to your list. You would need another 
<br />
labeling scheme for a language extending your previous labeling 
<br />
containing that g. Like with the sequence of growing computable 
<br />
functions, this label-extension can be iterated into the transfinite. 
<br />
But at each of those transfinite stage your machine is NOT universal, 
<br />
but it grows toward it keeping control. (it is a sort of pre-image of 
<br />
the first person exploring the first person *plenitude* (Levy's 
<br />
expression)).
<br />
<br />2) or you want to capture *all* total functions at once through one 
<br />
*universal* labeling scheme. Church Thesis is the statement that this 
<br />
wish can be fulfilled despite diagonalization (crazily enough!). Indeed 
<br />
CT asserts FORTRAN is such a universal language. And the programs can 
<br />
be effectively (fortran-mechanically, Turing-mechanically, recursively, 
<br />
... with CT all those terms are equivalent) enumerated, so that you get 
<br />
the Fi. The price to pay for escaping the contradiction through the use 
<br />
of the diagonalization: some Fi are undefined and even unpredictably 
<br />
so. That is, the Fi enumerates a set much vaster than the fi, and the 
<br />
fi forms a NON recursively enumerable subset of a recursively 
<br />
enumerable set (the Fi), a little like the &quot;Joconde&quot; is a very complex 
<br />
subset of a simple rectangle!
<br />
<br />I know that George Levy does not like this too much: but the first 
<br />
person plenitude, [although so big and so unnameable that you cannot 
<br />
generate it in one stroke-program, but that you can yet explore into 
<br />
the constructive transfinite ...]  is contained in the (&quot;simple&quot;) 
<br />
effectively enumerable set of partial recursive functions. But the 
<br />
border of the set of (codes of) the total function is fuzzy, it looks 
<br />
like the border of the Mandelbrot set in some sense. Chaitin or Webb 
<br />
would not contradicts me when asserting that life and mind (could) 
<br />
emerge internally on that border, ... and then eventually physics (my 
<br />
work).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is perhaps just the point you are making: it is not that g is not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computable, rather that the attempt to enumerate the computable 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; functions is problematic.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Yes. The attempt to enumerate effectively all AND ONLY ALL computable 
<br />
functions from N to N is problematic. With CT, &quot;effectively&quot; can be 
<br />
translated into &quot;fortran-effectively&quot;, and then you can translate 
<br />
&quot;problematic&quot; by &quot;impossible&quot;. And the g defined from the fi is not 
<br />
computable, because the bijection i ----&gt; fi is not computable. g, 
<br />
defined on all total fi,  is not computable because the fi are not 
<br />
effectively enumerable.
<br />
<br />And with CT: a fortran program *can* enumerate ALL computable functions 
<br />
from N to N. But then NOT in any effective way. Any algorithm 
<br />
generating all computable functions will generate them by generating  a 
<br />
superset containing the possibly and unpredictably undefined partial 
<br />
functions as a &quot;poisonous&quot; gift (the uncontrollable third person 
<br />
&quot;exterior&quot; perspective including the ten thousand crashing (infinite) 
<br />
path). G, defined on all Fi is programmable, but necessarily undefined 
<br />
on their own code: if G = Fk, Fk(k) makes the universal machine 
<br />
crashing.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  But is it as surprising to discover this (or what I think of as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; related results, like Russell's Paradox and Godel's Theorem) as it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would be to discover, say, a discrepancy or contradiction in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; addition and subtraction of integers?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />We are just proving theorem by the method of reduction to 
<br />
contradiction. If we find a real contradiction between addition and 
<br />
multiplication statements it would be the end of classical mathematics 
<br />
and physics and platonism, etc. Weak theory like Peano Arithmetic would 
<br />
be inconsistent. I would quit the math job, and frankly I think the 
<br />
multiverse itself would collapse. But there is no reason to doubt the 
<br />
consistency of arithmetic.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I'll reply to the second part of your post later.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Thanks. Take your time,
<br />
<br />Bruno
