Hal:
<br />
<br />I usually do not argue your posts (pro or con) because I feel whatever you
<br />
write is in a 'different' discipline for me (euphemism: for 'above my
<br />
head').
<br />
Now I have a fundamental remark:
<br />
<br />Whatever you QM etc. abiding minds conclude (including the published
<br />
science) is within our PRESENT *knowledge-base* (mindset, actual cognitive
<br />
inventory, naming is open). I don't hold myself above such, just acknowledge
<br />
that human *k-b* was flimsier in the past and will be less(?) flimsy in the
<br />
future (but still flimsy), so our likes/dislikes are no proof for the
<br />
actualities of nature (like: simpler, less axioms, etc.). If there is a
<br />
'measure' it is our (present) human figment.
<br />
<br />MWI: Tegmark is right: (knowledgeable) people hate it at least. I don't, as
<br />
a matter of fact I apply it in my 'narrative' with a vengeance: in the
<br />
course of origination I do not specify formational qualia (and the negative
<br />
is pointing rather to 'ALL may be very very different') so the MW membership
<br />
is as diverse as it can - beyond our widest imagination (which is still
<br />
based on this little poor universe we have some experience about.)
<br />
So those equations derived from mathematical consideration within this one
<br />
have not too much credit for (potentially) fundamentally different systems.
<br />
This may be one reason why we know nithing about &quot;them&quot;. And this ignorance
<br />
is the foundation of the 'hate'. People dislike to 'not know'.
<br />
I include the ignorance of 'most of it' and consider our information very
<br />
very partial so I can accept the 'rest of it' as unknown/unknowable.
<br />
<br />Why I accept the possible 'existence' of the multiverse? because I see no
<br />
reason not to. Our uniqueness and sole existence should be justified in the
<br />
multitude of everything and so far we could not come up with a good reason
<br />
for our exclusivity. I know: nescio non est argumentum against, but it is no
<br />
argument pro either. (This opinion is just as flimsy as the opposite
<br />
position.)
<br />
<br />String theory? I don't know the first thing about it (Pun: 1st: what is
<br />
'string' - beyond the math-fiction?). A consequence drawn upon it is at
<br />
least subject to the credibility of the base. (Understandability? that would
<br />
be too human).
<br />
I wrote a remark on the new MIT invention that 'spacetime is a liquid'  in
<br />
which I humbly asked about the string-loop vibration as QM-al 'waves' and
<br />
the straight string endings as the electrically charged subatomix, an
<br />
explanation using the non-explained. (I know: this may be the route of
<br />
advancement and I use it myself, - you have to 'dare' to innovate.)
<br />
<br />The never-never land of substituting math for common sense is disturbing for
<br />
simpleminded non-mathematicians, no matter how advanced they want to think.
<br />
Multiverse fits, with enough (non-math) imagination, string does not.
<br />
This is my way to look at it, I am not ready to defend it. Especially not on
<br />
the turf of the opponent.
<br />
<br />Regards
<br />
<br />John Mikes

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; New Scientist has an article on parallel universes:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; David Deutsch at the University of Oxford and colleagues have shown
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that key equations of quantum mechanics arise from the mathematics of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; parallel universes. &quot;This work will go down as one of the most important
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; developments in the history of science,&quot; says Andy Albrecht, a physicist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; at the University of California at Davis. In one parallel universe,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; at least, it will - whether it does in our one remains to be seen.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is behind a paywall at

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but I found a copy on Google Groups:

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It has a great quote from Tegmark: &quot;The critique of many worlds is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shifting from 'it makes no sense and I hate it' to simply 'I hate it'.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The thrust of the article is about recent work to fix the two perceived
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problems in the MWI: non-uniqueness of basis (the universe splits in all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different ways) and recovering the Born rule. The basis problem is now
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; considered (by supporters) to be resolved via improved understanding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of decoherence. This work (which was not particularly focused on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MWI) generally seems to lead to a unique basis for measurement-like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interactions, hence there is no ambiguity in terms of which way the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe splits.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As for the Born rule, the article points to the effort begun by Deutsch in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1999 to base things on decision theory. The idea is that we fundamentally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; care about probability insofar as it influences the decisions and choices
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we make, so if we can recover a sensible decision theory in the MWI, we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have basically explained probability. I've seen a number of critiques of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Deutsch's paper but according to this article, subsequent work by David
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Wallace and Simon Saunders has extended it to the point where things
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are pretty solid.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hence the two traditional objections to the MWI are now at least arguably
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dealt with, and given its advantage in terms of formal simplicity (fewer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; axioms), supporters argue that it should be considered the leading
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; model for QM. This is where we get claims about it being among the most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; important discoveries in the history of mankind, etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's interesting to see the resistance of the physics community to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multiverse concepts. It all comes back to the tradition of experimental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; verification I suppose, which is still pretty much impossible. Really
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it is more a question of philosophy than of physics as we currently
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand these disciplines.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We see the same thing happening all over again in string theory. I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't know if you guys are following this at all. String theory is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; going through a crisis as it has turned out in the past few years that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it does not predict a single universe, rather a multiverse where there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is a &quot;landscape&quot; of possible sets of parameters, each of which would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correspond to a universe. The big problem is that there is no natural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or accepted measure (unlike with QM where everyone knew all along that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the measure had to be the Born rule and it was just a matter of how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; many hoops you had to jump through to pull it out of your model).  As a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; result it looks like it might be impossible to get even probabilistic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; predictions out of the string theory landscape.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; AFAIK no one within the community has followed our path and looked
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at algorithmic complexity as a source of measure (i.e. the Universal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Distribution, which says that the simplest theories have higher measure).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Granted, even if that direction were pursued it would probably be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computationally intractable so they still would not be able to pull much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; out in the way of predictions. Neverthless physicists are skilled at the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; use of approximation and assumptions to get plausible predictions out of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even rather opaque mathematics so it's possible they might get somewhere.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But at this point it looks like the resistance is too strong. Rather
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than string theory making the multiverse respectable as we might hope,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it seems likely that the multiverse will kill string theory.
