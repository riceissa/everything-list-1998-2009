Hi Russell,
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [...]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I have a question in light of this for the group. Come September (2nd
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;anniversary of Why Occams Razor), if I've had no joy with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;J. Theoretics, I would like to try another journal. All I ask is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;my paper be properly peer reveiwed. Does anyone have any suggestions?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;What about Teorie e Modelli?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Well, I have published (and it appeared very recently btw) my &quot;Computation,
<br />
Consciousness and the Quantum&quot; in Teorie e Modelli, after some Italians
<br />
hears my talk at Dubrovnik. Also because they were doing a special issue
<br />
of Teorie e Modelli on Quantum and Consciousness. But I am not sure
<br />
about the general thema of the journal.
<br />
If you agree I can ask Vincenzo Fano and give you (or him) his mail
<br />
address (or the address of your paper).
<br />
<br />Have you try the &quot;Journal of Philosophy&quot;, or ... (The journals which
<br />
come to my mind turn around philosophical logics, I will think
<br />
about it ...).
<br />
<br />Perhaps you should  try to transform your paper in the form 
<br />
of a response to a similar paper you could find in the literature.
<br />
(This means spending lot of times in libraries ..., but I found
<br />
Maudlin's paper in this way).
<br />
<br />The problem with &quot;our domain&quot; is that it is very inter or trans
<br />
disciplinary. And a lot of &quot;specialists&quot; doesn't like that too much.
<br />
<br />Our epoch is not so easy for those who attempts clarity, rigor, and
<br />
open-mindeness, in fundamental matters. There is still a lot of energy
<br />
wasted by both scientist and philosophers for ignoring each other.
<br />
<br />About publication, I must perhaps confess that, a long time ago,
<br />
between publish or perish, I have chosen perish!... Until now 
<br />
I have never submit a paper to a journal. I publish only when 
<br />
people, after hearing oral talk of mine, ask me to send a paper.
<br />
<br />Talking about publishing, I guess it is about time I try myself
<br />
to publish in some &quot;serious&quot; International Journal. 
<br />
The paper by Rawling and Selesnick in the J. of the ACM 2000
<br />
gives me perhaps the opportunity to send a technical paper on
<br />
my &quot;arithmetical quantization&quot;. I will try to write it this
<br />
summer holliday(°).
<br />
<br />... So I hope this one will not be driven into company of my ten 
<br />
thousand unfinished papers ... :-)
<br />
<br />I certainly wish better fortune for your Occam paper!
<br />
<br />Bruno 
<br />
<br /><br />(°) My idea was to write such thesis-paper after the
<br />
presentation of my thesis, but I got a prize which consists
<br />
in the promise of publishing the thesis. But being to technical
<br />
I wrote a third &quot;book&quot; in french! The book is written but I am
<br />
not glad with it. That's the problem: I am my worst
<br />
referee.
