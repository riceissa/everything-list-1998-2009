<em class="quotelev1">&gt; George and List:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a very naive question (even more than my other posts) since I miss lots

of
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; posts that have been exuded on this list (since a decade or so of my
</em><br />
incompletely reading it):
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Has it been ever formulated (and accepted on this list!) what we mean by
</em><br />
the verb &quot;to observe&quot;? What does an 'observer' do in its (not his!!!)
<br />
'observer minute'? WHAT (and not 'who') is an observer?
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />Many hours spent on this one.
<br />
<br />My definition sounds odd but only because I have to literally 'build'
<br />
observation that I have had to sort it out. As an engineer I know that
<br />
building an X is a sure route to an intimate understanding of X....so...My
<br />
design goal: construction of an artificial scientist (artificial general
<br />
intelligence - AGI). Thus logically I must build an observer. So.. the
<br />
design aim of the project has observation as follows...(off the top of my
<br />
head!):
<br />
<br />Observation involves (necessitates) the AGI having experiences, some of
<br />
which are an experiential representation of the external world. The
<br />
process of generation of the experiential field(s) involves the insertion
<br />
of the AGI in the chain of causality from that which is observed 'out
<br />
there' through the external world to the sensing surface, impact (causal
<br />
interaction) measured by sensing, transport (causality again) of the
<br />
measurement through the AGI to the brain where the measurement
<br />
participates in the causality that is the creation of the experiential
<br />
field. It is by virtue of the existence/reality of the _entire_ causal
<br />
chain that the experiential field can be created and be called observation
<br />
of the external world. (Clearly experiential fields can also be created as
<br />
hallucinations/dreams, without the full causality chain - but that is not
<br />
the 'observation' we are talking about). In making use of the complete
<br />
causal chain the oberver has access (inherits some of the properties of)
<br />
to that which is observed. This is not 'creating reality' in the
<br />
Berkeleyian sense. This is participation in it. This is construction of a
<br />
representation of it from within the reality.
<br />
<br />This process I have described is observation and all of observation -
<br />
nothin else counts as observation. No separable part of what I have
<br />
described is observation including any subset of the entire causal chain
<br />
(just for you QM wave collapse buffs). Take anything out of the above and
<br />
observation is no longer happening. Connection of the observer with that
<br />
external reality is gone along with all access to a-posteriori knowledge
<br />
of it.... in the sense that with the faculty for observation as literally
<br />
the only possessed a-priori 'knowledge', all other knowledge (a-posteriori
<br />
&nbsp;aboutness) in respect of external reality flows.
<br />
<br />The best observers of all time IMHO?
<br />
<br />1) James Joyce.
<br />
2) Douglas Adams.
<br />
3) Heraclitus
<br />
<br />Note they are not scientists.... they were much more fun! Maybe my AGI
<br />
artificial scientist will run aweay and become a writer. I can be weird in
<br />
so many different areas! It's a gift! polyweirdness :-)
