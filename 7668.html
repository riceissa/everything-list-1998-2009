AP: The question of whether two chunks of matter are the same surely has
<br />
little to do with specifications.
<br />
<br />BH: You just did it again. Would you still say &quot;surely&quot; if in your statement
<br />
you replace &quot;chunks of matter&quot; with &quot;souls&quot; or &quot;spirits&quot; or &quot;logically
<br />
possible entities&quot;?
<br />
<br />AP: For souls and spirits, yes. Possible entities, however, are arguably not
<br />
entities, because an entity, by definition, exists.
<br />
<br />A logically possible entity, by definition, exists in at least one possible
<br />
world. I suspect by &quot;exists&quot; above you mean something like &quot;actually exists&quot;
<br />
or &quot;exists in this world&quot;, and that the souls and spirits you have in mind
<br />
are the ones that you think actually exist in this world. I'm talking more
<br />
broadly about possible souls in their possible worlds. How do you decide
<br />
whether two logically possible souls are the same if neither exists in this
<br />
world? Presumably you do it by comparing what we (hypothetically) know about
<br />
them -- i.e. their specifications or descriptions.
<br />
<br />BH: If two specifications contradict each other, they surely specify
<br />
different worlds, right?
<br />
<br />AP: Well, on the account you have, a specification is a bitstring.
<br />
<br />I haven't personally committed to a particular specification scheme, and I
<br />
hesitate to do so before you do. :-)  I suspect that any complaint you have
<br />
about the best available specification approach is a problem that is shared
<br />
by whatever technique you yourself use to distinguish e.g. similar possible
<br />
souls.  (You might claim that you don't need one because souls and chunks of
<br />
matter etc. are such familiar things that we &quot;surely&quot; needn't resort to
<br />
specifications to decide their identity. If so, I would again protest this
<br />
invocation of our intuitions about our world to seemingly wave away
<br />
questions about myriad other worlds.)
<br />
<br />AP: Intuitively, an encoding method is a map between bitstrings and worlds.
<br />
But that would be circular here.
<br />
<br />Let me try to come up with an example encoding method that could break
<br />
whatever circularity you're worried about.  What I need is a collection of
<br />
possible world that are both 1) simple enough that they can be mechanically
<br />
mapped to bitstrings, and 2) not so simple that they can be canonically
<br />
enumerated or have two specifications easily inspected to see if they
<br />
specify what we would consider the same universe. How about reversible
<br />
cellular automata with infinitely many past and future non-trivial states?
<br />
A world could be encoded into a bitstring by encoding its transition rules
<br />
and then encoding any one of its states. Since there is no distinguished
<br />
state in such a world's infinite series of states, it's not necessarily
<br />
tractable to test two worlds for the obvious form of identity involving
<br />
shared transition rules and a shared state somewhere in their histories.
<br />
<br />You asked earlier &quot;What IS a world?&quot;  The problem with this question is that
<br />
it can be too restrictive to try to define what worlds are by enumerating
<br />
what they can be made of -- &quot;chunks of matter&quot;, souls, substances, etc. A
<br />
more general approach is to come from the other direction, and say that a
<br />
world is any causal closure that doesn't involve a logical contradiction.
<br />
When you approach worlds this way, it's more natural to think of
<br />
descriptions and specifications as primary, rather than to think of the
<br />
traditional ontological building blocks -- substances, &quot;chunks of matter&quot;,
<br />
etc. -- as primary.
<br />
<br />The other problem with this question is that it can be misleading to think
<br />
that the inhabitants of a world have a privileged or authoritative
<br />
perspective about what counts as the ontological primitives of that (or any)
<br />
world.  We might think that Spirit or substances or quantum fields or 11-D
<br />
strings are the fundamental building blocks of our world, but if our world
<br />
turns out to be a simulation, then it's easy to see how an
<br />
information-theoretic perspective could suddenly be recognized to be a
<br />
better one. The way I think of it is that each possible world is just a
<br />
possible simulation, and each has the same content -- i.e. inhabiting a
<br />
world feels the same -- whether or not the simulation is ever &quot;run&quot; on some
<br />
&quot;actual&quot; simulator. (For any claim that an actual simulator is in operation,
<br />
then the simulator's world can itself be considered a merely-possible
<br />
simulation. I'm assuming for the moment that &quot;turtles all the way down&quot; is
<br />
not a sensible claim.)
<br />
<br />Now let me get back to the problem of induction.  My untutored intuition is
<br />
still that apparently regular worlds should predominate over apparently
<br />
irregular worlds, even if apparently irregular worlds predominate over
<br />
worlds that in fact contain neither apparent nor non-apparent
<br />
irregularities. I'm guessing I would have this intuition even if weren't
<br />
attracted to an information-theoretic approach to defining or specifying
<br />
worlds. Are these issues independent, or is this predominance calculus
<br />
sensitive to how one approaches the multiverse?

<br />
<br />[Brian Holtz] If two spacetime-disconnected regions are causally
<br />
disconnected (such that none of the events in each has any possibility of
<br />
influence on any events in the other), then it seems pure artifice to say
<br />
the regions are in the same world. You could as easily say that all possible
<br />
events in all possible worlds are in fact in the same world.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
[scerir] Is that true? Isn't Reichenbach's common cause a possibility?
<br />
Something like: future light cones of a and b do overlap within the future
<br />
light cone of c, and c can act on this overlap ...
<br />
<br />Sorry, I wasn't very clear. I'm talking about causal closure in the broadest
<br />
metaphysical sense, in which causal relatedness is transitive and can relate
<br />
events that in fact had no nomological ability to influence each other.
