<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If [a] species believed that 2+2=5, or that their kidneys were the organs of respiration,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they would be wrong. But if they believe that they wake up a different person every day,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and live their lives based on this belief, they would *not* be wrong; they could hold
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this belief quite consistently even if they knew all there was to know about their biology.
</em><br />
<br />I claim that there is an important sense in which they *would* be wrong,
<br />
that is, nature endowed us with a strong prejudice that we are the same
<br />
creature from moment to moment for a reason. A creature exhibits a great
<br />
deal of fear if a threat arises not to &quot;it&quot; itself in the sense of the
<br />
creature this moment, but &quot;it&quot; in the extended sense. It acts consistently
<br />
to ensure that itself of a few moments hence does not come to harm, and we,
<br />
of course, understand quite well why nature did this.
<br />
<br />Creatures who do not identify with themselves a few moments hence are
<br />
&quot;punished&quot;. They undergo pain or discomfort that is linked by their
<br />
intelligence to what the other creature (i.e. its self of a few moments
<br />
ago) actually did.  Again, in this way they become fearful of future
<br />
pain, and, on the other hand, eager to ravish future gain.
<br />
<br /><br />Suppose on the other hand that this is incorrect. Suppose that identity
<br />
does not extend in time past one Planck constant (whatever that is).
<br />
Then no object or person &quot;survives&quot;. But then the term &quot;survival&quot; is
<br />
also lost.
<br />
<br />(Words don't have absolute meanings; only meanings that convey relative
<br />
utility and which correspond to actual structure in the world. An object
<br />
and even a person *does* persist in time as is revealed by a close
<br />
examination of structure. It simply isn't very different from moment
<br />
to moment, and if it is, then the entity has not survived. For example,
<br />
a rock that is crushed into dust no longer exists as a rock.)
<br />
<br />Each person reading this would act in the following way if he suddenly
<br />
heard a loud animal roar behind him. If he then looked around a saw a
<br />
large tiger, all thoughts about the futility of survival past one
<br />
Planck constant would vanish. If the person takes a flying leap, and
<br />
just manages to get on the other side of a door, and is able to slam
<br />
it shut in the tiger's face, the person will rightfully be relieved.
<br />
Why shouldn't we say that the person has survived, at least for the
<br />
nonce until the tiger figures out that it may be able to burst through
<br />
the closed door?
<br />
