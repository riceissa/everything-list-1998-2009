<br />Just to be clear I'm not at all attempting to &quot;dis&quot; the possibilities of 
<br />
&quot;hard&quot; artificial intelligence.
<br />
I studied it to postgrad-level in the past, and would hope to be able to 
<br />
work in that field for real some
<br />
day.
<br />
<br />The &quot;Emergence of Life&quot; paper is talking specifically about those sorts 
<br />
of life that can emerge
<br />
WITHOUT THE ASSISTANCE OF AN ALREADY SMARTER, MORE-ORGANIZED AGENT.
<br />
That's why that kind of life (&quot;natural&quot; life) is a truly emergent or 
<br />
(emergent from less-order) system.
<br />
<br />One way of looking at A.I. is that it may become in some attributes 
<br />
life-like (I prefer just to say
<br />
it will become a true cognitive agent i.e. a true thinker (active 
<br />
modeler) without NECESSARILY
<br />
also independently being a fully self-sufficient life-form. If WE can be 
<br />
considered part of the environment
<br />
of AIs, then they are a life-form that uses US to reproduce (at least 
<br />
initially).
<br />
<br />It's traditional to think of the environment of a lifeform as less 
<br />
ordered than the lifeform itself, so this
<br />
AI case, where the environment includes extremely ordered self-emergent 
<br />
SAS's (ourselves)
<br />
is a little bit strange situation and it's hard to categorize.
<br />
<br />With AI, it's probably best just to say that there is another emergent 
<br />
system emerging, which is
<br />
(at this stage) a combination of humans (the human-species pattern and 
<br />
its behaviours) and  the software
<br />
(informational) and computing hardware technological/cultural artifacts 
<br />
we produce, acting together
<br />
to form the new emergent system.
<br />
<br />People do talk about AI computers/robots and nano-tech, in combination 
<br />
perhaps, becoming self-sufficient
<br />
(self-replicating and self-advancing/adapting independent of their human 
<br />
creators.)
<br />
<br />I have no trouble believing that this is in-principle possible. I just 
<br />
want to point out that
<br />
the properties for true long-term sustainability of pattern-order are 
<br />
HARD  (difficult, onerous)
<br />
requirements, not easy ones. Natural life (in the admittedly single case 
<br />
we know) is highly constrained
<br />
because of the constraints on its long-term survival and incremental 
<br />
improvement in a less-ordered
<br />
environment.
<br />
<br />It seems easier (but is it much easier really?) to get AIs to 
<br />
self-improve/self-sustain purely as virtual (informational) patterns
<br />
or entities (i.e. as software and data ie. pure-informational 
<br />
entities/thinkers/knowledge-bases) rather than as informational/physical
<br />
hybrids as we are. I suppose some of the people on the everything-list, 
<br />
myself included, may see the
<br />
distinction between informational and physical as more just a matter of 
<br />
degree than of substance,
<br />
so this is a puzzling area. Certainly both human-built computers and 
<br />
physical machines (robots eg mars rovers,
<br />
nanobots etc) have a long way to go, not only in their basic FUNCTIONAL 
<br />
development, but
<br />
perhaps more significantly and certainly more difficultly in their 
<br />
ROBUSTNESS (lack of brittleness)
<br />
AND EVOLVABILITY (&amp; META-EVOLVABILITY?) criteria, and their raw-material 
<br />
choice
<br />
(natural life uses primarily the most commonly occurring-in-the-universe 
<br />
chemically-bondable elements
<br />
(hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, nitrogen etc) for good reason), before they 
<br />
could hope to be very self-sustainable.
<br />
<br />It is interesting to speculate that the mechanisms available to a future 
<br />
AI robot/nanotech-conglomerate/web-dweller
<br />
for self-adaptation might be far more flexible and wide-ranging than 
<br />
those available to early natural life on Earth,
<br />
because we are building AI's partly in our image, and
<br />
we, after all, by becoming general thinker/planners (information 
<br />
maestros if you will) have managed
<br />
to increase enormously the range of ways we can adapt the environment to 
<br />
our needs. (Caveat: As an eco-aware
<br />
person however I can tell you the jury's out on whether we're doing this 
<br />
to system-survival-levels of sophistication,
<br />
and the jury's leaning toward &quot;guilty&quot; of eco-cide - or more precisely 
<br />
guilty of severe eco-impoverishment and disordering).
<br />
<br /><br /><br />BTW I'm most excited today in the AI field by the possibilities that the 
<br />
combination of the WWWeb's
<br />
information as accessed via google (and similar) and AI 
<br />
insights/technologies will have. The web is
<br />
not a big distributed brain yet, but it could get there.
<br />
