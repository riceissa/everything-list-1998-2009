I think many questions go begging here.
<br />
<br />Your elementary unit SU will have more of a logical existence 
<br />
than a 'physical' existence. There is no reason to suppose that 
<br />
Pythagoras's theory will apply because Pythagoras's theory 
<br />
entails ideas of straight lines, a right angle, and so forth but 
<br />
your elementary units are too simple to know about that stuff 
<br />
:-) How do they even know where their ends are? Ie what makes 
<br />
the difference between the 'length' of the elementary unit and 
<br />
the 'end' where it joins another.
<br />
<br />In fact though, I think it is more exciting to contemplate the 
<br />
possibility that space-time is a process. Certainly this is what 
<br />
is being asserted by the proponents of &quot;Process Physics&quot;. I 
<br />
cannot pretend to understand the mathematical formalisation they 
<br />
put forward. I like the idea very much though so I play around 
<br />
with my mental picture version and see where it takes me.
<br />
<br />The story so far looks like this:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* existence [all that which is] consists of nodes and connections
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* the nodes can be called a 'quorum' when talking about one, 
<br />
and  'quora' for plural
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* the connections can be called a 'janus' when talking about 
<br />
one, and 'jani' for plural
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* the janus is named after the Roman god Janus, the god of 
<br />
doors and name sake of the month of January, the common feature 
<br />
being that Janus had two faces one for each opposite direction, 
<br />
and two natures one being that of connecting and the other being 
<br />
that of dividing
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* the quorum is so named because there must be at least three 
<br />
jani facing together and bound together [how so bound is a 
<br />
mystery] because if there were only two their condition would be 
<br />
indistinguishable from there just being one janus connecting two 
<br />
real quora, and this in effect is how jani 'disappear'
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* my assumption, which reflects some aspects of what I think 
<br />
the process physics people are on about, is that the plenitude 
<br />
constituted by these jani and their quora [connections and 
<br />
nodes], is fundamentally unstable such that whenever it is 
<br />
possible for a janus to slip out of a quorum this will happen, 
<br />
as for example it MUST happen if two jani find themselves both 
<br />
to be facing into the same two quora; they will become one janus 
<br />
- one connection, and if this means that there would otherwise 
<br />
only be two jani left at one or both of the quora they face, 
<br />
then [by definition almost] such a quorum ceases to exist
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* the net effect of this is that the plenitude is always 
<br />
simplifying and 'collapsing' in the direction of smallwards and 
<br />
this is the basis of gravity, so it is true to say that gravity 
<br />
IS space-time and vice versa
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* it has to be remembered that jani and their quora ARE 
<br />
space-time, and ARE everything which exists, there is nothing else
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* for brevity and clarity, we can call this conception of the 
<br />
plenitude &quot;JQspacetime&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* for reasons not clear to me, regions of JQspacetime can 
<br />
become knotted and self-entangled such that the in-falling drift 
<br />
in the direction of smallwards cannot normally destroy the 
<br />
tangle which thus takes on something of the nature of a 
<br />
permanent vortex; these regions of JQspacetime are what people 
<br />
call 'particles'
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* there are all sorts of characteristic JQspacetime vortices 
<br />
and quite a few of them have the ability to create simple 
<br />
'glider' type vortices - much like the glider factories of the 
<br />
cellular automata *Game of Life* which, being essentially 
<br />
complex wave forms in the plenitude travel about at a 
<br />
characteristic velocity which reflects their complexity and some 
<br />
aspect of the intrinsic rate of evolution of the in-falling 
<br />
JQspacetime
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* distance within JQspacetime is first and foremost a question 
<br />
of connection; there is essentially NO distance at all between 
<br />
the two faces of a janus; it has no 'body' and is simply a 
<br />
connection between two quora
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* thus it is possible, indeed very common, that the two faces 
<br />
of a janus look into quora which are only otherwise connected 
<br />
[and here we could say 'next most closely connected'] indirectly 
<br />
via a pathway composed of a whole sequence of other jani
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* because the two faces of a janus simply ARE a connection 
<br />
between two quora, if the 'next most closest connection' between 
<br />
the two quora entails a sequence of umpteen billions of billions 
<br />
of other jani so that a NASA space probe would take decades to 
<br />
go the long way round [by the shortest feasible path none the 
<br />
less], well that is just the way it is
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
Now I realise that all that is a lot of words but, if you care 
<br />
to look closely, you will see that it is all plain-English and 
<br />
goes a fair way to informally explaining quite a lot of things.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* so-called Dark matter may simply be vortex knots that neither 
<br />
generate nor receive gliders
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* the generation and receipt of gliders may be the basis of 
<br />
electromagnetic, weak nuclear, and strong nuclear forces
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* the various kinds of charge may be the manifestations of 
<br />
chirality, fractal dimensionality, other aspects of topology, 
<br />
and wave interactions such as harmonic resonance and interference
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* none of the above relies on any concepts of 'particle' or 
<br />
'solidity' but points to all aspects of existence manifesting a 
<br />
wave nature, so talk of particles is out of place, 'wavicles' 
<br />
might be a word we have to use :-)
<br />
<br />That is enough for now. I will leave for another posting my 
<br />
question about the apparent scandal of Michelson/Morley 
<br />
interferometry NOT actually falsifying the aether concept, and 
<br />
Dayton Miller is it? Not only not falsifying it but actually 
<br />
providing support for a clear sidereal drift of some cosmic 
<br />
velocity.
<br />
