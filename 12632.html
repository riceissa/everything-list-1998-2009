<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It seems to me that abstract machines have been created for our 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; benefit, rather like mathematical notation or human language. That is, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they allow us to think about algorithms and to consider how we might 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; build a physical machine to carry them out, even if this is not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; actually done in practice.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I could agree that mathematical notation are our own invention, unlike 
<br />
number, OK?
<br />
Now, and I know I have to come back on this with more details, if you 
<br />
get what really is CHURCH'S THESIS, I can explain that &quot;abstract 
<br />
machine&quot; are mathematical object like numbers, having objective and 
<br />
general mathematical properties which does not depend on the choice of 
<br />
language or notation. There is an intrinsical, machine independent 
<br />
computer science.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you do away with the possibility of physical implementation and if 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you consider only first person experience, what purpose is served by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an abstract machine?
</em><br />
<br /><br />But I do not consider only first person experiences. I consider the 
<br />
0-person (roughly: truth), the 3-person (roughly: provability), the 
<br />
1-person captured by the conjunction of provability and truth, the 
<br />
first person plural or &quot;intelligible matter&quot; (conjunction of 
<br />
provability and consistency) and the &quot;sensible matter&quot; (conjunction of 
<br />
provability, consistency and truth). This makes five notion of person 
<br />
points of view.
<br />
And thus it makes 10 such notion when you distinguish machine discourse 
<br />
on them and divine (true) discourse on them (you can do that by using G 
<br />
and G*). And then, for technical but important reason, two of them 
<br />
collapse, so in reality there are 8 hypostases.
<br />
I don't either do completely away with the physical implementation, 
<br />
only they are &quot;abstract&quot; or &quot;immaterial&quot; themselves, by relating 
<br />
&quot;abstract machine state&quot; with their possible abstract computational 
<br />
&quot;most probable&quot; continuations.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The quotient of two numbers does not depend on a long division 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; algorithm, or any algorithm running on any  machine; it simply *is*.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, but with Church thesis, the many abstract machine computing the 
<br />
quotient simply *are*, too. And the first person observer, if he 
<br />
believe in comp, know that if he want to take localise himself in its 
<br />
most probable computational history has to take those many machine into 
<br />
considerations. The UD compute the quotient in all possible way (a 
<br />
little bit like an electron who follows all possible path).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; OK, but as far as they can communicate from their inside points of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; view
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (btw: thanks for the spelling!) you are adding implicitly some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; addition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and multiplication laws. Once we stop to take for granted what exists
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; or not, such little nuance have some importance, especially for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; deriving concretely physics from something else.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Communicating with the outside world changes everything, but we can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; put a box around the whole system and declare it closed. This closed 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; system (which may contain many interacting conscious entities) exists 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; somewhere in the Library of Babel, in the output of the &quot;count&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; program, in noise, in the decimal expansion of pi, etc., and even 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; though we outside the the system cannot find it or interact with it, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; its inhabitants are going about their business regardless.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes but, after the UDA, unless we abandon comp, we just cannot refer to 
<br />
an outside world so easily, nor can we reify any piece of matter. Then 
<br />
if comp allows such rich piece of matter, embedding interacting 
<br />
consciousness (which I doubt) will be relevant only as far as they 
<br />
perturb the relative first person (plural) SSA measure.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Of course, such measure is a bit too much intuitive: a priori all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; probabilities of histories add up, and we could a bit naively take 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; as a refutation of comp. What refrains us to jump toward that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; conclusion, is that such intuitive probabilities have not enough 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; taken
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; into account the difference between the points of view, something any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; self-referentially correct universal machine can be shown to be able 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; do, thanks, not really to incompleteness, but thanks to the fact that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; machine can reason about their own incompleteness (leading to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; arithmetical points of view/hypostases). This motivates then the AUDA
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (Arithmetical version of UDA, ... or of Plotinus, actually).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK, I think I understand why you can see all the arbitrary sequences 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from inside the UD but not the outside (it relates to the irrelevance 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of delays from the inside), but I don't see why these extra sequences 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should be more likely to encode white rabbit universes than the 3rd 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person observable ones.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Because the arbitrary sequences are much more numerous (a continuum) 
<br />
than the computable one. Matter, Nature and Life &quot;occur&quot; on the 
<br />
boundary of the computable and the uncomputable, where the first person 
<br />
view and the third person view get conflicting. Frankly, here computer 
<br />
science provides many (subtle and counterintuitive) clues.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Also, I still don't understand how you will avoid the white rabbits.
</em><br />
<br /><br />By extracting the physical laws from some 1-person machine measure. 
<br />
This one can be extracted from some interview of an honest 
<br />
self-observing machine. Well, to be sure, I'm saying this since 1973 
<br />
but it is only in 1991 that I have find a &quot;formal&quot; clue of the reason 
<br />
why the rabbits could disappear: the logic of certainty, corresponding 
<br />
to the godelian sort of undeterminateness, allows a formal quantization 
<br />
of the true Sigma_1 propositions (= those corresponding to the 
<br />
accessible state of the UD). This is by far NOT enough for already 
<br />
pretending that comp will avoid the white rabbits, but, imo, it is 
<br />
enough to make very plausible they can disappear through purely number 
<br />
theoretical reason, so that we don't have to rely on some material 
<br />
assumption, which puts the mind body problem (my basic motivation) 
<br />
under the aristotelian rug.
<br />
<br />But sure, the disappearance of white rabbits with comp is still an open 
<br />
problem. Brent seems to believe it is yet open in QM too, which is 
<br />
coherent with the fact that most MWI relies implicitly or not on some 
<br />
comp assumption. I sum up this sometimes by saying that decoherence + 
<br />
MWI avoids 3-person rabbits, but not the 1-person one. Actually I have 
<br />
argue that ASSA does the same. Some bayesian stuff seems to be able to 
<br />
eliminate the 3-rabbits (or the first plural person one), but hardly 
<br />
the first person one (I refer to my oldest post to this list, but I can 
<br />
repeat, especially when encouraged, the subject matter is tricky).
