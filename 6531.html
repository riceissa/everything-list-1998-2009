David Pearce is a British philosopher with Utilitarian leanings, and his 
<br />
extensive &quot;HedWeb&quot;  site has been around for many years. His main thesis is 
<br />
contained in a book-length article called &quot;The Hedonistic Imperative&quot;, in 
<br />
which he argues that the aim of civilization should be the ultimate 
<br />
elimination of all suffering in sentient life. He proposes that this be done 
<br />
not primarily through traditional methods, such as banning animal cruelty 
<br />
(although he has much to say about that as well), but by directly accessing 
<br />
and altering the neural mechanisms responsible for suffering, through 
<br />
pharmacological and neurological means initially, and eventually through 
<br />
genetic engineering so that no organism is physically capable of 
<br />
experiencing suffering.
<br />
<br />Pearce's thesis does not really address the next stage after 
<br />
neuroengineering often discussed on this list, namely living as uploaded 
<br />
minds on a computer network. The interesting question arises of how we would 
<br />
(or should) spend our time in this state. It would be a simple matter of 
<br />
programming to eliminate suffering and spend eternity (or however long it 
<br />
lasts) in a state of heavenly bliss. The obvious response to such a proposal 
<br />
is that perpetual bliss would be boring, and leave no room for motivation, 
<br />
curiosity, progress, etc. But boredom is just another adverse experience 
<br />
which could be simply eliminated if you have access to the source code. And 
<br />
if you think about it, even such tasks as participating in discussions such 
<br />
as the present one are only really motivated by anticipation of the complex 
<br />
pleasure gained from it; if you could get the same effect or better, 
<br />
directly, with no adverse consequences, why would you waste your time doing 
<br />
it the hard way?

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Thanks for an illuminating explanation of Tipler's paper.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I wonder if you and/or any other members on this list have an opinion about

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This is a discussion of &quot;WHY DOES ANYTHING EXIST?&quot;  (The author is

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Lee Corbin points to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Tipler's March 2005 paper &quot;The Structure of the World From Pure Numbers&quot;:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;<a href="http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0034-4885/68/4/R04">http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0034-4885/68/4/R04</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I tried to read this paper, but it was 60 pages long and extremely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;technical, mostly over my head.  The gist of it was an updating of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Tipler's Omega Point theory, advanced in his book, The Physics of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Immortality.  Basically the OP theory predicts, based on the assumption
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that the laws of physics we know today are roughly correct, that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;universe must re-collapse in a special way that can't really happen
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;naturally, hence Tipler deduces that intelligent life will survive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;through and guide the ultimate collapse, during which time the information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;content of the universe will go to infinity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The new paper proposes an updated cosmological model that includes a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;number of new ideas.  One is that the fundamental laws of physics for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;universe are infinitely complex.  This is where his title comes from; he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;assumes that the universe is based on the mathematics of the continuum,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;i.e. the real numbers.  In fact Tipler argues that the universe must
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have infinitely complex laws, basing this surprising conclusion on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Lowenheim-Skolem paradox, which says that any set of finite axioms
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;can be fit to a mathematical object that is only countable in size.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Hence technically we can't really describe the real numbers without an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;infinite number of axioms, and therefore if the universe is truly based
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;on the reals, it must have laws of infinite complexity.  (Otherwise the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;laws would equally well describe a universe based only on the integers.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Another idea Tipler proposes is that under the MWI, different universes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in the multiverse will expand to different maximum sizes R before
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;re-collapsing.  The probability measure however works out to be higher
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with larger R, hence for any finite R the probability is 1 (i.e. certain)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that our universe will be bigger than that.  This is his solution to why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the universe appears to be flat - it's finite in size but very very big.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Although Tipler wants the laws to be infinitely complex, the physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;information content of the universe should be zero, he argues, at the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;time of the Big Bang (this is due to the Beckenstein Bound).  That means
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;among other things there are no particles back then, and so he proposes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a special field called an SU(2) gauge field which creates particles
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;as the universe expands.  He is able to sort of show that it would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;preferentially create matter instead of antimatter, and also that this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;field would be responsible for the cosmological constant (CC) which is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observed, aka negative energy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In order for the universe to re-collapse as Tipler insists it must,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;due to his Omega Point theory, the CC must reverse sign eventually.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Tipler suggests that this will happen because life will choose to do so,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and that somehow people will find a way to reverse the particle-creation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;effect, catalyzing the destruction of particles in such a way as to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reverse the CC and cause the universe to begin to re-collapse.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Yes, he's definitely full of wild ideas here.  Another idea is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;particle masses should not have specific, arbitrary values as most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physicists believe, but rather they should take on a full range of values,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;from 0 to positive infinity, over the history of the universe.  There is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;some slight observational evidence for a time-based change in the fine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;structure constant alpha, and Tipler points to that to buttress his theory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;- however the actual measured value is inconsistent with other aspects,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;so he has to assume that the measurements are mistaken!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Another testable idea is that the cosmic microwave background radiation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is not the cooled-down EM radiation from the big bang, but instead is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;remnants of that SU(2) field which was responsible for particle creation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;He shows that such a field would look superficially like cooled down
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;photons, but it really is not.  In particular, the photons in this special
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;field would only interact with left handed electrons, not right handed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ones.  This would cause the photons to have less interaction with matter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in a way which should be measurable.  He uses this to solve the current
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;puzzle of high energy cosmic rays: such rays should not exist due to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interaction with microwave background photons.  Tipler's alternative does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not interact so well and so it would at least help to explain the problem.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Overall it is quite a mixed bag of exotic ideas that I don't think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physicists are going to find very convincing.  The idea of infinitely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;complex natural laws is going to be particularly off-putting, I would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;imagine.  However the idea that the cosmic microwave background interacts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;differently with matter than ordinary photons is an interesting one and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;might be worth investigating.  It doesn't have that much connection to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the rest of his theory, though.
