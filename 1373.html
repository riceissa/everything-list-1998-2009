I propose  comments on the last posts by
<br />
GSlevy and Russell Standish, which will also summarize
<br />
my critics of Tegmark and Schmidhuber.
<br />
<br />GSLevy wrote:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Pushing beyond the world of discrete programming, the question arise, is it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;possible to create languages for the control of:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;1) a unidimensional unidirectional continuous computer. 
</em><br />
<br /><br />The problem is that until now nobody has found a definition of
<br />
what could be a continuous computer. There is no corresponding
<br />
Church's Thesis in the continuous domain. Worst: there is no 
<br />
unanimity about what the continuum really is. The intuitionistic
<br />
or constructive approachs toward the continuum seems to me the
<br />
most interesting, but there are numerous and not equivalent.
<br />
The non-constructive approach is more standart, but still will
<br />
depend on the model choose. Most of these models are mathematical
<br />
structures which are impossible to describe using a finite or even 
<br />
recursively enumerable theory.
<br />
<br />This is linked to something said by Russell Standish in his paper
<br />
and in some posts. Russell Standish pretends that (I quote him):
<br />
<br />Each self-consistent mathematical structure is completely described
<br />
by a finite set of symbols, axioms and rule.
<br />
<br />This is totaly incorrect, I'm afraid. It is known that you cannot
<br />
find a recursively enumerable (RE) set of axioms to specify the 
<br />
(N,+,x) structure (N) of the natural numbers with addition and 
<br />
multiplication. Each RE description of N admit plenty of non 
<br />
isomorphic models which belongs to any reasonable set of 
<br />
mathematical structures. And things are worst with sets, 
<br />
categories, etc.
<br />
Of course you can guess this from the fact that the set of RE
<br />
theories are countable, and the set of possible mathematical 
<br />
structure is ... much much bigger, to say the least.
<br />
<br />People should realize that notion like &quot;definability&quot;, 
<br />
&quot;provability&quot; etc. are highly relative mathematical concept, by
<br />
which I mean that they are formalism-dependent.
<br />
&quot;computability&quot; is the first and the last (until now) purely
<br />
absolute concept, which doesn't depend on the formalism choosed.
<br />
Godel said that with the computability concept there is some
<br />
kind of miracle. The miracle is the apparent truth of Church's
<br />
thesis.
<br />
<br />That is why Tegmark or GSlevy approach, although very interesting,
<br />
is still ill-defined. Tegmark will need some powerfull constructive 
<br />
axiom to give a sufficiently precise sense to the &quot;whole set
<br />
of mathematical structures&quot; so that he can make the white
<br />
rabbit disappearing, by isolating the right prior.
<br />
<br />Schmidhuber has chosen the &quot;right&quot; (absolute) objective realm: 
<br />
the universe of computations, but still doesn't realise that 
<br />
with comp, the prior cannot be defined on the computation, 
<br />
but only on the relative continuation, and this in a &quot;trans-universe&quot;
<br />
manner (cf the UDA). 
<br />
The Universal Dovetailer Argument (UDA as I
<br />
now call it, hoping Chris appreciates) shows also that we must 
<br />
take into account the continuum.
<br />
It seems that the UDA makes some links between Tegmark and 
<br />
Schmidhuber approach, indeed. Because it shows that with comp
<br />
some prior needs non RE mathematical structures.
<br />
<br />BTW, Russell, I publish the &quot;white rabbit&quot; problem in my 1991
<br />
paper: Marchal B, 1991, Mechanism and Personal Identity, Proceedings
<br />
of WOCFAI, De Glass &amp; Gabbay (Eds), pp. 335-345, Angkor, Paris.
<br />
Those who want that paper just send me out-line an address. I do NOT
<br />
put them on my WEB page because it is in horrible WORD format, and
<br />
I have not the time to change all the format of my older publications!
<br />
<br />I have still a question for Russell, what is the meaning of 
<br />
giving a &quot;physical existence&quot; to a mathematical structure ? This is 
<br />
not at all a clear statement for me.
<br />
<br />Bruno
