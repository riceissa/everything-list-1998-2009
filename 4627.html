<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here is something from David Deutsch for Platonists to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contemplate...I think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; LN
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;We see around us a computable universe; that is to say, of all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; possible mathematical objects and relationships, only an
</em><br />
infinitesimal
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; proportion are ever instantiated in the relationships of physical
</em><br />
objects
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and physical processes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (These are essentially the computable functions.) Now it might
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; seem that one approach to explaining that amazing fact, is to say
</em><br />
&quot;the
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; reason why physical processes conform to this very small part of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; mathematics, 'computable mathematics,' is that physical processes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; really are computations running on a computer external to what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; we think of as physical reality.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But that relies on the assumption that the set of computable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; functions - the Turing computable functions, or the set of quantum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; computable operations - is somehow inherently privileged within
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; mathematics. So that even a computer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; implemented in unknown physics (the supposed computer that we're
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; all simulations on) would be expected to conform to those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; same notions of computability, to use those same functions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that mathematics designates as computable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But in fact, the only thing that privileges the set of all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; computational operations that we see in nature, is that they are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; instantiated by the laws of physics. It is only through our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; knowledge of the physical world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that we know of the difference between computable and not
</em><br />
computable.
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; So it's only through our laws of physics that the nature of
</em><br />
computation
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; can be understood. It can never be vice versa.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<br />I think our whole traditional approach is anthropomorphically inside
<br />
out. The universe is a process and the only perfect descriptor - the
<br />
perfect mathematics of the universe - is the universe itself.  Of
<br />
course it is all a computation. We tinker and panelbeat mathematics to
<br />
model what it does in a certain context but it's ultimately a process
<br />
and is indivisible. Take anything out of it and what you take is
<br />
changed and what you take it from is changed. Our silly fascination
<br />
that there are 'things' to model is an artifact of our being in the
<br />
system we try to describe and the inherently 3rd person view of it
<br />
provided by our senses. I hold that the third person view is
<br />
fundamentally virtual. There is only 1st person experience giving an
<br />
apparent 3rd person view! Kant was 180 degrees wrong.
<br />
<br />I find the awe that we have of the apparent utility of mathematics
<br />
quite funny. We beat the hell out of it until it works and then get
<br />
all misty eyed and mystical that it does! Nuts.
<br />
<br />Yes the universe is computation but its language is its own and the
<br />
only tokens and types that truly represent what it does are
<br />
persistencies in a massive process of change. In mathematical
<br />
modelling axiomatic statements form a boundary to both the rest of the
<br />
universe contained by the erstwhile model and to that part of the
<br />
universe containing your erstwhile model. The universe has no such
<br />
limit. It is complete from the most minute fluff in a loop in quantum
<br />
foam to a galactic supercluster and beyond. There is no such thing as
<br />
matter. There is only apparently persistent structure in a massive
<br />
process and everything in it is connected. Physics and mathematics can
<br />
only ever approximate what it does. That is what Godel taught us. It's
<br />
time we listened. A TOE in this context is simply meaningless. The
<br />
universe itself _is_ the TOE! Job's done!
<br />
<br />A model of a thing is not a thing. Materialism is only apparent and
<br />
platonist dreaming should be left as just that. A little while ago we
<br />
had a posted paper re 'Process Philosophy' and a 'Process Physics' to
<br />
go with it. Listen to it.
<br />
<br />How's that for a sweeping flood over the whole issue!
<br />
<br />cheers
<br />
<br />Colin Hales
