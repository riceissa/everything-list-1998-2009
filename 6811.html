</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and run in lockstep with my biologically implemented mind for the next 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;six
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; months, at which point the computer is shut down. This means that most 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; measure is now in the latter half of 2005, in the sense that if you pick
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; observer moment at random out of all the observer moments which identify
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; themselves as being me, it is much more likely to be one of the copies 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the computer. But what does this mean for my experience of life? Does it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; mean that I am unlikely to experience 2006, being somehow suspended in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;2005?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I would say so. You would find yoursef to be suspended in 2005, just like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you are now suspended between 1900 and 2100. But this would require the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;simulations of your mind in 2005 to dominate over all other versions of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now unless experiencing 2006 would require a miracle this can't be the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;case.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The reason is that all possible versions of you 'already' exist in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;multiverse. Your measure in 2005 is what it is. This includes the effects 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;others simulating your mind experiencing 2005 (the simulation can be done 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;any time, of course).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So, you can say that your measure for experiencing time t is:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;m(t) =  m_{biol}(t) + m_{sim}(t)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;m_{biol} being the 'biological' contribution of your measure and m_{sim} 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;digital contribution. Both terms are fixed by the laws of physics. If 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;indeed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;m_{sim}(2005) is trillions of times larger than m_{biol}(2005) and zero at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;other times, you would be suspended in 2005. But this cannot be the case
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;unless there is some reason why m_{sim}(t) is so strongly peaked around
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;2005. If there are branches in which someone is simulating you in 2005 for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;no good reason, then that decision is taken at random. That means that in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;some other branch you are simulated in some other time. So, the measure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;isn't strongly peaked around 2005 at all!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; More generally, if a person has N OM's available to him at time t1 and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;kN
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; time t2, does this mean he is k times as likely to find himself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;experiencing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; t2 as t1? I suggest that this is not the right way to look at it. A 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; only experiences one OM at a time, so if he has &quot;passed through&quot; t1 and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;t2
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; it will appear to him that he has spent just as much time in either
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interval
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (assuming t1 and t2 are the same length). The only significance of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;fact
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that there are &quot;more&quot; OM's at t2 is that the person can expect a greater
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; variety of possible experiences at t2 if the OM's are all distinct.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The same is true here. It must follow from the laws of physics (which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;include the effects of simmulations) that there are indeed many more copies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of you at t2.
</em><br />
<br />In dealing with this type of problem you have to consider not only the 
<br />
physics, which I'm sure you understand much better than I do, but also the 
<br />
psychology of how the first person experience of being a unique individual 
<br />
persisting through time is constructed from observer moment building blocks. 
<br />
This is not as obvious as may first appear; specifically, it does not follow 
<br />
in general that more copies/ greater measure at time t = more likely to 
<br />
experience time t. The important thing to keep in mind is that each 
<br />
individual experiences only one OM at a time. If I consider the future, then 
<br />
there is a potential that I could &quot;become&quot; any of the many OM's who consider 
<br />
me to be in their past. However, when I arrive at the future, and also when 
<br />
I remember the past, I consider myself to be unique. All the other OM's 
<br />
which from a third person perspective are other versions of &quot;me&quot; (and this 
<br />
third person perspective includes me looking at my potential futures) from 
<br />
my perspective are completely separate people. So if I am told that tomorrow 
<br />
I will be copied ten times and one of these copies will be tortured, I am 
<br />
worried, because that means there is a 1/10 chance I will be tortured. But 
<br />
when tomorrow comes and I am not the torture victim, I am relieved, because 
<br />
it is someone else who is suffering, and I can feel sorry for him in the way 
<br />
I feel sorry for suffering strangers.
<br />
<br />What this means is that if you trace an individual's history from his birth 
<br />
to his ultimate demise (which may never come, if QTI is correct), at each 
<br />
time point he is associated with only *one* OM. Two or more individuals may 
<br />
share two or more OM's at some point in their life, for example when a 
<br />
duplication occurs, but from the point of view of each of them, they still 
<br />
only experience one OM at a time for their entire life history. Two OM's may 
<br />
also &quot;combine&quot; in one of two ways: either a third OM exists with the content 
<br />
of the other two, or they do not really combine but a later OM has the 
<br />
memory of having been both in the past. The one OM per time point for each 
<br />
individual rule is maintained.
<br />
<br />The conclusion from the above is that the absolute measure of an individual 
<br />
at any time point, from that individual's point of view, is unity. When 
<br />
looking into the future, the other copies in the multiverse do matter, but 
<br />
in this case it is the relative measure of different outcomes rather than 
<br />
the absolute measure which is important. Once the future becomes present, 
<br />
the other copies from the first person perspective are just other people.
