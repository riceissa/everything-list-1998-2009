<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	Since you joined the list relatively more recently, you're

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unlikely to have come across a couple of example in decision theory I

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mentioned back in 1999
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (<a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m781.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m781.html</a>), namely with respect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to superannuation (pension insurance) and euthanasia. This has more to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do with QTI than MWI, but since many of us think an expectation of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subjective immortality is a corollory of the MWI, this is relevant.
</em><br />
<br />OK, I found it. Thanks. Rather than read through the comments others 
<br />
made about your article, I'll comment on it as I found it:
<br />
<br />&quot;However, I thought I'd report on how QTI has influenced me on a couple
<br />
of items recently. The first was in making a decision whether to stay
<br />
with my present superannuation scheme (which provides for a pension
<br />
for life, based on one's salary at retirement) and having the funds
<br />
invested in conventional shares and bonds, a possibly risky
<br />
strategy. With QTI, the life-long pension sounds like a good deal, and
<br />
is what I eventually chose, for that reason. However, I fully realise
<br />
that with QTI, I am likely to outlive the pension fund, or inflation
<br />
will so erode its value, that perhaps the decision is not so
<br />
clear-cut.&quot;
<br />
<br />By now you know my main perspective on this: the only world in which 
<br />
your choices matter is the world you are in.
<br />
<br />But even with your logic above, why not go for the gusto, grab the bull 
<br />
by the horns, and simply do quantum russian roulette? The payoff on 
<br />
this is better (in the worlds you happen to survive in!) than any 
<br />
fuddy-duddy pension plans.
<br />
<br />How with your theory are you expected to outlive your pension funds? Am 
<br />
I missing some assumption in this thread from a few years ago that 
<br />
somehow you, the actual you who is corresponding with me right here in 
<br />
this branch, that somehow you expect to live to an unusually old age?
<br />
<br />What does your wife think of your plans?
<br />
<br />As for investing, I invest exclusively in high tech companies. These 
<br />
have been severely beaten down in the 2000-present period, but my 
<br />
portfolio is still ahead of where it was in early 1998, way ahead of 
<br />
where it was in 1995, and vastly ahead of where it was in 1986 when I 
<br />
retired. And I only used good old reasoning about likely technologies, 
<br />
not any notions of killing myself if my investments failed to reach a 
<br />
certain return, etc.
<br />
<br />I don't mean to disparage the ideas as weird, but they are.
<br />
<br /><br />&quot;The second issue is in relation to euthanasia. I used to be in favour
<br />
of this, on the basis that I grew up on a farm, and understood the
<br />
phrase &quot;putting it out of its misery&quot;. However, the process of
<br />
attempting to kill someone is only likely to increase their suffering
<br />
in those worlds where they survive. So now I'm against euthanasia, at
<br />
least until someone can convince me they can control the outcome of
<br />
the &quot;merciful death&quot; well enough to ensure that the patient is almost
<br />
always in a better world because of it.&quot;
<br />
<br />I know of some pretty fool-proof ways of committing suicide, ones with 
<br />
99.99999% likelihood of working. Jumping off a high enough place almost 
<br />
always works. Jumping out of an airplane at 40,000 feet with an 
<br />
explosive collar set to detonate at 1000 feet, oh, and a rope attached 
<br />
to the plane to break the jumper's neck: that's four different 
<br />
approaches, any one of which is overwhelmingly likely to work. (And if 
<br />
one doubts this, but others play the odds the usual way, arrange a 
<br />
betting pool with a payoff sufficient to make one vastly wealth and 
<br />
able to buy the best pain-killing drugs in the 1 in 10^30 of the worlds 
<br />
where one survives the noose, the freezing cold and oxygen deprivation, 
<br />
the explosive collar, and the impact with the ground.)
<br />
<br />Or pay a firing squad to do the job...shades of Tegmark's machine 
<br />
gunner. Except make sure a dozen rifles are used.
<br />
<br />More easily, there are various combinations of pills which will do the 
<br />
job reliably. A friend of mine in college did it with cyanide from the 
<br />
chemistry lab...he didn't have a chance once he'd taken his dose. (Not 
<br />
that this compares with the 10^-30 chance, or whatever, one can arrange 
<br />
as above. So combine this with a large bottle of Tylenol and, for good 
<br />
measure, be doing the backstroke about a mile offshore when this 
<br />
process is started...)
<br />
<br />But using the logic about &quot;increasing their suffering,&quot; have you also 
<br />
considered that another implication of MWI is that not only are they 
<br />
sick and may wish/need to be put down, but that MWI guarantees all 
<br />
manner of _EVEN WORSE_ developments? Some worlds where the cancer runs 
<br />
really wild, leading to excruciating pain, tumors growing out of 
<br />
eyeballs, psychotic episodes where the afflictee kills his family, and, 
<br />
basically, every bad thing imaginable. There must be worlds where this 
<br />
is happening even now.
<br />
<br />So, even using your logic, leaving a sick person to die because the 
<br />
dangers of an unsuccessful suicide are likely to be even worse is not 
<br />
itself an obvious conclusion. Which is why the usual decision theory 
<br />
process gives about the right answer without appeal to many worlds 
<br />
theories.
<br />
<br />(More notes: I've also known unsuccessful suicides and have read about 
<br />
others. They are usually not &quot;worse off&quot; in any determinant way for our 
<br />
exercise. They wake up in a hospital room, or the bleeding stops, 
<br />
whatever. Only occasionally do suicides fail in ways that make them 
<br />
worse off. And in those cases, they can always try again, or have a 
<br />
hired killer waiting to finish the job.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The argument wrt superannuation is that standard decision theory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should lead one to the same decision as the QTI case (a bit like life
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; insurance, except one is betting that you won't die instead that you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will) - however in such a case why would anyone choose lump sum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; investment options over lifetime pension?
</em><br />
<br />Because they think they can grow the sum more than the pension fund 
<br />
managers can. And, since they can always take the grown amount and 
<br />
_buy_ an annuity later if and when they get tired of investing, they 
<br />
lose nothing by trying, if they think they can in fact do better than 
<br />
the managers.
<br />
<br />(I hope you considered this benefit of the lump sum payout. If you are 
<br />
at all bright, which you clearly are, you can grow the lump sum at 
<br />
least as well as some government/bureaucrat pension fund managers 
<br />
typically do. At some point you can then buy a larger annuity than the 
<br />
one you picked in the conservative option. And if you die before you 
<br />
expect to, you had the use of that lump sum for things of importance to 
<br />
you.)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Noone that I could recall came up with a convincing argument against
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Euthanasia issue - it would seem that committing euthanasia on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; someone is actually condemning them to an eternity of even greater
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; misery than if you'd just left things alone - quite the contrary to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what one expects in a single universe notion of reality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />I don't see this at all, even besides the issue of my own focus on the 
<br />
branch *I* am in.
