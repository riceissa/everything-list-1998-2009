<br />One of the issues is the computational complexity of &quot;running all the 
<br />
possible i.e. definable programs&quot; to
<br />
create an informational multiverse out of which consistent, metric, 
<br />
regular, observable info-universes
<br />
emerge. If computation takes energy (as it undeniably does WITHIN our 
<br />
universe), then an unfathomably
<br />
impossibly large amount of &quot;extra-universal&quot; energy would be required to 
<br />
compute all info-universes.
<br />
<br />(def'n qubitstring = a bitstring capable of simultaneously holding all 
<br />
of its possible values i.e. all possible
<br />
combinations of 1s and 0s in a bitstring of that length)
<br />
<br />For example, say that we have a relatively tiny info-multiverse 
<br />
consisting of a qubitstring
<br />
where the qubitstring is only 1 billion bits long. i.e. It 
<br />
simultaneously exhibits (if queried appropriately) any of
<br />
(2 raised to the power 1 billion) different information-states.
<br />
<br />Now lets imagine computation upon this qubitstring multiverse, in order 
<br />
for a god-computer to &quot;tour&quot; some
<br />
set of info-states of the qubitstring in some &quot;time-order&quot; in order to 
<br />
simulate the operation of some universe
<br />
within the qubitstring multiverse.
<br />
<br />Let's further imagine that the god-computer doesn't like to discriminate 
<br />
amongst its potential universes within
<br />
the multiverse qubitstring, so it wants to try (just the next 
<br />
computation step, for now,  in) all possible computations
<br />
upon the multiverse qubitstring.
<br />
<br />How many ways of choosing the next computational step are there? Again, 
<br />
there are 2 to the power 1 billion ways
<br />
at each step.
<br />
So if the god-computer wants to simulate only 1 million 
<br />
discrete-computing-steps
<br />
(defined as different-info-state-selecting steps) of each universe 
<br />
simulation, but to to do this for all possible
<br />
&quot;potential universes i.e. state-change traces&quot; in the billion-qubit 
<br />
multiverse, then the number of ways of
<br />
doing this (and we're saying all of these ways are going to get done, 
<br />
because the god-comp is non-favoring
<br />
of one potential universe over another), the number of ways of 
<br />
simulating a million comp-steps in each
<br />
universe is (2 to the power (1 million billion).)   (express as 2 ^ 
<br />
1,000,000,000,000,000)
<br />
<br />This &quot;number of possible computing-step-sequences to compute all of 
<br />
these million-step-old universes
<br />
is the same as the number of computing-steps NECESSARY to compute all 
<br />
these universes.
<br />
---------
<br />
Now lets make the numbers more realistic. Our current universe has the 
<br />
following statistics (roughly!)
<br />
# of protons = 10 ^ 78
<br />
# of material particles and photons = 10 ^ 88 (give or take)
<br />
<br />Entropy H = 10 ^ 88    = &quot;the log of the number of possible velocities 
<br />
and positions of the material particles and photons&quot;
<br />
<br />Bitstring length needed to represent a single &quot;instantaneous state&quot; of 
<br />
our universe
<br />
IS THE SAME AS THE ENTROPY, so the bitstring needed to represent a 
<br />
&quot;shortest distinguishable moment&quot; of
<br />
our universe is 10 ^ 88 bits long. So the qubitstring needed to 
<br />
&quot;simultaneously&quot; represent all possible moment-states
<br />
of our universe is also 10 ^ 88 bits long.
<br />
<br />So, how many &quot;shortest-distinguishable-moments&quot; have their been in our 
<br />
universe since the big bang anyway?
<br />
Well the shortest distinguishable moment of time is the Planck time unit 
<br />
= 10 ^ -43 seconds.
<br />
<br />And there have been 3 x 10 ^ 60 Planck time units in our own universe's 
<br />
lifetime so far.
<br />
<br />So, putting it all back together in the qubitstring-computational framework,
<br />
<br />The number of possible ways of choosing computing steps, to compute all 
<br />
possible info-universes up to those
<br />
universe evolution stages of the same age and particle+photon population 
<br />
and entropy as ours is: (+- fudge factors):
<br />
(Drum-roll please.....)  42 (just kidding, it is.....)
<br />
<br />2 to the power (Entropy  *  the number of distinguishable time moments) =
<br />
<br />2 to the power (bitstring-length  *  the number of distinguishable info 
<br />
states in each universe's sim. computation i.e. history) =
<br />
<br />2 to the power ( (10 ^ 88) * (3 * 10 ^ 60) )  = 
<br />
<br />======================================================================
<br />
2 to the power (10 ^ 148)          (approximately)
<br />
<br />Which is the number of computing steps that must be done to compute the 
<br />
simulations of
<br />
the histories of all possible universes of comparable age and particle 
<br />
population and entropy as our own.
<br />
======================================================================
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
-------------------------
<br />
<br />So probably, the &quot;extra-universal&quot; notion of &quot;computing all the universe 
<br />
simulations&quot; is not traditional computation
<br />
at all. I prefer to think of the state of affairs as being that the 
<br />
multiverse substrate is just kind of like a
<br />
very large, passive qubitstring memory, capable of holding the qubits, 
<br />
that is of exhibiting, if appropriately
<br />
queried, the different bit values in the information states (all 10 ^ 
<br />
148 information-states in the histories of
<br />
universes as big and old as ours, that is.)
<br />
<br />So then the question becomes, ok, how do we get to ACTUAL computation 
<br />
happening in all this mess,
<br />
and dynamics happening, and time etc &quot;happening&quot;. If it's all just a 
<br />
really, really big static RAM, then nothing's
<br />
HAPPENING!! And that doesn't seem right.
<br />
<br />However..... (raw speculation here)....
<br />
<br />SPECULATION A: The god-computer is lazy. It actually just constructs (or 
<br />
initially constructs) selected universes in
<br />
&nbsp;the qubitstring multiverse, using the principle of their being just 1 
<br />
bit initially (entropy of 0) and then
<br />
expanding to 2 bits but only creating (or first creating) those info 
<br />
states which are minimally different from
<br />
each other (i.e. are 1-bit in 1 position different from each other). 
<br />
Then creating an info state with 3 bits, but again,
<br />
only evolving its state 1 local bit-change at a time, and so on and so 
<br />
on. So I guess this means something at least
<br />
akin to  &quot;do the shortest (or least entropy-changing) bit-flipping 
<br />
programs first, before any other info-states are realized.&quot;
<br />
That could perhaps define some kind of thermodynamic time arrow I 
<br />
suppose.And it would define a limited set of
<br />
(perhaps constrained to be sensible-form) universes initially emerging 
<br />
from the computation, as well.
<br />
<br />In other words, maybe entropy is increasing (due to longer and longer 
<br />
bitstrings being created as &quot;god-computation/mem generation&quot;
<br />
proceeds) but it is increasing AS SLOWLY AS POSSIBLE. By only 
<br />
least-entropy-changing next states of the bitstring
<br />
being selected by the lazy god-comp at each step of &quot;computed existence&quot;.
<br />
&nbsp;Maybe that's the constraint that allows order to temporarily beat back 
<br />
entropy in local areas of our universe?
<br />
<br />AND/OR
<br />
<br />SPECULATION B:
<br />
<br />What if.... Observers are things that are kind of like &quot;lazy computers&quot; 
<br />
with access (from within it??) to
<br />
&nbsp;the multiverse qubitstring RAM.    So observers all observe the same 
<br />
universe, and the same time arrow, because
<br />
they are constrained to do the &quot;least-entropy-changing&quot; i.e. 
<br />
laziest-computational tour through whatever locale
<br />
of info-state-space in the multiverse they inhabit. In this model, there 
<br />
is only one realizable universe, and some
<br />
kind of entropy-change-minimization computing direction constraint is 
<br />
what determines it.
<br />
<br />I'm basically halucinating this at this stage, so I'll stop.
<br />
<br />Eric
