Kim,
<br />
<br />great post, thanks!
<br />
<br />You may enjoy this TED talk:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html">http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html</a>
<br />
<br />As to your &quot;laughing&quot; friend, I also know some such people, they have in 
<br />
truth not understood what science is about: asking questions, being 
<br />
critical (especially self-critical!); science is a method, an algorithm 
<br />
for arriving at knowledge, never the current canon of knowledge (which 
<br />
will be an old hat in a decade).
<br />
<br />People which laugh at everything that does not fit into their world-view 
<br />
are not scientific, just dogmatic. They believe in textbook knowledge 
<br />
from college times, which may be the snapshot of scientific modelling at 
<br />
a particular time, but, it's still not the _idea_ of science.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Cheers,
<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let's keep it simple. Schools and universities (globally identifiable as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'the education industry') have traditionally fulfilled the role of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fountains of knowledge. This is fine, up to the point where we realise 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that we no longer need to attend these places if all we want is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; knowledge (accumulated expertise, understanding of a field, the specific 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; technical low-down necessary to gain a foothold in a certain area.) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Increasingly the Internet fulfils this function in a direct and powerful 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way. It also presents a lot of pratfalls as well - as Brent was very 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hasty in pointing out, but then I would call 'using the Internet 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; responsibly' a skill that probably cannot be learnt easily from the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Internet. This is an example of what I mean when I say education should 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; now teach skills rather than knowledge. I am not talking either about 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the vocational skills that many employers hotly desire from the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; education sector although nobody could deny that those skills should be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; taught as well. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Above all what needs to be taught is the skill of thinking. Not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; compartmentalised, specialised, academic thinking, but OPERACY - how to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; get a result in a real and changing world. Bruno has referred (in his 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'amoebas&quot; dissertation) to the value of posing questions in a childlike 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; manner. Children have not yet submitted to &quot;the brainwashing known as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; academic specialisation&quot;. He has uttered a profound and above all, a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; useful truth in mentioning this, IMO.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Have you ever tried to stand upright on a carpet that somebody is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pulling along the floor from one end? Difficult. Ever learnt to ride a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; surfboard? Similar skill. The world around you is changing fast and you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; must strive to maintain some kind of relation to it that is useful. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My point is that education fails badly to teach this kind of skill. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Every banker, every businessman, every politician, every company boss, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; every worker, everybody in fact is &quot;flying by the seat of his pants&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; right now but education remains smugly complacent about it's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-serving tradition. Kids go to school and learn to memorise a bunch 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of stuff, they sit for exams and in so doing mandate the school to set 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; those exams and teach the stuff in the first place. The more you think 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about it the more circular it seems. It's not for nothing that we talk 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; often about the 'education bubble'. By this we mean that in a certain 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense, education is not the real world. The teacher puts something in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; front of the student. The student reacts to this using the vocabulary of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; knowledge taught up to that point. This means the teacher is always 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ahead of the student which is what lends the teacher their air of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; authority. In the 'real world' it isn't as simple as that. You have to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; invent initiatives and use risk-taking strategies to get ahead, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; increasingly we must do this on a daily basis now to even survive. There 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is no school subject, for example, that teaches &quot;economic survival 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; following job redundancy&quot;, yet millions of people are facing precisely 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this dilemma right now. In a certain sense their education has taught 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them little of real value.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Don't forget about &quot;the archway effect&quot;. This states that if a number of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brilliant people are sent under an archway, then it is highly likely 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that from that archway will stream a number of brilliant people. You 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have to be brilliant to get in to Harvard. They don't take in the class 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'dunce' in these institutions. The institution thus benefits more from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the quality of the students than the students benefit from the quality 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the institution.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Because of the unavoidable tradition of historical continuity in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; education - which grew up, after all in the church, the least likely 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; institution to welcome any form of new knowledge or innovation - 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; education is marked by all the drawbacks associated with an overweening 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; respect for 'historical continuity'. It is difficult to break with the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; patterns of the past. Teaching, education - call it whatever you want, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was for a long time in the hands of ecclesiastical authorities who 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; founded the vast majority of our elite educational institutions (not ULB 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - a good point in its favour) and so established the traditions of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; education. I often harp on about the need to teach 'creative thinking' 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in my posts. Note that by this I do NOT mean artistic thinking but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generative, innovative and risk-taking thinking generally. Critical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thinking was and still is of paramount importance in the ecclesiastical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world since it has proven the most effective weapon against heresy and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deviation and since that world consists of concept edifices that must 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have internal consistency and validity if they are not to be overrun by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; outside ideas that would cause them to appear relativistic and thus to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; risk collapse. But all that is very far from the practical, messy world 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in which people have to think (often with very inadequate data) in order 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to solve problems and bring things about. Critical intelligence is very 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; valuable. Critical thinking is an essential part of thinking. But 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; critical thinking can never be the whole of thinking.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The apostolic succession of educators in posts involving tenure and high 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; levels of job security mirrors the smugness with which the education 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world holds its historical continuity in high esteem. It is highly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; amusing for me to see a computer scientist and systems architect such as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Steve Wolfram innovating in such a way as to make these people seem less 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and less relevant.  Wolfram has his detractors for sure, many people 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think he is a bullshit artist, but he is also a risk-taking entrepreneur 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; who has little regard for the sanctity of education institutions to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; claim some kind of monopoly in the knowledge game.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno speaks often of 'interdisciplinarity'. This is the need to escape 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; specialisation, rather than to embrace it. Increasingly, I see this as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the safe path for education in the future. We all know about the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; professor of quantum mechanics who was so expert in his field, he could 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not even work out how to buy sex in a brothel. I think they made a movie 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about it starring Marlene Dietrich. It is also true that the people who 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are the most likely to innovate in any field are not the hidebound ones, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the pedants and the experts who act like oracles of all truth and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wisdom. Anyone who claims to be an 'expert' at something is by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definition expert in the state of knowledge up to that point. The 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; expert's judgement is based on the past. The expert's judgement is based 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on what IS rather than what CAN BE. The expert is always being asked for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; expert opinions. The expert cannot risk his or her reputation. So the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; expert does need to stay on the side of caution. Better to say that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something cannot be done, rather than to say that it can be done and to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be responsible for some mistake. Experts are the guardians of the past 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and people expect them to be so. They are like priests of knowledge. A 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so-called 'expert' in QM has been telling me for ages how stupid all of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you people are for imagining that MWI makes any sense. He laughs like a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; drain when I describe to him Bruno's teleportation gedanken experiment. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; He simply 'knows' that it is all fancy make-believe and that we are all 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; engaged in some kind of new-age nonsense here. He is highly educated and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; highly respected as a teacher. Experts (specialists) once declared that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for a rocket to get to the moon it would have to weigh a million tons. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Experts once calculated that the total world market for computers would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be just eight computers. These particular experts worked for the Xerox 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; corporation. We all know what happened to Xerox in a fast-changing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world. Experts once declared that the telephone was nothing more than an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; electronic toy. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; These days, everybody can stake out their field and research whatever 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they want. Life, however, is increasingly demanding that we all 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; specialise a little bit in many areas. As Bruno says, his own field of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thought is on the cusp of math, biology, psychology, theology, physics, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logic, computer science etc. Descartes said that it would be best to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; teach all the sciences as one. Increasingly, the Internet is the EXPERT 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and we are the fuzzy, creative innovators who design new fields of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; endeavour with our vast realms of knowledge. A kind of emergence 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; phenomenon, if you will.
