<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK. You know I like your little book as an introduction to the field, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but, as you have already acknowledge, there is some lack in rigor in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it, and it is not even clear if eventually you are of the ASSA type or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; RSSA type, or if you accept comp or not. Use of Bayes and Prior, for 
</em><br />
<br />I am clearly on the record, both in the book and also in the list
<br />
archives as an &quot;RSSA type&quot;.
<br />
<br />As far as comp is concerned, I do not assume it, but accept it as a
<br />
model of what's going on. See page 79 of my book.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; example, is a symptom of ASSA type reasoning. Distinction between 1 and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3 person points of view is symptom of the RSSA type of reasoning, (and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; favored with comp).
</em><br />
<br />Not if the prior were actually given by the observer erself. This is
<br />
the main point of departure between Schmidhuber's and my approach.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Not equivalent. Equivalent status. Assumption of the set of all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; infinite strings plays the same role as your assumption of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; arithmetical realism, and that is of the ontological background.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't know. Let us fix a simple alphabet: {0, 1}. Then an infinite 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; string like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    111101000100111000000010100101100001101001 ..... (infinite on the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; right) can be seen as the chracteristic function of a subset of N (the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; first 1 in the string means then that 0 is in the set,, the second one 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that 1 is in the set etc. The resulting set is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 12, 13, 14, 22, 24, 27, 29, 34, 35, 37, 40, ...}
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So there is a bijection between the set of infinite strings on the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; {0,1} alphabet, and the subset of N. So without putting any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; extra-stcruture on the set of infinite strings, you could as well have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; taken as basic in your ontology the set of subset of N, written  P(N). 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, such a set is not even nameable in any first order theory. In a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; first order theory of those strings you will get something equivalent 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to Tarski theory of Real: very nice but below the turing world: the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory is complete and decidable and cannot be used for a theory of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everything (there is no natural numbers definable in such theories). 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  From this I can deduce that your intuition relies on second order 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arithmetic or analysis (and this is confirmed by the way you introduce 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time). But then this again is really a strong assumption, far stronger 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than arithmetical realism.
</em><br />
<br />Stronger in what sense? I have only assumed just enough to make sense
<br />
of the notion of complexity.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; To be sure, I still don't know if your ontic base is just &quot;nothing&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (but then in which theory?) or the infinite strings (again, in which 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory and as I said you will to use rich mathematics for that), etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As you know, I am trying to go a little beyond the UDA result so as to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; give a little smell of the real thing. The trouble is that the basic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tools of logic and axiomatic are not very well known by anybody but the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; professional logicians.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />Its not so much that, but in how you interpret the logical
<br />
results. Calling G*/G an angel for instance might be colourful
<br />
rhetoric, but it doesn't really mean much to me.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It might seem like such uncountable sets are too much to assume, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in fact it is the simplest possible object. It has precisely zero
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; information.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Zero information. Zero justification. Occam razor ... I do agree with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; these major motivations for the everything idea, but I disagree with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the proposition saying that the the set of strings needs 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; zero-information. Why not the infinite strings on both right and left 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (coding the integers), or infinite many-dimensional lattices fit with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; zero and one on the vertex, or etc. ?
</em><br />
<br />Information theory is defined on one-sided strings. It would be
<br />
possible to redefine complexity to use two-sided strings, or subsets
<br />
of N, or real numbers, but you just end up with an isometric theory,
<br />
it wouldn't be saying anything different/
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is just a lack of enough precise definition so as to verify your 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; statements that strings needs zero-information, and as I say above, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from some standard and traditional view points, infinite strings needs 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a lot of information to be define.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; No countable set has this property.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />For finite sets, one has the objection - why that finite number? For
<br />
infinite countable sets, can one even define a measure?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I put your objection
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; into the same category as those who claim the multiverse is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ontologically profligate. Apologies to intuistionists out there.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Apologies to intutionists and also to constructivist like Schmidhuber, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but also to weak arithmetical platonist like, imo, digital mechanist 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ought to be.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Obviously I'm departing from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Schmidhuber at that point, and whilst in &quot;Why Occam's Razor&quot; I use 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; term Schmidhuber ensemble to refer to this, in my book I distinguish
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; between Schmidhuber's Great Programmer idea
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; (which you confuse some time with the UD, I think).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; He does actually dovetail,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We have discuss this. In the first paper the &quot;great programmer&quot; is not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a dovetailer, and indeed there is nothing in the ASSA approach for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which dovetailing could play a role.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />No the great programmer writes and runs a dovetailer on er great computer.
<br />
<br />I missed the dovetailer on my first reading, as indeed it doesn't seem
<br />
too important. I suspect the Scvmidhuber intended the dovetailer to
<br />
&quot;breathe fire&quot; into the ensemble.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; so it is a universal dovetailer in all but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; name perhaps. But the ontological basis of the &quot;Great Programmer&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; differs very much from COMP.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Again this is not corect. Schmidhuber and me do agree on comp (100% 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; agreement: we have the same hypothesis). 
</em><br />
<br />I'm not sure that Schmidhuber accepts arithmetical realism. His
<br />
ontology is that the great programmer exists, whatever e may be. The
<br />
GP is not necessarily a machine, or an arithmetical formula.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And relatively to the comp hyp 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and the importance of the universal machine Schmidhuber and me are much 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; closer than with Tegmark whi is just very naïve about notion of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical reality. Now the problem is that, unlike many people in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this list, Schmidhuber does not address neither the mind body problem 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nor the 1-3 person distiinction, and the relativity of states which 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; derives from that distinction. This forces him to literally defend the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; idea that randomness in nature never really exist, which is hard to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; justify in front of the physical branch of history we are living. This 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does not makes his work wrong, but at least incomplete (and then he 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should use Bennett notion of depth for the cosmological/geographical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aspect (like I do in Conscience et mécanisme: using just Kolmogorov is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not enough, but here I am going out topic.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Of course, although you'd better say the Standish ensemble so as not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to misattribute it to Bertie. Also, it is quite clearly a set (I think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; you've read enough English papers to know the difference between and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ensemble and a set in English, I hope?)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, I hope you are not referring to the notion of &quot;ensemble&quot; as it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; occurs in physical statistics. 
</em><br />
<br />Not at all! Ensemble is usually used in mathematical terms to refer to
<br />
a collection that need not satisfy set axioms.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Again, this would mean that you endow 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the space of infinite strings with a structure of a measure space 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (boolean sigma-algebra, for example). because this means that your 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; basic ontology is much richer than just the strings. I am trying to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand a bit more clearly how you view of the everything thing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; All of these concepts are more precise and have additional properties
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; to the set of all infinite strings. For instance, the reals have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; group properties of addition and multiplication that the strings
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; don't.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; But as sets, they are isomorphic, and if you don't have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; extra-structure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; on your &quot;ensemble&quot;, the relation between your &quot;observers&quot; and your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;ensemble&quot;  is even more obscure, it seems to me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You've lost me here.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm the one saying that I'm lost here. I am just asking: how do you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; define &quot;observer&quot; in the infinite strings setting. (Actually with or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; without extra-strcuture, like what you need to have a measure space).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />I don't define the observer at all! If I knew enough to define this,
<br />
I'd probably be very rich. I merely postulate what I need, and
<br />
hopefully the postulates are reasonable.
<br />
<br />For the Occam's razor (and White rabbit argument), the observer
<br />
defines a map O from the set of strings (descriptions, things which
<br />
are observed) to concepts, or interpretations (results of
<br />
observations). This latter set is assume discrete, and can therefore be
<br />
indexed by N, so we can consider O: {0,1}^\infty-&gt;N.
<br />
<br />The requirement that the measure of O^{-1}(n) be non-zero is needed
<br />
for the dewabbiting. It also ensures a positive complexity value for concepts.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; So here you do explicitly accept extra-structure, a measure, on your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; ensemble, making them again quite close to the reals.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; You cannot derive the existence of a measure from just a definition of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; a set. (There are *many* possible measures on any set).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Yes of course. The uniform measure has always been part of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; definition.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This was not clear, sorry. Now you definitely need analysis or second 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; order arithmetic. This is everything but nothing!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />It sounds like we have a different idea of &quot;nothingness&quot;. I call the
<br />
all-strings ensemble &quot;nothing&quot; as a rhetorical device to stress how
<br />
wrong the &quot;metaphysical profligates&quot; are.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; see Li &amp; Vitanyi example 4.2.1 for a detailed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; discussion. The idea is simple enough, however.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; ... where they describe how to put a measure on some set of *subsets*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; of an uncountable sets. You have to define a Borel structure on it,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; It is indeed explained in Li &amp; Vitanyi (page 214q).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; We must have different editions. On mine its page 243 :). So there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; must be some non-measurable subsets.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is not even provable in formal set theory like ZF (Zermelo 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Fraenkel). You need the axiom of choice, if I remember well. This means 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you presuppose set theory (a vastly bigger and richer ontology than 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arithmetic).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />It strikes me as unimportant if these sets exist or not. But I could
<br />
be wrong - sometimes corner cases are very important.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But I fail to see how these can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; be inverse images of an observers interpretation (O^{-1}(n)) must be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; measurable). But then I admit I am acting like a physicist in glossing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; over these sorts of details.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would not have dare to call you a physicist, but now that you admit 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you are acting a bit like them, I can understand better :)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />OK - I thought you'd appreciate the reference :)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Since this appears to be the point of departure between you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; and he, I'll state that I've always followed you in this point, that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; the 1st person pov (what I call the semantic level) is important.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; OK. But again it could be misleading to call that &quot;the semantic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; level&quot;,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; because a relation between &quot;semantic&quot; and first person would be a very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; interesting things to dig on, but nobody has done that yet.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; All hypostases (first person, third person, first person plural, etc.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; have syntax and semantics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Yes but again we're mixing terminologies. When I refer to syntactic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; level, I'm refer to what stuff is,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You can do that. I see the point. But it is not standard at all and has 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to be explained in all detail, especially if you are not clear if you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; follow comp or not. Even with comp this is highly ambiguous.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and when I refer to semantic level,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I mean how it is interpreted.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is even less standard, and although I could put sense on it, this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is only because I have tools for doing that. A term like 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;interpretation&quot; can be seen as syntactical at some level and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; semantical at some other level.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This can be applied to all situations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; where emergence is occurring.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I knwo a lot of people who are searching their gun when they hear the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; word &quot;emergence&quot;.  I mean this is a word which can be used once you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; take many precautions. Also, if comp is correct, as you know, it is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter (stuff) which emerges from consciousness/meaning (cf the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reversal result).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />Sure there is a lot of confusion on the subject of emergence, so it is
<br />
not surprising if there are people &quot;reaching for the gun&quot; when hearing
<br />
the term. However, the term actually is quite well defined, and the
<br />
way I use it is pretty consistent with what other recent thinkers have
<br />
written, such as Bedau, or Ronald, or Fromm.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; So in the case of an ideal gas, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; molecular description is syntactic, and its thermodynamic description
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is semantic.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hmmm....  I cannot really accept this. Here is a case where emergence 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is far better than semantics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />I'm not sure what this has to do with &quot;semantics&quot;, but everything to
<br />
do with emergence. Semantic means &quot;meaning&quot;. The &quot;semantic layer&quot; is
<br />
the descriptive layer that means something to the observer. The
<br />
&quot;syntactic layer&quot; is typically what the system is specified on
<br />
(although it need not be). The terms are my invention, but really of
<br />
the other terms I've across, microscopic/macroscopic will not do, as
<br />
it often doesn't relate to size, and L_1/L_2 (This is Ronald, Sipper
<br />
and Capcarre's term) - I mean WTF?
<br />
<br />I have actually read quite a lot of literature on the subject, and
<br />
there aren't any accepted terms for describing the levels of
<br />
description in emergence. I'm trying to propose the semantic/syntactic
<br />
level labels, but you know its a market of ideas out there.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Another point where your fuzziness does not help is that you are not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; clear on the comp hyp. 
</em><br />
<br />I never assume the comp hyp. I believe comp is consistent with what
<br />
I've developed, and note that you can pretty much get the consequences
<br />
of the UDA from a more general functionalist position.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Schmidhuber is clear on comp, even if he has 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; disagreed when discussing online in the list with the consequences I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; derive from it. But the disagreement comes not from what comp means, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but from the 1/3 distinction, which Schmidhuber does not consider. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Tegmark does introduce an embryo of 1/3 distinction (but quite 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different from mines (see below)), but Tegmark still uses some identity 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thesis implicitly for making observer belonging to universe, and minds 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to brain. Such identities have just no meaning at all once you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; postulate the comp hyp (or even strong weakening of it btw). OK? (by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; UDA). Yes?
</em><br />
<br />Yes, but there is still some reason tying the observer to the
<br />
universe. Otherwise you get the Occam catastrophe. (again my term, and
<br />
others have called it differently) I do not know what that reason is,
<br />
but suspect self-awareness has something to do with it.
