Hi Abram,

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I know just a little about the curry-howard isomorphism... I looked

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; into it somewhat, because I was thinking about the possibility of

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; representing programs as proof methods (so that a single run of the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; program would correspond to a proof about the relationship between the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; input and the output). But, it seems that the curry-howard
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relationship between programs and proofs is much different than what I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was thinking of.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Let me give the shorter and simple example. Do you know the  
<br />
combinators?  I have explained some time ago on this list that you can  
<br />
code all programs in the SK combinator language. The alphabet of the  
<br />
language is &quot;(&quot;, &quot;)&quot;, K S. Variables and equality sign &quot;=&quot; are used at  
<br />
the metalevel and does not appear in the program language.
<br />
<br />The syntax is given by the (meta)definition:
<br />
<br />K is a combinator
<br />
S is a combinator
<br />
if x and y are combinators then (x y) is a combinator.
<br />
<br />The idea is that all combinators represent a function of one argument,  
<br />
from the set of all combinators in the set of all combinators, and ( x  
<br />
y) represents the result of applying x to y. To increase readability  
<br />
the left parenthesis are not written, so ab(cd)e is put for ((((a b)  
<br />
(c d)) e)
<br />
<br />So example of combinators are: K, S, KK, KS, SK, SS, KKK, K(KK),   
<br />
etc.    Remember that KKK is ((KK)K).
<br />
<br />The (meta)axioms (or the scheme of axioms, with x and y being any  
<br />
combinators) are
<br />
<br />Kxy = x
<br />
Sxyz = xz(yz)
<br />
<br />If you give not the &quot;right&quot; number of argument, the combinators give  
<br />
the starting expression (automated currying): so SK gives SK, for  
<br />
example. But KKK gives K, and SKSK gives KK(SK) which gives K. OK?
<br />
<br />The inference rule of the system are simply the equality rule: from x  
<br />
= y you can deduce y = x, and from x = y and y = z you can deduce x =  
<br />
z, together with: from x = y you can deduce xz = yz, and, from x = y  
<br />
you can deduce zx = zy.
<br />
<br />This gives already a very powerful theory in which you can prove all  
<br />
Sigma_sentences (or equivalent). It defines a universal dovetailer,  
<br />
and adding some induction axioms gives a theory at least as powerful  
<br />
as Peano Arithmetic.
<br />
<br />See my Elsevier paper Theoretical computer science and the natural  
<br />
sciences
<br />
for a bit more. Or see
<br />
<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/everything-list.domain.name.hidden/msg05920.html">http://www.mail-archive.com/everything-list.domain.name.hidden/msg05920.html</a> 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;and around.
<br />
<br />The Curry Howard isomorphism arrives when you introduce types on the  
<br />
combinators. Imagine that x is of type a and y is of type b, so that
<br />
a combinator which would transform x into y would be of type a -&gt; b.
<br />
<br />What is the type of K? (assuming again that x if of type a and y is of  
<br />
type b). You see that Kx on y gives x, so K take an object of type a,  
<br />
(x), and transforms it into an object (Kx) which transform y in x, so  
<br />
K takes an object of type a, and transform it into an object of type  
<br />
(b -&gt; a), so K is of type
<br />
<br />a -&gt; (b -&gt; a)
<br />
<br />And you recognize the &quot;well known&quot; a fortiori axioms of classical (and  
<br />
intuitionistic) logic. If you proceed in the same way for S, you will  
<br />
see that S is of type
<br />
<br />(a -&gt; (b -&gt; c)) -&gt; ((a -&gt; b) -&gt; (a -&gt; c))
<br />
<br />And you recognize the arrow transitivity axiom, again a classical  
<br />
logic tautology (and a well accepted intuistionistic formula). So you  
<br />
see that typing combinators gives propositional formula. But something  
<br />
else happens: if you take a combinator, for example the simplest one,  
<br />
I, which compute the identity function Ix = x. It is not to difficult  
<br />
to &quot;program&quot; I with S and K, you will find SKK (SKKx = Kx(Kx) = x).  
<br />
Now the step which leads to the program SKK, when typed, will give the  
<br />
(usual) proof of the tautology a -&gt; a from the a fortiori axiom and  
<br />
the transitivity axiom. The rules works very well for intuitionistic  
<br />
logic associating type to logical formula, and proof to programs. The  
<br />
application rule of combinators correspond to the modus ponens rule,  
<br />
and the deduction theorem correspond to lambda abstraction. It leads  
<br />
thus to a non trivial and unexpected isomorphism between programming  
<br />
and proving.
<br />
For a long time this isomorphism was thought applying only to  
<br />
intuitionistic logic, but today we know it extends on the whole of  
<br />
classical logic and classical theories like set theory. Typical  
<br />
classical rule like Pierce axioms ((a -&gt; b) -&gt; a) -&gt; a) gives try- 
<br />
catch error handling procedure, and Krivine seems to think that  
<br />
Gödel's theorem leads to decompiler (but this I do not yet  
<br />
understand!). This gives constructive or partially constructive  
<br />
interpretation of logical formula and theorems, and this is a rather  
<br />
amazing facts.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In the end, I don't really see any *use* to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; curry-howard isomorphism!
</em><br />
<br />I thought a long time that it can be used only in program  
<br />
specification and verification analysis in conventional programming,  
<br />
but the fact that the CH iso extends to classical logic forces me to  
<br />
revise my opinion. Krivine seems to believe it transforms the field of  
<br />
logic into a study of the brain as a decompiler or desassembler of  
<br />
platonia (to be short). And I think he could be near a deep discovery.  
<br />
I am searching the CH for the modal logics, but I get trapped in  
<br />
technical difficulties, and l am not sufficiently familiar with the  
<br />
notion of typing, in general.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sure, the correspondence is interesting, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what can we do with it? Perhaps you can answer this.
</em><br />
<br />The interest relies in the fact that the CH links two things which  
<br />
were studied by different logicians with different tools, in different  
<br />
ivory towesr, and now we know it is the same thing, basically. It is  
<br />
like in the Strings Theories, or in the link between knots and quantum  
<br />
computation. It is too much amazing for not having some significance,  
<br />
even if applications are not directly obvious (apart from program  
<br />
specification proving and verifying).
<br />
<br />CH with combinators links Hilbertian logic and programs. CH with  
<br />
lambda terms links natural deduction system and programs. I think CH  
<br />
links sequent calculus and category theory. In the whole CH links  
<br />
logic with computation theory.
<br />
<br />I hope this could open your logical appetite,
<br />
<br />Bruno
