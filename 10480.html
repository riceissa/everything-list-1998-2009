<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Again we are discussing the arithmetical realism (which I just 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; assume).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A bold assumption, if I may say so.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Frankly I don't think so. Set platonism can be considered as a bold 
<br />
assumption, but number platonism, as I said you need a sophisticated 
<br />
form of finitism to doubt it. I recall it is just the belief that the 
<br />
propositions of elementary arithmetic are independent of you. Do you 
<br />
sincerley belief that 37 could be a non prime number? Or that the 
<br />
square root of 2 can equal to a ratio of two integers?
<br />
Or that if you run a program fortran it could neither stop nor not 
<br />
stop?  (When all the default assumption are on, to evacuate contingent 
<br />
stopping of a machine implemented in some deep story)?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But my exploration into cognitive neuroscience has exposed to me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; how mathematical thinking comes about, and that it is indeed not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; separable from our human brains.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I have not yet seen a book on human brain which does not presuppose the 
<br />
understanding of the natural numbers. Note just for using the index, 
<br />
but in the neuronal explanation themselves, implicitly or explicitly.
<br />
Eventually with comp the brain itself appears as a construct of the 
<br />
mind. The mathematical mind of the &quot;Lobian&quot; machines. Those are the 
<br />
self-referentially correct universal (sufficiently chatty) machines.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Numbers are symbols we create in our minds to communicate with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fellow individuals about things of importance to us.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Numbers are not symbol. Symbols can be used to talk about numbers, but 
<br />
they should not be confused with numbers.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; To paraphrase Descartes very liberally:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We group, therefore we can count.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Our act of arbitrary grouping (made a bit less arbitrary by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evolution, which makes us group things which are good to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our survival, like gazelles and spears or berries) let's us
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; count and communicate the number.
</em><br />
<br /><br />The notion of &quot;same number&quot; seems to have occur much before we 
<br />
discovered counting. Farmers have most probably learn to compare the 
<br />
size of the herds of sheep without counting, just by associating each 
<br />
sheep from one herd to the another. But this as nothing to do with the 
<br />
fact that sheeps were &quot;countable&quot; before humans learn to count it.
<br />
Humans and brains learn to count countable things because they are 
<br />
countable.
<br />
I think you are confusing the subject or object of math, and the human 
<br />
mathematical theories, which are just lantern putting a tiny light on 
<br />
the subject.
<br />
<br />If numbers and their math was really invented, why should 
<br />
mathematicians hide some results, like Pythagoras with the 
<br />
irrationality of the square root of two, ... As David Deutsch says: 
<br />
math kicks back.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; For the universe &quot;one apple&quot; may not exist, because in effect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there are only quarks interacting. And at this level indeterminacy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; strikes mercilessly, making it all but meaningless to count quarks.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You will not find a book explaining that &quot;meaninglessness&quot; without 
<br />
taking for granted the idea of counting at the start.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Also, concepts like infinity are most definitely not universal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concepts &quot;out there&quot;, but products of our mind.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I doubt any mind could ever produce infinity.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course, symbolisms are arbitrary, but physical instantiation makes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all the difference.
</em><br />
<br /><br />(note that my goal consists in explaining &quot;physical instantiation&quot; 
<br />
without using &quot;physical things&quot; at all. My point is that if we 
<br />
postulate comp, then we have to do this).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Note that if you understand the whole UDA,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Unfortunately, not yet, but I'm reading!
</em><br />
<br /><br />Ah, ok. UDA mainly shows that the mind-body problem is two times more 
<br />
difficult than most materialist are thinking. Indeed, with comp, matter 
<br />
can no more be explained by postulating a physical world. I let you 
<br />
discover that, and feel free to ask questions if you have a problem 
<br />
with UDA.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; you should realize that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; price of assuming a physical universe (and wanting it to be related
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; with our experiences *and* our experiments) is to postulate that you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (and us, if you are not solipsistic) are not turing emulable. No
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; problem.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why is that so? Could you clarify this issue?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />It is really the point of the UDA. It shows that computationalism (the 
<br />
idea that I am a digitalizable machine) is incompatible with &quot;weak 
<br />
materialism&quot; (the idea that there is a primary stuff or matter or 
<br />
aristotelian substances).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Absolutely. But I think we have to start with our assumptions and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; try to scrutinize them very carefully. After all, we want to devote
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our minds to problems arising out of them during our lives, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thus the initial choice should not be made rashly, but only after
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; careful review of our current body of knowledge.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />OK, but don't forget that here the idea is also to get some 
<br />
contradiction from hypotheses, so as to abandon them.
<br />
But until now, comp leads only to weirdness, not contradiction. And 
<br />
then that weirdness seems to explain the quantum weirdness ... 
<br />
Intuitively and qualitatively (already by UDA), and then technically 
<br />
through the interview of some universal turing machine.
<br />
