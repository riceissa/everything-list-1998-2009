Hello,
<br />
I'm new in here. I apologize in advance for any
<br />
inadvertent transgressions...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;     Second, there is no way of knowing whether
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you are in a so called 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;&quot;real world&quot; or in a &quot;virtual world&quot;.  So if I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't care about &quot;virtual&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;people, I don't even know whether or not I care
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about myself.  That doesn't 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;seem reasonable to me.
</em><br />
<br />I'd argue, all worlds are just as real, or unreal as
<br />
you make them. Finding a common context as some
<br />
mechanism to validate truth seems naive. One can only
<br />
apply truth to issues in the context to be evaluated.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Soon we may have AIs or uploaded human minds (i.e.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; human minds scanned and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;then simulated in computers). It seems to me that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; those who don't care 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;about simulated thoughts would have an advantage in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exploiting these beings 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;more effectively. I'm not saying that is a good
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thing, of course.
</em><br />
I enjoyed considering this possibility. It sounds a
<br />
lot like freedom.
<br />
<br />My current understanding tells me that there is much
<br />
more to mind than just logic and reasoning power. The
<br />
power of the intellect is the ability to transcend the
<br />
chaos of undisciplined thought and feeling. It's
<br />
downfall is it's declaration of absolutism, that it
<br />
stands as the pinnacle of understanding. The problem I
<br />
find is that the intellect developed in this world,
<br />
only knows *this world*. Some would argue that there
<br />
is no other world. I'd argue it's the intellect
<br />
defining it self in terms of the *apparent* world, and
<br />
religiously maintaining the faith, less it find it's
<br />
own demise.
<br />
<br />A truly powerful mind (imo) is one that quickly adapts
<br />
to any rules found in any context it operates in.
<br />
Clinging to one realm and making it the center of the
<br />
universe sounds a lot like religion to me.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     You're assuming that the AIs couldn't fight
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; back.  With technology 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; improving, they might be exploiting us soon.
</em><br />
<br />I do a lot of conceptual work in ai. I find without
<br />
purpose, an entity is one step closer to conceptual
<br />
death. An ai knowing enough to know it wants to
<br />
exploit probably isn't burdened by the chaotic
<br />
thinking humans are plaqued with. It is more likely
<br />
ai's achieving this level of cognition and
<br />
consciousness, will seek to cooperate. They would want
<br />
to achieve things they would recognize that only
<br />
humans act as a catalyst for. One scenario is that
<br />
ai's might have less consciousness than just
<br />
described, and that they operated in competition, not
<br />
conscious of what they are actually doing. I think
<br />
this is possible on a small scale, but would not
<br />
continue very far. Insects are in effect, small
<br />
machines without much in the way of consciousness.
<br />
Aside from the occasional plaque or locust swarm, we
<br />
don't worry about them too much.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Do you think that, 150 years ago, white people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; who didn't care about 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; blacks had an evolutionary advantage?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;I also value knowledge as an end in itself, but the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problems is how do you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;know what is true knowledge? If you don't judge
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; knowledge by how effective 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;it is in directing your actions, what do you judge
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it by,
</em><br />
<br />I think this is an issue of consciousness. One may
<br />
operate with knowledge on a small scale. They find
<br />
harmony in there lives by keeping things simple. There
<br />
are those that develop skills in applying vast amount
<br />
of knowledge to complicated problems. You might ask:
<br />
which is better? I think it depends on what a person
<br />
wants out of life. To judge something, I think,
<br />
requires a contextual awareness. What applies for one
<br />
might not apply for another. In science, we maintain a
<br />
rigid form of thinking to in effect, keep from
<br />
deluding ourselves. It also applies as a language that
<br />
spans over anyone who would join and uphold the
<br />
principles of science (scientific method, etc). But
<br />
again, the validity and applicability of the knowledge
<br />
gained in this club depends on the context it is
<br />
applied to. A scientist might say: This drug will
<br />
improve your life. The farmer or other simple person
<br />
might say: I don't care. The scientist might see
<br />
statistics that say: These people are dieing
<br />
needlessly. The simple person might say: That's life.
<br />
You might make a limited scientist out of a given
<br />
simple person, making them see your view point. But
<br />
have you improved their life? Have you made them see?
<br />
Or have you just blinded them.
<br />
<br />Robert W.
