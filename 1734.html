<br />
For sake of easyness in further references  I put here the Universal
<br />
Dovetailer Argument (UDA) I have sent to Russell (and to the list) some
<br />
weeks ago. I add the solution/comment to one of the exercice. 
<br />
I have made some minor corrections.
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Universal Dovetailer Argument.  (UDA)
<br />
<br /><br />UDA is a proof that:  COMP entails REVERSAL physics/psychology.
<br />
<br />The reversal will be be epistemological: the branch &quot;physics&quot;
<br />
will be a branch of machine's psychology, and ontological: matter 
<br />
will emerge from consciousness, in some sense, hopefully clearer
<br />
after reading the proof.
<br />
<br />Indeed such a reversal will change the meaning of term
<br />
like &quot;psychology&quot; and &quot;physics&quot; and the meaning is given ultimately
<br />
by the proof itself. By 'proof' here, I mean argument which either
<br />
should convince you, which means you are the only judge (no
<br />
authoritative argument) or you should find an error, a weakness... 
<br />
Of course if you belief that the REVERSAL
<br />
is an absurdity, you are free to interpret the proof as a
<br />
refutation of COMP (like Gilles Henri). 
<br />
<br />To make my reasoning independant of the debate between internalist
<br />
and externalist in philosophy of mind I introduce the concept of
<br />
generalised brain. By definition someone's generalized brain is
<br />
the portion of the universe (if that exists) which is necessary 
<br />
to emulate its consciousness. Put in another way, if the environment
<br />
play a direct role in consciousness (like the externalist philosopher of
<br />
mind argue for), put the needed part of thet environment in the
<br />
brain.
<br />
<br /><br />COMP is the hypothesis that there is a level such that I 
<br />
survive a digital functional substitution of my generalised body/brain 
<br />
(see above)
<br />
made at that level, + Church Thesis (CT: digital = turing) + Arithmetical
<br />
Platonism (AR: the belief that arithmetical propositions obeys
<br />
classical logic, and this independently of my own cognitive ability).
<br />
<br />To sum up: COMP = \exists n SURV-SUBST(n)    + CT   + AR
<br />
<br />Note also that I'm assuming a minimal amount of folk psychology (FOLK)
<br />
without which such an enterprise would be meaningless. It is the
<br />
minimal amount of psychology to understand that you or someone else
<br />
could, in some situation, accept an artificial-digital brain graft,
<br />
and to understand the intuitive difference between first and third
<br />
person. (See below).
<br />
<br />(the modal 'chapter 5' of my thesis can be interpreted as an
<br />
attempt (at least) to eliminate FOLK by substituting it by the
<br />
godelian provability logics and its thaetetical variants). 
<br />
But the real goal of the  chapter 5 is to make the derivation of 
<br />
physics real and concrete.
<br />
<br />Note also that it is the AR part of COMP which will makes COMP an
<br />
everything type of theory (explicitely so with the UD). This makes
<br />
'my' COMP assumption equivalent to Schmidhuber's one.
<br />
<br />To make the reasoning easy I introduce supplementary hypotheses.
<br />
I will eliminate these hypotheses in due course.
<br />
<br />a) NEURO: The neurophysiologist hypothesis. This is a supposition that
<br />
the level of substitution is high, or that my generalised brain is
<br />
my biological brain (the one in my skull) relevantly described at the
<br />
molecular level (let us say).
<br />
<br />b) CU: there is a Concrete Universe, whatever it is. This is need
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the decor.
<br />
<br />c) CUD: there is a Concrete running of a UD in the concrete universe.
<br />
<br />d) 3-locality: computations are locally implementable in the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;concrete universe. That is it is possible to separate two 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;implementations of two computations in such a way that the result
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of one of these computations will not interfere with the result
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the other one. Computations can be independent.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More generally the result of a computation is independant of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any event occuring a long way (out of the light cone) from that
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;computation.
<br />
<br />e) Conceptual OCCAM razor. I will not insist. That should be easy
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for many-worlder. The movie-graph argument in my thesis is really
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an elimination of occam razor. See also Maudlin's paper.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We talk about that in the discussion list (key word: Maudlin,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;graph, movie, crackpot).
<br />
<br /><br />The proof. (in 15 steps).
<br />
<br />1) By COMP and NEURO you survive with an artificial digital (turing
<br />
emulable, with TC) brain. OK?  (CU is used implicitely).
<br />
<br />2) By COMP and NEURO you survive classical teleportation. This 
<br />
follows from 1) where the building (reconstitution) of the brain is
<br />
done a long way from the 'reading device' and the annihilation of the
<br />
original body. (CU is used implicitely).
<br />
<br />3) By COMP and NEURO (and implicitely CU, I will not mention it again)
<br />
you survive teleportation with a delay. After the annihilation, your
<br />
body and brain description is keep intact during one year, and then you
<br />
are reconstituted. An important point is that you (from your first 
<br />
person point of view) will not see the difference with the simple
<br />
teleportation case (case 2). But an exterior observator (third person)
<br />
will see the difference. Indeed for him the delayed teleportation 
<br />
last one year.
<br />
<br />4) You are teleported from the center of the galaxy to its border.
<br />
At the opposite border a star explodes. This changes nothing: you still
<br />
survive. This follows easily from 3-locality.
<br />
<br />5) You are teleported from the center of the galaxy to its border.
<br />
At the opposite border you are reconstituted. (For exemple the scanned
<br />
information has been send in opposite direction from the center of 
<br />
the galaxy, and reconstituting machines has been put on the edge of
<br />
the galaxy). You still survive, by COMP and 3-locality.
<br />
<br />6) You are duplicable. (Direct consequence of 5). More precisely:
<br />
You are 3-duplicable. And the first person doesn't *feel the split*
<br />
<br />7) Although your surviving does not depend on the faraway events,
<br />
from the first person perspective the event &quot;I survive at the
<br />
left edge (let us say) of the galaxy&quot; could depend on the faraway
<br />
other reconstitution. The duplicability entails first person
<br />
indeterminisme, although everything is determinate for a third
<br />
person. (It is really the computationalist 3-determinateness 
<br />
which entails the computationalist 1-indeterminateness).
<br />
<br />(exercise: show that the duplicability entails the unprovability
<br />
of COMP. Hint: consider teleportation without annihilation of the
<br />
original, with a delay, applied to a non-computationalist)
<br />
<br />8) You are 'read' and annihilated in Brussels and the information
<br />
is send to Washington and Moscow. You are reconstituted at Washington
<br />
and the information is keep intact at Moscow during one year. Then
<br />
you are reconstituted at Moscow. (Duplication with assymmetric
<br />
delay). The point is the following: whatever the way you choose for
<br />
quantifying the 1-indeterminisme in the symmetric duplication, you
<br />
must quantifify in the same manner the assymmetric duplication.
<br />
This follows from COMP and 3. The first person cannot be aware of
<br />
the delays.
<br />
<br />9) There is also a form of 1-non-locality. Although your surviving
<br />
does not depend on faraway events, your expectation of personal
<br />
experience does depend on faraway events. Here also, it is the
<br />
strict 3-locality which entail the 1-non-locality.
<br />
<br />10) Here is an old argument you can find in all idealist school
<br />
of thought (Hindouist, Budhist, Platon, Descartes, Berkeley, etc.)
<br />
It is based on the notion of dream, but today it is more easy
<br />
(especially with COMP)
<br />
to convey it with the notion of virtual reality. The point is:
<br />
For any neigborhood and any time interval, you can build a computing
<br />
machine simulating  that &quot;space-time&quot; at such a level that a first 
<br />
person will not be able to see any difference. 
<br />
(The computing machine preserves the relevant counterfactuals).
<br />
Roughly speaking a first person cannot
<br />
distinguish 'real neigborhood' with virtual (digitally simulated)
<br />
neighborhood (for all level 'below' its own substitution level).
<br />
<br />11) To sum up: the way you quantify the indeterminisme is independent
<br />
of the time, the place and the nature (real/virtual) of the
<br />
reconstitution.
<br />
<br />Note: the indeterminism is pure 1-indeterminism. Nevertheless, by
<br />
duplicating entire population, the indeterminism can be made
<br />
third person 'verifiable' inside each multiplied population. This
<br />
leads to what I call first person of the plural indeterminism. 
<br />
(I would like to know a better english expression for that!).
<br />
<br />12) A Universal Dovetailer exists. (Extraordinary consequence of
<br />
Church thesis and Arithmetical Realism). The UD simulates all 
<br />
possible digital devices in a quasi-parallel manner).
<br />
<br />(Adding a line in the code of any UD, and you get a quasi-
<br />
computation of its Chaitin \Omega number).
<br />
<br />13) So let us assume CU and CUD, that is let us assume explicitely
<br />
there is a concrete universe and a concrete running of a UD in it.
<br />
This need a sort of steady state universe or an infinitely expanding
<br />
universe to run the complete infinite UD.
<br />
Suppose you let a pen falls. You want predict what will happen.
<br />
Let us suppose your brain is in state S at the beginning of the 
<br />
experiment. The concrete UD will go to that state infinitely often
<br />
and compute all sort of computational continuations. This is 
<br />
equivalent to reconstitutions. It follows from 11 that your 
<br />
expectation are undetermined, and the domain of the indeterminism
<br />
is given by the (infinite) set of reconstitutions. To predict,
<br />
with COMP, what will happen you must take into account all
<br />
possible histories going through the state S of your brain. 
<br />
And here clearly the NEURO hypothesis is not used. Even if your
<br />
real brain state is the state of the actual concrete universe, 
<br />
with COMP that state will be generated (infinitely often) by the 
<br />
UD. Same reasoning if your brain state is the quantum state of
<br />
the universe, so the reasoning works even if the brain is a
<br />
non local quantum object (if that exists). So the physics is
<br />
determined by the collection of your computational continuations
<br />
relatively to your first person actual state.
<br />
<br />14) If 'that' physics is different from the traditional empirical
<br />
physics, then you refute COMP. But with COMP you will not refute
<br />
COMP, isn't it? So with COMP you will derive the laws of physics,
<br />
i.e. invariant and similarities in the 'average' continuations of
<br />
yourself (defining the measure on the computationnal continuations).
<br />
<br />Exercice: why should we search a measure on the computational
<br />
continuations and not just the computational states? Hint: with
<br />
just the computational states only, COMP predicts white noise for
<br />
all experiences. (ok Chris ?). With the continuations, a priori 
<br />
we must just hunt away the 'white rabbit' continuations. 
<br />
You can also show that Schmidhuber's 'universal prior' solution 
<br />
&nbsp;works only in the case the level of substitution
<br />
is so low that my generalised brain is the entire multiverse.
<br />
(see below).
<br />
<br />15) Once you explain why arithmetical machines are statistically right 
<br />
to believe in physical laws without any real universe, such a real 
<br />
universe is redundant.
<br />
By Arithmetical Realism and OCCAM razor, there is no need
<br />
to run the concrete UD, nor is there any need for a real concrete
<br />
Universe.
<br />
(Or you can use the movie graph argument to show that a first
<br />
person is not able to distinguish real/virtual/and *Arithmetical*
<br />
nature of his own implementations, and this eliminates OCCAM.)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QED

</em><br />
<br />This is far from being an easy exercise. It is an ``exercice&quot;, not
<br />
because I think it is an easy homework, but because I do not need its
<br />
solution in the UDA (the proof that COMP -&gt; REVERSAL).
<br />
<br />Note that IF QM is correct, THEN we get (non constructively)
<br />
COMP -&gt; QM.
<br />
<br />The UDA shows ``only&quot; that we *must* extract the ``physical laws&quot; from
<br />
the computationnalist quantification (quantitative analysis) of the
<br />
comp-1-indeterminisme. But it does not tell us what really is the 
<br />
quantification's domain and how to compute it.
<br />
<br />And I believe it is a so difficult question that I have choosed to
<br />
approach it formally by substituting the folk psychology by the 
<br />
provability logics, searching for an arithmetical interpretation
<br />
of probability or credibility notion. The verifiable ``certainty&quot; of p
<br />
is modelized in that setting by []p &amp; &lt;&gt;p, and if p is DU-accessible
<br />
we get a sort of quantum logic, and this, I think, is promising.
<br />
<br />But it is also interesting to try to get an intuitive understanding
<br />
of the &quot;probability&quot; calculus, if only to make clear the relation
<br />
between Schmidhuber and me.
<br />
<br />In the course of doing this we will also discover a kind of apparent
<br />
objective weakness in my UDA reasoning. I have never try to hide that
<br />
weakness, but I have realize it is also unpedagogical to insist on
<br />
it too early. This weakness is not fatal for the UD Argument, but
<br />
is quasi-fatal for the hope of finding intuitively the
<br />
probabilities. Here again, that has motivated me for the modal
<br />
(more abstract) approach.
<br />
<br />Indeed. Remember the ``fundamental result&quot;: the way of quantifying
<br />
the (1) indeterminism is independent of the place, time and
<br />
the virtual/real nature of the reconstitution. The reason which has
<br />
been invoked is the first-person undistinguishability.
<br />
<br />Now let us consider again the thought experiment from the
<br />
renormalisation thread. I am in Brussels preparing myself for 
<br />
a multiplication experiment. After annihilation in Brussels I
<br />
will be reconstituted in ten *virtual environment*:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- one simulating perfectly Washington,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- the others simulating perfectly Moscow.
<br />
<br />I consider here virtual environments so that by comp 3-determinism
<br />
I can ensure that the 9 experiences of being in Moscow are 
<br />
completely identical, and thus first-person undistinguishable.
<br />
<br />Thus, if we take seriously first-person undistinguishability
<br />
we should consider equivalent the 1:9 multiplication experiment
<br />
described here with any 1:n multiplication experiments.
<br />
In that case P(M) = P(W) = 1/2.
<br />
In that case, with CUD, (there is a concrete running UD) we should
<br />
put the same weight on all ``compiler-equivalent&quot; computational states.
<br />
(Note that this equivalence is not so easy to define, but clearly
<br />
it entails that we must put the same weigth on all 1-steps
<br />
computational continuations of my brain state (I assume NEURO for
<br />
the sake of easyness). But remember the UD dovetails on the reals
<br />
(or the initial segment of the reals which is the same for the
<br />
1-person). So if my brain has n (binary, for easiness too) entries,
<br />
there will be 2^n such continuations, and so one: that means
<br />
that comp would entail white noise expectation for *any* 
<br />
experience in *any* experiment. 
<br />
That is not the case, so something is wrong with such equivalence.
<br />
So either comp is false or we must throw away this equivalence.
<br />
<br />As it appear in Mallah's reply, the idea is that we will take
<br />
into account more steps in the comp continuation. The idea
<br />
is to put weight, not on computational states but on
<br />
computational histories.
<br />
This move will lead us quickly toward comp-immortality
<br />
(contra Mallah, ironicaly enough!).
<br />
But how many steps make a computational history? And should we 
<br />
distinguish the equivalent one ? Surely we should if we keep
<br />
the first-person undistinguishability principle. But in that
<br />
case we will meet a new problem: with the first person possible
<br />
amnesy, the computational equivalence will make possible (cf GSLevy)
<br />
the merging (fusing) of computational histories, and this,
<br />
(although a good news for our hope about finding the comp
<br />
origin of the quantum laws) kill our hope to tackle the 
<br />
probabilities by pure intuition. But let us at least continue
<br />
our attempt.
<br />
<br />Let us go back to the question ``how many steps make a comput.
<br />
history?&quot;. The easiest answer is &quot;let us take all steps&quot;. So
<br />
a computation (modulo the compiler-equivalence) is just the whole
<br />
computation.
<br />
<br />Now, a platonist mathematician (unlike an intuitionist) will 
<br />
easily accept that there are two sort of computation:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- those which stops,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- those which never stops.
<br />
<br />So, relatively to a computational state X, (my Brussels' state
<br />
for example), there are computational continuations going through
<br />
X which stops, and the others which does not stop.
<br />
The stopping one can only be enumerable. The non stopping one are
<br />
at least as numerous as the reals.
<br />
So the stopping one can be eliminated from the probability
<br />
calculus. This is immortality with a revenge: we are immortal 
<br />
because we have 2^aleph_0 infinite futures and at most aleph_0
<br />
finite futures.
<br />
<br />But this is not enough. We should take into account more seriously
<br />
the nearness of computational histories, and this could depend
<br />
on Schmidhuber/Wei Dai Universal Prior (UP) of the roots (Wei Dai
<br />
little program) of the computations going through X. 
<br />
<br />In that case our probability formula becomes something like
<br />
<br />P(W) = P(W in y / conditionnalised by X :: UP(little 
<br />
program is an origin of X)). 
<br />
<br />Where ``::&quot; is still not defined, and y is one possible 
<br />
consistent infinite computation going
<br />
through the (actual) state X.
<br />
<br />The possible merging of the histories makes me feel that an
<br />
intuitive research of ``::&quot; is senseless, and personally
<br />
I have never been able to define it, and so I have decided
<br />
to interview the SRC UTM (and its guardian angels) itself. This
<br />
is possible thanks to the work of Boolos, Solovay, Goldblatt, etc.
<br />
<br />Only if my brain is the entire universe, my history is directly
<br />
defined with the UP of the little programs (Schmidhuber's solution).
<br />
<br />I see almost all this discussion-list as a search to define
<br />
the unknow relation ``::&quot; (oversimplifying a little bit).
<br />
I see it more and more as a search of making a good use
<br />
of both ASSA (based on the UP) and RSSA (taking the actual state
<br />
into account).
<br />
<br />Note also that there is something importantly true in the
<br />
saying (though vague as it is) of Higgo and Griffith.
<br />
Indeed it seems that an observer moment (the 1-person object on 
<br />
which the quantification of indeterminacy is done) is really
<br />
(with comp) a computational state *including* all computational
<br />
histories going through. It seems there is some kind of 
<br />
duality between ``observer moment&quot; and the sheaf of histories
<br />
(branching-bifurking sequences) going through the observer moments.
<br />
How to use that?
<br />
<br />With the modal logics, the observer-moment could be modelised by
<br />
the canonical maximal consistent sets of formula for the logic 
<br />
Z1* (the logic of []p&amp;&lt;&gt;p, p DU-accessible (or Sigma_1)).
<br />
That is very nice, because formally it gives a kind of
<br />
quantum logic. And here the duality between ``observer moment&quot;
<br />
and the sheaf of histories is akin to the ``Galois Connection
<br />
between theorie and models well known in logic.
<br />
But I'm still searching a semantics for Z1* for making that
<br />
duality and that Galois Connection genuinely useful.
