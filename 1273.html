I agree a lot with the last post by Juergen Schmidhuber.
<br />
<br />I take the opportunity to describe briefly the difference between
<br />
Schmidhuber and me. It is relevant for the current Alistair-Russell
<br />
debate (IMHO).
<br />
<br />i-POV means from the ith person point of view (i = 1 or 3). 
<br />
<br />I don't take the notion of observer for granted. I modelise it
<br />
with the notion of self-referentially correct universal machines.
<br />
This put very high constraints on the concept of communicable 
<br />
proposition (3-POV), knowable truth (1-POV), observable facts 
<br />
(3-communicable and 1-non-communicable like qualia).
<br />
This entails also different logic for the 3-POV and 1-POV.
<br />
<br />The PE-omega experience (see below) shows that the computationalist
<br />
&nbsp;hypothesis entails that the physical
<br />
laws emerge on the possible 1 and 3 discourses of the
<br />
self-referentially correct universal machines.
<br />
<br />In my thesis <a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal</a> I show that indeed
<br />
a precise quantum logic comes from the logic of 3-observation.
<br />
<br />This entails that at some point I think Juergen is a little to rapid.
<br />
For exemple when Schmidhuber write
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The prior U suggests: you are in the simplest universe compatible with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;your existence. The conditional probability of some universe, given
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;yourself, is high if that universe is computable by a short algorithm. To
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;use the example in [1], a universe in which lambs start attacking lions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;seems less probable than the present one, because apparently it requires
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;more information than conveyed by the few physical laws causing &quot;normal&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;animal evolution. Similarly for &quot;flying rabbits&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />The problem is that &quot;to be in a universe&quot; has no clear meaning with
<br />
comp. (Independently that the argument of the short algorithm is 
<br />
probably correct and fundamental). The hunting of the flying rabbit is
<br />
basically correct, but even with my precise notion of observer
<br />
it is not so easy to solve it completely).
<br />
<br />Here is a copy of my concise formulation of the Universal Dovetailing
<br />
argument from a older post (the PE-omega experience as I call it in 
<br />
this list). It gives the explanation that the whole UD* must be taken into
<br />
account to define the measure on computational histories. 
<br />
I recopy it because it is not easily readable in the archive (the lines
<br />
are too long).
<br />
<br />==========
<br />
Begin copy
<br />
<br />UD, the Universal Dovetailer, is equivalent to Schmidhuber 
<br />
Great Programmer. 
<br />
UD is a finite program. 
<br />
UD* is the infinite extension of the UD.

<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Bruno, you say &quot;you can only associate mind with the

</em><br />
<br />Here is a short answer. Take your time to read it, and please tell 
<br />
me if you disagree at some point.
<br />
It is necessary to concentrate ourself on the following thought 
<br />
experiments (PE, PE1, PE2, PE3, PE4, PE-omega).
<br />
<br />The &quot;practitionners&quot; of computationnalism can use classical 
<br />
teletransport as a mean to move from one place A to another 
<br />
place B. This mean he is &quot;read&quot; at A, send (by wave radio, 
<br />
for exemple) at B, annihilated at A, and reconstituted at B. 
<br />
Let us call that experience : the primitive experience or 
<br />
simply the PE.
<br />
<br />Let us look first at two independent changes of the PE.
<br />
<br />PE1 : if, knowing it or without knowing it, the reconstitution 
<br />
is time-delayed at B, this doesn't change anything from his 
<br />
first-person point of view. In particular if he is certain to 
<br />
get B with PE, he must be certain to get B, in PE1. 
<br />
(The delay is supposed to be finite).
<br />
<br />PE2 : if he is told he will be reconstituted at B and B', 
<br />
his first-person futur is undetermined. The domain of 
<br />
undeterminism is {B, B'}.
<br />
Of course, from a third person point of view, everything 
<br />
is determined.
<br />
<br />Do you agree until here ?
<br />
<br />Now, consider the following experience PE3 which mixed PE1 
<br />
and PE2.
<br />
He is told that he will be reconstituted at B and at B' 
<br />
(like PE2), but a time-delay of reconstitution is introduced 
<br />
at B (like PE1).
<br />
Now, if you agree with what I say about PE1 and PE2,
<br />
&nbsp;you should agree with :
<br />
<br />IF he quantifies the indeterminism on {B, B'} in some way 
<br />
for PE2, THEN he must give the same quantification for 
<br />
the indeterminism on {B, B'} with PE3.
<br />
For exemple, if he quantifies {B, B'} with a uniform 
<br />
probability distribution with PE2, he must quantify {B, B'} 
<br />
with a uniform probability distribution with PE3. To sum up, 
<br />
the delay doesn't change his expectation.
<br />
<br /><br />This follows from comp (think on the first-person communication 
<br />
by the average robot instead of you, for exemple). The average 
<br />
robot = the normal (gaussian) robot when these duplication 
<br />
experiences are iterated.
<br />
<br />OK ? 
<br />
<br />I guess you will also accept that nothing will change, in 
<br />
neither PE nor PE1 nor PE2, nor PE3, if at B (for exemple) 
<br />
he is reconstituted in a perfect virtual environment 
<br />
(which could exist by COMP). This is PE4.
<br />
<br />If you agree, you are ready for &quot;PE-omega&quot;, which is just 
<br />
the infinite running of the UD.
<br />
<br />Suppose that you are in some state of mind s, captured at 
<br />
some digital level by a computationnal state S (which exist 
<br />
by COMP, and there is no restriction on the level other than 
<br />
permitting digitalisable capture).
<br />
<br />Now suppose the UD is running, and that it never ends 
<br />
(accidentally). Then you will be virtually reconstituted, 
<br />
in the state S, an infinite number of times in the all UD*.
<br />
<br />End copy.
<br />
=====================================
<br />
<br />Because your 1-feeling doesn't depend on the time when the
<br />
UD access your state of mind, the whole (infinite) UD* is needed
<br />
in the definition of the measure on the computational histories.
<br />
<br />Now, either with the movie argument (the marchal-maudlin
<br />
crackpot proof as Jacques M Mallah once put it) or with some strong
<br />
Occam razor, the UD doesn't need to be physically implemented.
<br />
<br />Note also that the UD dovetails on the oracle computations, so that
<br />
the &quot;non computable stuff&quot; could still have an important role
<br />
with comp. (I say that before).
<br />
