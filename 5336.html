<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience precisely because I cannot think of a way to formalise it. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps its defining characteristic is that it cannot be formalised. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One can imagine that if we made contact with an extraterrestrial 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; civilization, however alien it is, we could eventually exchange 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information about the natural sciences, mathematics, history, anything 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;objective&quot;. It would effectively involve finding an algorithm to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; convert from one formal system to another, or one natural language to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; another. But although the aliens may be able to explain how their 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physiology has evolved so that gamma rays which are an odd multiple of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a certain wavelength cause them to feel a pleasant sensation while 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even multiple rays cause them to feel a completely different, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unpleasant sensation, we as humans would have absolutely no idea what 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; these sensations are like to experience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />But even this goes way out in front of what we can possibly know.  You 
<br />
say we have no idea what these feelings are like to experience--but why 
<br />
should we assume we even are entitled to ask this question?
<br />
<br />To borrow a bit from Wittgenstein -- imagine you have completely 
<br />
translated these aliens' language, and they tell you that each of them 
<br />
has a box with something inside it.  Although they talk a lot in rather 
<br />
vague terms about what's in their box, they insist you can't really 
<br />
know what is inside it.   Now what is the logical conclusion here:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a)  There may or may not be something in the box.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b)  There's definitely something in the box, and I have absolutely no 
<br />
idea what it is.
<br />
<br />What on earth could possibly make someone conclude (b) here?  It's not 
<br />
logical at all.  Yet this is what people conclude when they bend over 
<br />
backwards talking about &quot;qualia&quot; and how ineffable they are.
<br />
<br />Earlier you say:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'll grant you that the subjective experience of &quot;red&quot; etc cannot be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; derived from a theory of physics.
</em><br />
<br />But this statement just assumes one philosophical position about mind, 
<br />
and there are many out there.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So, in addition to the empirical data, there is this extra bit of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information, neither contained in the data nor able to be derived from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it using the laws of physics: what it actually feels like to be the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one experiencing the subjective sensation. If someone can think of a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; better way to describe it than &quot;extra bit of information&quot; or can come 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; up with a way to formalise it, I would be happy to hear about it.
</em><br />
<br />A better way to describe what, exactly?  &quot;What it actually feels like&quot;? 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;But why do you first commit yourself to the view that this question 
<br />
makes any sense?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I suppose there will still be some who insist that if you know all 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about the physiology etc. behind the alien response to gamma rays, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then you know all there is to know. I think this response is analogous 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the &quot;shut up and calculate&quot; attitude to the interpretation of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quantum mechanics.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, I am one of these people.  You say &quot;if you know all about&quot;, and 
<br />
you must be taken seriously here:  you would really have to know &gt;all&lt; 
<br />
about it.  But if you did, you would be able to entirely trace the 
<br />
causal pathway from the receipt of the gamma rays, to whatever internal 
<br />
responses go on inside the alien's body, to the subsequent report of &quot;I 
<br />
feel that pleasant, odd-multiple feeling&quot;.  Let's say you had that 
<br />
entire explanation written out.  And &quot;subjective experience&quot; doesn't 
<br />
appear anywhere on this list.  So what reason on earth do you have to 
<br />
assert that it exists?
<br />
<br />Of course subjective experience exists in a way -- but it's just a way 
<br />
of talking about things.  It isn't a &quot;primitive&quot;.  When I see red, I 
<br />
have a subjective experience of red, sure -- but all this means is just 
<br />
that my brain has responded to a certain stimulus in the way it 
<br />
normally does.
