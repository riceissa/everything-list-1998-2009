Brent: 'Remember that Bruno is a logician.'
<br />
<br />MP:  :-) Yes, this much is easy to infer. The full scope of what this 
<br />
might MEAN however, is little short of terrifying ... ;-)
<br />
<br />MP: Infinity, infinite, infinitely big or small; these are challenging 
<br />
concepts at the best of times and made very interesting to the point of 
<br />
mind-boggling in the contexts of QM and relativity theory. In QM, there 
<br />
is apparently NOT an infinitely small level of existence that could be 
<br />
reached by any kind of measurement due to the shortest length and 
<br />
shortest durations denoted by the Planck length and Planck time. I 
<br />
personally wonder whether there is room to criticise this limitation. 
<br />
The underlying concept of Process Physics [let me call that PP from now 
<br />
on] directly challenges the idea.
<br />
<br />MP: My point about measurement is to do with the fact that in seeking to 
<br />
get as exact a copy as possible, not just a working model, it is 
<br />
possible that the digital representations of salient features might need 
<br />
more decimal places than the recording and/or transmission systems can 
<br />
provide. This is a matter of big as opposed to infinite of course but as 
<br />
I pointed out before, the copy is not that of a static something or 
<br />
other it is a sufficient facsimile of a very complex dynamic system. 
<br />
This means that AT VERY LEAST two measurements of everything will be 
<br />
needed AND THEN a computation of all salient displacements WITH further 
<br />
measurements of system parts undergoing acceleration WITH WHICH 
<br />
calculations of the accelerations and displacements might finally be 
<br />
made. As far as I can see the amount of computation required to get all 
<br />
that in order will always be whatever is the maximum that the copier is 
<br />
currently capable of and might indeed require 'infinite' calculations to 
<br />
get all of it right.
<br />
<br />Now I realise this is beginning to sound like an old fart imitating a 
<br />
wet blanket but these practical considerations, even if here only 
<br />
arising in a hypothetical and highly unlikely situation, are nicely 
<br />
indicative of just the sort of thing that distinguishes the real world 
<br />
from the beautiful but artificial worlds envisaged by 'comp', aggressive 
<br />
QM and other theories that confuse description with ontology.
<br />
I could go on and on but it is very late here so let me finish by 
<br />
paraphrasing a line or two out of the 'Lord's prayer' - as might be 
<br />
addressed to the great IT or Universe:
<br />
'Lead us not into temptation, and deliver us from hubris,
<br />
for Thine is the location, the duration and the entropy,
<br />
for at least the next 15 billion years and maybe for eternity,
<br />
Amen!
<br />
<br />Regards

<br />&nbsp;PS: &quot;Qualia&quot;: part of 'what it is like to be the updating of the model' 
<br />
therefore essentially a first person aspect. Not something to worry 
<br />
about and let's NOT get wired up just yet! :-)  The project of inducing 
<br />
qualia in others corresponding to those of one's own is my definition of 
<br />
fine art. It is by and large the fundamental criterion for judging 
<br />
success in any art.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; SP: 'using the term &quot;comp&quot; as short for &quot;computationalism&quot; as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; something picked up from Bruno. On the face of it, computationalism 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; seems quite sensible: the best theory of consciousness and the most 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; promising candidate for producing artificial intelligence/consciousness'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; That is what I thought 'comp' meant. My approach to this is to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; adhere, as much as possible, to plain and simple English. Not being a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'mathematician' I stick with my type of sceptical method. To me this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; does not seem deeply problematic although is does of course limit the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; scope of conversations I can participate in. As far as I can see, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Bruno's grand scheme depends on 'assume', like the economists do. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Unfortunately that which is assumed remains, I believe, unprovable. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Furthermore there are deep, common sense, problems which undermine 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; all these theories of universal emulation possibilities, never mind 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; those potentially lethal :-) teleporting/fax holidays and cryogenic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; time shifts.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The biggest hurdle is the requirement for infinite computing ability. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Remember that Bruno is a logician.  When he writes &quot;infinite&quot; he 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; really means infinite - not &quot;really, really big&quot; as physicists do.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Almost all numbers are bigger than 10^120, which is the biggest number 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that appears in physics (and it's wrong).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; This is simply the recognition that all measurements are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; approximations so the teleporter/fax machine could only ever send an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; approximate copy of me to whatever destination duty or holiday 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; dreamings might lead me. Still, it is probable that I, as subjective 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; experiencer, would not notice most anomalies, particularly if trying 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to fill in the temporal gaps caused by Bruno's gratuitous delays in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; reading me back out of his archive :-)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; This limitation hits all the 'Matrix' type scenarios as well: the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; emulation system would require essentially infinite computing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; capacity to reproduce any useful world that a real person inhabits. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; If on the other hand the Matrix is only concerned to make A world, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; its virtual reality inhabitants might be sustained [I am admitting 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; this as a possibility] until they started engaging in real science. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; As I understand things the denizens of a Matrix type world would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; start to find real anomalies in their 'reality' unless the matrix 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; machine could operate at a fineness of resolution unattainable by any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; experimental method the matrixians could devise. There would be much 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; less, or even no problem at all if they were all believers in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'Intelligent Design' of course. [I can put that very rudely as: the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; problem is not 'If our mind were simple enough to understand then we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; would be too dumb to understand it' but rather 'If Intelligent Design 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; were really true then we have been designed to be so dumb that it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; really doesn't matter!']
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Re &quot;Platonic objects&quot; - I think this is illusory. The numbers that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; people write down and think about are words in the language/s of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; logico-mathematics. They do what they do because they are defined as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; such but they do not exist apart from the systems which generate and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; record them - by which I mean brains, blackboards and computers, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; etc... The regularities, and exciting facts people discover about 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; them are just that, regularities and exciting facts about languages. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I don't mean that in any derogatory sense. We live largely BY MEANS 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; OF our languages and certainly our cultural lives as human beings 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; would be impossible without language in the general and inclusive 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; senses. But the universe is not made out of languages, it just exists 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; - for the moment at least.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I incline to this view.  I agree that the Platonic objects of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematics are inventions or language - but so are our models based 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on material particles.  An electron is almost (but maybe not quite) as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; abstract an invention as the number two. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; [NB: it just occurs to me that certain G/goddists will say that the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; universe is made out of the mind of G/god/s which could perhaps be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; included as a or THE language of existence. To be 'perfect' however, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; this would need to be allowed to have infinite recursion, i.e. ''made 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; out of(made out of(made out of(made out of ... -&gt; inf ... ))). As far 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; as I can see however this would amount to an assertion of many 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; layered uncertainty and/or a Heraclitan in-falling in the direction 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of smallwards due to the necessity of each layer of divinity 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; maintaining omniscience, omnipotence, and so for, over and under its 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'turf'. As this has the minimalist effect of underpinning either 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; standard model QM, etc. or something like the Process Physics 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; advocated by Colin Hales and friends [which I find attractive], all 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is well with the world. :-]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But, seriously, all this stuff about 'supervening' and so forth is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; all based on the Cartesian assumption that mind-stuff has no physical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; extension. Well the Inquisition is no longer the authority or power 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; base that it was and empirical science has moved on. I think the onus 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is falling ever more heavily on those who deny the identity of mind 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and brain to explain WHY they still do so. The 'distinction' between 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 1st and 3rd person view points is simply raw fact. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think of it as a failure of communication.  My brain must 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; communicate with your brain through the medium of language, which is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inadequate to convey qualia.  But maybe if we could directly &quot;wire&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our brains together you could feel my qualia.
