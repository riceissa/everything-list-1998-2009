<br />John Wheeler said (from Ghost in the Atom):
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot believe that nature has &quot;built in&quot;, as if by a corps of 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swiss watchmakers, any machinery, equation or mathematical 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;formalism which rigidly relates physical events separated in time. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather I believe that these events go together in a 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;higgledy-piggledy fashion and that what seem to be precise 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;equations emerge in every case in a statistical way from the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;physics of large numbers; quantum theory in particular seems to 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;work like that. . . . The second law of thermodynamics does not go 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;back to any equations written down at the beginning of time, not 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to any &quot;built in&quot; machinery - not to any corps of Swiss 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;watchmakers - but rather to the combination of a very large number 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of events.
<br />
<br />This I agree with whole-heartedly.  Considering that members of this
<br />
list for the most part agree that &quot;everything exists&quot;, I would assume
<br />
(and this might be a stretch, but I doubt it) that most would reject
<br />
the notion of a divine creator.  Well, without a divine creator, just
<br />
_how_ could an object that acted one way yesterday be &quot;compelled&quot; to
<br />
act the same way today?  From an aesthetic philosophical vantage, I
<br />
just cannot accept it.  I really can't say it better than Wheeler:
<br />
how could the universe behave as though it were an elaborate machine
<br />
built by a &quot;corp of Swiss watchmakers&quot;?
<br />
<br />Yet nature does seem to obey &quot;laws&quot;.  There does seem to be some sort
<br />
of connectedness between different subjective times that we experience.
<br />
I have a sort of nebulous, speculative idea that the connection 
<br />
derives from the laws of probability and from the anthropic principle.
<br />
<br />The anthropic principle first:  as has been said by others, in order
<br />
for an &quot;I&quot; to exist, that is, in any given mathematical structure, in
<br />
order for you to be able to define an SAS, you must be
<br />
able to define a single time step of that SAS, which means being able
<br />
to define:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;1.  information contained by the SAS at time t
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;2.  information contained in a &quot;delta-SAS&quot; which is &quot;connected&quot; to 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the SAS(t) by one delta-time
<br />
<br />Now, in the _entire_ ensemble of structures in which &quot;I&quot; can be 
<br />
defined, it must be that for any observable, the expectation value
<br />
can be derived from the equations of quantum mechanics.  But it's
<br />
not necessary for each individual structure to obey physical laws,
<br />
just for their average, when considering large numbers, to produce
<br />
what we see about us.
