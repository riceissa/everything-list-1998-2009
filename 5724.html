I just read the New Scientist article &quot;Quantum Rebel&quot; last night about
<br />
Shariar Afshar's work on the double slit experiment. Ingenious as the
<br />
experiment is, I really don't think it says anything about different
<br />
interpretations of QM. Indeed, the outcome of the experiment is just
<br />
what I'd expect from quantum theory, regardless of which
<br />
interpretation is used.
<br />
<br />OK - so the claim is that Bohr's complementarity principle (CP) is tested
<br />
by this experiment and found wanting. I decided to go back to the two
<br />
text books I learnt quantum mechanics from - Leonard Schiff's book
<br />
which is the older and more traditional of the two, and Rammamurti
<br />
Shankar's book which has the more modern approach, but which I found
<br />
explained things better. Shankar doesn't mention the CP at all, and
<br />
for Schiff, the CP is basically a restatement of the Heisenberg
<br />
uncertainty principle, a principle not tested by Afshar's experiment.
<br />
<br />In the double slit experiment, how I understand the CP to work is that
<br />
one cannot measure which slit a photon passes through, and retain an
<br />
interference pattern. Assuming it is possible to do this, one could
<br />
divide the measures data into those photons that passed through slit A,
<br />
and those that passed through slit B. The resulting distribution of
<br />
photons arriving at the screen of
<br />
the two slit experiment is then the sum of the distributions of the
<br />
two subsets of data. However, the two sub distributions do not have
<br />
inteference patterns so how can the sum have an interference
<br />
pattern. Hence any such measurement of which slit the photon passes
<br />
through must affect the photons so as to destroy the intereference
<br />
pattern.
<br />
<br />Now in the article, Afshar claims to have measured which slit the
<br />
photon passed through and verified the existence of an interference
<br />
pattern. However, this is not the case - without the wires in
<br />
place to detect the presence of the interference pattern, photons
<br />
arriving at detector A have passed through slit A, and vice-versa with
<br />
detector B and slit B. However, with the wires in place, some photons
<br />
are scattered, indeed some photons which passed through slit A will
<br />
arrive at detector B. With both slits open, and the wire placed
<br />
exactly at a null point of the interference pattern, the photons
<br />
passing through slit A and arriving at detector B exactly counteracts
<br />
the photons passing thoguh slit B that have been lost through
<br />
scattering. The mathematics of quantum mechanics assures this,
<br />
coincidental this may seem.
<br />
<br />It may be a question of &quot;interpretations of interpretations of QM&quot;,
<br />
however on the basis of the New Scientist article, I don't believe
<br />
Afshar have shown a problem with the complementarity principle.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheers

&gt; Oops, I too was a victim of viral paranoia this AM and committed wholesale
&gt; deletion of all attachment laden emails in my box including, apparently,
&gt; Russel's. letter. Can someone send or forward me a copy? (of the letter
not
&gt; a virus) ;)
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Please, Russell,
&gt; &gt; for the peace of our minds who believe in 'smart' viruses and have none
of
&gt; &gt; the software you indicated:
&gt; &gt; Could you at least put a word in the e-mail that thei comes from you?
(eg
&gt; &gt; &quot;Safe from RS&quot; or &quot;from Russ&quot; etc.)
&gt; &gt; I wanted to open this attachment in blind face and paranoid shiver,
&gt; however
&gt; &gt; went first to FILE - Properties - 2nd page and checked the &quot;from&quot; line
at
&gt; &gt; the bottom.  Boring. Even there it may be a virus usiing your mailbox -
&gt; &gt; before you detect it.
&gt; &gt; I am not the only one suffering from virus-paranioa.
&gt; &gt; Cheerz
&gt; &gt; John Mikes
