<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />I am doing a detailed look at the relationship between solipsism and
<br />
science. I am writing it up...will post it on the list (if that's
<br />
OK...it's not too big!) when it's Ok to read.. I am surprised at what I
<br />
found. The feedback on solipsism is interesting...
<br />
<br />Russel is right in the sense that 'as-if' instrumentalism seems to
<br />
characterise scientific behaviour...where scientists act 'as-if' the
<br />
external world existed. At the same time, the facts of neuroscience tell
<br />
us that scientific evidence arrives as contents of phenomenal
<br />
consciousness, so science is, in fact, all about correlated appearances...
<br />
and it is an 'as-if' solipsism. That is, science is also acting 'as-if'
<br />
solipsism ( as per &quot;1Z&quot; 'methodological solipsism) defines the route to
<br />
knowledge but is actually in denial of solipsism!
<br />
<br />The weird state that seems to be in place is that science is tacitly
<br />
radically solipsistic in respect of what evidence is available (phenomenal
<br />
consciousness is all there is), whilst scientist's actual behaviour denies
<br />
this solipsism and tacitly adopts the 'as-if' stance in respect of the
<br />
existence of an external world. The net affect is that the external world
<br />
is assumed to exist, consciousness is eschewed as evidence of anything in
<br />
its own right and objectivity allows correlates of appearances within
<br />
consciousness to literally define the workings of the (assumed existent)
<br />
external world. Science is a methodological-solispsist-in-denial
<br />
instrumentalism? whew!
<br />
<br />This paradoxical situation I have analysed out and, I hope, straightened
<br />
out. The answer lies not in adopting/rejecting solipsism per se (although
<br />
solipsism is logically untenable for subtle reasons) , but in merely
<br />
recognising what scientific evidence is actually there and what it is
<br />
evidence of. At least then scientists will have a consistent position and
<br />
will no longer need to think one way and behave another. At the moment
<br />
they are 'having it both ways' and have no awareness of it. ...if you talk
<br />
to mainstream neuroscientists, to whom this matters the most (in terms of
<br />
understanding the available evidence) they have no clue what you are on
<br />
about...but they go right on doing it without question...staring down the
<br />
microscope with their phenomenal consciouess at the &quot;external world&quot; they
<br />
assume they are directly characterising without phenomenal consciousness,
<br />
correlating the appearances of test and control..day in, day out...
<br />
<br />The thing is, none of it actually matters...until one day you decide
<br />
scientifically study phenomenal cosnciousness... which I think I have said
<br />
previously.... so many ways to get to the same place!
<br />
<br />I'll probably dump the text of 'Solipsism and Science' to the list
<br />
tomorrow. Who'd have thought that in looking at AI i'd end up forced to
<br />
analyse solipsism in science?
<br />
