The &quot;Flip-Flop&quot; game described by Stathis Papaioannou strikes me as a 
<br />
version of the old Two-Envelope Paradox.
<br />
<br />Assume an eccentric millionaire offers you your choice of either of two 
<br />
sealed envelopes, A or B, both containing money.  One envelope contains 
<br />
twice as much as the other.  After you choose an envelope you will have the 
<br />
option of trading it for the other envelope.
<br />
<br />Suppose you pick envelope A.  You open it and see that it contains $100. 
<br />
Now you have to decide if you will keep the $100, or will you trade it for 
<br />
whatever is in envelope B?
<br />
<br />You might reason as follows: since one envelope has twice what the other one 
<br />
has, envelope B either has 200 dollars or 50 dollars, with equal 
<br />
probability.  If you switch, you stand to either win $100 or to lose $50. 
<br />
Since you stand to win more than you stand to lose, you should switch.
<br />
<br />But just before you tell the eccentric millionaire that you would like to 
<br />
switch, another thought might occur to you.  If you had picked envelope B, 
<br />
you would have come to exactly the same conclusion.  So if the above 
<br />
argument is valid, you should switch no matter which envelope you choose.
<br />
<br />Therefore the argument for always switching is NOT valid - but I am unable, 
<br />
at the moment, to tell you why!

Subject: RE: Observation selection effects
<br />
<br /><br />Here is another version of the paradox, where the way an individual chooses
<br />
does not change the initial probabilities:
<br />
<br />In the new casino game Flip-Flop, an odd number of players pays $1 each to
<br />
individually flip a coin, so that no player can see what another player is
<br />
doing. The game organisers then tally up the results, and the result in the
<br />
minority is called the Winning Flip, while the majority result is called the
<br />
Losing Flip. Before the Winning Flip is announced, each player has the
<br />
opportunity to either keep their initial result, or to Switch; this is then
<br />
called the player's Final Flip. When the Winning Flip is announced, players
<br />
whose Final Flip corresponds with this are paid $2 by the casino, while the
<br />
rest are paid nothing.
<br />
<br />The question: if you participate in this game, is there any advantage in
<br />
Switching? On the one hand, it seems clear that the Winning Flip is as
<br />
likely to be heads as tails, so if you played this game repeatedly, in the
<br />
long run you should break even, whether you Switch or not. On the other
<br />
hand, it seems equally clear that if all the players Switch, the casino will
<br />
end up every time paying out more than it collects, so Switching should be a
<br />
winning strategy, on average, for each individual player.
<br />
<br />I'm sure there is something wrong with the above conclusion. What is it? And
<br />
I haven't really thought this through yet, but does this have any bearing on
<br />
the self sampling assumption as applied in the Doomsday Argument etc.?
<br />
