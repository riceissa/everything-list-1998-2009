<br />
In a previous post in reply to Hal Finnay, I have suggested the use
<br />
of a particuliar case of additional conditions to the hypothetical
<br />
set of equation that would rule ou universe. This is an attempt
<br />
to clarify it while taking it out from the computation perspective
<br />
with which it has nothing to do.
<br />
<br />Considering the kind of set of equation we figure up to now,
<br />
completely specifying our universe from them seems to require
<br />
two additional things:
<br />
<br />1) The specification of boundary conditions (or any other equivalent
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;additional constraint.
<br />
2) The selection of a set of global parameters.
<br />
<br />My suggestion is that for 1), instead of specifying initial
<br />
conditions (what might be problematic for a number of reasons),
<br />
one could use another form of additional high level constraint
<br />
which would be that the solution universe should be &quot;as much as
<br />
possible more ordered on one side than on the other&quot;. Of course,
<br />
this rely on the possibility to give a sound sense to this, which
<br />
implies to be able to find a canonical way to tell whether one
<br />
solution of the set of equations in more &quot;more ordered on one
<br />
side than on the other&quot; than another solution.
<br />
<br />This is a way to narrow down the set of solutions that offers
<br />
several advantages:
<br />
<br />a) It removes the asymmetry in the choice of initial versus
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;final (or any other combination of) conditions.
<br />
b) It is consistent with boundaryless universes as proposed by
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stephen Hawking for instance.
<br />
c) It is able to make the flow of time appear as an emergent
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;property instead of being postulated and built upon.
<br />
d) This kind of condition is very well appropriate to select
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those in which SASs have  chance to emerge.
<br />
<br />This condition does not seem alone enough to define a unique
<br />
mathematical structure but there might be a little number of
<br />
ways according to which the remaining symmetries could be
<br />
canonically broken.
<br />
<br /><br />It might well be that this additional constraint can also be
<br />
used for selecting the appropriate set of global parameter for
<br />
the set of equations considered in 2). It does not seem
<br />
counter-intuitive that the sets of global parameters that
<br />
allows for the maximization of the gradient of order among all
<br />
possible solutions considering all possible values for global
<br />
parameters be precisely those for which SASs emerges and
<br />
therefore those we see in our universe: universes not able to
<br />
generate complex enough substructures to be self aware would
<br />
probably equally fail to exhibit large gradients of order and
<br />
vice versa.
<br />
<br />The hypothesis of the maximization the gradient of order seems
<br />
even Popper-falsfiable. At least one prediction can be made:
<br />
<br />Given the set of equation that describe our universe and the
<br />
corresponding set of global parameters, if we can find a canonical
<br />
way to compare the relative global gradient of order within the
<br />
universes that satisfy this set of equations:
<br />
<br />1) It could be possible to determine the subset of universes
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that maximize the gradient for each set of global parameters
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(comparing all possible universes for a given set of global
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;parameters), these being called &quot;optimal&quot; for this set of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;global parameters.
<br />
<br />2) It could be possible to determine the sets of global parameters
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that maximize the gradient in an absolute way (comparing
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;optimal universes for all possible sets of global parameters).
<br />
<br />The prediction is that the set of global parameter that we observe
<br />
is one of those that maximizes the gradient of order within the
<br />
corresponding optimal universes.
<br />
<br />A prediction with a weaker version of 2) would be that the set
<br />
of global parameter that we observe must be consistent with any
<br />
constraint we can obtain from the maximization constraint.
<br />
<br />It might be possible to solve problem 2) (finding the optimal
<br />
sets of global parameter or some constraints on them) from high
<br />
level considerations without being able to solve problem 1)
<br />
finding the corresponding optimal universes.
<br />
<br />Maybe also the constraint could be used at a third level if it
<br />
can remain consistent as a mean to select the appropriate set of
<br />
equations.
<br />
<br />Finally, the hypothesis of the maximization of the gradient of
<br />
order within universes could offer the additional advanatges:
<br />
<br />e) It does not involve any arbitrary parameter.
<br />
f) It might help not to require that a choice be arbitrarily
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;made within an infinite set.
<br />
<br />Do all of this make sense ? Has it already been considered ?
<br />
<br />Georges Quénot.
