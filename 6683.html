</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; there are other things that can only be known by being the object.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Okay; but some examples are probably necessary. (1) Only Mozart can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;know what it's like for the Mozart auditory system to hear C-sharp
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;on a harpsichord. (2) only a human being can know the feeling that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a human has at the loss of a family member.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Note that my first example had this same peculiar linguistic structure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of &quot;what-it-is-like-to-be&quot;. Not necessarily an indictment; but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;something to notice. As for my second example: are feelings knowledge?
</em><br />
<br />That is the sort of thing I had in mind: any first person experience. I 
<br />
would say that feelings are a kind of raw knowledge, as it doesn't add much 
<br />
to say that they are not knowledge but what-it-is-like-to-have-a-feeling is.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; When the object is a human brain, this latter class of things
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is consciousness. (When the object is something else, this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; latter class of thing is... well, how would I know?)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I think that the distinction between these two types of knowledge
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is surprising, and I would never have noticed it had I not been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; conscious myself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;As you write (below), it's possibly debatable whether this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;really is *knowledge*. Certainly it does not resemble the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;usual kind of knowledge that is communicated from one person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to another. But here is my analysis of what knowledge is:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Knowledge is an internal map of something usually outside
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the skin. But then, a gunshot patient may also obtain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;knowledge provided by his doctors of the exact location of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a bullet in his brain. Still, this is *knowledge* of what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;conditions obtain in the physical world, encoded into a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;yet different area of the patient's brain.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Are there other examples of knowledge?  This is important
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;because, of course, one may be pressed to make the case
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;for consciousness *itself* to provide special knowledge
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(of the non-communicable variety).
</em><br />
<br />This last sentence gets to the crux of the matter. I would say that 
<br />
consciousness is a type of knowledge &quot;of the non-communicable variety&quot;, and 
<br />
it is *this* which makes it special. I say it is knowledge because if I 
<br />
reflect, &quot;I am now typing on a keyboard&quot;, it takes up RAM and hard disk 
<br />
space in my brain. But I'd be happy enough if you decided it was *not* 
<br />
knowledge, because that then makes it even *more* special.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The response of those who think that consciousness is nothing special to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; above is that it is not surprising that there is a difference between a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; description of an object and the object itself, and that what I have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;called
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;knowledge&quot; in reference to conscious experiences is not really 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;knowledge,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; but part of the package that comes with being a thing. I can't really 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;argue
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; against this; as I said, it is just a different way of looking at the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; facts.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Good. You anticipated my question. But your answer is oddly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interesting in a certain way: I would never have conflated this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;question about &quot;what is knowledge&quot; with the difference between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;the description of an object&quot; and &quot;the object itself&quot;. Yet, it's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;true: they are both examples of &quot;the map&quot; versus &quot;the territory&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Interesting.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I wonder if this knower/known distinction can help even further.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;After all, I might claim that in all the cases of this suspicious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;different kind of &quot;knowledge&quot;, it's as if those who see &quot;the problem&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are trying to establish this difference between the knower and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the known in a case in which there isn't any actual difference.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In fact, the whole erection of the notion of *qualia* seems now
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to me to be an effort to impose the knower/known dichotomy where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it doesn't apply. Hence the peculiar English language construction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of &quot;what it is like to be a...&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(A good test to apply to doubtful cases where there may simply
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be a semantic problem is to demand restatement using other terms.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;For example, I am highly critical of the word &quot;rights&quot; used in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the abstract, such as &quot;what gives X the right to do A?&quot;. So I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;challenge people to try to say the same thing without using
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the word &quot;right&quot;. As near as I recall, they don't succeed without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;greatly reducing the impact of what they want to say. So perhaps
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a good challenge is this: we could try to articulate Nagel's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;question without the construction &quot;what it is like to be...&quot;.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Much has been written about particular formulations of the mind/body 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;problem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (or, if you prefer, &quot;problem&quot;). For example, Douglas Hofstadter's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;commentary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; on Thomas Nagel's famous essay, &quot;What Is It Like to Be a Bat?&quot; (which I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; looked up at your suggestion) makes the point that the logic of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;titular
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; question itself is muddled: if Nagel were a bat, he would not be Nagel, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; he would therefore not be Nagel asking the question. If Nagel were 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; asking what it would be like for him to stay Nagel and experience being 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; bat, perhaps by having his brain stimulated in a batty way, then that is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(a)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a different question, and (b) in theory possible, and not the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;intractable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; problem originally advertised. This is fair enough, so I shall try to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;avoid
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; talking about qualia in the way Nagel does. However, I can't get rid of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; idea that there is something special and fundamental about first person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; experience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Yeah! I know the feeling!  :-)  I myself can't shake the feeling
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that there *isn't* anything special about first person experience.
</em><br />
<br />Well, in that case I would have to repeat my reply to Jonathan Colvin, which 
<br />
is that we basically agree on the facts of the matter but choose to 
<br />
appraise/ interpret/ describe them in a different way.
