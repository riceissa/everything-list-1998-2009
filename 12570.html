Hi Mark,
<br />
<br />Le 16-janv.-07, à 13:41, Mark Peaty a écrit :
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Bruno: 'To be honest I always fear a bit those who want to help me or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; others,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  but thanks anyway for the good intentions (which pave the way to hell 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ... :) '
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  MP: yes, I can relate to that. Be reassured then that as I understand 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it [AIUI], helping you and others is very much in my own interest.
</em><br />
<br />Cool.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I must feel that my life has meaning. Without this, getting up in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; morning would become a terrible effort never mind going to work in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; oxymoronic, Sisyphus-world of bureaucracy. Amongst other things this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entails belief that the things I do contribute to the well being and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; survival prospects of those I love and also to the benefit of those 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; upon whom my children and their children will depend in the future. As 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I like to say: the human universe is always potentially infinite, so 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; long as it exists and we believe it to be so.
</em><br />
<br />OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; However I have not met anyone who can reassure me that the human 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; species has anything much more than a 50% chance of surviving beyond 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the next 200 years.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Ah but this is something else. To comment this I need to comment your 
<br />
last paragraph before, so ... see below.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I can see how all the pieces necessary to create sustainable and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; enduring social and cultural networks and systems already exist; the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; technology has already been invented, the theory has all been written 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; down. What is not clear to me however is how to ensure that everybody 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with the need [effectively everybody on the planet] can access the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information they need to make fully informed decisions about the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; crucial issues which affect us. I am pretty much convinced that the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; answer/s involves person to person dialogue rather than propaganda and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; oratory, and the empowerment of individuals to undertake human sized 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; projects rather than the regimenting of industrial clone armies in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; massive organisations.
</em><br />
<br />Well ... OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; AIUI the practice of sceptical inquiry is fundamental to getting 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things right.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree. (But I think skeptical inquiry in the field of scientific (= 
<br />
modest, doubting) has been abandoned since 1500 years when the academy 
<br />
of Athena has been closed. The Enlightenment has been only 
<br />
half-Enlightenment: scientific theology remained stuck in the 
<br />
authoritative mode of thinking).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In this vein, we all need to help each other to see on the one hand 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the formidable danger which affects absolutely ALL of us, and on the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other hand to see the utterly amazing potential for creatively solving 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all the practical problems that confront us. Such is the nature of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; modern world as it is transformed again and again by the fruits of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; application of scientific method.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I would say it is like that since the very beginning.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Bruno: 'Then I can explain you with all details why the proposition 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;we will all 1-die&quot; is provably &quot;put in doubt&quot; once we assume either 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just comp or even just quantum mechanics. With QM this is not wishful 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thinking but &quot;terrorful&quot; thinking: a priori the QM immortality is not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fun: each time we die clinically (in a relative third person way), 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from our personal point of view we survive in the closer normal comp. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; history. A case can been made that this entails a sort of eternal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; agony. Of course this can be nuanced too. With comp some weird gap 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seems to exist ... '
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MP: I do not understand this. I am surprised to notice, however, a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; faint resemblance to something I read once concerning the teachings of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; George Gurdjieff, an ethnic Armenian who became a teacher of 'esoteric 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; religion' and some very deep insights into how humans function, in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; early 20 Century. He died in 1952 in France. Gurdjieff was asked what 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was the truth about reincarnation, and the reply was along the lines 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of: talk of souls transmigrating from body to body over millennia was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; misleading, it is more like that if a person could not see what they 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; were really doing, and what they are, then they [we] are condemned to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; live and relive that same life - until we realise what is happening [I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suppose, or some such ... ].
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Well once upon a time I was very enthusiastic about George 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Gurdjieff's teachings but now I think just that his psychological 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; insights and practical methods were good but too much of his 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; metaphysics, for want of a better word, is pre-scientific in origin.
</em><br />
<br /><br />To make things simple, let me say that I think somehow the contrary. I 
<br />
believe that his metaphysics insights are basically &quot;correct&quot; or at 
<br />
least coherent with facts, theories, and philosophical principles which 
<br />
I think are almost beyond reasonable doubts, but I am less far 
<br />
convinced in the practical use of such insights. Now if that can help 
<br />
some people, why not, but, like sometimes with mystics, I'm afraid his 
<br />
disciples didn't got him right.
<br />
I don't think Gurdjieff metaphysics is pre-scientific, it is 
<br />
pre-aristotelian perhaps, and in that sense, it could be visionary. I 
<br />
know that I have much more to explain to you for making such things 
<br />
more palatable. See below.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Bruno: 'Have you an opinion on QM interpretation?'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  MP: Well, from my particular style of ignorance, I take it that QM is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a descriptive system that allows predictions and explanations to be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; made about how things do or will occur at the smallest scales of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measurement that scientists can currently observe. I take with a grain 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of salt all statements that the noumenal world, or even parts of it, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cannot exist without an observer. That world - 'The Great It' - I like 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to call it, exists whether we know about it or not. We participate and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; make things happen, but usually without being very aware of it. Our 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; awareness is what it is like to be the updating of the brain's model 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of self in the world, and this model is a cryptic, or encrypted, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; analogue system. It is complex and subtle but classical as opposed to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Quantum in nature, in that the dynamic logical entities which mental 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; objects and so forth are aggregate effects of literally millions of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; neuron interactions. I take it that harmonic resonance and all manner 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of standing wave effects are essential to the spatia-temporal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure of perceptions and other mental objects. So, AIUI, clearly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the world described by QM is very weird from our classical and naive 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience view point, but it is so whether we know about it or not. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The world we are normally aware of, or our experience of it if you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like, is our brain's analogue description of the emergent properties 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of space-time, energy and matter at our bodies' order of magnitude.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I should have asked you: &quot;what is you opinion on the QM ``theory&quot;, 
<br />
instead of ``interpretation&quot;. The problem with QM is above all a 
<br />
problem of choosing a theory (well before asking oneself how to 
<br />
interpret it). Currently, there is, well, let us say three theories (I 
<br />
count mine!):
<br />
<br />1) Bohr or Copenhagen theory:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= SWE + Wave-collapsing observation &quot;theory&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(this *is* a dualist form of the many world/state theory, where 
<br />
mind act on matter by making many worlds/states disappear by 
<br />
observation, in a way which eludes the SWE (Schroedinger Wave 
<br />
Equation). I agree with David Deutsch that QM is a theory of parallel 
<br />
universe, but I am not sanguine about words and you can call it a 
<br />
theory of superposable states. It is incomplete as far as the 
<br />
Copenhagen theory has never succeed in providing any serious clue about 
<br />
what is an observation and why does observation not follow the SWE. Cf; 
<br />
the &quot;measurement problem&quot;, Schroedinger cat, etc.
<br />
<br />2) Everett theory:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= SWE + COMP (or weaker form of COMP)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;(This is a theory which accept that observation itself obeys to the 
<br />
SWE, + a proof/argument showing that if we model the observer by some 
<br />
memory-machine, then the SWE explains completely why such machine feels 
<br />
as if they reduce the wave packet, although it is just a first person 
<br />
&quot;illusion&quot;. This is an indispensable theory for any macro use of QM 
<br />
(like Quantum Cosmology, quantum general relativity (black holes), 
<br />
etc.).
<br />
<br /><br />3) Your servitor's &quot;theory&quot;:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= COMP (or weaker)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(This is a theory which assumes that whatever I am, I am 
<br />
turing-emulable, + a proof/argument showing that this alone *has to* 
<br />
explain the appearance, in the mind of most universal machines,  of the 
<br />
SWE (and then of the wave collapse), or of the &quot;correct SWE&quot;, in case 
<br />
the SWE would appear to be incorrect.
<br />
<br />In this list, I am in good company. The main &quot;everything-list&quot; idea is 
<br />
that it is conceptually more elegant to accept or assume all realities 
<br />
and then to explain from that,  what is &quot;our reality&quot;  and why do we 
<br />
&quot;belong&quot; to it (using either ASSA or RSSA) .  To be sure the &quot;3)&quot; 
<br />
points only to the fact that if we take the comp hyp seriously we have 
<br />
to derive physics from computer science and number theory (I also 
<br />
explain a completely precise way of how to do that and get some nice 
<br />
results).  You can see that &quot;3)&quot; is to &quot;2)&quot; as &quot;2)&quot; is to &quot;1)&quot;: the 
<br />
sequence of 1,2,3 are just less and less redundant presentation of the 
<br />
same theory.
<br />
<br />Now, both assuming &quot;2)&quot; or &quot;3)&quot; it is hard to avoid a form of 
<br />
immortality, both individual and collective, making &quot;materialism&quot;, 
<br />
under the form &quot;I will die with certainty&quot; looking like a form of 
<br />
wishful thinking, I'm afraid.
<br />
<br />To sum up, I agree with the necessity of the skeptical inquiry 
<br />
attitude. Actually, I believe that &quot;modern science&quot; has begun with such 
<br />
an attitude, especially in front of the appearances.  I take Plato as 
<br />
saying &quot;reality&quot; or &quot;truth&quot; is what is beyond the appearance. Now I 
<br />
have finished reading Aristotle, and I am less sure he is the one 
<br />
responsible for (re)introducing the idea that reality is what we see 
<br />
and measure, but clearly that idea has had some success. But if we 
<br />
assume comp, we have to abandon it.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Bruno: 'Worst, I do believe this assumption is contrary to both 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logic+arithmetic (and comp) and with the empirical data'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  MP: What data?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Violation of Bell's inequality or of other classical tautologies. 
<br />
Quantum computing stuff, black hole behavior, electron or photons 
<br />
behavior, ...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MP: Existence entails being somewhere
</em><br />
<br />I don't think so. &quot;somewhere&quot; could be (and *is*, with comp) an 
<br />
emerging modality. The number 3 exists, but not somewhere. Believing in 
<br />
a absolute notion of &quot;somewhere&quot; is already making some physicalist or 
<br />
geometricalist  basic starting assumption incapable of fitting the comp 
<br />
hyp, or even just the empirical data (and some criterion of simplicity 
<br />
like occam razor). This is already implied by the Universal Dovetailer 
<br />
Argument, but you can just read Plotinus for a coherent theory where 
<br />
physicalist things like space and time emerged as secondary products.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and IMO, except possibly for the smallest conceivable distances of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Planck length, whatever it is that IS somewhere ENDURES while other 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things change around it.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Nothing endures so much as number theoretical truth, which is better 
<br />
conceived as being out of the realm of space and/or time. Then space 
<br />
and/or time can emerged as an internal view (modality).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have written before about my Process Physics inspired conception of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; connections [called Janus] being ultimately all that is and that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particles of matter and energy are knot-like, self-entangled 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concentrations of the every collapsing plenitude of simplifying 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; connections.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Hmm... Good intuition! I have purely mathematical results and 
<br />
conjectures which make knot theory a sort of possible bridge between 
<br />
number theory and physics. Entanglement arise from a notion of first 
<br />
person plural modalities.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It just seems to me to be logically necessary that existence and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; location are prerequisites for anything else.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I don't think so at all. I guess you believe this because you assume an 
<br />
aristotelian reality. I can explain how time (and hopefully one day 
<br />
space) emerge from relation between numbers. I do believe in time, like 
<br />
I do believe in consciousness, but those are very high level emerging 
<br />
(in a logico-arithmetical way, not in a spatio-temporal way) things.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps that should be existence, location and separation. But anyway, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; words fail and something like the Chinese Yin and Yang conception 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; actually makes a lot of sense [thinks: the interpenetration and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; eternal separation of two branes might be just that!]
</em><br />
<br />I like very much the &quot;I king&quot; and the Ying Yang, but comparing them 
<br />
with the branes is very speculative. But arithmetically you would be 
<br />
close to right if the branes could appear in the arithmetical 
<br />
interpretations of the fourth and fifth hypostases, and I hope so, but 
<br />
there remains a lot of work. The moonshine story (the discovery of the 
<br />
Bosonic string theory as a complex representation of the Monster Group) 
<br />
is going in that direction. It could be that the particles of &quot;physics&quot; 
<br />
are related, through comp, to the group of permutations of roots of a 
<br />
universal diophantine polynomial.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Numbers are written and imagined as existing in their own right
</em><br />
<br /><br />The problem is that we have to assume some independent existence for 
<br />
the numbers if we want to be able to explain a term like &quot;imagined&quot;. It 
<br />
seems to me it is more easy conceptually to accept some axiom of 
<br />
arithmetic and to derive a theory of machine's imagination (bearing on 
<br />
numbers, gluons and galaxies), than to take &quot;imagined&quot; as a primitive 
<br />
term for explaining the numbers.
