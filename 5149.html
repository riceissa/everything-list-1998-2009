<em class="quotelev1">&gt;representation of environment aspects&quot; etc.
</em><br />
<br />I'm not sure I really understand what you're asking for here. I'm applying 
<br />
the very same concepts of &quot;lifelike&quot; and &quot;sentient&quot; that I apply to 
<br />
configurations of matter here in our own universe. These concepts certainly 
<br />
have to do with the things you mention - perception of surrounding 
<br />
environment, information processing, the building of internal 
<br />
representations, action within the environment, etc. All of these concepts 
<br />
are essentially computational, and are highly general. They should be 
<br />
applicable to substructures in any computation-universal system.
<br />
<br />If you're asking how we would be able to recognize SASs (or even just 
<br />
lifelike substructures) in a 4D cellular automata, there's clearly no 
<br />
simple answer to that question. We can imagine running a giant computer 
<br />
implementation of a 4D world, with lots of software tools at our disposal. 
<br />
Obviously, we could examine the state of any bit in the lattice, and we 
<br />
could also build higher-level pattern-matching tools that would help us to 
<br />
recognize higher-level structures (like gliders, and perhaps larger 
<br />
molecule-like structures). To recognize lifelike substructures in the 
<br />
lattice, we would bring everything we know about computation, 
<br />
self-replication, information processing, etc., to bear on the subject. We 
<br />
already have some conception of what a self-replicating structure in 
<br />
Conway's Life universe would look like. I don't see any reason why we 
<br />
couldn't recognize such things if they arose naturally in some 4D CA that 
<br />
we were studying.
<br />
<br />I have no doubt that the problem would be difficult. I am also fully aware 
<br />
that we have no precise &quot;definition&quot; which infallibly distinguishes all 
<br />
&quot;living&quot; sub-structures from &quot;non-living&quot; ones. This is true for any 
<br />
universe, including our own. We know that elephants are intelligent, but do 
<br />
we really have a clear picture of what kind of sentience they possess? The 
<br />
science-fiction author Stanislaw Lem suggests that alien intelligences in 
<br />
our own universe might be as big as galaxies, and might look to us simply 
<br />
like clouds of cosmic dust.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;My guess is that that physical theory (and that subset of computations or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computed states) would end up being proven to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be essentially equivalent to the physical theory of  OUR universe.
</em><br />
<br />We may be starting a game of what Dennett calls &quot;burden tennis&quot;, but it 
<br />
seems to me that the burden is entirely upon you to support such an 
<br />
extraordinary claim. Are you suggesting that, for any CA we discover that 
<br />
contains SASs, if we analyze how those SASs gain information about their 
<br />
environment and how they affect it, if we analyze how their environment 
<br />
must seem *to them*, we will find that it looks essentially like our own 
<br />
quantum-physical, relativistic universe? I find that highly implausible, to 
<br />
put it mildly.
<br />
<br />Maybe you're simply arguing that our definitions of &quot;life&quot; and &quot;sentience&quot; 
<br />
are so tied to our particular physics that we simply wouldn't find SASs 
<br />
when we explore CA worlds. (Or, we'd only find them in those CA that manage 
<br />
to behave very much like our own universe, with QM and GR and all the 
<br />
rest.) Again, I find that highly implausible. I think our standard (fuzzy) 
<br />
conceptions of life and sentience are substantially more &quot;substrate 
<br />
neutral&quot; than that.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;You can't just say &quot;there could be life and sentience in this (arbitrarily 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;weird) set of constraints&quot; and then not bother to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;define what you mean by life and sentience. They aren't self-explanatory 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;concepts. Our definitions of them only apply
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;within universes that behave at least roughly as ours does.
</em><br />
<br />As I've said, my definitions of life and sentience are essentially 
<br />
computational, and they're the same ones I apply to groups of molecules in 
<br />
our own local universe. I think these definitions are applicable within any 
<br />
universes that are computation-universal.
<br />
<br />Of course, it should be obvious that my position rests on underlying 
<br />
positions about the possibility of computational models of life, 
<br />
consciousness, etc. If you don't believe, for instance, that hard-AI is 
<br />
possible, even in principle, then obviously you won't accept my 
<br />
conclusions, at least when it comes to intelligent SASs. But in that case, 
<br />
we're really talking past each other, and we need to back up - way up. (And 
<br />
frankly, I'm not interested in backing up that far.)
