Hi Nicole,
<br />
<br />I have promised to you some negative (and positive)
<br />
comments on Nielsen and Chuang book on quantum computation.
<br />
Rereading it in that state of mind, I realize I could make a comment
<br />
at each line, and I despair a little bit because it witnesses the gap
<br />
between &quot;philosophers&quot; &quot;logicians&quot; and &quot;physicists&quot; (&quot;i&quot; am
<br />
a mathematician, although I never asked for: I have studied math
<br />
because I suspected that Godel's theorem and Church thesis
<br />
bring light to the mechanist approach of the mind-body problem
<br />
which is the problem I am really working in).
<br />
First of all let me insist that Nielsen and Chuang book is one
<br />
of the better book for introducing quantum computation and quantum
<br />
information. It is also a beautiful book, and a solid one!
<br />
<br />Below is a sentence, taken from the introduction, which illustrates
<br />
my perplexity (page 4) (emphasis by the authors):
<br />
<br />&quot;This assertion, known as the *Church-Turing thesis* in honor
<br />
of Turing and another pioneer of Computer Science, Alonzo
<br />
Church, asserts the equivalence between the physical concept
<br />
of what class of algorithms can be performed on *some physical
<br />
devices* with the rigorous mathematical concept of a Universal
<br />
Turing Machine. The broad acceptance of this thesis laid the
<br />
foundation for the development of a rich theory of computer
<br />
science.&quot; (Nielsen &amp; Chuang page 4)
<br />
<br />I challenge anyone to find the word &quot;physical&quot; or any allusion
<br />
to physics in the whole work of Church, or even in the whole
<br />
logical work of Church, Kleene, Turing, Post, Godel, etc. (See the
<br />
book edited by Martin Davis &quot;The undecidable&quot; which contains
<br />
the original papers. Church proposed to identify the set of
<br />
intuitive or effective computable functions with the mathematical
<br />
set of functions definissable in his &quot;Lambda formal system&quot;.
<br />
The intuitive idea of effective computability is the idea of computing
<br />
by finite means whatever big the resource  needed in the process are
<br />
once they are finite but unbounded.
<br />
Although Church never mentioned the notion
<br />
of &quot;physical&quot; I do appreciate the idea that going from &quot;physical' to
<br />
mathematics is interpreted as an increase in rigor. I know David
<br />
should not appreciate this, because David has proposed a physical
<br />
version of Church Thesis as a more modern version of it, and
<br />
of course this is the point where I disagree in FOR. Deutsch thesis
<br />
is very interesting by itself, and it is better not to confuse it with
<br />
the proposal of Church. Note that the first who proposes &quot;Church Thesis&quot;
<br />
is Emil POST, who proposes it as a law of mind, and gives from it
<br />
the first simple and direct proof of the incompleteness theorem.
<br />
Post seems to have anticipated the whole story from Godel to the
<br />
immaterial monism of my thesis! (Well, actually in a footnote
<br />
added later  Post said that after discussing with Turing he came
<br />
back to dualism, but he did anticipate the form of immaterialism
<br />
monism which I show inherent to the comp hypothesis.
<br />
<br />Another example: more funny and more typical (in the spirit of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Copenhagen):
<br />
<br />&quot;Furthermore, measurement changes the state of a qubit, collapsing
<br />
it from from its superposition of I0&gt; and I1&gt;  to the specific state
<br />
consistent with the measurement result. [...]
<br />
Why does this type of collapse occur? Nobody knows. As discussed
<br />
in chapter 2, this behavior is simply one of the fundamental postulates
<br />
of quantum mechanics.&quot;  (N &amp; C page 15)
<br />
<br />I guess Nielsen and Chuang are just stating the quintessence of
<br />
the don't ask feature of Copenhagen philosophy. But why does people
<br />
add a &quot;fundamental postulate&quot; nobody knows, and actually nobody
<br />
can understand especially putted in that way? Here I would have
<br />
appreciate a footnote telling that some people does not believe that
<br />
such a collapse ever occur, and pointing to some literature (Everett,
<br />
Deutsch, etc.) which gives some explanation why the memory of such
<br />
collapse can be explained in strict respect of quantum linearity.
<br />
I believe in the long term the collapse gives a wrong idea of what
<br />
entanglement could possibly be in term of quantum information
<br />
(as I found apparent in the work of Cerf and Adami).
<br />
<br />A last example is the box 8.4 on Schroedinger's cat, it gives the
<br />
wrong idea that information on a cat which is in a superposition state
<br />
(alive + dead), by leaking into the external world will transform
<br />
that superposition state into a ensemble of cat being either alive
<br />
or dead.
<br />
I really does not understand what they mean. Such explanation
<br />
is meaningfull in a MW, or in a non-collapse QM. The box gives the
<br />
wrong feeling that a real collapse can be explained in QM, ...
<br />
<br />OK. It is an excellent book for learning QC and QI, but read
<br />
a book like &quot;the conceptual foundation of QM&quot; by Bernard
<br />
d'Espagnat, along with FOR book to prevent some implicit
<br />
Copenhagen &quot;philosophical&quot; prejudices.
<br />
Quantum computation is born through very fundamental
<br />
question asked by Einstein (notably) and dismissed by Bohr.
<br />
Through the work
<br />
of Bell, Feynman and Deutsch, those Einsteinian realist
<br />
questions have been shown testable (Bell ) and even
<br />
exploitable (Deutsch, Shor, etc.). It is a pity that, when
<br />
interesting fundamental questions leads to applications,
<br />
people feel to be allowed to dismiss the original questions.
<br />
It is on the contrary a sign that the questions were
<br />
meaningful, and, even if only for possible new future application (!)
<br />
worth to be taken seriously, and investigate closely.
<br />
<br />For quantum computation, you can also read the very excellent
<br />
book by Gruska. This one is rigorous at all level, i.e. in the math,
<br />
in the physics, and in the philosophy (that's very rare!).
<br />
But nothing being perfect, the Gruska book is not so pedagogical,
<br />
so, read perhaps the book by Nielsen and Chuang, and consult
<br />
Gruska.
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />
<br />Bruno
