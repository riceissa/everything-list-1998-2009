<br />
Let's keep it simple. Schools and universities (globally identifiable  
<br />
as 'the education industry') have traditionally fulfilled the role of  
<br />
fountains of knowledge. This is fine, up to the point where we realise  
<br />
that we no longer need to attend these places if all we want is  
<br />
knowledge (accumulated expertise, understanding of a field, the  
<br />
specific technical low-down necessary to gain a foothold in a certain  
<br />
area.) Increasingly the Internet fulfils this function in a direct and  
<br />
powerful way. It also presents a lot of pratfalls as well - as Brent  
<br />
was very hasty in pointing out, but then I would call 'using the  
<br />
Internet responsibly' a skill that probably cannot be learnt easily  
<br />
from the Internet. This is an example of what I mean when I say  
<br />
education should now teach skills rather than knowledge. I am not  
<br />
talking either about the vocational skills that many employers hotly  
<br />
desire from the education sector although nobody could deny that those  
<br />
skills should be taught as well.
<br />
<br />Above all what needs to be taught is the skill of thinking. Not  
<br />
compartmentalised, specialised, academic thinking, but OPERACY - how  
<br />
to get a result in a real and changing world. Bruno has referred (in  
<br />
his 'amoebas&quot; dissertation) to the value of posing questions in a  
<br />
childlike manner. Children have not yet submitted to &quot;the brainwashing  
<br />
known as academic specialisation&quot;. He has uttered a profound and above  
<br />
all, a useful truth in mentioning this, IMO.
<br />
<br />Have you ever tried to stand upright on a carpet that somebody is  
<br />
pulling along the floor from one end? Difficult. Ever learnt to ride a  
<br />
surfboard? Similar skill. The world around you is changing fast and  
<br />
you must strive to maintain some kind of relation to it that is useful.
<br />
<br />My point is that education fails badly to teach this kind of skill.  
<br />
Every banker, every businessman, every politician, every company boss,  
<br />
every worker, everybody in fact is &quot;flying by the seat of his pants&quot;  
<br />
right now but education remains smugly complacent about it's self- 
<br />
serving tradition. Kids go to school and learn to memorise a bunch of  
<br />
stuff, they sit for exams and in so doing mandate the school to set  
<br />
those exams and teach the stuff in the first place. The more you think  
<br />
about it the more circular it seems. It's not for nothing that we talk  
<br />
often about the 'education bubble'. By this we mean that in a certain  
<br />
sense, education is not the real world. The teacher puts something in  
<br />
front of the student. The student reacts to this using the vocabulary  
<br />
of knowledge taught up to that point. This means the teacher is always  
<br />
ahead of the student which is what lends the teacher their air of  
<br />
authority. In the 'real world' it isn't as simple as that. You have to  
<br />
invent initiatives and use risk-taking strategies to get ahead,  
<br />
increasingly we must do this on a daily basis now to even survive.  
<br />
There is no school subject, for example, that teaches &quot;economic  
<br />
survival following job redundancy&quot;, yet millions of people are facing  
<br />
precisely this dilemma right now. In a certain sense their education  
<br />
has taught them little of real value.
<br />
<br />Don't forget about &quot;the archway effect&quot;. This states that if a number  
<br />
of brilliant people are sent under an archway, then it is highly  
<br />
likely that from that archway will stream a number of brilliant  
<br />
people. You have to be brilliant to get in to Harvard. They don't take  
<br />
in the class 'dunce' in these institutions. The institution thus  
<br />
benefits more from the quality of the students than the students  
<br />
benefit from the quality of the institution.
<br />
<br />Because of the unavoidable tradition of historical continuity in  
<br />
education - which grew up, after all in the church, the least likely  
<br />
institution to welcome any form of new knowledge or innovation -  
<br />
education is marked by all the drawbacks associated with an  
<br />
overweening respect for 'historical continuity'. It is difficult to  
<br />
break with the patterns of the past. Teaching, education - call it  
<br />
whatever you want, was for a long time in the hands of ecclesiastical  
<br />
authorities who founded the vast majority of our elite educational  
<br />
institutions (not ULB - a good point in its favour) and so established  
<br />
the traditions of education. I often harp on about the need to teach  
<br />
'creative thinking' in my posts. Note that by this I do NOT mean  
<br />
artistic thinking but generative, innovative and risk-taking thinking  
<br />
generally. Critical thinking was and still is of paramount importance  
<br />
in the ecclesiastical world since it has proven the most effective  
<br />
weapon against heresy and deviation and since that world consists of  
<br />
concept edifices that must have internal consistency and validity if  
<br />
they are not to be overrun by outside ideas that would cause them to  
<br />
appear relativistic and thus to risk collapse. But all that is very  
<br />
far from the practical, messy world in which people have to think  
<br />
(often with very inadequate data) in order to solve problems and bring  
<br />
things about. Critical intelligence is very valuable. Critical  
<br />
thinking is an essential part of thinking. But critical thinking can  
<br />
never be the whole of thinking.
<br />
<br />The apostolic succession of educators in posts involving tenure and  
<br />
high levels of job security mirrors the smugness with which the  
<br />
education world holds its historical continuity in high esteem. It is  
<br />
highly amusing for me to see a computer scientist and systems  
<br />
architect such as Steve Wolfram innovating in such a way as to make  
<br />
these people seem less and less relevant.  Wolfram has his detractors  
<br />
for sure, many people think he is a bullshit artist, but he is also a  
<br />
risk-taking entrepreneur who has little regard for the sanctity of  
<br />
education institutions to claim some kind of monopoly in the knowledge  
<br />
game.
<br />
<br />Bruno speaks often of 'interdisciplinarity'. This is the need to  
<br />
escape specialisation, rather than to embrace it. Increasingly, I see  
<br />
this as the safe path for education in the future. We all know about  
<br />
the professor of quantum mechanics who was so expert in his field, he  
<br />
could not even work out how to buy sex in a brothel. I think they made  
<br />
a movie about it starring Marlene Dietrich. It is also true that the  
<br />
people who are the most likely to innovate in any field are not the  
<br />
hidebound ones, the pedants and the experts who act like oracles of  
<br />
all truth and wisdom. Anyone who claims to be an 'expert' at something  
<br />
is by definition expert in the state of knowledge up to that point.  
<br />
The expert's judgement is based on the past. The expert's judgement is  
<br />
based on what IS rather than what CAN BE. The expert is always being  
<br />
asked for expert opinions. The expert cannot risk his or her  
<br />
reputation. So the expert does need to stay on the side of caution.  
<br />
Better to say that something cannot be done, rather than to say that  
<br />
it can be done and to be responsible for some mistake. Experts are the  
<br />
guardians of the past and people expect them to be so. They are like  
<br />
priests of knowledge. A so-called 'expert' in QM has been telling me  
<br />
for ages how stupid all of you people are for imagining that MWI makes  
<br />
any sense. He laughs like a drain when I describe to him Bruno's  
<br />
teleportation gedanken experiment. He simply 'knows' that it is all  
<br />
fancy make-believe and that we are all engaged in some kind of new-age  
<br />
nonsense here. He is highly educated and highly respected as a  
<br />
teacher. Experts (specialists) once declared that for a rocket to get  
<br />
to the moon it would have to weigh a million tons. Experts once  
<br />
calculated that the total world market for computers would be just  
<br />
eight computers. These particular experts worked for the Xerox  
<br />
corporation. We all know what happened to Xerox in a fast-changing  
<br />
world. Experts once declared that the telephone was nothing more than  
<br />
an electronic toy.
<br />
<br />These days, everybody can stake out their field and research whatever  
<br />
they want. Life, however, is increasingly demanding that we all  
<br />
specialise a little bit in many areas. As Bruno says, his own field of  
<br />
thought is on the cusp of math, biology, psychology, theology,  
<br />
physics, logic, computer science etc. Descartes said that it would be  
<br />
best to teach all the sciences as one. Increasingly, the Internet is  
<br />
the EXPERT and we are the fuzzy, creative innovators who design new  
<br />
fields of endeavour with our vast realms of knowledge. A kind of  
<br />
emergence phenomenon, if you will.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this seems to be a so far undiscussed domain and I have some concerns.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; First off: the English usage mixes up 'education' with 'teaching'.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Schools have a task to transform unformatted teen-beasts into  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constructive beings, what I call 'education'. That may be a very  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; controversial thing, because the aim of such transformation may be  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; questionable (by many) - e.g. in the Ottoman Empire the education of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Janissaries produced uniform and brainwashed efficient killers.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But this is subject to intelligent evaluation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Secondly: relying on 'online' provided knowledge eliminates the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shame of the student (Sorry, teach, I did not do my homework) -  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which is a powerful educational momentum in raising responsible  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; people. More importantly the 'piped' ('wired', or rather:  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'wirelessed') science is uncontrolled and depends on the choosing  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; skill of the 'pupil' - if he so decides.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There are benedits (besides weaknesses, of course) in having a 'live  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and knowledgeable' teacher who verbally and demostratingly interacts  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with his pupils. Benefit: experience and accumulated knowledge plus  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the chance to simultaneously &quot;educate&quot; (see above). Weakness: the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; choice WHAT is to be included in such 'knowledge' to be taught.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I fully agree with 'creative thinking' to be included. What happened  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to those who have no resonance to the selected versions of it? (They  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; may be very talented in different domains). E.g. in a music school  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'composing' may be considered the 'creative', what only a fraction  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of talented musicians can muster (master?). How many Eifels.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Fultons, Bunsens were among the many million engineers who were  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instrumental in developing our advanced technology? Creativity  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should be encouraged, not made a fundmental in 'education'.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Disciplined well-founded professional knowoledge should prevail.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This maybe a bit conservative position of mine has a side-line to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; feed it:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; electronic libraries cannot replace a hard-copy self-stored one and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this is obvious to all who worked with old fashioned libraries  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; successfully. The main benefit: if you can stand before the shelf of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the particular topic and browse SOME similar-topic BOOKS you get  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ideas what you can check instantaneously in a neighboring book - or  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the same book sticking your finger to the page where you were. No  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Googling from 3,467,390 (or more)  entries. Electronics is good for  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; checking and responding once the topic is fixed. Even in responding  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you get only to a select audience, not as with an experienced  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; teacher, who 'knows' the different schools under divers keys.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; All that is hard to explain to the generation which never did  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; efficient research using old fashioned hard-copy libraries' lit- 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; search. Whoever did not experienced &quot;better&quot; will not accept that it  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can exist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I wonder if Bruno would like to give a list of URLs to youngsters  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and tell them: &quot;here is math/physics, learn it!&quot; - I will teach only  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; UDA and further.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I appreciate the efforts vested into AI - as preparatory for the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time when we really (will) know the &quot;I&quot; (intelligence and its  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; workings) to make an artificial approach for its mechanisation.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maybe a better contraption is also needed for such than our present  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; binary embryonic - level toy.
