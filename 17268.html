<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Really? I don't think so. Difficult, not yet very well known, and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; rather
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; subtle, no doubt.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But I don't think there is anything controversial. Nobody told me  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think the ordinary English usage of 'controversial' is that there is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; considerable disagreement - of which this list demonstrates ample
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proof!  It doesn't imply that it is wrong.  But I didn't mean to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; offend.
</em><br />
<br />You think about Peter Jones? I don't think we can call that a  
<br />
disagreement.
<br />
I think many understand UDA1-7, and many probably are interrogative on  
<br />
UDA-8, and the notion of comp supervenience. Some can be skeptical,  
<br />
but that is a sane attitude in front of a &quot;reversal&quot; proposition. I  
<br />
would not call that disagreement. May be we are trapped by different  
<br />
connotation due to english/french slight nuance.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  Bruno has shown (at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; least I agree with him on this) that for the mind to be regarded as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; computation,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The wording is a bit dangerous. All I know after UDA is that my  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; state of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; mind at time and place (x,t) has to be linked to an infinity of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; computations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; going through that state, and that my next state, from my first  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; person point
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of view is indeterminate on the set of all those computations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, I'll avoid saying &quot;a computation&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; essentially everything else must also be regarded in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; same light: IOW our ontology is to be understood entirely from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; perspective of numbers and their relations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; True, but this excludes quickly that it can be conceived a priori as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; computations. Immaterial relation between numbers, sure, but not  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; necessarily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; computable relation. Cf the first person indeterminacy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; This is not universally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; accepted, but more on this in the next section.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; This is not universally understood, nor really studied. But it is  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; understood
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; quickly or slowly when studied. To my knowledge.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; When I make a gesture to one side of the argument (i.e. the simple
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fact that they don't - in fact - accept it) the other side objects!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I understand your frustration.
</em><br />
<br />But who does not accept what? You worry me. Scientists don't play the  
<br />
game of accepting or not accepting proposition. They understand, they  
<br />
refute, or they criticize, the axioms, or the validity of a reasoning.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Suffice it to say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that on this basis we would appear to have a situation where the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; appropriate set of computations could be regarded not as mere
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'emulation', but in fact *as real as it gets*.  But this of course
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; also renders 'stuffy matter' irrelevant to the case: it's got to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; numbers all the way down.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; No. With the first person indeterminacy it would be more correct to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; say that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; it's got to be number all the way up.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, I nearly said 'all the way up'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It makes the comp immaterial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; appearance of &quot;stuffy matter&quot; infinitely complex and non turing  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; emulable, a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; priori. I suspect you have not yet really see the role of UDA1-6 in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; step-7.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ah, this is a key point, I suspect.  Now, in my pre-UDA (&quot;beam me up
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Scotty&quot;) way of thinking about it, I saw that teleportation could be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; coherent only if consciousness was seen in terms of a movable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; viewpoint within some larger context, not as consisting in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'thing-in-itself' - hence the a priori 1-person indeterminacy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Consequently this also implied that the brain - matter itself - must
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be seen somehow in this way too, but I was unable to say how.  Anyway,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; now I see the Star Trek part as UDA1-6.  UDA-7 introduces the UD
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; itself, and from this, that &quot;comp &quot;stuffy&quot; matter has to be made by a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; infinite sum of infinite computations including infinities of white
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rabbits-computations&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />It is more the comp stuffy matter appearances which has to be made  
<br />
by ...
<br />
OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; UDA-8 crucially shows - finally - that the computations cannot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; themselves supervene on stuffy matter - i.e. the 'stuffy TM' one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; previously assumed they were running on.
</em><br />
<br />I am not sure I understand. What UDA-8 shows is that consciousness is  
<br />
not related to the physical activity of some machine. Consciousness is  
<br />
related to the truth of some arithmetical relations which defines the  
<br />
computations going through the relevant states at the right level and  
<br />
below.
<br />
Computation can supervene on the comp-stuffy matter. Without this no  
<br />
first plural person, nor personal computer.
<br />
Hmm.. My be I see what you say, cautious with the wording, or I miss  
<br />
something ...
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  So the overall picture
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; derived from this is that both the first person and the appearance of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter are complex - and, in any specific instance, a priori
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indeterminate - emergents from this infinite blizzard of computation;
</em><br />
<br />Well, it is the problem of matter to which comp force to reduce the  
<br />
mind-body problem. But that blizzard is a well structured part of the  
<br />
arithmetical reality, so it is a mathematical problem. AUDA provides  
<br />
already information on the solution.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; hence 'individual instances' of minds and bodies can't be regarded as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'isolated computations'.  Is this is what you mean when you say that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter is &quot;non turing emulable, a priori&quot;?
</em><br />
<br />A priori, to predict with 100% accuracy the result that &quot;I&quot; will  
<br />
observe when doing an experience in physics, I will have to run the  
<br />
entire UD*, which is an infinite task. Empirically we can bet on very  
<br />
long computations with many high level stable emerging pattern which  
<br />
makes most of them easily simulable, but those are the hard to justify  
<br />
with comp, they have to be relatively multiplied to &quot;save the internal  
<br />
appearance&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 4) If we don't accept 3) then we can keep stuffy matter,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; We can't by step 8;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Surely we can if we're willing to drop the computational theory of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mind?  Note that I say this later on (another sequencing problem).
</em><br />
<br />OK, sorry.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; but by the whole UDA 'stuffy matter&quot; does no more make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; sense at all.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, but my point was that one isn't forced to accept the UDA, as long
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as one is equally willing to give up the computational theory of mind.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Faced with the UDA, I suspect many non-specialists might well see
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that as preferable to relinquishing their grasp on stuffy matter.  I'm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not making claims about the correctness of positions here, I'm just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contrasting them.
</em><br />
<br />No problem, you are right. To abandon 1500 years of Aristotelian  
<br />
theology will take time, especially for the atheist which have to  
<br />
understand they were doing theology without saying.
<br />
<br />But you can' disagree with such type of work, because it is mainly  
<br />
question made precise. A statement of a problem. Now this problem was  
<br />
under the rug, since long, and many materialist thought that  
<br />
mechanism, per se, solve the problem.  But comp, per computer science,  
<br />
can only make the problem precise, mathematical.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The comp &quot;stuffy&quot; matter has to be made by a infinite sum of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; infinite computations including infinities of white rabbits- 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; computations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The apparent computability of the physical laws *is* a problem for  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; indexical computationalist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; but at the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; cost of losing the digital computational model of both mind and body.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Most want introduce a stuffy matter because they believe they can  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; save
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; computation for both mind and body.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, but I agree with you that this doesn't work.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Not everyone agrees with that radical assessment, I know;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Who disagree? It is not a question to agree or not. It is a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; question of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; understanding or not (or to find a mistake).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Whoa!  It's a fact that not everyone agrees.  This is obviously true,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because when I don't say this, the ones that don't, start disagreeing!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Your point is that disagreement isn't refutation (or even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understanding).
</em><br />
<br />In science, we can always succeed in agreeing  on what we disagree,  
<br />
and then it means we propose different theories. Before that it is the  
<br />
hard work to understand the theory.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; but even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; those who don't concur presumably do hold that everything that  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; happens
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; finally supervenes on something stuffy as its ontological and causal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; basis, and that numbers and their relations serve merely to model
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; this.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; That is comp, before UDA, before the necessary reversal.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The reversal is necessary only to save the computational theory of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mind, surely?
</em><br />
<br />Yes. But it is also welcome to give a rationale spectrum of where the  
<br />
laws of physics come from.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The stuffiness doesn't of course mean that the evolution of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; physical systems can't in principle be specified algorithmically,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Comp-stuffiness *is* a priori not algorithmic.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, but I was referring here to matter in the stuffy sense, precisely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to *contrast* it with the comp sense.  IOW mathematics is still
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;unreasonably effective&quot; even if it turns out that comp doesn't go
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; through as a TOE.
</em><br />
<br />Hmm... If comp is true, then elementary arithmetic goes through as a  
<br />
TOE.
<br />
Comp is an axiom of a sort of &quot;theology&quot;, a belief in a form or  
<br />
relative incarnation (yes doctor). Then that theology entails that we  
<br />
don't need more than elementary arithmetic, for the ontology, and  
<br />
arithmetic+induction, for an epistemology, at least for having the big  
<br />
shape. Comp entails that the question of the ontic existence of  
<br />
anything more than what we can defined in arithmetic is absolutely  
<br />
undecidable. We cannot know the cardinal of the universe, in a sense.  
<br />
But from inside, there is not one drop of Cantor paradise, which can't  
<br />
help us. There is a sort of Skolem phenomenon.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'emulated' on a TM if that is possible; we still have mathematics  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; model of stuff and its relations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; UDA entails there is no stuff at all. No stuff capable of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; justifying in any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; way the observation of stuff.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, of course, I know this!  This is what makes me think you have a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem with the way I present the argument in stages.  I was trying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to characterise the stuffy model in its own terms (with the caveat
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that IMO this entails abandoning the comp theory of mind),
</em><br />
<br />OK, my fault. I read too quickly.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; as well as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comp (however inadequately) also in its own terms.  I just get
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; confused when you interpolate comp objections when I'm not saying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anything about comp.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But it does entail that no digital
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; emulation of a physical system can - as a mere structure of numbers -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; be considered the 'real thing': it's got to be stuffy all the way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; down.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Well, with comp+physicalism. But this is inconsistent, at the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; epistemological level.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, but there's no reason to claim that comp is necessarily the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *only* theory of mind.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Of course. But apart from its many weakenings (for which AUDA continue  
<br />
to work) I don't have heard about other &quot;rationalist&quot; approach.
<br />
I tried to build one, a very long time ago, when I was still believing  
<br />
in the quantum wave collapse.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Physicalism itself isn't necessarily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inconsistent at the epistemological level, but it does need a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different theory of mind - IMO.
</em><br />
<br />I am not even sure of that, but I have no proof, yet. :-)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Rather, it seems to me that in our various discussions on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; emulability or otherwise of physics, we may sometimes lose sight of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; whether we are interpreting in terms of numerical or stuffy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ontologies.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But &quot;stuffy&quot; or just primitively physical, after UDA has no more any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; meaning.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Again, surely only on the basis that a stuffy theory still hangs on to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comp as a theory of mind?  Can't we escape the UDA in this way, even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in principle?
</em><br />
<br />To escape UDA, you have to invent a substantial matter, a substantial  
<br />
mind, and glue them in a way that makes them unduplicable. Using  
<br />
infinities does not help, you have to use genuine complex infinities  
<br />
which prevents your mind to slip in the mathematical world, where  
<br />
infinities can self-multiply. To identify yourself to your quantum  
<br />
state, could seem a good idea, because by the non cloning theorem,  
<br />
your necessarily unknown state (by comp) cannot be cloned, but this  
<br />
does not work because you remain &quot;preparable&quot; in many similar states,  
<br />
and the UD will do this all the times.
<br />
To escape UDA, I am afraid that you will have to diagonalize it, but  
<br />
it is closed for the diagnalization, so perhaps with strong oracles, I  
<br />
don't know.
<br />
Only the ONE could perhaps escape UDA, that is comp's consequences.  
<br />
AUDA points toward the idea that comp makes just the argument against  
<br />
physicalism simpler, but that physicalism could be inconsistent by  
<br />
itself. But I really don't know anything for sure. It is very complex.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Be that as it may, the punchline is: do we find this analysis of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; distinction between numerical 3) and stuffy 4) to be cogent with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; *specific* respect to the significance and possible application of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; concept of 'emulation' in each case?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; You don't yet have grasped the UDA yet. It makes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the stuffy things not just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; useless for having computations and relative emulation, but it  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; makes, it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the big hard point, any notion of stuffiness, irrelevant for physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; objects too.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, I'm always willing to stand corrected, but I had hoped in my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; post on Olympia to show you finally that I had indeed grasped
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *exactly* this point. My questions in this post about emulation were
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; really directed to clarifying the stuffy-ontology position, as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; result of the debate with Colin: i.e. what does emulation mean in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stuffy context?
</em><br />
<br />OK sorry.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The common sense view is that - if stuff is primitive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - emulation can only be a 3-description.  However, if numbers are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; primitive, then in principle mathematical structures - in very special
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relation, as you argue - actually *constitute* reality, not just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; describe it.
</em><br />
<br />Yes. But in the sense that you are relatively immaterial, when your  
<br />
wife offers you two new bodies for your birthday. Despite this is  
<br />
present in the material frame, &quot;you&quot; somehow is already immaterial.  
<br />
You own your bodies. This immaterial being is a reality.
<br />
I expect many realties of that kind, be it person, people, game,  
<br />
galaxies, photons, etc.
<br />
The common sense believes in particles, and everything is made of  
<br />
those particles, and their laws are the fundamental laws. Comp is  
<br />
threatening only the last point, the fundamental aspect of such laws,  
<br />
they have to justified once comp is assumed.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think what muddies the waters all the time is the physicalist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumption that 'immaterial computation' can still be claimed account
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for the mind on the basis of a stuffy ontology.  Without this, we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would have more or less the simple dichotomy I propose: i.e.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stuffy-ontology =&gt; stuffy stuff + stuffy mind;
</em><br />
<br />That's OK. If &quot;stuffy&quot; in &quot;stuffy-mind&quot; is enough sophisticated in its  
<br />
non-comp aspect, then you can save physicalism. This is somehow what  
<br />
Penrose tried.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; or comp-ontology =&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comp stuff + comp mind.
</em><br />
<br />More or less OK. stuff, mind, etc. become arithmetical reality as seen  
<br />
from inside from some angle.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Each side could then argue against the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other's position, but at least without laying claim to each other's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'stuff'!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; There is just no stuff available. Even if we introduce it, it makes  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; change in consciousness, and can't have any relation with what we  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; observe in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; nature
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; On the basis of the comp theory of mind-body: yes, definitely, no  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; question.
</em><br />
<br />OK. thanks for that precision. I remain open to the idea that someone  
<br />
find that there is something wrong in the reasoning given the  
<br />
difficulty of the subject.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We will come back on this.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK,
<br />
<br />Bruno
