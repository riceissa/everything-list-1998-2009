Hi,
<br />
<br />Roadmap:
<br />
<br /><br />There are two things I can hardly separate: UDA, that is the Universal 
<br />
Dovetailer Argument, which is an argument showing that if you take 
<br />
seriously enough the hypothesis that we are digitalizable machine then 
<br />
it follows that *necessarily* the physical laws, among more things (see 
<br />
below), emerge from the relation between numbers, in a verifiable way.
<br />
This includes relative relations between particular numbers and what I 
<br />
will call from now on Universal Numbers.
<br />
And UDA points on a way to explicitly extract the physical laws: just 
<br />
interview one of those universal numbers.
<br />
I say above that the physical laws emerges, among more things
<br />
Among more? Not only UDA forces the quanta to emerge from numbers, but 
<br />
the interview shows that they emerge in the company of many non 
<br />
communicable truth, even many sort of non communicable truth, some of 
<br />
which are good candidates for playing the role of qualia. In that case 
<br />
quanta appears to be sharable qualia.
<br />
<br />It is in the UDA that I have introduce the first and third person 
<br />
discussion (the expression itself coming from philosophy of mind). In 
<br />
the UDA the definition of first person *discourse* is quite specific: 
<br />
it is the content of a diary, or of any local memorization of a result 
<br />
of self-localisation (like Washington and Moscow) after 
<br />
self-duplicating experiments. Note that here some &quot;universe&quot; or 
<br />
&quot;universal story&quot; is presupposed in the thought experiment. Third 
<br />
person person discourse are then defined by the content of a diary of 
<br />
some external observer, where external refer to the 
<br />
reading-annihilating (cut) and reading reconstituting (copy) pair of 
<br />
boxes.
<br />
<br />The last version of UDA has 8 steps: (CT is for Church's thesis)
<br />
<br />1) classical teleportation (Here the 1-discourse is equivalent with the 
<br />
3-discourse, up to the use of the indexical &quot;I&quot; by the candidate)
<br />
2) Classical teleportation with delay (Here already the 1 and 3 
<br />
discourses diverge)
<br />
3) Self-duplication (Here the first person indeterminacy appears)
<br />
4) Self-duplication with asymmetric delay.
<br />
5) Teleportation without annihilation of the &quot;original&quot;
<br />
6) Virtual 1+2+3+4+5 (the preceding steps with virtual reconstitutions)
<br />
7) Universal 1+2+3+4+5 (Here appears the universal Machine and the 
<br />
Universal Dovetailer. CT is used)
<br />
8) Arithmetical 1+2+3+4+5 (Here the UD appears to be &quot;just&quot; Sigma1 
<br />
truth).
<br />
<br />It follows from that that &quot;ontologically&quot; (perhaps in a weaker sense 
<br />
than usual, or at least in a weaker sense than Peter D. Jones' use of 
<br />
the term) the following theory is enough. It is often named Robinson 
<br />
Arithmetic and denoted by Q. It is a tiny segment of elementary 
<br />
arithmetic. As a theory, it is a very poor theory, completely incapable 
<br />
of making the slightest generalization. But yet able to prove all the 
<br />
sigma1 truth, which by Church thesis, makes it capable of representing 
<br />
all computable functions, that is the Fi and the Wi, etc. Put in 
<br />
another way, although Q has few provability abilities, it has the full 
<br />
universal power of a universal turing machine or of any (relative) 
<br />
universal number.
<br />
<br />So:
<br />
<br />TOE 1 (Ontology, formally presented)
<br />
<br /><br />Classical first order logic with equality,   together with the symbol 
<br />
0, s, +, *
<br />
<br />The intended meanings of 0, s, + and * are respectively the number 
<br />
zero, the successor function (which sends a number n on its successor 
<br />
n+1), and addition and multiplication.
<br />
<br />The axioms are:   (where &quot;Ax&quot; should be read: &quot;for any number x&quot;, and 
<br />
&quot;Ex&quot; should be read &quot;it exists x such that &quot;, and &quot;x ­ y&quot; abbreviates 
<br />
~(x = y))
<br />
<br />Q1)   Ax        0 ­ s(x)
<br />
Q2)   AxAy    x ­ y -&gt; s(x) ­ s(y)
<br />
Q3)   Ax        (x ­ 0  -&gt;  Ey(x = s(y))
<br />
<br />Together with the definition of addition:
<br />
<br />Q4)   Ax        x + 0  =  x
<br />
Q5)   AxAy   x + s(y)  =  s(x + y)
<br />
<br />and the definition of multiplication:
<br />
<br />Q6)   Ax         x * 0  =  0
<br />
Q7)   AxAy    x * s(y) = (x * y) + x
<br />
<br />Just remember that the roadmap point: UDA shows that &quot;ontologically&quot;  
<br />
Q1+Q2+Q3+Q4+Q5+Q6+Q7 is enough for a (comp) TOE.  As a machine, which 
<br />
dynamics is governed by the inference rules of logic (modus ponens, 
<br />
rule for the quantifiers), Q is recursively isomorphic to a UD.  By its 
<br />
Church-Turing completeness, it is universal for computability.
<br />
<br />KEY REMARK: although computability-complete, the theory Q is very weak 
<br />
in term of provability power. It cannot even prove that any numbers has 
<br />
a successor (Ax Ey (y = s(x)), although Q can prove all individual 
<br />
statements Ey(y = s(0)), Ey(y=s(s(0))), Ey(y=s(s(s(0))), etc. Q can 
<br />
prove (modulo the notation) that 1+3 = 2*2,  that 1+3+5 = 3*3, that 
<br />
1+3+5+7 = 4*4, etc., but Q cannot, like the greeks, generalizes and 
<br />
concludes that the sum of any sum of the first odd positive integers 
<br />
are perfect squares. Q can prove, for each number n and m, that n+m = 
<br />
m+n, but cannot infer that (n + m = m + n) is true for all n. Still, Q 
<br />
has the full power of being able to prove ExP(x) in case P is decidable 
<br />
and true, and this makes Q sufficiently powerful to prove 
<br />
metamathematical statements like the theory &quot;ZF can prove the 
<br />
consistency of me (Q)&quot;. Here we are invited to NOT DOING Searle's 
<br />
error, consisting in confusing computation (simulation, emulation) and 
<br />
provability (or any higher belief system notion). In a sense Q can 
<br />
imititate ZF proving Q's consistency, but Q can hardly believe (prove) 
<br />
ZF's consistency, and Q can certainly not infer her consistency from 
<br />
ZF's proof of it. Give me time and Einstein's brain, and I can emulate 
<br />
Einstein's opinion about the loop-gravity/string theory debate, but 
<br />
this will not entail I will understand it. It is capital to understand 
<br />
this, because it will explain eventually how from a little ontology (Q 
<br />
theory), we will get an infinitely rich and unbounded epistemology 
<br />
&quot;from inside Q&quot; or from inside the work of a UD.
<br />
<br /><br />TOE 2 (Epistemology, will permit the &quot;universal interview&quot; which will 
<br />
include &quot;physics&quot; and in fact all Plotinus' hypostases (n-person point 
<br />
of view).
<br />
<br />An observer will be any consistent extensions of Q. Peano Arithmetic is 
<br />
probably the most celebrate one, like ZF, or axiomatizable second order 
<br />
arithmetic (Analysis), same+omega-rule (as example of angels), or 
<br />
(&quot;gods&quot;) the set of all statement of arithmetic (written in ZF) which 
<br />
are true in all transitive models of ZF, etc.
<br />
<br />I will fix the idea by choosing Peano Arithmetic (PA) for the begining 
<br />
of the universal interview. Q, as the UD, generate (in a precise 
<br />
arithmetical sense) all the proofs, made by all the consistent 
<br />
extensions of itself, and we will keep an eye on what PA says about 
<br />
itself and its consistent extensions. This will be equivalent with the 
<br />
study of what a self-referentially correct machine can prove about 
<br />
itself.
<br />
<br />Formally PA is just Q1+Q2+Q3+Q4+Q5+Q6+Q7 together with an infinity (but 
<br />
mechanically generable) of induction axioms:
<br />
<br />For any predicate P definable in Q (or PA, they have the same 
<br />
language), PA believes that (think about an infinite range of 
<br />
dominoes):
<br />
<br />[ if P(0) and Ax (P(x) -&gt; P(s(x)) ]  -&gt; AxP(x)
<br />
<br />This gives to PA a tremendous ability to generalize. It is not even 
<br />
clear if not all current mathematic (except logician's set theories and 
<br />
categories) can be proved in PA. And of course PA is lobian, by which I 
<br />
mean PA's provability are captured by the modal logics G and G*.
<br />
<br />Suddenly grand-mother stops me: Bruno, you get too much technical ... 
<br />
keep the hypostases for another posts, it will be too much ...
<br />
<br />OK, it was an attempt. Please keep this post for letter references. But 
<br />
the extraction of physics (and the other hypostases/persons) is 
<br />
entirely based on the arithmetical self-reference logics, and I can 
<br />
hardly explain this without introducing the basic notions. Recall that 
<br />
once we have a modal logic we can use some canonical multiverse 
<br />
attached to it.
<br />
<br />But don't hesitate to comment. Nevertheless in the next one we get the 
<br />
n-person arithmetical notions.
<br />
<br />Bruno
