<br />
To clarify what I meant by &quot;past uncertainty&quot; and tie it into this thread
<br />
title, &quot;Which universe are we in&quot;, it is necessary to adopt a certain
<br />
view towards instantiations of consciousness.
<br />
<br />If my mind, as a physical or computational system, is instantiated
<br />
in multiple places, whether multiple universes, multiple branches of a
<br />
many-worlds interpretation (MWI), or even multiple places and times in one
<br />
universe, the question is how that appears to me from the first-person
<br />
perspective.  I am adopting a position that from my point of view, it
<br />
is indeterminate which of those instantiations I am now experiencing.
<br />
There is no &quot;fact of the matter&quot; as to which one is me, now.
<br />
<br />The alternative is to say that although all of these instantiations
<br />
are in some sense indistinguishable, nevertheless the instances of
<br />
consciousness produced by these systems are all distinct.  That is, for
<br />
each instance of consciousness, there is a single physical system which
<br />
creates that consciousness.  All of the physical systems are similar, or
<br />
even locally identical, so that the consciousness instances produced are
<br />
all structurally the same.  But nevertheless we would not say that there
<br />
is one consciousness which spans all the implementations; rather, there
<br />
are multiple consciousnesses which merely &quot;look alike from the inside&quot;.
<br />
<br />Anyway, that is the opposite of the view I am taking for the purposes
<br />
of this discussion.  I am assuming the former position, that my present
<br />
consciousness is being instantiated widely throughout the multiverse
<br />
and I can with equal justification think that I am experiencing any
<br />
of those instantiations.  My consciousness, in that sense, spans many
<br />
parts of the multiverse, and the question of &quot;which universe am I in&quot;
<br />
has no unique answer.
<br />
<br />That is how we can reconcile the notion of a cleanly determined &quot;third
<br />
person&quot; past with an indeterminate &quot;first person&quot; past.  Each universe
<br />
has a uniquely defined past history (we will stipulate), but since it
<br />
is ambiguous which universe my mentality is currently occupying, there
<br />
is also ambiguity about which past is mine.
<br />
<br />We might note that in the MWI we also have a somewhat similar effect
<br />
with regard to the future.  In the MWI, the universe is completely
<br />
deterministic.  There is no randomness.  Yet we are able to reconcile
<br />
a deterministic &quot;third person&quot; view with an indeterminate, random,
<br />
&quot;first person&quot; perspective.  It is quite possible to have objective
<br />
determinism while having subjective indeterminism, as long as &quot;identity&quot;
<br />
is sufficiently slippery.
<br />
<br />And note too that as we move into the future, although we face subjective
<br />
indeterminism, we will still have a consistent consensus reality.
<br />
The events of the quantum future are undefined for us, but we know that
<br />
we will all experience consistent versions of those events.  In the same
<br />
way, subjective indeterminism in the past still allows for consistent
<br />
consensus reality.  As we gain information about the past, we will all
<br />
learn consistent information.
<br />
<br />The way this works, in both the future and the past, is that as we gain
<br />
this information, there is a subjective &quot;split&quot; and different versions
<br />
of ourselves will gain different sets of information.  But each group
<br />
of observers which is communicating together will see a consistent view.
<br />
The future splitting is that which is described by the QM wave function,
<br />
the formation of a relative state.  The past splitting is different
<br />
and relies on the speculative philosophical interpretation I described
<br />
above; as we learn about the past, mind instances which were formerly
<br />
indistinguishable become distinct.
