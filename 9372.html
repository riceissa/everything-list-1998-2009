<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; your answer, but the fairy is kind enough to give you a little more if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; you ask.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; You can ask the question to very little children. The cutest answer I

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; got was &quot;7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7&quot; (by a six year old). Why seven? It was the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; age of his elder brother!
</em><br />

</em><br />

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (computable) functions, and then try to diagonalize it. S can be

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; {addition, multiplication, exponentiation,  .... (?)....}. More hints
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and answers later. I let you think a little bit before. (Alas it looks
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I will be more busy in may than I thought because my (math) students
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; want supplementary lessons this year ...).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Any potentially largest finite number n that I could name could be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; incremented by 1 so this finite number could not be the largest. The 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; trick is not to name a particular number but to specify a method to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reach the unreachable.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Well, if *you* try to give the biggest natural number, *you* will never 
<br />
stop, and you will not succeed in specifying a large number, and the 
<br />
fairy will not make your wish coming true, and you will gain nothing. 
<br />
It would be absurd not saying 10^100 under the pretext that you would 
<br />
have prefer to live &quot;(10^100)+1&quot; years.
<br />
By trying to reach the unreachable, well, you are anticipating another 
<br />
fairy which I will present to you once you will be able to diagonalize 
<br />
without even thinking ...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Method 1) Use the fairy power against her.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I see you like to live dangerously. Or to die dangerously should I say 
<br />
....
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; She says she has &quot;finite power&quot;. Ask for precisely the largest number 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of days she can provide with her &quot;finite power.&quot;
</em><br />
<br /><br />*any* FINITE number !
<br />
It is up to you to choose one in particular. And to succeed in 
<br />
describing which one.
<br />
Recall that the set of all finite things (or numbers) is infinite.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This method is similar to the robber's response when the victim asks 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; him &quot;how much money do you want?&quot;: &quot;All the money in your pocket.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Method 2) Use the concept of &quot;limits&quot; Ask for as many days it would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; take to obtain a sum of 2 as terms in the series 1+1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1/16..... If the fairies knows any math she may argue that the series 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; never reaches 2.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />And she is right!
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; On the other hand I may argue that &quot;in the limit&quot; it does reach 2.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Yes but to reach that limit you need an infinity of additions. The 
<br />
serie is convergent, and you can go as close as you want to 2 in finite 
<br />
steps, but 2 itself requires an infinity of steps, and the fairy asks 
<br />
you to specify a precise number, actually the biggest you can specify 
<br />
precisely (through some algorithm, program, description) using a 
<br />
reasonable amount of paper. The better is to describe a growing 
<br />
function applied to some number. Although it looks a little bit 
<br />
ridiculous, the child solution: &quot;9 + 9&quot; contains the basic good idea: 
<br />
applying a growing function you know (or can program), like &quot;+&quot;  on a 
<br />
big number that you know, like 9. Of course &quot;9 * 9&quot;  is better, and 
<br />
&quot;9^9&quot; is still better, ... (?) ....
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Method 3) Come up with a unprovably non-halting problem:
</em><br />
<br /><br />Again, you are anticipating on the next sort of fairy I will present 
<br />
later. The current fairy is somehow constructivist, and ask you to 
<br />
specify a number as big as you can describe, but it must be a precisely 
<br />
well defined  number.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; For example ask for as many days as required digits in PI to prove 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that PI has a single repetition of a form such that digits 1 to n 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; match digits  n+1 to 2n. For example 2^0.5 = 1.4142135... has a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; single repetition (1 4 match 1 4) in which digits 1 to 2 match digits 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3 to 4. Similarly  79^0.5=8.8881944 and 147^0.5= 12.12435565. Note 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the repetition must include all numbers 1 to n from the beginning 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and match all number n+1 to 2n The problem with this approach is I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't know for sure if PI is repeatable or non-repeatable (according 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to above requirements.)  I don't even know if this problem is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unprovable. All I know is that the probability for any irrational to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have a single repeat is about 0.1111. For PI the probability is much 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lower since I already know PI to a large number of digits and as far 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as I can see it does not repeat. However, with this approach I could 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be taking chances.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Indeed.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Diagonalization clearly allows you to specify a number outside any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; given set of number, but I have not been able to weave it into this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argument.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I will say more in my reply to Hal Finney who gives a good start.

<br />
<br />&lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;fixed&gt;Now I think I should train you with diagonalization. I
<br />
give you an=20
<br />
<br />exercise: write a program which, if executed, will stop on the biggest=20
<br />
<br />possible natural number. Fairy tale version: you meet a fairy who=20
<br />
<br />propose you a wish. You ask to be immortal but the fairy replies that=20
<br />
<br />she has only finite power. So she can make you living as long as you=20
<br />
<br />wish, but she asks precisely how long. It is up too you to describe=20
<br />
<br />precisely how long you want to live by writing a program naming that=20
<br />
<br />big (but finite) number. You have a limited amount of paper to write=20
<br />
<br />your answer, but the fairy is kind enough to give you a little more if=20
<br />
<br />you ask.
<br />
<br />You can ask the question to very little children. The cutest answer I=20
<br />
<br />got was &quot;7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7&quot; (by a six year old). Why seven? It was the=20
<br />
<br />age of his elder brother!
<br />
<br /><br />Hint: try to generate an infinite set S of more and more growing and=20
<br />
<br />(computable) functions, and then try to diagonalize it. S can be=20
<br />
<br />{addition, multiplication, exponentiation,  .... (?)....}. More hints=20
<br />
<br />and answers later. I let you think a little bit before. (Alas it looks=20
<br />
<br />I will be more busy in may than I thought because my (math) students=20
<br />
<br />want supplementary lessons this year ...).
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/fixed&gt;
<br />
<br />&lt;/excerpt&gt;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Any potentially largest finite number n that I could name could be
<br />
incremented by 1 so this finite number could not be the largest. The
<br />
trick is not to name a particular number but to specify a method to
<br />
reach the unreachable.
<br />
<br />&lt;/excerpt&gt;
<br />
<br /><br />Well, if *you* try to give the biggest natural number, *you* will
<br />
never stop, and you will not succeed in specifying a large number, and
<br />
the fairy will not make your wish coming true, and you will gain
<br />
nothing. It would be absurd not saying 10^100 under the pretext that
<br />
you would have prefer to live &quot;(10^100)+1&quot; years.
<br />
<br />By trying to reach the unreachable, well, you are anticipating another
<br />
fairy which I will present to you once you will be able to diagonalize
<br />
without even thinking ...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />&lt;excerpt&gt;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Method 1) Use the fairy power against her.=20
<br />
<br />&lt;/excerpt&gt;
<br />
<br /><br /><br />I see you like to live dangerously. Or to die dangerously should I say
<br />
=2E...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&lt;excerpt&gt;She says she has &quot;finite power&quot;. Ask for precisely the
<br />
largest number of days she can provide with her &quot;finite power.&quot;=20
<br />
<br />&lt;/excerpt&gt;
<br />
<br /><br />*any* FINITE number !=20
<br />
<br />It is up to you to choose one in particular. And to succeed in
<br />
describing which one.
<br />
<br />Recall that the set of all finite things (or numbers) is infinite.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />&lt;excerpt&gt;This method is similar to the robber's response when the
<br />
victim asks him &quot;how much money do you want?&quot;: &quot;All the money in your
<br />
pocket.&quot;
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;Method 2) Use the concept of &quot;limits&quot; Ask for as many days it would
<br />
take to obtain a sum of 2 as terms in the series 1+1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 +
<br />
1/16..... If the fairies knows any math she may argue that the series
<br />
never reaches 2.=20
<br />
<br />&lt;/excerpt&gt;
<br />
<br /><br /><br />And she is right!
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&lt;excerpt&gt;On the other hand I may argue that &quot;in the limit&quot; it does
<br />
reach 2.
<br />
<br />&lt;/excerpt&gt;
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Yes but to reach that limit you need an infinity of additions. The
<br />
serie is convergent, and you can go as close as you want to 2 in
<br />
finite steps, but 2 itself requires an infinity of steps, and the
<br />
fairy asks you to specify a precise number, actually the biggest you
<br />
can specify precisely (through some algorithm, program, description)
<br />
using a reasonable amount of paper. The better is to describe a
<br />
growing function applied to some number. Although it looks a little
<br />
bit ridiculous, the child solution: &quot;9 + 9&quot; contains the basic good
<br />
idea: applying a growing function you know (or can program), like &quot;+&quot;=20
<br />
on a big number that you know, like 9. Of course &quot;9 * 9&quot;  is better,
<br />
and &quot;9^9&quot; is still better, ... (?) ....
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&lt;excerpt&gt;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Method 3) Come up with a unprovably non-halting problem:=20
<br />
<br />&lt;/excerpt&gt;
<br />
<br /><br />Again, you are anticipating on the next sort of fairy I will present
<br />
later. The current fairy is somehow constructivist, and ask you to
<br />
specify a number as big as you can describe, but it must be a
<br />
precisely well defined  number.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&lt;excerpt&gt;For example ask for as many days as required digits in PI to
<br />
prove that PI has a single repetition of a form such that digits 1 to
<br />
n match digits=A0 n+1 to 2n. For example 2^0.5 =3D 1.4142135... has a=A0
<br />
single repetition (1 4 match 1 4) in which digits 1 to 2 match digits
<br />
3 to 4. Similarly=A0 79^0.5=3D8.8881944 and 147^0.5=3D 12.12435565. Note
<br />
that the repetition must include all numbers 1 to n from the beginning
<br />
and match all number n+1 to 2n The problem with this approach is I
<br />
don't know for sure if PI is repeatable or non-repeatable (according
<br />
to above requirements.)=A0 I don't even know if this problem is
<br />
unprovable. All I know is that the probability for any irrational to
<br />
have a single repeat is about 0.1111. For PI the probability is much
<br />
lower since I already know PI to a large number of digits and as far
<br />
as I can see it does not repeat. However, with this approach I could
<br />
be taking chances.
<br />
<br />&lt;/excerpt&gt;
<br />
<br /><br />Indeed.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />&lt;excerpt&gt;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Diagonalization clearly allows you to specify a number outside any
<br />
given set of number, but I have not been able to weave it into this
<br />
argument.=20
<br />
<br />&lt;/excerpt&gt;
