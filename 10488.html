David,
<br />
your post has wits. Yet it reminded me of 'atheism' which starts from the
<br />
&quot;belief&quot; it is supposed to deny. I am not an atheist, because I do not know
<br />
what to deny: what do people 'think' to call &quot;god&quot;?
<br />
My question to comp was (and I think it is different from your position):
<br />
Let me &quot;IN&quot; into learning about 'comp' from the outside, the 'no comp'
<br />
mindset.
<br />
When you say: &quot;Comp is false&quot; you accepted it and argue about &quot;IT&quot;.
<br />
I ask &quot;What is comp - if I am outside the entire mindset and don't assume&quot;?
<br />
<br />Bruno is VERY logical and knowledgeable, but his 'mindset' includes numbers
<br />
and mathematical thinking. I got a lot of good responses from him to my
<br />
questions and all started from some &quot;in theory&quot; assumption (e.g. 'assuming
<br />
comp', etc.). What if we do NOT assume it?
<br />
<br />I asked about 'numbers' stripped from counting and quantities. Otherwise
<br />
they are only quantizing adjectives (6 what?). (Like the 'color green'?)
<br />
&quot;Pure&quot; mathematics works differently, it even substitutes the numbers with
<br />
other symbols (yes, 'symbols', if we do not think of the 'what').  I
<br />
differentiate an &quot;applied math&quot; in the sciences, working with quantities
<br />
identified within the limited topical models of the science. This is another
<br />
subject, - I want to concentrate here on the &quot;numbers&quot; concept.
<br />
<br />Ideas 'exist' relationally (and some are translated into physical
<br />
(materialistic) features). To get to 'ideas' a receiving observer is
<br />
necessary with enough complexity to accept them.  (Then we (our mind)
<br />
interpret them into the perception of reality).
<br />
In my older thinking (prone to be revised) I defined my 'information'
<br />
concept as some difference 'accepted' into an observer. The difference can
<br />
be e.g. an electric (so called) potential and the acceptor )observer!) even
<br />
a polar(!) moelcule(!),  - or at a different level: a difference, like a
<br />
strange societal story is accepted by a reader of G.B.Shaw (observer).
<br />
(Existence in this ontology was the difference itself, observer anything
<br />
that accepts information.)
<br />
<br />When the developing human 'mind' reached the complexity to identify
<br />
'numbers' the numbers enetered the human thinking. Does it make sense to
<br />
argue a homoiusion war whether they existed &quot;before&quot; they could be accepted?
<br />
For 'us' they started to exist when our mind became capable to 'accept' such
<br />
information.
<br />
It is only semantical in our syntax to call this situation an &quot;invention&quot;.
<br />
It is only semantical in our syntax to call this situation an &quot;invention&quot;.
<br />
Then we started to count and think in quantities using the newly &quot;invented&quot;
<br />
'numbers'. But what are these 'numbers' without the counting and quantizing?
<br />
<br />Do they have a quantitative original meaning? Originally the 'unit' was 2,
<br />
and '1' was half of it in certain cases. In my language which is older than
<br />
the Indo - European ones a man with 1 eye is &quot;half-eyed&quot; and with 1 hand or
<br />
foot i said to have lost his &quot;half&quot; hand or foot. Yet a man is 1, a sable is
<br />
1, not 2. Many was 5, seemingly from the fingers, and in Russian grammar
<br />
they have a dual case and a &quot;big plural&quot; above 5.  (Also: a 'unit' involves
<br />
more than one by its meaning).
<br />
<br />David, I do not go all along your long post.
<br />
These remarks came to mind  - I don't write a dissertation.
<br />
Your idea was an intreresting one. My original reaction (above) was a
<br />
reminiscence to a 'believer's' challenge that I should 'disprove' god and my
<br />
answer was: only, if you prove something to exist can I refute it.
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />John Mikes

Subject: The anti-roadmap - an alternative 'Theology'
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Comp is false&quot;. Let's see where *that* leads. I'm erecting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this as a signpost to indicate a direction, and I would beg the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; list's indulgence in helping me to look in this direction, rather
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than confining its comments to the ramshackle construction of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; signpost itself. My hope is that you will help me to expose whatever is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; untrue or confused about what follows (I'm sure you will!). But I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hope you will also 'catch my drift'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) The bit-stream
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Comp deals with a bit-stream representation of appearance. The theorems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of comp process this bit-stream in terms of a formal system, creating a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; framework within which 'true or 'false' theorems may be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evaluated. This system is by its nature closed, or tautological. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; statements that can be made, their 'truth' or 'falsehood', are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inherent in the axiomatic and operational characteristics of the formal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; system as applied to the bit-stream.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) The instantiation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In order to implement the comp approach, an instantiation is required
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that will represent the bit-stream and enact the formal operations. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Turing machine is an idealised version of such an instantiation. A
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; digital computer is a physical version of a TM. Consequently comp may
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be instantiated in a digital computer, and copied in innumerable media
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that suitably preserve its informational structure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3) Dimensionality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The bit-stream is 'pure' information and as such is 0-dimensional.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Multi-dimensionality emerges only at the level of the active
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instantiation of the bit-stream. Consequently what is Turing-emulable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is the bit-stream (which includes a statement of the required formal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; operations - i.e. the program) and because this emulation is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 0-dimensional, it is indifferent to form ('substrate-independent').
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Also because it is 0-dimensional, it is inherently powerless to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interact directly with multi-dimensional reality. All such interaction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; takes place because what is implicit in the bit-stream is rendered
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explicit by its multi-dimensional instantiation. Although we may speak
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; metaphorically (i.e. 'as if' projecting 'form' on to it) of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bit-stream as 'representational' in a virtual 0-dimensional sense,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this is powerless as such to cause any interaction with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multi-dimensional environment. To do this requires that additional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information, merely implicit in the bit-stream, is rendered explicit by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the instantiation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If we consider an 'intelligent program' instantiated in a digital
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computer, 'explicit form' - multi-dimensionality - is 'added
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; back' at the interfaces where the machine interacts with the external
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; environment. For example, a display device transforms the bit-stream
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; into pixels in a 2-dimensional arrangement. At the next 'layer' up,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a user decides whether to interpret the 2-dimensional arrangements
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; semantically (i.e. 'these are symbols') or graphically (i.e.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'this is a quasi-3-dimensional scene'). Up another layer, and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; user transforms these judgements into direct interaction with a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multi-dimensional environment.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; All pure bit-stream representations rely on implicit environmental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumptions in order to 'execute' as intended. DNA, for example,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relies for its expression both on its multi-dimensional orientation in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; space, and the materials present in the local environment. This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information is not present, though implicit, in the codons, but is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *made explicit* by the environment that instantiates them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4) Form
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The 'physical' description of the world, as I was rightly reminded
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by Peter, has no significant layering (well, perhaps it does, but more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; later). Appearance, however, displays complex layering, and as we have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seen, this also 'appears' to extend to the intelligibility of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world in which we 'appear' to participate. 'Form' and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'layering' somehow emerge from whatever the physical model
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; describes as a bit-stream. When we experience and interact with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world, we do so in a way that is inherently multi-dimensional. What is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; represented in this way is directly 'grasped' or 'enacted'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (i.e. represented, structured) in multi-dimensional 'form' and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unfolded by multi-dimensional 'motor units' into action in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multi-dimensional world. This is both what makes it non-invariant to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Turing-emulation, and gives it its direct multi-dimensional linkage to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; enaction in multi-dimensional environments. Certainly, 0-dimensional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bit-stream representations and pathways are entailed in such processes,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but they serve to store and transmit information, not to enact its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaning or its consequences in the world  - i.e. its intentionality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as information-put-into-action.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 5) Correlation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; How is the above to be correlated with the physical or bit-stream
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; representation? Through appropriate forms. We already know this from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the fertility of 'laws of form' that are intrinsic to science as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; practised - whether physical, chemical, biological, physiological,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; psychological, sociological, and so on up the 'levels'. At each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; level, 'laws of form' are abstracted that render this world-view
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intelligible, although they are not directly implied at the level below
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - hence Peter's comment about the 'lack of layering'. So,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consider the brain. We can approach this through the lens of a variety
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of forms - squidgy grey mass, neural network, bio-electrical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; circuitry, neuro-chemical pathways, etc. - even 'digital
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computer'. None of these has yet succeeded in capturing a 'formal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; decomposition' that yields appearance, or even a mechanism that seems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; capable of enacting the construction of  multi-dimensional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; representation as experienced.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, as the above analogies indicate, this is not a fruitless task,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but an empirical one. There have been, and still are, innumerable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'formal decompositions' of the world that have served only to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multiply mystery. The world, as we know, stands on the backs of an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; infinite stack of turtles, and motion is accomplished through the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; efforts of an innumerable insensible angelic host. ????? .......... We
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should be looking for a 'formal decomposition' of the brain that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; embraces both isomorphic representation of, and direct
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multi-dimensional interaction with, the external environment of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; body, and beyond it the world. We should expect these forms to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'construct boundaries', the 'lines of cleavage' that do not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exist in the 0-dimensional physical description. We should ask - from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; either side of this cleavage - 'who is looking, listening, tasting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what lies on the other side?' The 'side' that is able to answer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; these questions intelligibly by enacting its responses in the world is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the 'perceiver'. The other is the 'perceptual model'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The explicit multi-dimensional 'grasp' of form is what I contend
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; makes all this non-invariant to Turing emulation. Note that I've not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; said 'non-Turing emulable', since anything that can be represented
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as a bit-stream may be Turing-emulated, but the issue here is whether
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multi-dimensional experience and enaction is invariant to such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emulation. My claim is that it can't be, because it requires the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instantiation to explicitly 'add back' the missing information that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is only implicit in the 0-dimensional  emulated bit-stream. It is this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that makes multi-dimensional environments 'non-invariant to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computation', as opposed to 'non-computable'.  This is IMO the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'understanding' - the multi-dimensional enaction of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multi-dimensionally-represented information - to which, for example,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Penrose appeals as the source of mathematical intuition. It isn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Platonic reality to which the mathematician, or any of us, has direct
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; access, but rather the multi-dimensional forms from which these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'perfect' concepts are abstracted.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 6) Indexical existence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Missing information? Surely this isn't the dreaded 'hidden
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; variables'? I don't think it is. The missing information is what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (some of us) are trying to express by 'I assert my indexical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence as a necessary fact'. This 'information' is entirely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; absent from the physical or other formal (virtual, or what we've
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sometimes rather unfortunately called 3rd-person) accounts of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appearance/ reality. It expresses itself self-referentially, and this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; expression has 'qualities' (again what we perhaps unfortunately
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; call 'qualia', but  let it serve). I contend that qualia carry the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaning *like this!*, or more simply *this!*. From such 'codons'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; worlds of  'thisness' emerge. Since 'thisness' is at the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time the instantiation of the multi-dimensional environment, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'thisness' of experience' can transform directly to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'thisness' of enaction in the world. This is what we call meaning
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and intentionality. The project of mapping and correlating our accounts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the world-as-appearance-and-meaning and the world-as-structure has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; been well-termed 'Dual-aspect Science'. Let's get on with it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 7) Mass, space, gravity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If the foregoing is speculative, what follows is ruminative. Having
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dismissed 'form' as significant in a physical decomposition of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality, does this perhaps force a re-appearance at the point where QM
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; collides with General Relativity - i.e. where the bit-stream hits the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instantiation? Curved space, gravitational interaction - these seem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intrinsically geometrical/ topological/ 'shaped' ideas. Is there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any analogy here to the relationship of formal description to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instantiation? I wonder.....
