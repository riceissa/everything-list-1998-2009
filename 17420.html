<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But also - just to dispose once and for all of this particular point -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I want to be sure that you understand that I'm not arguing *for*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; eliminative materialism, except as devil's advocate (I'm sure you know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; this).  But one aspect of my recent discussions with Peter has been to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; bring to a focus the strict consequences of materialism, in precisely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the honest way that you attribute to Dennett.  The trouble is, that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Dennett, having eliminated the mind and hence the notorious 'problem',
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; still cheerfully carries on deploying the same mind-dependent concepts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; as though nothing had happened!  In other words, his position is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; inconsistent and incoherent.  It's dualism for free!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Nope. He is a reductionist, not an eliminativist.
</em><br />
<br />Yep.  Perhaps you haven't perused &quot;Consciousness Explained&quot; recently.
<br />
The whole point is that you can't be a reductionist in the Quinean
<br />
sense - which Dennett (more or less honestly) is - without being an
<br />
eliminativist.   The passage that you commented approvingly actually
<br />
used the term 'eliminative materialist', for goodness sake!  The
<br />
reason that anyone might imagine that they could be is simply because
<br />
of the all-too-understandable tenacity of first-person intuitions.
<br />
Despite the (imagined) 'reduction', one can't help but go on
<br />
*imagining*!   IOW - since one is in fact conscious - one can't help
<br />
but deploy the same mind-dependent (i.e. first-person) concepts that
<br />
are supposed to be eliminated (i.e. made redundant) by the reductive
<br />
(i.e. third-person) account of mind.   So the distinction between
<br />
reduction with and without elimination turns out to be that between
<br />
eliminative materialism (the former) and material-mental 'dual aspect'
<br />
theory (the latter).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; So, in this context, let me try to understand your remark: &quot;with or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; without assuming PM (primitive matter) there is an mathematical notion
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of computation and of computability&quot;.  I would say - per Dennett, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; understood *consistently* - that under the assumption that there is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; *only* primitive matter (i.e. material monism) - there strictly can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; no appeal to such a notion as computation, because mathematics itself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is eliminable per Qine.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That isn't elimination in the sense of eliminativism.
</em><br />
<br />What other sense do you have in mind?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Don't misunderstand me - this is what is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; *wrong* with material monism - because to be consistent, one is either
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; honestly forced to such an eliminativist conclusion (but then you must
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; deny your own consciousness and all mental concepts), or you tacitly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; accept a form of dualism (but again without noticing!)  So I suppose
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that when you say &quot;with primitive matter&quot; that you don't mean
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;**only** with primitive matter&quot;, but rather &quot;with primitive matter +
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; computation&quot; - which is in effect a dualistic assumption.  Again,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; please don't misunderstand me - I regard comp as a coherent *monistic*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; approach to both mind and matter that seeks to 'eliminate' neither,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and which brings the mind-body issues into full focus. But the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; assumption of PM *in addition* would transform it into a type of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; epiphenomenal dualism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You are still confusing reduciton/identity with elimination
</em><br />
<br />Thanks for the excellent summary, but I assure you I'm not confusing
<br />
them, I just want to know which is intended in a given case.  I'd
<br />
always assumed that your materialism went hand-in-hand with some
<br />
identity-based hypothesis of mind (or at least the possibility of
<br />
such).  I was surprised - and consequently commented - when you
<br />
appeared to endorse a passage citing physical reduction as an approach
<br />
to elimination of human concepts.  If I misunderstood what you meant
<br />
by &quot;I agree&quot;, please just correct the misunderstanding.
<br />
<br />That being said, I do in fact think that 'identity' - even 'dual
<br />
aspect' - theories can't really avoid being an unacknowledged back
<br />
door to dualism.  It's part of the 'sweeping under the rug' of the MBP
<br />
I think, because the attempt to stretch the notion of 'identity' to
<br />
the point of literally *equating* consciousness with 'primitively
<br />
material' processes is ultimately to rob either of any sense.  I
<br />
suspect you may wish to respond that consciousness is not a matter of
<br />
ontology, but epistemology.  But in fact this is directly contradicted
<br />
by the identity hypothesis itself: though we may differentiate the
<br />
contents of consciousness from the context in which they are
<br />
immediately apprehended by use of the term 'epistemological', that
<br />
very container is ex hypothesi *identical* to that of the material.
<br />
IOW: content = epistemology, but context+content = ontology.
<br />
<br />As you correctly remarked, it is rare for anyone to have a new idea,
<br />
so I don't indulge the fantasy that I'm proposing anything original.
<br />
Schrödinger, for example, articulated it rather clearly, commenting
<br />
that if as monists, we must choose a singular ontology, then it would
<br />
be curiously blind to reject the one of which we have indubitable
<br />
knowledge.

<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Early eliminativists such as Rorty and Feyerabend often confused two
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different notions of the sort of elimination that the term
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;eliminative materialism&quot; entailed. On the one hand, they claimed, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cognitive sciences that will ultimately give people a correct account
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the workings of the mind will not employ terms that refer to common-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense mental states like beliefs and desires; these states will not be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; part of the ontology of a mature cognitive science.[4][5] But critics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; immediately countered that this view was indistinguishable from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; identity theory of mind.[1][13] Quine himself wondered what exactly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was so eliminative about eliminative materialism after all:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;        Is physicalism a repudiation of mental objects after all, or a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory of them? Does it repudiate the mental state of pain or anger in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; favor of its physical concomitant, or does it identify the mental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; state with a state of the physical organism (and so a state of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical organism with the mental state)? [14]  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; On the other hand, the same philosophers also claimed that common-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense mental states simply do not exist. But critics pointed out that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; eliminativists could not have it both ways: either mental states exist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and will ultimately be explained in terms of lower-level
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; neurophysiological processes or they do not.[1][13] Modern
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; eliminativists have much more clearly expressed the view that mental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; phenomena simply do not exist and will eventually be eliminated from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; people's thinking about the brain in the same way that demons have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; been eliminated from people's thinking about mental illness and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; psychopathology.[3]
