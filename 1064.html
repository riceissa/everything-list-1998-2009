Hans' ideas are quaint and curious, but ultimately vacuous, IMHO.

</em><br />
<br />Here I think Hans has finally revealed what the hell he has been
<br />
talking about.  He is talking here in general about a &quot;simulation&quot;.
<br />
In this usage, &quot;simulation&quot; can mean just about anything - the dream
<br />
I had last night, a fleeting thought I have about a fictional character,
<br />
an image I have of a teddy bear talking, the text inside a Sherlock
<br />
Holmes book.  A simulation is an elided construct representational
<br />
of something else.  Hans has said above that the more elided the
<br />
simulation, the more general it is, and the more applicability it can
<br />
have.  I agree that that's often immensely useful.
<br />
<br />So any simulation encodes some physical laws, perhaps very generally.
<br />
Those physical laws delimit an ensemble of universes which contain
<br />
(by assumption) SAS's.  Fine.  But Hans seems to go further to submit
<br />
that an elided simulation actually is the reality it is simulating.
<br />
But at the same time, he has said that an implementation is not
<br />
important for existence.
<br />
<br />So is a simulation an implementation, or isn't it?  If I imagine
<br />
terrible things, like hitting somebody I don't like, have I actually
<br />
generated universes in which injustices have been done?  Or did those
<br />
universes exist already, and I've just opened up a window into them?
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From Hans' disjoint rantings, it's difficult to say which he 
</em><br />
believes.  
<br />
<br />I don't believe it's an empty question -- it would have consequences
<br />
with regard to the measure of those simulated universes.  And I don't
<br />
see the point of saying that the universe I've thought about has
<br />
&quot;measure 1&quot; to me.  Do we all agree that there must be some absolute,
<br />
objective measure over universes?  If not, I see no hope for ever
<br />
saying anything useful about the AUH, and we might as well all sign
<br />
off now.
<br />
<br />The answer to the question would have obvious ethical consequences as 
<br />
well.  In the former case, where each simulation in one universe 
<br />
affects the measure of others, it would be difficult to determine how 
<br />
the measure is affected.  It might be possible, but I foresee 
<br />
problems.  Does the amount of elision play a role in the affect?
<br />
<br />In the latter case, his view is isomorphic to the view that fictional
<br />
characters are not real.
