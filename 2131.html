<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  for our reference class. It would appear that the Doomsday argument is

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  in direct contradiction with the Fermi paradox. I am rather

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  uncomfortable about this, and my preference would be to accept the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Any comments?

<br />It is with great hesitation that I place this post...
<br />
<br />The following is an idea which I have had for a while and which I have never 
<br />
seen expressed. My hesitation stems from the possible nefarious consequences 
<br />
of talking about it. Yet, an idea cannot remain bottled up for long. So here 
<br />
it is. The idea is simply this:
<br />
<br />ET is not here because he understand the MWI and possibly did QS.
<br />
<br />Let me elaborate. When a civilization in the universe reaches the point where 
<br />
its members understand the MWI, they are basically faced with a choice. Their 
<br />
decision depends on what kind of &quot;people&quot; they are. I can imagine several 
<br />
possibilities:
<br />
<br />1) They consider life a &quot;game&quot; to be played according to the rules of the 
<br />
universe where they are. If they win, great! If they lose, no problem! they 
<br />
know that life continues on a different branch. They play the &quot;game&quot; to the 
<br />
fullest, but always retain a sportmanlike attitude toward the lesser 
<br />
civilizations which have not reached their level of knowledge. Their attitude 
<br />
ranges from a passive non-interference with these lesser civilizations, to 
<br />
being guardians to and actively protecting them against any kind of 
<br />
interference by other civilizations. They remain hidden &quot;guardian angels.&quot; 
<br />
HENCE NO ET OF THIS KIND CAME TO EARTH. 
<br />
<br />2) They look at the MW and adopt a fatalistic attitude. Why bother since 
<br />
everything happens anyway? Their civilization decays, and they become 
<br />
insignificant or disappear entirely from the universe. HENCE NO ET OF THIS 
<br />
KIND CAME TO EARTH.
<br />
<br />3) They are neither protective of others nor fatalistic. Since they 
<br />
understand the full possibilities of QS, this is precisely what they do. By 
<br />
defining the specifications of the world he desires and then performing QS 
<br />
(unless these specifications are satisfied) ET restricts himself to that 
<br />
world. Doing so, he becomes the God of that world, but cease existing in our 
<br />
own. HENCE NO ET OF THIS KIND CAME TO EARTH.
<br />
<br />In summary, the only ETs we can hope eventually to contact are the ones still 
<br />
in existence in our universe - the guardian angels - In fact, they may be 
<br />
waiting for us to start reaching out to, and interfering with, other worlds, 
<br />
to make their presence known. 
<br />
<br />It is my hope that we shall follow the first of these three possibilities: 
<br />
become guardian angels ourselves. A more likely scenario is that we shall 
<br />
follow the three of them. Some of us will become guardian angels, some will 
<br />
die out because of fatalism, and some will do QS - die to become Gods.
<br />
<br />Of course all this (especially the second and third possibilities) hinges on 
<br />
the relativistic notion that measure does not decrease with death, and I know 
<br />
how sensitive this issue is in this group.
