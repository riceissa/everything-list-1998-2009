<br />Peter
<br />
<br />It's a bit late in the day perhaps to tell me you 'don't even know what
<br />
I mean by first person'!  However, I'll have another go.  I'm concerned
<br />
to distinguish two basic meanings, which failing to specify IMO causes
<br />
a lot of confusion:
<br />
<br />1) First person 1 (FP1) - the point-of-view that is directly claimed by
<br />
an individual (FP1i) such as David or Peter, or what is generally meant
<br />
when the word 'I' is directly uttered by such a person.
<br />
<br />2) First person 2 (FP2) - representations of an FP1 point-of-view as
<br />
modelled within members of the FP1 community. The usage of 'David' or
<br />
'Peter' in point 1) exemplifies one type of such representation, whose
<br />
presumed referent is an FP1i person.
<br />
<br />My speculation is that both of the above arise through specific sorts
<br />
of differentiation of an axiomatically FP1 context (FP1g).  My reason
<br />
for this speculation is to simplify the ontological assumptions.  If
<br />
our existential context is FP1 then any zone within it is also FP1 and
<br />
consequently, when structured into FP1i persons, yields the direct
<br />
experience with which we all claim familiarity.  I have been at pains
<br />
to point out that the nature and content of experience are a function
<br />
of such structure, and we shouldn't think in terms of 'conscious rocks'
<br />
or whatever.  Having established such an FP1 context, we can then go on
<br />
to show that FP2 and third person (TP) are simply other zones, not
<br />
themselves organised for self-experience/ self-reporting, that are
<br />
categorised in specific ways for specific purposes. They are not novel
<br />
ontological states.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You seem to think that the boundraries of the self are given by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; secondary,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non-fundamental structures and properties, likewise qualia.
</em><br />
<br />This is a good point.  However, it prompts me to deny that the
<br />
structures you refer to are 'secondary'.  In claiming the FP1 context
<br />
to be 'primitive', I'm saying that it is irreducible. We have to begin
<br />
somewhere.  Likewise, in relying on 'differentiation' of this context
<br />
(and here I'm designedly agnostic about whether this 'differentiation'
<br />
resolves into comp, strings, or whatever) I'm also claiming the
<br />
independent irreducibility of primitive differentiation.  I've
<br />
discussed this in one of my replies to Bruno in this thread.  Clearly
<br />
the undifferentiated FP1g context can yield no experience since thus
<br />
conceived it can have no 'content', either 'perceiver' or
<br />
'what-is-perceived'.
<br />
<br />So it must be differentiated.  Now it seems to me that such a basic
<br />
notion of differentiation (prior to any schematisation into
<br />
fundamental-object-of-the-month) is primitive and irreducible, not to
<br />
say semantically paradoxical (since an undifferentiated whole that is
<br />
the sum of everything cannot in logic rely on symmetry-breaking from
<br />
any source whatsoever).  Such apparent paradoxicality is a good test of
<br />
'primitiveness'. Both primitives are required, because without the
<br />
'whole', the mutual transmutability of all phenomena is
<br />
incomprehensible, and without the 'part', no phenomena can arise at
<br />
all.  Consequently the differentiation process, and the structures to
<br />
which it gives rise, are as fundamental as the context itself.
<br />
<br />As to 'qualia', I'd like to put it as follows. In my account of things,
<br />
our existence within the FP1g context is what gives us our purchase on
<br />
the (rest of the) world, what enables us to 'grasp it'.  Whatever we
<br />
perceive, we do so in terms of our existence in this form.  Such direct
<br />
access, what we sometimes call 'experience', is by this token both
<br />
incorrigible, and literally indescribable.  To take one of the
<br />
favourite examples, the 'experience of red', this is something which we
<br />
know by 'direct grasp', and as such it takes its place within our
<br />
'shareable knowledge base', or SKB.  But we cannot 'describe' (i.e.
<br />
reduce) this direct experience, even to ourselves.  What we can do is
<br />
to refer to it ostensively - to 'point' to it - and to relate it to
<br />
other elements within the SKB.
<br />
<br />This puts us on precisely the same footing as the other members of the
<br />
FP1i community with whom we can share the SKB. So IMO 'qualia' are an
<br />
attribute of the FP2-type modelling of the SKB.  You know what I mean
<br />
by the term because we can both 'point' to parts of the SKB that in our
<br />
view possess this attribute.  But the 'redness-of-red' is the medium,
<br />
the 'means whereby', we grasp some element of the world directly, and
<br />
is in itself not transmissible - it's not part of the SKB information
<br />
content, it's the *medium* of the SKB (and everything else).  In this
<br />
direct FP1 aspect 'red' is a fundamental structure based on a primitive
<br />
context with a primitive process of differentiation.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why shoukdn't FP1i be the most primitive 1st-person,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arising from 0-personality ?
</em><br />
<br />It depends what you want 0-personality to mean.  Of course I don't
<br />
claim that FP1g has 'personality' in the FP1i sense of a single
<br />
individual point-of-view.  What I'm claiming is that both have the same
<br />
ontological status, and since when we come to the 'individuation' of
<br />
the context - i.e. ourselves (amongst others) - we know incorrigibly
<br />
that this ontology is first-personal, this status must per simplicitas
<br />
be first personal.  You may wish to distinguish 0-personal from third
<br />
personal, in which case we might be able to agree on a more mutually
<br />
satisfactory terminology (I'd be more than happy to abandon my terms
<br />
for more transparent ones).
<br />
<br />In my view the conceptual problems in trying to rationalise first
<br />
personal with third personal is that IMO 'third person' is an attribute
<br />
applicable only in a metaphorical or classificational sense to
<br />
'objects' within the SKB.  The SKB is the 'third personal world', but
<br />
because ordinary language and inter-personal discourse forces us to
<br />
communicate exclusively in terms of the SKB, this puts us into a
<br />
schizoid state between the 'world-out-there' (i.e. our ostensive
<br />
references to the SKB, the FP2 or descriptive world) and the
<br />
'world-in-here' (i.e. our 'experience' or 'direct grasp' of the SKB,
<br />
the FP1 or instantiated world).  When I posit the FP1-only ontology,
<br />
I'm saying that all of this can be modelled as the 'world-in-here',
<br />
though of course not in a naive solipsistic sense - i.e. not the
<br />
world-in-FP1i, but the world-in-FP1g.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; All of that is structural and therefore seconfary to any prime
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; substance.
</em><br />
<br />I think that would be a telling point but for my arguments above.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You could have done the same starting from a 0-personal position.
</em><br />
<br />I hope you can now see why I believe that I could not, unless it turns
<br />
out that you mean by 0-personal what I mean by FP1g.  To test this,
<br />
could you elaborate on how in your view the 'directly manifest' first
<br />
personal point-of-view (not, mark you, FP2 descriptive analogs thereof,
<br />
such as the reference in this sentence) arises from the 0-personal.  If
<br />
the 0-personal entails that under appropriate structural delimitation,
<br />
such 'pinched-off' zones display FP1i first person-hood - such as that
<br />
in which I presume you are modelling these words *right now* - then it
<br />
may turn out that we are merely confusing terms rather than concepts.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Hi Peter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I'd like to be really careful here to avoid getting into some of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; same loops that so frustrated Alan on the FOR list!  I may well be dead
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; wrong in what I'm claiming, but at least I'd like us both to be clear
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; on precisely what in fact this is.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Firstly, my overall enterprise is to arrive at some general description
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of things that relies on as few explanatory entities as possible.  Now,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; IMO we cannot avoid taking first person into account - I find I can't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; begin to have an intelligible discussion with anyone who doesn't accept
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; this (not you clearly).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't even know what you mean by &quot;first person&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You seem to think that the boundraries of the self are given by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; secondary,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non-fundamental structures and properties, likewise qualia.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; From this, if first person is to be a given,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the simplest approach is to explore whether, ontologically speaking, we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; could take it to be the sole given, and my project has been to see
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; where this leads.  One of the difficulties has been to pin down the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; language to distinguish the different meanings associated with the term
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'first person', so I've attempted to define certain usages (which I'm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; happy at any time to abandon for better ones). These are:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 1) FP1g - primitive 'global' first person entity or context
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 2) FP1i - individual person delimited by primitive differentiation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (which is agnostic to comp, physics, or anything else at this logical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; level)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 3) FP2 - narrative references to first persons, as in 'David is a first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; person', an attribution, as opposed to 'David-as-first-person', a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; unique entity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 4) TP - third person, or structure-read-as-information, as opposed to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; structure-demarcating-an-entity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Later on in the reply to Bruno from which you quote, and in some of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; earlier posts, I make the point that starting from such a generalised
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; or undifferentiated first person context we can see that certain sorts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of structural differentiation can create delimited zones within the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; whole. Some of these zones take the form of individual first persons
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (FP1i).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why shoukdn't FP1i be the most primitive 1st-person,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arising from 0-personality ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Within each FP1i person so constituted exists a 'set of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; capabilities' and a 'structural model of the world'.  Which part of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; FP1i acts as 'perceiver' and which 'perceptual model' is simply an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; aspect of function-from-structure.  It happens to be the former that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; has the organisation for representing information and self-reporting,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; so it's the one that gets to enjoy 'experience'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Within the structural model of the world - our only means of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; representing, and through 'downloading', sharing information with other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; first persons - there will of course be regions that we variously label
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'self' (e.g. 'my arm') or 'other' (e.g. Peter Jones').  The latter, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; presume, would be an example of what you call 'stuff that appears,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; subjectively , to be not-me'.  Of course I agree that 'If I ignore it,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I am not making full use of my only epistemologial resource'.  So, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; don't ignore it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; However, you go on: 'If I treat is as 1st-personal as well as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; third-personal, I am overcomplicating things'.  My response to this is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; two-fold.  First, of course, it is simply not the case that my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; representation of 'Peter Jones' is the same as its presumed referent in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the world 'Peter Jones'.  My assumption is that it is informationally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; connected with this referent, and to an extent co-varies with it, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; it is well for me to remember that such representations are my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; reponsibility and not yours.  But more fundamentally, and this is why I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; recapitulated my overall project at the outset, the intention is to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; simplify, not complicate.  My representation of 'Peter Jones' is a part
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of my subjectivity, and it is a part I label 'third person' to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; distinguish it from 'self', an evolutionarily useful distinction.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; All of that is structural and therefore seconfary to any prime
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; substance.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Peter Jones in the world I take to be another first person entity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (FP1i) that derives this status in virtue of being another delimited
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; zone, appropriately structured, within FP1g, the single ontological
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; context.  Outside of my subjective model of the world, and that of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; other first persons, in no sense is Peter Jones in the world 'third
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; person'.  Only the *references* to Peter Jones are subjectively
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; categorised as such within individual world-models, and these are FP2
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; first-person analogs, or third person descriptions of first persons -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; as distinct from 'instantiated first persons'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Now it seems to me that all of the above has been accomplished without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; moving outside of a primitive first person ontology.  I have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; distinguished various zones within this single context, and I've
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; suggested how one information structure can be used to 'label' another
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (i.e. stand in relation to it) as 'third person' (description or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; narrative), 'self', or 'other', and all without deploying any other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ontological type, other than metaphorically.  That's what I'm trying to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; achieve.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You could have done the same starting from a 0-personal position.
