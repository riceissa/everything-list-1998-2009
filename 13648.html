<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hi John....
</em><br />
<br />....(just your Italics par-s quoted in this reply. Then &quot;JM: means present
<br />
text)):
<br />
<br />*DN: Since we agree to eliminate the 'obsolete noumenon', we can perhaps
<br />
re-phrase this as just: 'how do you know x?'  And then the answers are of
<br />
the type 'I just see x, hear x, feel x' and so forth.  IOW, 'knowing x' is
<br />
unmediated** - 'objects' like x are just 'embedded' in the structure of the
<br />
'knower', and this is recursively related to more inclusive structures
<br />
within which the knower and its environment are in turn embedded.
<br />
*
<br />
JM:  You mean a hallucination of x, when you * 'I just see x, hear x, feel
<br />
x' and so forth'*.
<br />
is included in your knowledge? or even substitutes for it? Maybe yes...
<br />
But then can you differentiate? (or this is no reasonable question?)
<br />
*
<br />
<br /><br />*((to JM: ...know if you are NOT conscious? Well, you wouldn't.))
<br />
DN: Agreed.  If we 'delete the noumenon' we get: &quot;How would you know if you
<br />
are NOT?&quot; or: &quot;How would you know if you did NOT (know)?&quot;.  To which we
<br />
might indeed respond: &quot;You would not know, if you were NOT&quot;, or: &quot;You would
<br />
not know, if you did NOT (know)&quot;. *
<br />
JM:  The classic question: &quot;Am I? and the classical answer:  &quot;Who is
<br />
asking?&quot;
<br />
*
<br />
<br />*DN: I think we need to distinguish between 'computers' and 'machines'.  I
<br />
can see no reason in principle why an artifact could not 'know', and be
<br />
motivated by such knowing to interact with the human world: humans are of
<br />
course themselves 'natural artifacts'.* itself embedded.
<br />
<br />JM: Are you including 'humans' into the machines or the computers? And dogs?
<br />
Amoebas?
<br />
The main difference I see here is the 'extract' of the &quot;human world&quot; (or:
<br />
&quot;world, as humans can interpret what they learned&quot;) downsized to our
<br />
choice of necessity which WE liked to design into an artifact. (motors,
<br />
cellphones, AI, AL). Yes, we (humans etc.) are artefacts but 'use' a lot of
<br />
capabilities (mental etc. gadgets) we either don't know at all, or just
<br />
accept them as 'being human' (or an extract of human traits as 'being dog')
<br />
with no urge to build such into a microwave oven or an AI.
<br />
But then we are SSOO smart when we draw conclusions!!!!!
<br />
*
<br />
*DN:
<br />
Bruno's approach is to postulate the whole 'ball of wax' as computation, so
<br />
that any 'event' whether 'inside' or 'outside' the machine is 'computed'*.
<br />
JM:
<br />
Bruno is right: accepting that 'any machine' is part of its &quot;outside(?)
<br />
totality&quot;, i.e.  embedded into its ambiance, I would be scared to
<br />
differentiate myself. There is no hermetic 'skin' - it is transitional
<br />
effects transcending back and forth, we just do not observe those outside
<br />
the 'topical boundaries' of our actual observation (model, as I call it).
<br />
<br />*DN:*
<br />
*The drift of my recent posts has been that even in this account, 'worlds'
<br />
can emerge 'orthogonally' to each other, such that from their reciprocal
<br />
perspectives, 'events' in their respective worlds will be 'imaginary'.*
<br />
JM:
<br />
I can't say: I have no idea how the world works, except for that little I
<br />
interpreted into my 1st person narrative. I accept &quot;maybe&quot;-s.
<br />
And I have a way to 'express' myself: I use &quot;I dunno&quot;.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Dear David.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; do not expect from me the theoretical level of technicality-talk er get
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; from Bruno: I talk (and think) common sense (my own) and if the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; theoretical technicalities sound strange, I return to my thinking.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; That's what I got, that's what I use (plagiarized from the Hungarian
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; commi
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; joke: what is the difference between the peoples' democracy and a wife?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Nothing: that's what we got that's what we love)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; When I read your &quot;questioning&quot; the computer, i realized that you are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in the ballpark of the AI people (maybe also AL - sorry, Russell)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; who select machine-accessible aspects for comparing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You may ask about prejudice, shame (about goofed situations),  humor
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (does a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; computer laugh?)  boredom or preferential topics (you push for an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; astronomical calculation and the computer says: I rather play some Bach
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; music now)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Sexual preference (even disinterestedness is slanted), or laziness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; If you add untruthfulness in risky situations, you really have a human
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; machine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; with consciousness (whatever people say it is - I agree with your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; evading
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that unidentified obsolete noumenon as much as possible).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I found Bruno's post well fitting - if i have some hint what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;...inner personal or self-referential modality...&quot; may mean.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I could not 'practicalize' it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I still frown when &quot;abondoning (the meaning of) something but consider
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  items as pertaining to it&quot; - a rough paraphrasing, I admit.  To what?.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I don't feel comfortable to borrow math-methods for nonmath explanations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; but that is my deficiency.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Now that we arrived at thequestion I replied-added (sort of) to Colin's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; question I -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; let me ask it again: how would YOU know if you are conscious?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (Conscious is more meaningful than cc-ness). Or rather: How would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; you know if you are NOT conscious? Well, you wouldn't. If you can,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; you are conscious.  Computers?????

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; I agree with this, but I would prefer to stop using the term

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; 'consciousness' at all.  To make a decision (to whatever degree of

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; certainty) about whether a machine possessed a 1-person pov analogous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; to a human one, we would surely ask it the same sort of questions one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; would ask a human.  That is: questions about its personal 'world' -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; what it sees, hears, tastes (and perhaps extended non-human
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; modalitiies); what its intentions are, and how it carries them into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; practice.  From the machine's point-of-view, we would expect it to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; report such features of its personal world as being immediately
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; present (as ours are), and that it be 'blind' to whatever 'rendering
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; mechanisms' may underlie this (as we are).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; If it passed these tests, it would be making similar claims on a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; personal world as we do, and deploying this to achieve similar ends.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Since in this case it could ask itself the same questions that we can,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; it would have the same grounds for reaching the same conclusion.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; However, I've argued in the other bit of this thread against the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; possibility of a computer in practice being able to instantiate such a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; 1-person world merely in virtue of 'soft' behaviour (i.e.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; programming).  I suppose I would therefore have to conclude that no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; machine could actually pass the tests I describe above - whether self-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; administered or not - purely in virtue of running some AI program,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; however complex.  This is an empirical prediction, and will have to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; await an empirical outcome.

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; ideas

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ideas, and we might assume that the AI would read these

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; suggestions,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; along with many other ideas that contradict the ones offered here.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It seems hard to escape the conclusion that the only logical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; response
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is for the AI to figuratively throw up its hands and say that it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; impossible to know if it is conscious, because even humans cannot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; agree
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on what consciousness is.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Augustin said about (subjective) *time* that he knows perfectly what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is, but that if you ask him to say what it is, then he admits being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unable to say anything. I think that this applies to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;consciousness&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We know what it is, although only in some personal and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; uncommunicable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now this happens to be true also for many mathematical concept.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Strictly speaking we don't know how to define the natural numbers,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we know today that indeed we cannot define them in a communicable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; way,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that is without assuming the auditor knows already what they are.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So what can we do. We can do what mathematicians do all the time. We
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can abandon the very idea of *defining* what consciousness is, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; try
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; instead to focus on principles or statements about which we can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; agree
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that they apply to consciousness. Then we can search for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; (mathematical)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; object obeying to such or similar principles. This can be made
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; easier
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by admitting some theory or realm for consciousness like the idea
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; consciousness could apply to *some* machine or to some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; *computational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; events&quot; etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We could agree for example that:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1) each one of us know what consciousness is, but nobody can prove
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he/she/it is conscious.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2) consciousness is related to inner personal or self-referential
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; modality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is how I proceed in &quot;Conscience et Mécanisme&quot;.  (&quot;conscience&quot;

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; topic.  If anyone disagrees, I'd like to hear how it could happen.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As far as a machine is correct, when she introspects herself, she
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cannot not discover a gap between truth (p) and provability (Bp).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; machine can discover correctly (but not necessarily in a completely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; communicable way) a gap between provability (which can potentially
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; leads to falsities, despite correctness) and the incorrigible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; knowability or knowledgeability (Bp &amp; p), and then the gap between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; those notions and observability (Bp &amp; Dp) and sensibility (Bp &amp; Dp &amp;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; p). Even without using the conventional name of &quot;consciousness&quot;,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; machines can discover semantical fixpoint playing the role of non
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; expressible but true statements.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We can *already* talk with machine about those true unnameable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; things,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as have done Tarski, Godel, Lob, Solovay, Boolos, Goldblatt, etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And the corollary to this is that perhaps humans also cannot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; legitimately
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; make such claims, since logically their position is not so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from that of the AI.  In that case the seemingly axiomatic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; question of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whether we are conscious may after all be something that we could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mistaken about.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is an inference from &quot;I cannot express p&quot; to &quot;I can express not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; p&quot;. Or from ~Bp to B~p.  Many atheist reason like that about the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; concept of &quot;unameable&quot; reality, but it is a logical error.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Even for someone who is not willing to take the comp hyp into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; consideration, it is a third person communicable fact that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; self-observing machines can discover and talk about many non
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; 3-provable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and sometimes even non 3-definable true &quot;statements&quot; about them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; true statements can only be interrogated.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Personally I don' think we can be *personally* mistaken about our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; consciousness even if we can be mistaken about anything that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; consciousness could be about.
