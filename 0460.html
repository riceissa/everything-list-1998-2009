<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Sure. The problem here consist in finding the relation between mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reality and physical reality. You can believe there is a physical universe,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and that mathematics are *mental* tools build by high mammifers for strugling
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with the physical universe. This is a respectable position.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;What I say is that such a respectable position is incompatible with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;hypothesis of computationalisme. I am *just* saying that IF we can survive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with a digital brain, THEN physical reality is NECESSARILY part of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;arithmetical reality &quot;viewed from inside&quot;. This gives us a new
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;*space* (the space of computationnal histories) which gives clues on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;logical origin of the (machine-belief in) physical laws.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I'm still not convinced with that. I'd want to precize the idea &quot;we can
<br />
survive with a digital brain&quot;. In all your thought experiment you seem to
<br />
assume that it is possible to reproduce *exactly* the behaviour of a
<br />
physical system (the brain) with some detailed computation. I think it is
<br />
impossible : the physical reality is not computable exactly, at least in
<br />
our present knowledge. A very profound reason for that is that we do not
<br />
know how to describe it, independantly of the physical laws that govern it.
<br />
That's why you still have room to make any hypothesis on the nature of the
<br />
reality! But that forbids to consider systems strictly &quot;equivalent&quot; to
<br />
other ones. You can build machines that will &quot;mimic&quot; other machines up to
<br />
some level and during some time, but their fate will necessarily diverge at
<br />
some point. As I mentioned in another mail, the fact that we are aware of
<br />
our position in space and of our physical constitution makes impossible to
<br />
build a machine even &quot;grossly&quot; equivalent to ourselves. The idea, already
<br />
mentioned, to simulate also the environment is impracticable, because you
<br />
will face the problem of simulating the whole Universe with a machine
<br />
embedded in this very universe, which is logically impossible. Furthermore,
<br />
the chaotic nature of most physical systems would need an infinite
<br />
accuracy, which is also impossible to realize.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">  &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;Have you follow the PE-omega experience ?
</em><br />
<br />I didn't find this precise term in your thesis, may be because it is an
<br />
English acronym for the experiment that you describe in French? I suppose
<br />
you are speaking of the replacement of a brain by a digital one, with a
<br />
possible infinite duplication of one person.
<br />
<br />The problem that I see with this experiment is that it poses the problem of
<br />
the definition of identity, which is a sand-heap like problem. It is not a
<br />
*physical* problem but a *semantic* one. We, high mammifers that have had to
<br />
struggle with the physical universe, have developed the notion of identity
<br />
in a case where it was rather well defined, because there is no natural
<br />
mechanism that duplicates large organisms. (however such a mechanism does
<br />
exist for simple cells, as you remark yourselves at the beginning of your
<br />
thesis). However, this notion, like all human notions, could become
<br />
unappropriate in different conditions. If we were really able to
<br />
&quot;duplicate&quot; the brain (which has to be proven), we should more carefully
<br />
redefine this notion. We can argue that two realizations based on the same
<br />
initial brain should be consider as the same entity, or the contrary. But
<br />
again it is a semantic problem, and for me it cannot give you any clue on
<br />
the nature of the world (just like asking whether viruses are living
<br />
organisms or not doesn't help to know their replication mechanism). Indeed
<br />
in our real world, true twins are born from the same cell : in this case
<br />
they *are* actually considered as different persons.
<br />
<br />So I think that in the case  where duplication would be possible, we would
<br />
naturally modify our notion of identity. We may for example think us as an
<br />
&quot;array&quot; I[1], I[2]...instead of a single person. The I[i] would share the
<br />
same history at the beginning,,but differ after some time.  All the
<br />
questions and paradoxes  related to the question &quot;who is &quot;I&quot;?&quot; would
<br />
disappear simply because we would be led to adapt our notions to a new
<br />
reality, and this question would loose any sense, because &quot;I&quot; would have
<br />
lost its property of unicity. (A comparable evolution has already been made
<br />
in QM for example, where the question &quot;where is the electron?&quot; has lost its
<br />
sense). That's why I call that a &quot;semantic&quot; problem, and not a physical
<br />
one. After this mental revolution , we would face the same problem of
<br />
understanding the origin of thought!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ... Schmidhuber's programms, for example, could most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;simply interpreted like the generation of classical worlds where &quot;1&quot; means
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;the presence of a classical particle and 0 an absence. There is nothing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;wrong logically...just that you cannot make good physical laws with this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;idea.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I agree with Schmidhuber and James Higgo (and Wei Dai (?), ...)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ONTOLOGICAL explanation: roughly speaking I agree that the &quot;great
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;programmer&quot; is the simplest explanation for everything.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;What those people seem not to understand is the formidable EPISTEMOLOGICAL
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;problems which arise with such an ontology. My UD-argument (or PE-omega
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;experiment) is build to show the inevitability of these epistemological
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;problems.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />I agree, but for this reason, and as a physicist, I wouldn't call it an
<br />
&quot;explanation&quot; at all...
<br />
<br />Cheers
<br />
<br />Gilles
