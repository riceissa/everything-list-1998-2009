Hi Bruno:
<br />
<br />I have attempted to answer some of your questions below.  I have removed 
<br />
some terms and replaced others to improve clarity [I think].  This effort 
<br />
also improved the statement of the model.  As I have tried to point out in 
<br />
other posts I believe the model has many features in common with Russell's 
<br />
book such as an entity [the All] containing all descriptions, an evolution, 
<br />
conscious observers, local time, an accessability between observer events, 
<br />
&quot;selection&quot; via the existence of SAS, a randomness that can support 
<br />
&quot;creation&quot; or at least its illusion.  The model is not the same as 
<br />
Russell's as I derive mine from a primitive of a simple list of fragmentary 
<br />
descriptions and the ability to divide that list into two lists in many 
<br />
[uncountably infinite ? see below] ways.  The timeless dynamic [random - 
<br />
absent order] I derive for the system may produce another difference 
<br />
between the two approaches because what I see within mine is that all 
<br />
sequences of all states of all universes experience a flow of instantations 
<br />
of physical reality [over and over] some of which instantations bridge 
<br />
between states [due to the randomness] thus giving any Self Aware 
<br />
Structures described in these states a flow of awareness [consciousness].
<br />
<br />I believe that your approach may be in my All to some degree but in my view 
<br />
physics and mathematics are derived from the list and the inherent ability 
<br />
to sub divide it.
<br />
<br />The one to ones with the natural numbers and the reals I mentioned earlier 
<br />
have been removed as being confusing at this stage.  I only reference the 
<br />
properties of countable, uncountable, and power set.
<br />
<br />As to measure, if one assumes that the list is countably infinite then its 
<br />
divisions are uncountably infinite in number which results in an 
<br />
uncountably infinite number of descriptions of states of universes.  All of 
<br />
these would be given instantations of physical reality over and over and in 
<br />
random sequence.  Long well behaved sequences that support SAS would be 
<br />
uncountably infinite in number.
<br />
<br />Definitions:
<br />
<br />Object: That which has a degree of physical reality such as a ball.  The 
<br />
degrees of physical reality are distinguished by imperativeness and duration.
<br />
<br />Idea:  That which is expressed by an arrangement of sub components of an 
<br />
object.  Mathematics is an idea in our universe expressed by the pattern of 
<br />
ink on paper or neurons in our brain.
<br />
<br />The list of all properties: The list of all the possible properties of 
<br />
objects and ideas.  The list consists of fragments of descriptions such as 
<br />
red, large, spherical, addition, prime, etc.   This list can not be empty 
<br />
since there is unlikely to be less than a nothing and a nothing has at 
<br />
least one property - emptiness.  The list is most likely to be at least 
<br />
countably infinite and can be assumed to be countably infinite.  The list 
<br />
is the primitive of the model.  It has existence but not physical reality.
<br />
<br />Information: Information is the potential to establish a division between 
<br />
two parts of the list of all properties that is to divide the list into two 
<br />
sub lists.  Each sub list is then a full description of [definition of] an 
<br />
object [such as a state of a universe] and any ideas expressed within 
<br />
it.  A full description is not the object itself and has no degree of 
<br />
physical reality.  At most information need only consist of one of the two 
<br />
sub lists [one of the two full descriptions established by a 
<br />
division].  The cardinality of all sub lists [the power set of the list] is 
<br />
c if the list is assumed to be countably infinite.
<br />
<br />Kernel of information: The information relevant to a specific division of 
<br />
the list - it is at most a single full description, the remaining portion 
<br />
of the list is not required as information in order to establish the division.
<br />
<br />The All: An object structured to express the idea &quot;The complete ensemble of 
<br />
kernels&quot; [all information [equivalent to no net information]].
<br />
<br />The Nothing: An object structured to express the idea &quot;That which is empty 
<br />
of all kernels&quot; [no information [equivalent to no net information]].
<br />
<br />A Something: A division of the All into two subparts.  Somethings need not 
<br />
be static divisions of the All.
<br />
<br />True Noise: The inconsistency of any evolution of a Something reflected in 
<br />
the pattern and duration of physical reality given to states of universes 
<br />
it encompasses or absorbs in the course of its evolution.
<br />
<br />Model
<br />
<br />Proposal: The existence of our and other universes and their dynamics are 
<br />
the result of unavoidable definition, incompleteness, and inconsistency.
<br />
<br />Justification:
<br />
<br />1) Notice that &quot;Defining&quot; is the same as establishing a division of the 
<br />
list of all properties - a boundary between what an object is and what it 
<br />
is not.  This thus simultaneously defines a second object: the &quot;is 
<br />
not&quot;.  An object can not be defined in isolation and definition establishes 
<br />
an [is,is not] pair.
<br />
<br />2) Given the definitions of the All, and the Nothing:
<br />
<br />3) These definitions are really a single definition forming an [is,is not] 
<br />
pair and arise from the same division of the list.  This division places 
<br />
&quot;empty of kernels&quot; in one of the sub lists [the &quot;is&quot; or the &quot;is not&quot;] and 
<br />
the remainder of the list in the other sub list [the &quot;is not&quot; or the &quot;is&quot;].
<br />
<br />4) These definitions are unavoidable because at least one of the [All, 
<br />
Nothing] pair must be an object and have high degrees of physical reality 
<br />
if &quot;no net information&quot; is a key to an explanation of our universe [as 
<br />
mulitverse or any other form].  Since they form an [is, is not] pair and 
<br />
any selection of one over the other for physical reality would be net 
<br />
information they bootstrap each other to the highest degree of physical 
<br />
reality.
<br />
<br />5) The Nothing has a logical problem: since it is empty of kernels it can 
<br />
not answer any meaningful question about itself [as an object it expresses 
<br />
no ideas] including the unavoidable one of its own stability [the duration 
<br />
of its physical reality].
<br />
<br />6) To answer this unavoidable question the Nothing must at some point gain 
<br />
access to the interior of the All [the only place information resides] in 
<br />
an attempt to complete itself.  The appropriate information is not likely 
<br />
to be the first information passing into the Nothing so its incompleteness 
<br />
will persist and likely get worse re the added information.  Further it can 
<br />
no longer be a Nothing but rather becomes an evolving Something within the 
<br />
All absorbing kernel after kernel.  This &quot;destruction&quot; of the Nothing could 
<br />
be viewed as a spontaneous symmetry breaking establishing a dynamic within 
<br />
the All.
<br />
<br />7) However, the [All,Nothing] pair is unavoidable and a Nothing must be 
<br />
restored.
<br />
<br />8) Thus the process repeats in an always was and always will be manner and 
<br />
the cycle is random.
<br />
<br />9) The process divides the All into two evolving Somethings - i.e. evolving 
<br />
multiverses - each with many kernels.  Evolving Somethings are unlikely to 
<br />
reach completeness short of encompassing the entire All.  Notice that half 
<br />
the multiverses are &quot;contracting&quot; - i.e. losing kernels [but the 
<br />
cardinality of the number of kernels is c].
<br />
<br />10) Notice that the All also has a logical problem.  Looking at the same 
<br />
meaningful question of its own stability it contains all possible answers 
<br />
because just one answer would constitute an exclusion of specific kernels 
<br />
which is contradictory to the definition of the All as the complete kernel 
<br />
ensemble.   Thus the All is internally inconsistent.
<br />
<br />11) Therefore the evolution of a Something in the All must echo this 
<br />
inconsistency.  That is each step in the evolution of a Something can not 
<br />
be completely dependent on the history of that evolution.  The Dynamic in 
<br />
the All is random [An ongoing change absent any order is not time like in 
<br />
my opinion].
<br />
<br />12) Some kernels are states of universes and when the boundary of an 
<br />
evolving Something passes about a kernel, the kernel can have a moment of a 
<br />
degree of physical reality.  [The kernel is actually transferred from one 
<br />
Something to another.  This moment can extend [to all degrees due to the 
<br />
randomness] so that successor states can have a degree of overlapping 
<br />
physical reality resulting in a flow of awareness or &quot;consciousness&quot; for 
<br />
some sequences of states for universes that contain Self Aware Structures.
<br />
<br />13)  From within any Something the future pattern of reality moments due to 
<br />
(11) would be non deterministic i.e. suffer True Noise.
<br />
<br />14) The All of course contains a kernel re the founding definition [a 
<br />
kernel need only be one side of a definition] and thus there is an ongoing 
<br />
potential to have [All,Nothing] pairs.  This completes the system in that 
<br />
the origin of the dynamic basically destroys [All, Nothing] pairs but there 
<br />
is a lasting potential to form new ones.
