<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I mean is 'perceivable *in principle* ( i.e. by some mind, somewhere in

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the universe).

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I admit my misunderstanding, and that you are talking about the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unperceivable rather than the unperceived, so the argument about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; eliminating the motivation to discover does not apply, although it does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; apply to those that reject the existence of an objective reality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Reality can only ever be understood from the perspective of a mind.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Are you willing to admit that you have to be agnostic (by definition!)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about the fact that there could be reality that can't be understood by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a mind?
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;Yes. But only minds can perceive and comprehend reality. Only minds can
<br />
value. The parts of reality that are beyond the comprehension of all
<br />
possible minds cannot by definition be directly dealt with by any
<br />
metaphysical theory. And what value could they possibly be to us? That's why
<br />
I called my theory the 'Sentient Centered' theory. A mind is the most
<br />
important thing in the universe because without mind there can be no value
<br />
(values come from minds).
<br />
<br />What I'm asking is: Why do you limit metaphysics, at the outset, to
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being &quot;for the purposes of understanding general intelligence?&quot; On the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other hand, how do we know what &quot;general&quot; intelligence is if all we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have is our human understanding? Thus my example of conscious stars
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which are enlightened about the universe in ways that don't even fit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; into our mind's capability of understanding what enlightened can mean.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Only a general intelligence (a mind capable of fully reflective reasoning)
<br />
can value things, perceive things and comprehend things. Therefore any
<br />
metaphysical theory needs to deal with those aspects of reality that can in
<br />
principle impinge on the mind of a general intelligence.
<br />
&nbsp;You make a good point about kinds of consciousness that may be beyond human
<br />
understanding. But my theory does not attempt to provide a full explanation
<br />
of what general intelligence is. It is simply meant to serve as a logical
<br />
scaffolding to which new scientific and philosophical information would
<br />
continue to be added. In order for the words 'intelligence' and
<br />
'consciousness' to have an unitary meaning, there would have to be *some*
<br />
general properties that all possible minds had in common. A metaphysical
<br />
theory intended to serve as a 'logical scaffolding' simply has to deal with
<br />
these general properties.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt; Therefore only things capable of (in principle) making a difference
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to perceived reality need to be taken into account when devising
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ultimate theories of metaphysics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is not there a difference between things that &quot;(in principle)&quot; can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; never make a difference to perceived reality (i.e. unperceivable by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some logical contradiction to perceivability, but yet existing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; somehow), and things that never will make a difference to perceived
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality because of the limitations of minds (in general)? I admit that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we can't include the former, but what about the latter?
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter possibility would mean that there's an unbridgeable seperation
<br />
between the thing in itself and a mind's conception of a thing aka Kant.
<br />
It's a logical possibility of course but I note that many modern
<br />
philosophers reject Kant's idea.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't think the 'perceivable in principle' requirement contradicts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical Platonism. What makes you think that mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; objects aren't perceivable? True, most *humans* can't perceive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical things, but that's probably just a limitation of the human
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mind. I think that a mind sufficiently talented at math *could* in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; principle directly perceive mathematical objects. Kurt Godel claimed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that it was possible to directly perceive mathematical objects. He
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even thought the mind was capable of directly perceiving infinite sets.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What if the proof of Goldbach's Conjecture was such that it could not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be perceived by a mind? Doesn't our incomplete picture of the mind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; allow for such a possibility?
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I suppose so. But it seems unlikely to me. What does the word 'proof'
<br />
*mean* if not that there are a series of logical connections each of which
<br />
is capable of being comprehended (in principle) by *some* mind? Of course,
<br />
there are likely proofs beyond human understanding but such proofs should
<br />
not be beyond the understanding of *some* (in principle) sufficiently
<br />
powerful mind.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In all of the history of humans' exploration of the universe, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perpetual message that keeps coming back to us from the universe is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the brain is not as wide as the sky. I think that trying to make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an &quot;end run&quot; around &quot;everything&quot; and starting with the doctrine that it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is, is not a new thing (even to the ancient Greeks), but it contradicts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the evidence.

<br />&nbsp;*Given* that we want a metaphysical 'Theory Of Everything' (the name of
<br />
this mailing list after all!) we must *assume* as a starting point that mind
<br />
can comprehend reality. Our assumption could be wrong. That's why it's
<br />
called a *theory* of everything ;)
