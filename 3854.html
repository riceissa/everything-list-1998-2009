<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; The mind-body problem I am talking about is the one formulated by Descartes

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  (but also by Hindu philosophers before J.C). It is really the problem

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  of linking private (first person) sensations and third person communicable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  phenomena. How a grey brain produces sensation of color, as someone put it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Could you state the problem more formally?
</em><br />
<br />The mind-body problem is hard to formulate purely formally because it
<br />
search a link between the somehow formal body and the non formal mind.
<br />
My whole work, i.e UDA and AUDA(*), can be considered as an attempt to
<br />
*state* the problem, in the frame of the computationalist hypothesis.
<br />
The UDA still uses an &quot;intuitive/informal&quot; notion of &quot;you&quot; because it is
<br />
asked to &quot;you&quot; if you accept an digital body transplant. Nobody can
<br />
known for sure that you will survive such a transplant, but this is true
<br />
for any operation, and I am just looking for consequences in the case you
<br />
do survive (comp). The AUDA is more subtle with respect to that
<br />
informal/formal relation.
<br />
It happens that, in a quite precise sense, the S4Grz logic (and the X and X*
<br />
logics) capture formally the lack of formal description of the subject.
<br />
This is really difficult to explain shortly and I propose we postpone this
<br />
after the more easy UDA is made completely transparent.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Also, you asked me whether I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;was aware of the mind-body problem. What did my answer tell you?
</em><br />
<br />?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; Those I have encapsulated in the label &quot;comp&quot;. Precisely it consists in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  1)accepting a minimal amount of arithmetical realism, i.e. the truth of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  elementary statements of arithmetic does not depend of me or us ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I agree with (1).
</em><br />
<br /><br />Thank you for telling me. Note that among those who understands the
<br />
uda proof, because they rarely like to endorse the conclusion, they often
<br />
choose to reject Arithmetical Realism.
<br />
(Church thesis has never been rejected, nor, curiously enough
<br />
the existence of a the substitution level).
<br />
Note that I don't really care: my point is only that AR+TC+BJ entails
<br />
the psycho/physico reversal.
<br />
A referee told me he is convinced that my reasoning still goes through
<br />
along with a weakening of the three part of comp. I think he is right but
<br />
this would make the UDA reasoning much longer and more difficult.
<br />
<br />(AR = Arithmetical Realism, TC = Church Thesis, BJ = Big Jump (saying yes to
<br />
the brain/body surgeon).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; 2) the Church Thesis (also called the Church Turing Thesis, or the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  Post Law, etc.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  i.e. all universal machine are equivalent with respect to their simulation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  abilities (making abstraction of the duration of those simulation).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I don't think that is settled yet. We may be able to build machines that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are more powerful than Turing machines. I don't think we should rule it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;out at this point.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I do also believe that we may be able to build machines that are more
<br />
powerful than Turing machines. But this has nothing to do with Church
<br />
Thesis (look at the Copeland paper you mentionned yourself). Church
<br />
thesis is just the thesis that all *digital* universal machine are
<br />
equivalent. But of course not all machine are digital machine. In particular
<br />
I have argued more than once that if comp is true (i.e. CT + ... are true),
<br />
then we should find in &quot;nature&quot; non computable processes. The first person
<br />
white rabbits appears for similar reasons and they are a priori non
<br />
computational. I know there are a lot of confusions in the literature.
<br />
Now I insist that my work uses comp as a working hypothesis. I am not
<br />
to much interested in discussing alternative hypothesis at this stage.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; 3) The existence of a level of description of my body (whatever it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  is) such that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  my first person experience remains invariant through a functional 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;substitution
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  made at that level.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Can you state this more formally? Specificly how do you define &quot;functional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;substitution&quot;?
</em><br />
<br />Come on, I'm sure you see what I mean.  (Of course &quot;functional substitution&quot;
<br />
is an interesting concept by itself. It would be just a slight exaggeration
<br />
to say that the lambda calculus and even category theory has been invented
<br />
for making that concept precise). In the uda frame, once the level of
<br />
digital substitution has been chosen, a substitution is functional if it
<br />
preserves the counterfactuals input/output relations of the thing which
<br />
is substituted.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; (Note that the Arithmetical uda makes it possible to eliminate 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the &quot;3)&quot; above).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I guess I'll have to wait for your English paper to understand how.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I have written more in this list than I will ever be able to write in
<br />
a paper. I have begin at least four papers; I don't know if I will
<br />
finish them. &quot;Our field&quot; overlaps too much disciplines. Either the
<br />
papers grow too much, or the paper became relatively incomprehensible.
<br />
Perhaps I should write a book instead. I don't know.
<br />
I must think about that. Advices are welcome.
<br />
At least some logicians begin to realize I give challenging
<br />
new mathematical problems. But then most usual technics doesn't apply,
<br />
and, because they lack the physical/bio/psycho-logical motivations,
<br />
they prefer to concentrate on their usual tasks.
<br />
Also, I think it is preferable to have a thorough understanding of
<br />
the UDA before tackling the AUDA. (except for the mathematicians, or those
<br />
who like logics and math).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; But the UD, because he is shallow, will generate an infinite number of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  computations in which you will experience drinking a cup of tea (if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  not a white rabbit), and this although you have the same experience
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  of the past which include
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  your preparing that cup of coffee).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;You can just ignore those universes because their algorithmic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;complexities are very high (and therefore their measures are very low).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  The &quot;invariance lemma&quot;  prevents &quot;easy&quot; use of (Kolmogorov or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  Chaitin) complexity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  notion for dismissing those abnormal stories.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Why? I just did it. Are you saying each copy of you in any universe counts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;equally regardless of how small the measure of the universe is? If that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;what you mean by &quot;invariance lemma&quot; then I certainly don't agree with you.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  The comp indeterminacy hints to transform that problem into a search
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  of a measure,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  and into showing that relatively abnormal consistent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  extension/stories are rare.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  This is not unlike the Feynman integration on path in quantum mechanics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I do not see the necessity of it.
</em><br />
<br /><br />It is the whole purpose of the uda to show that necessity character, *once*
<br />
we accept comp (i.e AR + TC + BJ), if only for the sake of the argument.

the arithmetical universal dovetailer argument. Roughly speaking it is

a translation of the uda in the language of a universal digital machine.
