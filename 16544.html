<em class="quotelev1">&gt; DO -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; those 'steps' neither OPERATE the machine.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Looks like we want to 'assume' that if there is a possibility, it is  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; also done.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes. It is the trade mark of all everythingers and many worlders. Be  
<br />
them quantum or arithmetical many states/worlds/histories.
<br />
relative existence = relative consistence. Actual consciousness =  
<br />
inside view of possible existence.
<br />
&quot;Now&quot; is as well yesterday from the point of view of yesterday than  
<br />
tomorrow from the point of view of tomorrow, if ever. The &quot;everything&quot;  
<br />
idea is that such an indexical approach is conceptually simpler, and  
<br />
should be favored for Occam-like related reason.
<br />
But it is neither assume in comp (my point) nor in (quantum mechanics,  
<br />
Everett-Deutsch point). Indeed any rememorable &quot;here and now&quot; depends  
<br />
on the statistical interference on the many many many &quot;elsewhere&quot;. It  
<br />
is not an assumption, it is a consequence of the theory. You can  
<br />
change the theory by adding selection principles, but this is really  
<br />
cutting off everything that does not fit our wishful thinking. It is  
<br />
like when Niels Bohr says &quot;Quantum mechanics is false in the classical  
<br />
macroscopic world, when applying QM to Niels Borh explains why Niels  
<br />
Bohr (and all of us) can experience a third person plural collapse  
<br />
despite the SWE prevent the need for it to happen &quot;really&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am looking at the &quot;physical creator&quot; (haha)
</em><br />
<br />... still looking for Aristotle initial motor (haha).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; keeping the contraption moving and us in it. Not to speak about  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'making it'. (Deus ex machina?)
</em><br />
<br /><br />No worry, assuming comp, it is  &quot;Machina ex Deus&quot;.
<br />
Machines can already prove that as far as they are consistent,  
<br />
something which is not a machine, and which is not even nameable  
<br />
(arithmetical truth) transcends them (Tarski,  Askanas).
<br />
<br />I have also discovered recently (and this has been proved by my  
<br />
student/friend &quot;the little genius&quot; (Eric Vandenbuscche)), that some  
<br />
false beliefs can enlarge the true provability spectrum. It is almost  
<br />
like de Bono said, according to Kim, it could be logical to be  
<br />
illogical, in some situation. But as I said to Kim, this belongs  
<br />
probably to the corona G* minus G, the space of the unspeakable.   
<br />
(Note that I fall myself in the same trap if I suggest this should be  
<br />
a reason to abandon prescriptive talk, yet, assuming comp, I can  
<br />
justify caution with such prescriptive talk, this because I talk  
<br />
explicitly on Machines and I talk on (ideally correct) Humans only  
<br />
through the comp HYPOTHESIS).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Once all is there and moving, everything is fine.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I salute the &quot;...infinitely many such relations, ...&quot; that gives me  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the idea of a 'physical' supervenience in terms of a restrictive  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Occam, cutting off everything that dos not fit into our goals.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Just say &quot;No doctor&quot;. No problem. We are just studying consequences of  
<br />
an hypothesis. But I think the comp hypothesis is the less  
<br />
reductionist view possible concerning the possible first person points  
<br />
of view.  The little and simple has more degree of freedom than the  
<br />
complexe and sophisticate.
<br />
I tend to believe comp is even a vaccine against major forms of  
<br />
reductionism.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;States&quot; seem to be identified by our limited views.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Third person conceived states are indeed identify with finite  
<br />
descriptions of a (probably deep and complex) computational states  
<br />
(notion relative to the choice of a universal machine).
<br />
But then &quot;first person states&quot;, as conceivable by first persons, are  
<br />
very complex and variable things with non trivial connectedness, and  
<br />
dependence on non nameable continuum (and thus a relative measure  
<br />
problem).
<br />
<br />But machine can prove their own relative (to consistency, to the  
<br />
existence of a &quot;reality&quot;) incompleteness theorem, and this introduces  
<br />
many deep nuances between all the possible variant of Theaetetus  
<br />
knowledge theories, up to the quasi Aristotelian (naturalist) theory  
<br />
of matter by Plotinus. I can't wait listening more to that humble  
<br />
universal machine ... 'course, today, it is still hard work: Gödel,  
<br />
Löb, Feferman, Smullyan, ..., but Solovay makes a progress by  
<br />
providing shortcuts: the modal systems G and G*.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I feel that both the referred Maudlin-text and Jesse's comment are  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on the static side, as 'descriptive', while I can presume into  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno's &quot;relations&quot; some sort of a functional (operative) relation  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that would lend some dynamism (action?) into the descriptional  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stagnancy. I still did not detect:  HOW?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Comp cannot explain HOW, for a reason similar to the fact that comp  
<br />
cannot explain where the numbers come from.
<br />
<br />Comp can explain some things though. It explains why and how the  
<br />
numbers, relatively to each others, and through their additive and  
<br />
multiplicative relations (cf Post, Turing ... Matiyazevitch)  begin to  
<br />
believe in numbers and in dynamics, and it explains why and how the  
<br />
numbers cannot explain the numbers and the dynamics, and it explains  
<br />
how the number can explain, like your servitor tries, why the numbers  
<br />
cannot explain the numbers and the dynamics. The same for many  
<br />
transcendent notions like &quot;truth&quot;, &quot;consciousness&quot;, &quot;realm&quot;, etc.
<br />
<br />Comp gives a TOE with a gap. But it explains why there is a gap, why  
<br />
we have to be ignorant there, and why that TOE is as close as an  
<br />
explanation can possibly exist. But it shows, to simplify, that the  
<br />
physical multi-world is given by some geometry on that ignorance gap,  
<br />
making comp refutable. So, let us see...
<br />
QM confirms comp, up to now, and it is too early to conclude anything  
<br />
definitive. Eventually comp, and thus arithmetic, has to justify QM as  
<br />
QM justifies the collapse.
