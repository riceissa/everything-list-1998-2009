<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Would this be guaranteed to work? You might get local regions of space and

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; modify things to make them globally consistent of course, but isn't it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible it'd get stuck in a loop?
</em><br />
<br />Yes, you might have to do it carefully in order to avoid that.  I think
<br />
that if you had a stochastic (random) element to the algorithm then it
<br />
would avoid loops.  And you'd also have to be prepared to change your
<br />
boundary conditions so that you weren't trying to solve an impossible
<br />
state.  (I think this part is implicit in Georges' idea of maximizing
<br />
some criterion rather than using fixed boundary conditions.)
<br />
<br />Wolfram observationally divided CA universes (and more general
<br />
computational systems) into four categories: static, cyclic, random
<br />
and structured.  Only the last class would allow for computation.
<br />
I suspect that those universes capable of computation would be among
<br />
the hardest ones to solve in this non-sequential way, that they would
<br />
have the most global dependencies.  Universes which were restricted to
<br />
regular patterns would be easy.  (Maybe the random ones would be hard,
<br />
too, since they tend to be chaotic.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Now, I'm not sure how to combine this process with Georges' proposal to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;maximize some criterion such as the gradient of orderliness.  I suppose
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;you could simply repeat this process many times, saving or remembering
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;the best solution found so far.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As long as everything that happens in the universe's history can be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; represented by a finite string, this brute-force method is one that's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; guaranteed to work...the ultimate version of this would just be to generate 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all possible strings of that length, then throw out all the ones that don't 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; match the laws/boundary conditions you've chosen. This method could also be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; used to generate histories satisfying global constraints that could be hard 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to simulate in a sequential way, like a universe where backwards time travel 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is possible but history must be completely self-consistent, where it is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible to influence the past but not to change it.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, that's a good idea, and it would probably be a shorter and simpler
<br />
program than my suggestion.  I like your idea of time travel universes;
<br />
this is a mechanism for generating them that shows that they are not
<br />
logically impossible or contradictory.  Several science fiction writers
<br />
have explored this concept, that time travel is possible and paradoxes
<br />
will not occur, no matter how unlikely are the events which conspire to
<br />
keep things consistent.
<br />
<br />I'm not sure how to estimate the measure of time travel universes.
<br />
The program to generate them is not necessarily large, but there would
<br />
be many fewer consistent solutions to the equations than in universes
<br />
without time travel.  So perhaps there would be fewer observers in
<br />
time travel universes compared even to ones that might have ad hoc
<br />
rules forbidding time travel.  Such rules might make non time travel
<br />
universes' programs more complex and the universes of lower measure,
<br />
but this might be more than compensated for by the greater numbers of
<br />
observers in universes that forbid time travel.
