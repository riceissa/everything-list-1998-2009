<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Wonderful! Now we are getting somewhere. I agree with you almost 100% except

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for the &quot;anti-realist&quot; part and the fact that I consider measure relative. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; :-) Our exchange has brought to focus the really important aspects of our 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; difference.  Thank you!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We are both relativist. Our difference is that you are an objectivist like 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Einstein whereas I am a subjectivist. I am not sure if Everett was an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; objectivist or a subjectivist.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I might not be a relativist, depending on what it's supposed
<br />
to mean.  But it's a seperate issue.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wouldn't say that not priviledging one term in a superposition
<br />
is the same idea as not priviledging one coordinate system.  You call both
<br />
ideas relativity, but I don't.  In fact, I am not convinced there is no
<br />
absolute reference frame, just because we can't observe it.  But again,
<br />
that's not relevant now.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is no problem with the relativist-objectivist point of view as long as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you restrict yourself to non-self (3rd person) issues such as inertial frames 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of reference like Einstein did.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really?  Einstein is the one who invented general relativity.  I
<br />
see no basis for your statement.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, as soon as you start talking about 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness and quantum immortality which are, as Bruno calls them first 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person issues, then you are led inexorably from the objective point of view 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the subjective one. Pushing the concept of relativity from Einstein's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; objective frames to its final conclusion, the self, you'll discover that the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self becomes the ultimate frame of reference. The mind then becomes a frame 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of reference and relativity is expressed at least in part by Shannon mutual 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; infomation theory. I like to think of &quot;mutual information&quot; as &quot;relative 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information.&quot; Other branches of mathematics that could bear on this problem 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is axiomatic theory and Goedel's work.  
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It sounds to me like a bunch of mumbo jumbo.  You're stretching
<br />
the analogy to Lorentz invariance into some kind of mangled metaphor.  I'd
<br />
like you to drop it and present your ideas straightforwardly.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am not sure if Everett did envisioned Quantum immortality and if he 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; actually made the transition from objectivism to subjectivism.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see no reason not to give Everett, a reasonably intelligent man,
<br />
the benefit of the doubt: that is, no, he would be on my side :-)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If however, you maintain an objective point of view, you forgo any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understanding of consciousness. Objectively speaking, you are only a mass 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comprised mostly of water, nitrogen, phosporus and trace minerals totally 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; void of consciousness. As an objective relativist you would deny any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness to anyone.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that is a strange statement.  Sure, it's counterintuitive that
<br />
matter could be conscious.  But for obvious reasons, my guess it that it
<br />
can.  If that's correct, then it's an objective fact that the objects
<br />
known as human brains do have consciousness.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Therefore, it is not surprising that you also deny 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Quantum immortality. 
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No connection that I see.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yet you do feel conscious, don't you? How do you explain this?
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm a computationalist.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In summary, you can't possibly simultaneously retain objectivity, relativity 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and consciousness. One of them has to go. My choice was to keep  relativity 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and consciousness, and become a subjectivist. 
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok, maybe you can clarify something since that doesn't make much
<br />
sense to me.  Suppose one wanted to keep objectivity and consciousness.  
<br />
What would such a theory be like?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; the illusion of an objective reality is helpful in providing a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mental framework for analyzing things. The reason why we have such an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; illusion is that, most of the time, our frames of reference are extremely 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; close together. Our points of view do not differ significantly and therefore 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the world appears to be the same. So it's OK to be an objectivist in most 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cases.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we have different viewpoints, we can convert from one to the
<br />
other, agreeing on the facts up to a convention.  For example, and there's
<br />
no need to get fancy, suppose I am facing you and I think there's a door
<br />
to the right.  You disagree, claiming that the door is in fact to the
<br />
left.  Who's right?  The question needs to be reformulated.  The door is
<br />
to my right and to your left, which we can both agree on.  Knowing this
<br />
objective fact I am fully competent to describe things from your point of
<br />
view, just as a third party knowing it could.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; As I mentioned above, It was acceptable for Einstein to be an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; objectivist because his frames of reference were third-person-based and did 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not involve the self and more specifically the continuing existence of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, when one starts to think in terms of consciousness and Quantum 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Immortality, the objectivity paradigm doesn't cut it anymore. In those cases, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the relevent frames of reference are consciousness-based and anthropically 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dependent. To be more specific the frames of reference are comprised of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information and data processing capability in the mind of the observer, plus 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all the anthropically necessary sustaining factors in the environment. An 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; example of sustaining factor would be the state of the cyanide capsule in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Schoedinger cat experiment. The state of the cyanide capsule represents the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; difference between the frames of reference for the cat that survives and the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cat that dies. 
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your paradigm doesn't cut it at all.  I think what you are trying
<br />
to say, in your own obscure way, is that by conditioning the view on the
<br />
survival of the cat you obtain the answer that the cat survives.  That
<br />
neglects that fact that the cat is more likely to exist prior to the
<br />
experiment, etc. etc. etc. all the stuff I keep saying about measure and
<br />
defining what &quot;the cat&quot; means.
