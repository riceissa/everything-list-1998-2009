John, 

<br />
I apologise if you thought I was referring to you in any way: I was just trying to 
<br />
make a general point about how we come to accept some beliefs and reject others. 
<br />
Perhaps I should not have used the pejorative terms, but I think it is a fair question: 
<br />
how do we know if a belief is crazy or stupid? Nature does not care about 
<br />
epistemology, only about utility, and brains have evolved to process evidence and 
<br />
arrive at conclusions because it assists survival. Psychotic illness disrupts the normal 
<br />
reasoning process and leads to delusions. The most important feature of these is not 
<br />
that they are false, but that they occur as a result of a pathological process which 
<br />
leads to morbidity and sometimes mortality. 

<br />
You make an interesting point about fixed *true* beliefs, not covered by the definition 
<br />
I gave below: it is actually possible to be right but still be delusional. For example, a 
<br />
patient believes with utter conviction that his wife was having an affair with his neighbour 
<br />
because the neighbour painted his fence green and green is her favourite colour.  
<br />
The patient is treated with antipsychotic medication and after a few weeks realises that 
<br />
it was crazy to come to the conclusion that he did and apologises to his wife and the 
<br />
neighbour, whom he had confronted prior to treatment. Months later, his wife leaves him 
<br />
for the neighbour: it turns out that they had been having an affair all along! Nevertheless, 
<br />
the patient had still been delusional because (a) most reasonable people would see the 
<br />
conclusion he drew from the green fence, and the conviction with which he held it, as very 
<br />
dubious, and (b) he himself saw the conclusion as dubious after treatment with antipsychotic 
<br />
medication.

<br />
Stathis Papaioannou

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Stathis: thanks for the psichiatry class.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You brought in a new questionmark: &quot;crazy&quot;. As George Levy has proven, we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all are crazy - my contention was: in that case such (general) craziness is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the norm, eo ipso we all are normal.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is  normalcy composed of delusions?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then why the (p)scientific identification of the &quot;delusion- 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; n  -psychiatry&quot;, which, - btw  - is not that impressive to those who are not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; standing on the shoulders of psychiatry.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You successfully wiped out the validity of that definition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (one by one). [you left out the case, if someone has a 'fixed'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; belief, which, however is NOT false (in unidentified opinions) - is also no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; delusion. ]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So: &quot;delusion&quot; (which I have not involved) is not applicable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If one thinks: it is,  it is not valid (i.e. not applicable again?).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The only solution to your post I can find is in the last par., if it refers 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to me. I value your right to tell your opinion and also value your opinion, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but question the term 'stupid'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In who's terms? by what (cultural?) norm?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Stupid seems to me a negative connotation, just could not formulate in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; general applicability the 'positive' features against which the deficiency 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would constitue stupidity.  I would easily fall into a series similarly to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your series about 'delusion' - invalidating every aspect one by one, by the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rest.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yet: I believe in stupidity, just cannot identify it beyond my personal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; feelings. I even feel a difference between a stujpid bum and a stupid ass, - 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could not express it scientifically.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thanks for your thought provoking reflections.
</em><br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; John,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Some people believe crazy things... literally crazy things, and they require
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; treatment for it. The definition of a delusion in psychiatry is:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;A fixed, false belief which is not in keeping with the patient's cultural 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; background.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So someone may have a belief that is false, but not fixed, i.e. he will 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; revise his belief
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in response to contrary evidence, and that isn't a delusion. Or someone may 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; belief that is both false and fixed, but it is shared by the cultural group 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to which he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; belongs, and that isn't a delusion either. This latter provision was put in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mainly to exclude
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; religious beliefs.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Usually there are other markers of mental illness as well as the delusion 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; allowing one to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; make a diagnosis and decide on treatment: hallucinations, sleep and appetite 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; disturbance,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; personality changes and so on. Very rarely, these other signs are absent, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and you are faced
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with deciding whether the patient is mentally ill or just has weird beliefs. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The only investigation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which is of help in these cases is a trial of antipsychotic medication: this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has a false negative
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rate, in that in a minority of cases clearly psychotic symptoms do not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; respond to medication,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but a negligible false positive rate, i.e. if the beliefs go away with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; antipsychotic medication and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; return on cessation of medication then they are definitely psychotic. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Religious and other cultural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; beliefs do not change with medication.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In other words, it is usually possible to know if someone is crazy, but more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; difficult to know if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they are just stupid.
