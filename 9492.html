<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It looks like g is computable isn't it. All fn are computable and can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; be computed on each n, and certainly adding one (&quot;the + 1&quot;) is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; computable too. Right?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Well, if you say &quot;all right&quot; here, we are in trouble. Because if g is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; really computable, then g is in the sequence of all computable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; functions fi. But then *there is* a k such that g = fk, and then g(k)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is equal to both fk(k) and fk(k)+1, and that gives 0 = 1, by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; substracting the well-defined number fk(k).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; So g just cannot be a computable!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; How could g looks like being computable? It is true that all fn are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; computable, and it is obviously true that &quot;+ 1&quot; is computable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; So, the only thing which is not computable is .... the bijection
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; itself, between N and the fi.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It is the correspondence:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 1 --- f1
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 2 --- f2
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 3 --- f3
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 4 --- f4
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; which is NOT computable! There is just no algorithm which can generate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the sequence of codes of the computable functions from N to N. So,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; although each fn is a computable function (from N to N), you cannot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; diagonalize it for getting g, because to compute g on n, g(n) you need
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to generate the n first programs corresponding to f1, f2, f3, ... fn,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and then apply it to n (and then add one), but you just will never 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; able to give me a finite set of instructions for doing that. If {f1,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; f2, f3, ...} are all computable function from N to N, and if the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; sequence is complete (con,tains all such function) then g, although
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; mathematically well defined, is just not programmable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here, I would think that to compute g(n), you would only have to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generate fn and apply it to n and add one.  In saying that you have to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;generate the n first programs&quot;, perhaps you are looking ahead to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Universal Dovetailer starting at f1 which is the smallest program, etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  But if we are just considering the math/definitions here, I'd reason
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; differently to show that the bijection is not computable.  It seems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the way to prove that g is not computable, we could show that one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (or both) of the following is false:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) g can be specified in a finite number of symbols.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) g can be executed in a finite number of steps, given any single
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; input.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think that #2 above is actually true.  To compute g(n), you just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; compute fn(n) and add one (like you said).  Since fn can be executed in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a finite number of steps, then #2 follows.  Even if you had to compute
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all of the fi from 1 to n in a dovetailer fashion, it would still
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; compute g(n) in a finite time, since all of the fi's are computable.  I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; guess even if this was the Universal Dovetailer computing the fi's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interspersed with non-computable Fi's, it would still compute the fi's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in a finite amount of time, along with a finite amount of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non-computable Fi's computation (even though it will not finish the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Fi's computation).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; On the other hand, I think that #1 above is false.  This is because, in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; order to specify g as a bijection from N to N, you need an infinite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; number of symbols:  you need *all* of the programs {f1, f2, f3, ...},
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which is a countably infinite number of finite programs, which added
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; together makes a countably infinite number of symbols.  Am I off track?
</em><br />
<br />I think you are a little bit off the track here (and less in your other 
<br />
post).
<br />
<br />Let us be specific (also for the others).
<br />
<br />Let us continue to write f1 f2 f3 f4 f5 f6 f7 ... for the sequence of 
<br />
total computable functions.
<br />
Let us continue to write F1 F2 F3 F4 F5 F6 F7 ... for the sequence of 
<br />
partial computable functions (this includes the fi but in a hidden 
<br />
way).
<br />
Let us write, as usual, g for the diagonalization of the fi, and G for 
<br />
the diagonalization of the Fi.
<br />
<br />So: g(n) = fn(n)+1; and G(n) = Fn(n)+1
<br />
<br />Now g cannot be computable, it would be total and it would belongs to 
<br />
the sequence fi, and thus there would be a number code k such that g = 
<br />
fk, and then fk(k) = fk(k)+1, and then 0 = 1 by substracting the well 
<br />
defined number fk(k). Obviously each fn(n) is computable, and adding 
<br />
one is computable, so only the bijection between the fi and N can be 
<br />
the source of uncomputability.  Conclusion the bijection between i and 
<br />
fi, although well defined mathematically, is not computable.
<br />
<br />Now, if we accept Church thesis, then by definition all the total 
<br />
function are in the sequence F1 F2 F3 F4 ... But the sequence Fi is 
<br />
mechanically generable (just do it on your favorite programming 
<br />
language), and thus G is programmable, (G(n) = Fn(n)+1; note the 
<br />
capital!) but then G is programmable and thus belongs to the Fi, and 
<br />
thus you can find k, the number code of G, and then G(k) = Fk(k) = 
<br />
Fk(k)+1, but this can be ok only if Fk(k) is undefined.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; BUT THEN .....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Saying this, it could look like the Universal Dovetailer is still in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; peril. But I have given you the shape of the solution when I show you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the proof of the existence of a irrational number which exponentiated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to an irrational number gives a rational number. That precise problem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is irrelevant, but the non constructive reasoning I did to prove it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; very relevant here. I was telling that there exist some mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; object, but I was unable to give it. I was only able to give you a bow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; with the shape
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     { a   b }
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; telling you the &quot;solution&quot; was in that box (but not saying if it was a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; or if it was b).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The same here, but with an infinite box. I cannot generate 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; mechanically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the set {f1, f2, f3, ...} of computable functions, but there is still
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; hope (Church Thesis CT will just express that hope) that I can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; generate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; some BIGGER set, containing all computable functions AND MANY OTHER
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; THINGS TOO. The hope is that the OTHER THINGS will help us escaping 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; diagonal contradiction.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Well, actually CT says more: it says not only that there is a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; universal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; language/machine, but that fortran is such a one! And fortran programs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; are fortran generable, so I can generate a sequence of all fortran
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; one-variable program F1 F2 F3 F4 F5 F6 F7 F8 .... (&quot;all&quot; means that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; soon or later this sequence goes trough any fortran programs: it is of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; course an infinite set)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here, the Fi's are all still computable but not necessarily from N to N
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (i.e. total). Right?
</em><br />
<br />Yes. They are called partial computable functions, although it would 
<br />
have been better to call them computable partial functions. But I 
<br />
prefer to always stick to the most used nomenclature.
<br />
The Fi are written \phi_i  (in latex), but I will write Fi for it in 
<br />
the mail (and Wi will denotes their domain).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why is it that we are interested only in total computable functions?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The first paragraph in my previous post, on &quot;motivation&quot;, addressed the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; motivation for computable, but why total?  Do total functions have some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attribute that is required in your comp?
</em><br />
<br /><br />The total fi are an important subset of the partial Fi. It is really 
<br />
the Fi which are important, although the sequence of fi will be play a 
<br />
rather important &quot;second&quot; role: the role of what George Levy called 
<br />
sometimes the *first person plenitude* and which will play the role of 
<br />
the arithmetical interpretation of the third Plotinus' hypostases (the 
<br />
Soul!). I don't want anticipate too much (the soul comes after the 
<br />
&quot;terrestrial&quot; and &quot;divine&quot; intellect captured by G and G*. 
<br />
Nevertheless, intuitively, you can imagine that if you are working with 
<br />
a powerfull NON-UNIVERSAL subprogramming language you will keep control 
<br />
on your &quot;software processing&quot;, and you can still extend it into the 
<br />
tranfinite as we have done with the successive sequences of (total) 
<br />
growing functions.
<br />
The first person is not only incorrigible, she want have complete or 
<br />
total control of her (growing) universe!
<br />
And this is by the way what conventional computer (as opposed to 
<br />
artificial intelligence) use consist in: we don't want our execution 
<br />
going in an unpredictable loop of infinite computation, even when 
<br />
dealing with streams (although I don't want to tackle them at this 
<br />
stage). Conventional computing is &quot;first person&quot; at the start. In 
<br />
artificial intelligence programming, we are no more trying to conceive 
<br />
a controllable self-extension of ourself, but we hope that the program 
<br />
will self-extend itself by itself and thus become autonomous (it is 
<br />
almost a contradictory goal: we want the machine going to surprise us 
<br />
in some way and so we are open (up to some economic point!) to let 
<br />
ourself loosing control. Life, and everything creative or interesting 
<br />
lives on the border between the controllable and the uncontrollable.
<br />
Another thing of interest about the total computable functions is that 
<br />
they are are equivalent with the constructive, or computable, recursive 
<br />
(all those terms are synounimous with CT) *real*. Indeed a computable 
<br />
real number can be defined (with CT) as a real such that its decimals, 
<br />
or its continuous fraction coefficient (for those who knows what it is) 
<br />
are computable, and I guess you can see how to code it by a total 
<br />
computable function: for example 10*PI = 31,41592...can be coded by the 
<br />
computable function:
<br />
<br />{(0, 31) (1, 4) (2, 1) (3, 5) (4,9) (5, 2) ...}
<br />
<br />Inversely, total computable function can represent computable real 
<br />
numbers, and the set R of total computable functions is quite often 
<br />
referred as the computable reals. It represents the maximal 
<br />
controllable thing. It is thus ironic, but highly informative that you 
<br />
cannot generate it all, unless you accept to generate hidden among them 
<br />
the *other beast&quot; the partial computable functions. Those partial 
<br />
computable functions do not capture the computable reals which all have 
<br />
their decimals computable.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; So, given that the sequence F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, ... is generable, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; corresponding diagonal function G defined by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; G(n) = Fn(n) + 1
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; *is* programmable in fortran. So there *is* a k such that G = Fk
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; And what will happen if I apply G on its own number-code k?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Just this: your machine will crash! The fortran interpreter will go in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; loop or in an infinite computations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Well, in some formal sense I will get G(k) = G(k) + 1. But I can no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; more substract G(k) on both sides like we have always do at that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; stage,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; because G(k) is just not a well-defined number.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It looks like the OTHER THINGS are the function from a subset of N to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; N. Functions, now, if we want to associate them to the fortran
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; programs, can be only partially defined functions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; So I can still  hope the sequence Fi of Fortran programs goes trough,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; among OTHER THINGS, all computable functions everywhere defined, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the price will be that I will got the undefined programmable functions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; by the same token.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I can see why a *non-computable* function would run forever, because if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it is generatable it must admit a finite description, so the only other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attribute of computability it can fail to have is finite execution.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But why would a computable partial function run forever?
</em><br />
<br />At least we know for the partial computable G. If G(k) = Fk(k) does not 
<br />
run for ever, it will stop on a number Fk(k) equal to Fk(k)+1.
<br />
G(k) run forever because 0 is different of 1.
<br />
Or if you prefer: G(k) run forever unless 0 is different of 1, and then 
<br />
experiments (*)  provides confirmation that 0 is different from 1 (but 
<br />
honestly I'm joking here).
<br />
<br />(*) try it, well if you have some time and know some not to complex 
<br />
programming language, perhaps we could do it on the list here either 
<br />
with Python or the combinators?. I think aloud.
<br />
<br />Now if G(k) run forever, you think that you can stop it by some 
<br />
&quot;Ctrl-Q&quot; key, or escape key, and somehow you think G crashed, not your 
<br />
computer! Well, the point of the diagonalization is that you will never 
<br />
succeed in finding a complete set of keys or a 100% safe operating 
<br />
system such that any non terminating procedure can end so easily, 
<br />
unless you accept keys like cut the power, or send an asteroid on the 
<br />
planet! But actually even such instruction can be defeated by 
<br />
diagonalization, once you take the &quot;whole system&quot; into account in the 
<br />
(universal) simulation.
<br />
The diagonalization can show why in Computerland there is no universal 
<br />
vaccine against the many kind of virus and organisms.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Why would it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even crash?
</em><br />
<br />Because if you run &quot;G(k)&quot; on your universal machine (including the 
<br />
operating system)  in which you have defined G, you will have to reboot 
<br />
the system.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Wouldn't the Universal Dovetailer just generate the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; program for that function and run it on all numbers that it is defined
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on?
</em><br />
<br />Yes, for each programs, the one corresponding to the sequence of the 
<br />
partial computable functions Fi.    Let us write them Pi. The UD runs 
<br />
one step of P1 on 1, then one step of P2 on 1, then the seond step of 
<br />
P1, on 1, then the second step of P2, etc. using a good bijection 
<br />
between N and N^3, it can dovetails on the n of Pn, the number of 
<br />
steps, and the inputs, so as not being trapped into some *particular* 
<br />
infinite computations. Somehow it trapped itself in all finite and 
<br />
infinite computations.
<br />
<br />When I say a computer (alias a turing universal machine, or simply, 
<br />
given that we assume CT, a universal machine) crash, I am not saying it 
<br />
is the end!
<br />
The universal dovetailer is born crashed, if I can say. It compute 
<br />
nothing. More precisely, and extensionally,  it computes the empty 
<br />
partial computable function, the one with the graph having no couples!:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{  }
<br />
<br />The DU has no input and no outputs and computes for ever. Intensionally 
<br />
(as opposed to extensionally) The DU goes through all possible 
<br />
computations.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; When we are jumping from functions to programs crashing, I am getting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; confused.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Here a partial computable function Fi is undefined at n if her program 
<br />
i &quot;crashes&quot; on n.
<br />
And I propose to define equality of partial computable function by
<br />
<br />Fi = Fj if they have the same domain and the same value on that domain.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It would seem that a program running forever and a program
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; crashing (stopping without the right answer) would have different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; effects on a Universal Dovetailer.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Why? There is no effect of the DU by the DU. It runs all programs, and 
<br />
of course all the ways programs can crash, including asteroids!
<br />
The DU itself cannot crash in some sense, and btw this shows the DU is 
<br />
not a universal machine but we knew it: &quot;{}&quot; would be a quite 
<br />
degenerate computable universal function.
<br />
<br />Oops I realize I am calling the UD DU. Sorry. DU is the french for UD. 
<br />
Dovetelleur Universel (Brussels' &quot;thesis&quot;), or Déployeur Universel 
<br />
(Lille's thesis). (Universal Deployment). Les deux se disent (you can 
<br />
say both) :)
