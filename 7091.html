<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Let us consider these flavors of altruism in the case of Stathis' puzzle:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You are one of 10 copies who are being tortured. The copies are all 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; run in lockstep with each other, as would occur if 10 identical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; were running 10 identical sentient programs. Assume that the torture is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; bad that death is preferable, and so bad that escaping it with your life 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; only marginally preferable to escaping it by dying (eg., given the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;option of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a 50% chance of dying or a 49% chance of escaping the torture and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;living,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; you would take the 50%). The torture will continue for a year, but you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; allowed one of 3 choices as to how things will proceed:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (a) 9 of the 10 copies will be chosen at random and painlessly killed, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;while
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the remaining copy will continue to be tortured.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (b) For one minute, the torture will cease and the number of copies will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; increase to 10^100. Once the minute is up, the number of copies will be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; reduced to 10 again and the torture will resume as before.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (c) the torture will be stopped for 8 randomly chosen copies, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;continue
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; for the other 2.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Which would you choose?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;For the averagist, doing (a) will not change average happiness.  Doing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(b) will improve it, but not that much.  The echoes of the torture and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;anticipation of future torture will make that one minute of respite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not particularly pleasant.  Doing (c) would seem to be the best choice,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;as 8 out of the 10 avoid a year of torture.  (I'm not sure why Stathis
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;seemed to say that the people would not want to escape their torture,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;given that it was so bad.  That doesn't seem right to me; the worse it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is, the more they would want to escape it.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;For the totalist, since death is preferable to the torture, each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;person's life has a negative impact on total happiness.  Hence (a)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would be an improvement as it removes these negatives from the universe.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Doing (b) is unclear: during that one minute, would the 10^100 copies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;kill themselves if possible?  If so, their existence is negative and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;so doing (b) would make the universe much worse due to the addition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of so many negatively happy OMs.  Doing (c) would seem to be better,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;assuming that the 8 out of 10 would eventually find that their lives
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;were positive during that year without torture.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So it appears that each one would choose (c), although they would differ
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;about whether (a) is an improvement over the status quo.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(b) is deprecated because that one minute will not be pleasant due to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the echoes of the torture.  If the person could have his memory wiped
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;for that one minute and neither remember nor anticipate future torture,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that would make (b) the best choice for both kinds of altruists.  Adding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;10^100 pleasant observer-moments would increase both total and average
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;happiness and would more than compensate for a year of suffering for 10
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;people.  10^100 is a really enormous number.
</em><br />
<br />This analysis would be fine were it not for the fact that we are discussing 
<br />
*exact copies* running in lockstep with each other. You have to take into 
<br />
account the special way observers construct their identity as a unique 
<br />
individual persisting through time, which you admitted in a recent post &quot;is 
<br />
a purely contingent, artificial, manufactured set of beliefs and attitudes 
<br />
which have been programmed into us in order to help our genes survive.&quot; With 
<br />
choice (a), although it seems like a good idea to end the suffering of 9/10 
<br />
copies, it doesn't make the slightest bit of difference. In order to end a 
<br />
person's suffering at a particular observer moment, you have to either 
<br />
ensure that there will be no successor OM's ever again (i.e., death), or 
<br />
provide a successor OM which does not involve suffering. As long as at least 
<br />
one copy remains alive, that copy will always provide a successor OM for any 
<br />
of the other copies which are killed. Subjectively, it will be impossible 
<br />
for any of the copies to notice that anything has changed when they are 
<br />
killed. This reasoning applies whether you consider the selfish interests of 
<br />
one of the copies or the altruistic interests of all of them.
<br />
<br />You might argue, as you have with your example of increased measure on 
<br />
alternate days of the week, that it is still better to try to reduce the 
<br />
total number of unpleasant experiences in the world, even if we cannot see 
<br />
any change that may result. Perhaps that would be OK, all else being equal. 
<br />
However, I provided choice (c) to show how this sort of reasoning can lead 
<br />
to unfortunate outcomes. In (c), unlike (a), alternative successor OM's to 
<br />
the torture exist. The result is that at the moment the choice is made, each 
<br />
copy is looking at a 20% chance that the torture will continue and an 80% 
<br />
chance that it will stop. At first glance, this doesn't look quite as good 
<br />
as choice (a), if you follow the &quot;try to reduce the number of unpleasant 
<br />
OM's in the world&quot; rule. But as shown above, it would be a terrible mistake 
<br />
to choose (a), as you would be ensuring that the torture will continue.
<br />
<br />Now consider choice (b). Let's assume, as you suggest, that the minute of 
<br />
respite choice (b) provides is not spoilt by the knowledge that it is 
<br />
bookended by torture. Certainly, if you were to randomly pull one OM out of 
<br />
the set of all possible OM's the probability that it would involve torture 
<br />
is now, for practical purposes, zero. But what does this mean for the poor 
<br />
wretches populating my thought experiment? I suggest that it means nothing 
<br />
at all. At the first person level there is no possible test, observation or 
<br />
line of reasoning which could give the copies any clue as to whether they 
<br />
are one of 10, 10^100 or unique. If all the copies kept a diary, you would 
<br />
find that each of them tells exactly the same story, with a single narrator 
<br />
and a single narrative, and each considers himself to be one individual from 
<br />
start to finish. If you asked them what the best choice out of (a), (b) and 
<br />
(c) is, they would all pick (c), because from their point of view (a) 
<br />
results in continuous torture, (b) continuous torture with only one minute 
<br />
respite, and (c) gives them an 80% chance of ending the torture for good. 
<br />
Moreover, as each of them want (c) as the selfish choice, it must also be 
<br />
the altruistic choice.
<br />
<br />Finally, is the averagist/totalist distinction of relatively recent vintage? 
<br />
Its application to left/right wing politics is something I had never thought 
<br />
of before, and it's a rare thing when you come across a completely new way 
<br />
of looking at something you have been familiar with for years.
