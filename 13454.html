<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Part of what I wanted to get at in my thought experiment is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bafflement and confusion an AI should feel when exposed to human ideas
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about consciousness.  Various people here have proffered their own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ideas, and we might assume that the AI would read these suggestions,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; along with many other ideas that contradict the ones offered here.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It seems hard to escape the conclusion that the only logical response
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is for the AI to figuratively throw up its hands and say that it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; impossible to know if it is conscious, because even humans cannot agree
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on what consciousness is.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In particular I don't think an AI could be expected to claim that it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; knows that it is conscious, that consciousness is a deep and intrinsic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; part of itself, that whatever else it might be mistaken about it could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not be mistaken about being conscious.  I don't see any logical way it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could reach this conclusion by studying the corpus of writings on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; topic.  If anyone disagrees, I'd like to hear how it could happen.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And the corollary to this is that perhaps humans also cannot legitimately
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; make such claims, since logically their position is not so different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from that of the AI.  In that case the seemingly axiomatic question of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whether we are conscious may after all be something that we could be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mistaken about.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br /><br />A human, or an AI, or a tree stump cannot be mistaken about what, if
<br />
anything, it directly experiences. However, it could not know that this
<br />
experience corresponds to what any other entity calls &quot;consciousness&quot;. It is
<br />
possible that what other people call &quot;consciousness&quot; is very different to
<br />
what I experience, and certainly a computer would do well to question
<br />
whether its experiences, such as they may be, are &quot;consciousness&quot; as would
<br />
befit a human; but it couldn't be in doubt that it had some experiences.
