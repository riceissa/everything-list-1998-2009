</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the acceleration is forever...
</em><br />
<br />That's both an astonishing and maybe just a little bit of a scary 
<br />
thought. Is there some hint of any kind that the acceleration of the 
<br />
universe might have a limiting factor?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; In other words, the redshift at all points within the universe 
</em><br />
will
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; have shifted to a level of absolute zero observable energy at 
</em><br />
some
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; future time because the universe is then expanding (at every 
</em><br />
point
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; within itself) at or beyond a rate that would allow energy to 
</em><br />
find
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; anything in the universe that it could be relative to.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't quite understand this last sentence. 
</em><br />
<br />Assume that at some distant time the inflation rate of space/time has 
<br />
exceeded the speed of light. At that moment, and forever thereafter, 
<br />
no particle within that inflation region could interact with another -
<br />
- because the distance between particles is increasing faster than a 
<br />
particle can transverse any distance at the speed of light or below. 
<br />
That leads to the conclusion that the affected particle is then no 
<br />
longer relative to anything but itself. As far as that affected 
<br />
particle is concerned it IS the entire universe and nothing else 
<br />
exists. This of course is an illusion, from the larger viewpoint of 
<br />
the meta universe. But I argue that when the particle becomes in that 
<br />
way relative only to itself then it has in fact melded with the meta 
<br />
universe, meaning that its energy has in fact returned to the meta 
<br />
universe from which it was spawned during the big bang.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;But it may be worth
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pointing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; out that dark energy is uniformely and isotropically distributed so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that
</em><br />
<br />It is? That would infer a homogeneous distribution of energy that 
<br />
does not appear to hold true with any other observation of the 
<br />
universe. If the big bang had resulted in an observable universe that 
<br />
is uniform in structure or composition throughout then one might 
<br />
expect the same of dark energy, but this does not appear to be the 
<br />
case. I would argue that when/if we are able to measure (as opposed 
<br />
to just infer) dark energy then we will find it to be distributed in 
<br />
much the same way as is energy that we can now measure.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; it seems to be something akin to the largest scales of 
</em><br />
matter/energy
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distribution, for example, inertial mass distibution (dark and lit) 
</em><br />
or
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; better still, curvature or torsion. There are several models of DE
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proposed along these lines...
</em><br />
<br />Perhaps. As you say, it's too early to know. But our closed universe 
<br />
has of late been attributed to have a shape that is NOT a smooth 
<br />
spheroid. Amazingly, it appears to be composed of interlocking shapes 
<br />
that are not that of a sphere, but because the universe is closed the 
<br />
aggregate appearance is theat of a non smooth spheroid. Maybe this is 
<br />
not so amazing, since no perfect sphere seems to exist in nature.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; In that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; situation a particle would never be able to travel from any point 
</em><br />
A
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to any point B, although it might try to do so for as long as it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; existed.  Eventually the particle could no longer exist, because 
</em><br />
it
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; itself would loose coherency as its integral parts moved away 
</em><br />
from
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; each other as a consequence of the space it occupies continuing 
</em><br />
to
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; inflate, and thereby move its parts away from each other until
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; nuclear forces could no longer maintain the attraction that keeps
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; particle (of any type whatsoever) from totally disintegrating.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, I can't quite make out what you are saying here! I don't 
</em><br />
think
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the &quot;integrity of particles&quot; is threteaned by universal 
</em><br />
acceleration.
<br />
<br />Perhaps not if indeed a particle, once the inflation rate has reached 
<br />
a rate relative to a particle so that the particle can no longer 
<br />
itneract with any other particle, then the particle has indeed melded 
<br />
with an thereby returned its energy to the meta universe from which 
<br />
it originated to begin with.
<br />
<br />But if it does not, then ALL points in space relative to that 
<br />
particle, including at all points within and exterior to the 
<br />
particle, keep increasing in expansion rate. In that case the 
<br />
distance between bound quarks (for example) keeps distancing, and at 
<br />
some point they suddenly become unbound because of a nuclear force 
<br />
being unable to influence a binding force over that much of a 
<br />
distance. The particle completely disintegrates.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; That the Universe has causaly disconnected regions, as it stands, 
</em><br />
is
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; undeliable but Dark Matter seems to define the largest regions that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are able to be structured if that is what you are talking about.
</em><br />
<br />No, it's just that at this current stage of expansion rate we are 
<br />
only able to observe the expansion over cosmic distances. In time, if 
<br />
one lived long enough, it would be observable at quantum distances.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The local inhomogeneities, such as you and I, do not betray the 
</em><br />
very
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; high degree of homegeneity the Universe displays at the Megaparsec
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scale. The cosmological term may cease to be constant at some 
</em><br />
scale,
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that is true, and it would be most interesting to know which one 
</em><br />
but
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it is to early in the game for that.
</em><br />
<br />It is too early! But I argue that a high degree of homegeneity does 
<br />
not equate to homegenity. Our universe could not have planets, stars, 
<br />
and other items such as people if it were homogeneous.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; A lot of the approaches to DE assume a cosmological term varying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with some cosmic scalar field (quintessence) or some clever 
</em><br />
equation
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of state (quartessence).  These address time variation rather than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; spacial variation because that is where the weirdness remains...
</em><br />
<br />A varying comological term probably does exist in reality, although I 
<br />
might argue that the term is an effect rather than an affect. I think 
<br />
such a term would represent an exponential inflation rate factor (an 
<br />
observation at a point in space at a specific point in time).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am afraid I cannot offer much comment on what you say here. I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; presumme you are expounding your own ideas but each one of your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; paragraphs contains assumptions that are not quite consistent with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; each other, beyond what is believe known. I have specail trouble 
</em><br />
with
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your insistence on a &quot;metauniverse of absolute temperature zero&quot; 
</em><br />
and
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your language of energy exchange between each universe and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; metauniverse!!! Not my thermodynamics there!
</em><br />
<br />I'm merely refering to a universe that has reached ultimate and total 
<br />
heat death, when I refer to a meta universe. A universe that is at 
<br />
100% equilibrium throughout all of its points. I am not sure that 
<br />
there can be only one meta universe, but it seems to me that a meta 
<br />
universe by that definition must be a singularity of nature. Perhaps 
<br />
the only real singularity that ever has, does, or will exist.
<br />
<br />There is no real energy exchange from the viewpoint of the meta 
<br />
universe, for it is at average and over infinite time at equilibrium. 
<br />
It is only due to quantum effects (however unlikely they are, they do 
<br />
still have an eternity to occur within) that the creation of virtual 
<br />
particles within the meta universe can lead to the (temporary) 
<br />
formation of a universe similar to ours. No matter if the resultant 
<br />
universe is open, flat, or closed ... by one way or the other those 
<br />
virtual particles are returned to the meta universe; those methods 
<br />
being via black holes and/or the expansion of a universe at an ever 
<br />
increasing rate (they are both really one and the same thing from the 
<br />
viewpoint of the meta universe). What we, bound in our universe, 
<br />
perceive as energy is but an illusion from the viewpoint of the MU.
