</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;affect; then I think it would be conscious.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;It's interesting that people actually withdraw their hand from the fire *before* they experience 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;the pain. The withdrawl is a reflex, presumably evolved in organisms with the most primitive 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;central nervour systems, while the pain seems to be there as an afterthought to teach us a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;lesson so we won't do it again. Thus, from consideration of evolutionary utility consciousness 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;does indeed seem to be a side-effect of memory and learning. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;Even more curious, volitional action also occurs before one is aware of it. Are you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;familiar with the experiments of Benjamin Libet and Grey Walter?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; These experiments showed that in apparently voluntarily initiated motion, motor cortex activity 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; actually preceded the subject's awareness of his intention by a substantial fraction of a second. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; In other words, we act first, then &quot;decide&quot; to act. These studies did not examine pre-planned 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; action (presumably that would be far more technically difficult) but it is easy to imagine the analogous 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; situation whereby the action is unconsciously &quot;planned&quot; before we become aware of our decision. In 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; other words, free will is just a feeling which occurs after the fact. This is consistent with the logical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; impossibility of something that is neither random nor determined, which is what I feel my free will to be.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;I also think that this is an argument against zombies. If it were possible for an organism to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;behave just like a conscious being, but actually be unconscious, then why would consciousness 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;have evolved? 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;An interesting point - but hard to give any answer before pinning down what we mean 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;by consciousness.  For example Bruno, Julian Jaynes, and Daniel Dennett have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;explanations; but they explain somewhat different consciousnesses, or at least 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;different aspects.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Consciousness is the hardest thing to explain but the easiest thing to understand, if it's your own 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; consciousness at issue. I think we can go a long way discussing it assuming that we do know what 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; we are talking about even though we can't explain it. The question I ask is, why did people evolve 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; with this consciousness thing, whatever it is? The answer must be, I think, that it is a necessary 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; side-effect of the sort of neural complexity that underpins our behaviour. If it were not, and it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; were possible that beings could behave exactly like humans and not be conscious, then it would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; have been wasteful of nature to have provided us with consciousness. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is not necessarily so.  First, evolution is constrained by what goes before. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Its engineering solutions often seem rube-goldberg, e.g. backward retina in mammals. 
</em><br />
<br />Sure, but vision itself would not have evolved unnecessarily.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;   Second, there is selection against some evolved feature only to the extent it has a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (net) cost.  For example, Jaynes explanation of consciousness conforms to these two 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; criteria.  I think that any species that evolves intelligence comparable to ours will 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be conscious for reasons somewhat like Jaynes theory.  They will be social and this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; combined with intelligence will make language a good evolutionary move.  Once they 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have language, remembering what has happened, in order to communicate and plan, in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; symbolic terms will be a easy and natural evolvement.  Whether that leads to hearing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your own narrative in your head, as Jaynes supposes, is questionable; but it would be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consistent with evolution. It takes advantage of existing structure and functions to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; realize a useful new function.
</em><br />
<br />Agreed. So consciousness is either there for a reason or it's a necessary side-effect of the sort 
<br />
of brains we have and the way we have evolved. It's still theoretically possible that if the latter 
<br />
is the case, we might have been unconscious if we had evolved completely different kinds of 
<br />
brains, but similar behaviour - although I think it unlikely.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;This does not necessarily 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; mean that computers can be conscious: maybe if we had evolved with electronic circuits in our 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; heads rather than neurons consciousness would not have been a necessary side-effect. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But my point is that this may come down to what we would mean by a computer being 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious.  Bruno has an answer in terms of what the computer can prove.  Jaynes (and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probably John McCarthy) would say a computer is conscious if it creates a narrative 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of its experience which it can access as memory.
</em><br />
<br />Maybe this is a copout, but I just don't think it is even logically possible to explain what consciousness 
<br />
*is* unless you have it. It's like the problem of explaining vision to a blind man: he might be the world's 
<br />
greatest scientific expert on it but still have zero idea of what it is like to see - and that's even though 
<br />
he shares most of the rest of his cognitive structure with other humans, and can understand analogies 
<br />
using other sensations. Knowing what sort of program a conscious computer would have to run to be 
<br />
conscious, what the purpose of consciousness is, and so on, does not help me to understand what the 
<br />
computer would be experiencing, except by analogy with what I myself experience.
