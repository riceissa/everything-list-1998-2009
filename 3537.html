<br />
One of the things that strikes me as most peculiar and unexpected about
<br />
the universe is this: that it is apparently finite and inhomogeneous in
<br />
time, yet infinite and homogeneous in space.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From what we can tell, the universe began about 13 billion years ago
</em><br />
and has gone through a series of phases or &quot;ages&quot; in which the dominant
<br />
physical effects have been strikingly different.  And current observations
<br />
appear to indicate that the pattern will continue into the future, with
<br />
our current era of matter and stars being destined to give way to low
<br />
temperature and long-term effects.
<br />
<br />However at the large scale the universe shows no evidence of being finite
<br />
in size.  Some models predict that it should be finite, but these aren't
<br />
very strong predictions given the struggles which cosmology is facing
<br />
these days.  And even if it is finite as inflation models predict, it
<br />
is so huge that there is no real hope of distinguishing it from infinite
<br />
in size.  Likewise the universe appears to be roughly the same everywhere.
<br />
Although there is clumpiness at many scales, there is no belief that the
<br />
average density or other parameters of the universe will be different
<br />
in widely separated regions.
<br />
<br />Is this something that might be predicted by a multiverse theory?
<br />
<br />It might be argued that the finiteness of (past) time is predicted by
<br />
the theory, because it is questionable whether it is meaningful to
<br />
have an infinite amount of computation in your past.
<br />
<br />The apparent infinitude of the spatial universe however does not fit
<br />
too well, for the same reason.  If the universe is infinite then it
<br />
plausibly carries an infinite amount of information.  This would require
<br />
an infinite amount of computation.  Of course most of it is outside of
<br />
the &quot;light cone&quot; imposed by relativity, so perhaps this loophole in some
<br />
ways could avoid the need for truly infinite computation.
<br />
<br />Even if the universe is finite, it does seem extravagantly large.
<br />
It seems hard to justify such a size from anthropic arguments, especially
<br />
the sizes predicted by cosmological inflation theories.  Surely humans
<br />
could have evolved in a much smaller universe, one which contains less
<br />
information and requires less computation.
<br />
<br />The universe seems to contain a lot more information than is necessary
<br />
for minds like ours to exist.  Perhaps there are subtle reasons why such a
<br />
large size is necessary (for example, perhaps inflation is a side effect
<br />
of the simplest set of fundamental particles which would allow atoms to
<br />
exist and hence life to form, so we get a big universe as a side effect
<br />
of having simple physical laws at the microscale).  But unless we can
<br />
find such linkages, this appears to count against an ensemble theory.
<br />
<br />Put another way, the all-universe model should predict that our universe
<br />
is little more complex than it needs to be for us to evolve.  In effect
<br />
it predicts that such linkages will be found.
<br />
