Jacques, I'm really trying to understand your objection to 
<br />
QTI, but I'm not there yet.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         What if ALL branches terminate?
</em><br />
<br />I think that no &quot;branches&quot; ever terminate.  As I discussed in my 
<br />
last email, the only relevant consideration for QTI is the present 
<br />
moment of a conscious being, and the &quot;very next moment&quot;, which might
<br />
be one Plank time in the future, if you like.  As long as there are
<br />
some next moments in which my conscious self is alive, I don't need
<br />
to worry, my branch has not terminated.  Now, I would think that if
<br />
any branch ever did completely terminate, then QTI would be in 
<br />
trouble, but I don't see how that could ever be. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;         Note 1: this is perfectly compatible with an ensemble of branches
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which does not terminate even though each individual branch does, if there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are infinitely many branches.
</em><br />
<br />I don't know what this means.  How are &quot;all branches terminating&quot; and
<br />
&quot;an ensemble of branches which does not terminate&quot; compatible?  What
<br />
are you trying to say here?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;         Note 2: this is really the situation in QM, if a 'branch' is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understood as an implementation of a brain computation.  If you disagree I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; must ask for a mathematically precise definition of branch.
</em><br />
<br />I tried to give a description of a branch in my last post, but it
<br />
was certainly not very precise.  I called it &quot;world&quot; there.  I think
<br />
that in &quot;Many-Worlds&quot;, a world is the same as a branch.  I also called
<br />
it a thread on consciousness.  I think I'm understanding, after trying
<br />
to get more rigorous about these terms, why so many physicists hate 
<br />
the term &quot;Many-Worlds&quot;.
<br />
<br />But again, I'll iterate that as far as QTI is concerned, the only 
<br />
portion of the branch that is important are the two SAS-observer
<br />
moments separated by one &quot;delta-t&quot;.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         Note 3: I have not been active recently because I have a lot of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; work to do, and I will have for the next few weeks.  To all Qiciders: Do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not interpret silence on my part as a lack of contempt for your writings.
</em><br />
<br />I'm so relieved!

</em><br />
<br />In having read a number of your posts from the archives, let me propose
<br />
a description of what I think *might* be why you disagree with QTI, then
<br />
you can tell me why I'm an idiot.
<br />
<br />Deutsch, in FOR, described an interpretation of MWI wherein worlds
<br />
didn't &quot;split&quot;, instead, they &quot;differentiated&quot;.  He gave a diagram
<br />
something like this:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classical MWI, worlds split:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deutshian MWI, worlds differentiate:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
<br />
<br />Could it be that you are thinking along the lines of Deutschian MWI,
<br />
and see each one of us as trapped inside one world, which looks like
<br />
infinitely many others?  In other words, if you represent my 
<br />
consciousness as C, according to Deutsch, I could draw my existence
<br />
schematically as
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
<br />
<br />I exist in lots of different worlds, but in each one, I'll only
<br />
survive for a limited time.  My &quot;measure&quot; is constantly decreasing.
<br />
This suggests that I'm in one and only one world, but I just don't
<br />
know which.  Since I can't jump from one world to another, I'll
<br />
inevitably die.
<br />
<br />I'm going to assume that this is close to your position, and now
<br />
I'll proceed to blow this argument away.  If it's not, and instead
<br />
I've concocted a straw man, then oh well, at least I'll have had
<br />
fun.
<br />
<br />First, the interpretation above is in conflict with a computational
<br />
approach to consciousness, in which space, time, and indeed, every-
<br />
thing we could consider to be a &quot;world&quot; are emergent phenomena.  In
<br />
comp, we certainly could &quot;jump from one world to another&quot; - in fact,
<br />
it is meaningless to say that we are in one world or another, if
<br />
*the exact same C* appears in multiple places.  So in comp, we can
<br />
jump from world to world, and in fact, the Deutschian MWI just does
<br />
not fit.  So at the instant that one of the lines of C's terminated,
<br />
I would jump to another.  I'm sure Bruno would have more to say 
<br />
about this &quot;computational indeterminism&quot;.
<br />
<br />Note that in the MWI FAQ, Michael Clive Price states that the 
<br />
&quot;differentiation&quot; model is wrong, that worlds do, in fact, split.
<br />
He says that the statistics comes out all wrong with differentiation.
<br />
But I haven't studied the math, so I don't know, so I won't rely on
<br />
references to authority.  If anyone else knows of more info on this
<br />
topic, I'd love to hear it.
<br />
<br />One might argue that the two interpretations above are isomorphic.
<br />
That's kind of the thought I got while reading Tegmark's paper, where
<br />
he described us as being firmly embedded within a mathematical
<br />
structure, and just not being sure which.  Then, in the above
<br />
scenario, for any given line of C's, in the next moment, I would
<br />
always find myself in one of the lines that continues.  To make
<br />
this work, you'd have to swallow the FAP (Final Anthropic Principle),
<br />
which few people seem willing to do.  I'm not sure why;  FAP seems
<br />
to make sense to me.  Considering how *amazingly* unlikely is our
<br />
present existence, due to the everyday Anthropic Principle, it 
<br />
doesn't seem much of a stretch to require that I live forever -
<br />
that would be a boundary condition, see.
<br />
<br />That's all I can think of for now.
