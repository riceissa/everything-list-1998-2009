</em><br />
<br />Simple.  It's because, as I've said and as Jacques has said, the
<br />
inactive block changes the program.  But let me be explicit -- 
<br />
after all, you're the one who told me to buy these books on
<br />
computationalism, I might as well bludgeon you with them.
<br />
<br />Suppose we start out with a simple Turing machine that implements
<br />
the NAND function.  It operates on two locations in a tape, called
<br />
L0 and L1.  After the program is finished, L0 will be replaced 
<br />
with (L0 initial) NAND (L1 initial), and L1 will be replaced with
<br />
zero.  The state diagram of this machine would look like this:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0  right       write0       left       write1
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S0 ----------&gt; S1 --------&gt; S2 ------&gt; S3 --------&gt; S7
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|                          ^                        ^
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|  1  right       0 write0 |                        |
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|-----------&gt; S4 ----------|                        |
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|                                    |
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|  1 write0       left       write0  |
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|-----------&gt; S5 ------&gt; S6 ---------|
<br />
<br />It works like this:  the top chain of states, S1, S2, and S3,
<br />
record that the result of the NAND operation is a 1, meaning
<br />
that either L0 or L1 initially contained a 0.  So if L0 
<br />
initially contains a 0, then the machine will go from S0 to
<br />
S1, and will move right one space.  In its second operation,
<br />
it always writes a zero into location L1.
<br />
<br />You can see that for inputs L0 = 0, L1 = (don't care), the
<br />
states are S0, S1, S2, S3, S7.  The result of the NAND 
<br />
operation (1) is written into L0 on the transition S3 -&gt; S7.
<br />
For inputs L0 = 1, L1 = 0, the states are S0, S4, S2, S3, S7.
<br />
Again, the result of the NAND is 1 and is written on the
<br />
transition S3 -&gt; S7.  For inputs L0 = 1, L1 = 1, the states
<br />
are S0, S4, S5, S6, S7, and the result of the NAND is a 1,
<br />
which is written during the transition S6 -&gt; S7.
<br />
(Sorry for the excrutiating detail, but I want to make sure
<br />
that my notation is clear).
<br />
<br />We can write the computation performed by this device as:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;L0 &lt;- L0 NAND L1
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;L1 &lt;- 0
<br />
<br />Now let's consider, as our reference run, the inputs L0 = 0,
<br />
L1 = 1.  A detailed breakdown of the activity during this run
<br />
is:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time | State | Focus | L0 | L1 | Operation
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;------|-------|-------|----|----|-----------
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0  |   S0  |  L0   |  0 |  1 | right
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1  |   S1  |  L1   |  0 |  1 | write0
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2  |   S2  |  L1   |  0 |  0 | left
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3  |   S3  |  L0   |  0 |  0 | write1
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4  |   S7  |  L0   |  1 |  0 | STOP
<br />
<br />Now, according to Maudlin's formula, we'll create an Olympia
<br />
version of this, consisting of five troughs, corresponding
<br />
to the location in each of the five states.  If the troughs
<br />
are numbered from 0, then T0, T3, and T4 are connected by
<br />
pipes (corresponding to location L0 at times 0, 3, and 4),
<br />
and T1 and T2 are connected.  The first set, T0, T3, and T4,
<br />
is initially empty of water (0), and the second set is 
<br />
initially full (1).
<br />
<br />The armature goes down the chain, and when it gets to T2, it
<br />
empties it (corresponding to the write0 operation on the
<br />
transition from state S1 to S2 at time 1.  When it gets to
<br />
T4, it fills it.  All the other troughs, it leaves alone.
<br />
Now, as part of Olympia, we must also set up floats within
<br />
each trough that will detect when the water level is other
<br />
than that which it would have been when the armature reaches
<br />
it in the reference run.  To sum up, we have:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T0      T1      T2      T3      T4
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;bbbb    bbbb    bbbb    bbbb           bbbb = barrier
<br />
&nbsp;|    |  | f  |  | f  |  |    |  |    |
<br />
&nbsp;|    |  |^^^^|  |^^^^|  |    |  |    |     
<br />
&nbsp;|    |  |    |  |    |  |    |  |    |  f = float     
<br />
&nbsp;| f  |  |    |  |    |  | f  |  | f  |     
<br />
&nbsp;|----|  |----|  |-D--|  |----|  |----|  D = drain tripper
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|       |       |       |       |
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|       |-------|       |       |    pipes
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|                       |       |
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|-----------------------|-------|
<br />
<br />All this is set up ahead of time, clearly for the purpose
<br />
of making it so that the machine is completely &quot;dumb&quot;
<br />
while it is performing the reference calculation.
<br />
<br />So far so good.  When Olympia performs the reference run,
<br />
she works as advertised, and none of the supporting machinery
<br />
is brought into play.  But note that if I just showed you
<br />
the drawing above, you would have no way of deriving what the
<br />
computation is, i.e. NAND.  I would have to provide you an
<br />
explicit description of the supporting Klaras.
<br />
<br />Now, if I tell you that I have inserted a &quot;second set of 
<br />
blocks&quot;, such that the Klaras are disabled, now I _can_ tell
<br />
you what the computation is that is performed by this device:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (L0 == 0 AND L1 == 1) then
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;L0 &lt;- 1
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;L1 &lt;- 0
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else STOP
<br />
<br />This is an entirely different program!  It's a trivial one,
<br />
at that.
<br />
<br /><br />So what, you ask?
<br />
<br />This demonstrates that you must take the entire system into
<br />
account when translating from physical structure -&gt; computer
<br />
program.  This further demonstrates that yes, it is possible
<br />
to have two instances of the exact same physical activity
<br />
which perform different computations.  But the scenario is
<br />
necessarily contrived, in such a way that a particular 
<br />
computation is encoded into the device.  In other words, the
<br />
physical activity is given a contrived meaning.
<br />
<br />So physical structures can implement computations.  This is
<br />
the physical supervenience hypothesis.  And it is quite
<br />
compatible with the computationalist hypothesis of 
<br />
consciousness.  Note that in the above argument, consciousness
<br />
never entered into the discussion.  Unless you can prove to
<br />
me that physical structures cannot reliably implement 
<br />
computations, I assert that they can implement conscious
<br />
entities.
<br />
<br />Now either refute this, or admit that you have made an error.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This seems rather magical to me. If only because, for a computationalist,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the only role of the inert block (during the particular execution) is to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explain why the machine WOULD have give a correct answer in case the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inputs WOULD have been different.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This mean that you don't associate consciousness with a particular
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical computation but with the entire set of possible computations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But that is exactly what I do ..., and what I mean by the abandon
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of physical supervenience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A singular brain's activity becomes an invention of the mind.
