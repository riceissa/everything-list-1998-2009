Dear Tianran,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QM is far more than a &quot;set of equations&quot;! It is a very predictive and 
<br />
falsifiable collection of principles and relationships. The most cunning of 
<br />
experimenters have been trying for almost 90 years to find a falsification, 
<br />
none yet has even been hinted. When a quantum gravity theory is found that 
<br />
unifies QM and General Relativity theory's realms of prediction, it will not 
<br />
contradict them, but will extend them. We see the same situation when we 
<br />
compare QM and GR to Newton's theory.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is one thing for a quantum computation to solve NP-Complete problems 
<br />
in polynomial time. It is something else to compute simulations of behaviors 
<br />
&quot;faster&quot; than Nature itself can complete them. The non-commutativity issue 
<br />
is a very important aspect of any theory that hopes to explain phenomena, it 
<br />
follows from the small but non-zero value of the Plank constant. From what I 
<br />
have studied of superstring theory (or its M-theory incarnation), the 
<br />
non-commutativity of canonically conjugate observables (such as position and 
<br />
momentum) is something that we should not expect to vanish.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Not a &quot;time dependency&quot;, it is a &quot;concurrency&quot; problem. It 
<br />
involves the order of operations that naturally can not be avoided when more 
<br />
that one event is considered. In order to do simulations of consciousnesses 
<br />
that involve shuffling the ordering, it is necessary for each conscious 
<br />
event is computationally simulable independent of all others and this would 
<br />
include any possible experience including experiences of events that involes 
<br />
order sensitive measurements. If we could assume that &quot;all possible 
<br />
experienciable events&quot; exists, like a pile of shapshots, then we claim have 
<br />
to prove that for any given first person experience of living in a world 
<br />
with time there exists some sequence of snapshots that exist a priori in the 
<br />
pile, but this is not enough, we must be able to show the necessity of first 
<br />
person experiences.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is it that I have a first experson experience of a world in which 
<br />
there is an asymmetry between past and future if the entire content of this 
<br />
experience exists priori to me? Why bother with an illusion of time?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BTW, the N-boby problem is completely intractible in a world that takes 
<br />
Plank's constant to be zero because the number of solutions becomes infinite 
<br />
if the energy differences can be infinitely small. The problem is 
<br />
non-integrable.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QM solves this problem partially by only allowing energy (involved in 
<br />
emmision and absorbtion events, which encompasses any and all interactions) 
<br />
to be integer multiples of the plank constant. All of this can be learned 
<br />
from a good QM for laymen book such as Roger Penrose's &quot;The Emperor's New 
<br />
Mind&quot; or John Gribbin's &quot;Schroedinger's Kittens&quot;.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Dear Hal and Tianran,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;    Assuming there is some aspect of consciousness that requires QM ( I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; side with Penrose on this) these out of order computations are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; impossible. This boils down to the fact that for systems that have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; time-like relationship with each other will have observable that are not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; commutative.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;    We could ignore Penrose and make the same argument by pointing out 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that is the simulated consciousnesses, for example those of Alice and Bob 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of the EPR experiment, are to involve any hint of QM phenomena then the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; non-commutativity will rear its ugly head and nip off the idea in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; bud. I am surprised that Greg Egan didn't notice this...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Stephen
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Logically speaking, QM (not its interpretations) is simply a branch of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; applied mathematics (use the definition given by &lt;&lt;Foundation of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mathematics&gt;&gt;) that happen to agree with some observed facts. In another 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; word, QM is a set of equations we used to describe phenomenon. If there is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time dependency, then it is in the structure of those equations, not in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the phenomenon. It is totally possible that later on, some totally 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different theories will be proposed that can describe the same set of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observations and yet do not suffer from such time dependency problem. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Isn't it?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let us suppose, later on, the super-string theory become favored by most 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; serious physicsts, and let us pretend that there are some equation in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; super-string theory that can support consciousness, and can be solved in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constant steps with some turing machine. However unlikely, such possible 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shall not be ruled out.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Also from another direction, isn't it possible that later some type of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computation model (say quantum computer) can actually solve hard problems 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (say multi-body gravity problem) in constant time, then it can also 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simulate consciousness-supporting world out of order.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I only had chance read a few sections novel, so sorry if I misunderstood 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some important details here. But the novel did not explicitly say which 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory of physics the simulator was using, right?
</em><br />
