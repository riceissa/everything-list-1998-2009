<br />
Bruno,
<br />
<br />In this step, one of me experiences (or actually does not experience)  
<br />
the delay prior to reconstitution. In Step 2, it was proven to me that  
<br />
I cannot know that any extra time (other than the 4 minutes necessary  
<br />
transmission interval) has elapsed between my annihilation and  
<br />
reconstitution on Mars. The same thing will now happen to one of &quot;me&quot;  
<br />
in the duplication-plus-delay in Step 4. Essentially, Step 4 is  
<br />
identical to Step 2 with duplication as the only added feature. We  
<br />
cannot attribute a measure to my 1-pov in either step because the  
<br />
outcome is truly random.
<br />
<br />Here I would merely like to ask, random to whom? Doesn't random mean  
<br />
that no conscious mind (mine or yours) can see the determinism behind  
<br />
it? We are tempted to say &quot;probability 1/2&quot; but that is only a comp- 
<br />
style &quot;bet&quot;. You explained on this in Step 2:
<br />
<br /><br />&quot;We see that the MEC hypothesis, generally considered as imposing a  
<br />
strong determinacy in nature, introduces on the contrary a form of  
<br />
strong indeterminacy. Even a God, or whatever possible Omniscient  
<br />
Being, cannot predict to you, before a duplication (of you)  
<br />
experiment, where you will feel to be after. If he told you &quot;you will  
<br />
feel to be the one in room A&quot;, the &quot;Kim&quot; in room A will say that such  
<br />
God was right, but the one in room B will know or believe that that  
<br />
God was wrong, and the point of MEC is that we have no reason to  
<br />
listen more to one Kim than to the other Kim. In particular the Kim of  
<br />
room A will not convince the Kim of room B, that &quot;God&quot; was right. No  
<br />
Kim will ever be able to convince its counterpart about any possible  
<br />
method of prediction for the particular future.
<br />
This does not mean that nothing can be predicted.&quot;
<br />
<br /><br />I want to grok this more. At this stage I can only believe you. I have  
<br />
always felt (with Einstein) that reality is fundamentally  
<br />
deterministic, even if we have to point to stochastic features along  
<br />
the way. I know you will be able to debunk this easily and to my (and  
<br />
Einstein's) satisfaction. Maybe dwell a little on this and then move  
<br />
on to Step 5 where you manage to email me to me. This is truly scary  
<br />
because here I meet &quot;myself&quot;. I recall with horror what Angier did  
<br />
about his double in &quot;The Prestige&quot;...
<br />
<br />Actually, I believe I have already met my double. Once, a man stopped  
<br />
outside my house and stroked my cat, which was on the verandah. I  
<br />
greeted him and he told me that he had a cat that looked exactly like  
<br />
my cat and that it was his dearest and most cherished friend (I feel  
<br />
much the same way about my cat). I then asked him what name he had  
<br />
given his cat. He told me &quot;Cindy Bingy&quot;. I think my mouth must have  
<br />
fallen open in shock because that is the name of my cat too. From  
<br />
memory, the man looked rather like me as well. He then walked off  
<br />
while I stood there wondering about the improbability of all this (I  
<br />
cannot remember whether cannabis was in my system at the time)
<br />
<br />regards,
<br />
<br />K
