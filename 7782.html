Hi Russell,
<br />
<br />Le 30-juil.-05, à 08:13, Russell Standish wrote out-of-line (but gives 
<br />
me the permission to answer online, which I will do to encourage others 
<br />
to invest a little more in the technics).
<br />
But those who have never heard about G and G* can skip it ... for the 
<br />
moment :)
<br />
(One day those posts will seem incredibly easy, I'm sure).

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Dear Russell,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; I note that S4Grz=S4Grz* - is this not because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Cp -&gt; p, so there is no difference between the starified and non
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; starified logics?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It is related to that but this is not enough. S4Grz = S4Grz* has been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; proved by Goldblatt (and perhaps Boolos). The proof is in Boolos 1979
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; or 1993. It is not entirely obvious.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; If so, then Op -&gt; p, and so X=X* by the same argument.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Op -&gt; p is true (with Op = Bp &amp; ~B~p &amp; p). But this does not entail X 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; X*.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'll take your word for it for the moment - I'm impatient, you see!
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I recall Op can be seen as an abbreviation of Bp &amp; ~B~p &amp; p. Where Bp 
<br />
can be interpreted by BEW('p') and BEW is the machine probability 
<br />
predicate of Godel 1931, and 'p' is a representation of 
<br />
machine-language proposition p (it is the so-called godel number in the 
<br />
case the machine &quot;talk arithmetic&quot;).
<br />
Note that I limit my machine interview on sound machine, for which Bp 
<br />
-&gt; p is true for any p, and thus ~p -&gt; ~Bp is true also for any p, and 
<br />
thus p -&gt; ~B~p is true, and thus, it is true that
<br />
<br />Bp &lt;-&gt; Op
<br />
<br />BUT, the machine cannot prove it, making B and O, different for the 
<br />
machine!!!!! G* proves Bp &lt;-&gt; Op (for any p) but G does not prove it.
<br />
<br />Now X is the logic of what the machine can prove about that Op. And X* 
<br />
is the logic of what is true about that Op. Put in another way X 
<br />
corresponds to what G can prove about O, and X* is logic of what G* 
<br />
proves about O.
<br />
<br />X is different from X* because G* proves ~B~t, but G does not prove it. 
<br />
So X does not even prove Ot although G* proves it. (G does not prove Bt 
<br />
&amp; ~B~t &amp; t, G* proves it). We see that the adjunct of &quot;~B~p&quot; is quite 
<br />
non trivial. It makes Ot false. Now in any classical Kripke 
<br />
&quot;Multiverse&quot; Bt is true in all words, and the failure of X to prove Ot 
<br />
show that the X logic, the logic of O, cannot have a Kripke semantics!. 
<br />
(later I will explain why this is a quite good news for the serach of 
<br />
the measure on the &quot;OMs&quot;).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; My next question concerns your statement that S4Grz_1* is a quantum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; logic. In your thesis, you seem to indicate that p-&gt;[]&lt;&gt;p is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; necessary theorem of QLs, and that this is proved for []=P applied to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; V* and presumably []=O (although my modal logic ability is still
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; rather undeveloped), however why should it be true for []=C? This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; seems implausible.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; As I said in a footnote of SANE04 I have been wrong on that point in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; theses, where I say that S4Grz_1 collapse into propositional calculus.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I was wrong but it is a little long to explain. I could do it online
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; someday (although it could look cumbersome without drawings!!)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maybe written up as a paper?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />A good journal has ordered me a paper and I will even be paid! The 
<br />
paper is finished and accepted  but I am not sure I can put it right 
<br />
now on my web page. It is better, imo, than my preceding papers, but it 
<br />
is not yet the &quot;official technical presentation of my PhD&quot;, which will 
<br />
still take some time. One of the reason is that I would like to get 
<br />
more results. I would like to optimize somehow my theorems provers
<br />
(cf  <a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/G.html">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/G.html</a> ).
<br />
Thanks anyway for encouraging me. And as you have seen I have still 
<br />
some &quot;wording&quot; problems, and it is hard to satisfy simultaneously the 
<br />
susceptibilities of the cognitive scientists, the physicists and the 
<br />
computer scientists. In the &quot;scientific world&quot; diplomats are still 
<br />
often &quot;killed!&quot;
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; What is the exact derivation of p-&gt;[]&lt;&gt;p - I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; couldn't follow it from your thesis.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I have prove it by using the Kripke Semantics that Visser found for V
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (and V*).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I did it using a somewhat shorter version of the proof you gave in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your thesis (which I never understood BTW). It was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; p
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; =&gt; []p (Using p-&gt;[]p, which holds for V, V*)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; =&gt; []p v &lt;&gt; p = -P-p  (T v x = T)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; =&gt; []-P-p   (Using p-&gt;[]p)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now you also say that the rule of possibilisation holds for G* (and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; V*) (I don't understand this point, but am taking your word for it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; here)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; -P-p =&gt; &lt;&gt;-P-p
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; =&gt; []-P-p ^ &lt;&gt;-P-p = P-P-p (or p-&gt;[]&lt;&gt;p, where []=P)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I also did a slight variant of this proof for []=O, and it seemed to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; work, but couldn't replicate it for []=C
</em><br />
<br /><br />That is not too bad :).  One problem though is that you are using the 
<br />
&quot;p-&gt;Bp&quot; with p substituted by ~P~p  (I recall from SANE04 that Pp is 
<br />
for Bp &amp; ~B~p). But p can be substituted only by atomic formula or 
<br />
boxed formula; if not you would be able to get ~B~t -&gt; B~B~t, 
<br />
contradicting Godel's incompleteness Theorem. The next lines are 
<br />
correct. To understand why G* (and V*) are closed for the 
<br />
possibilisation (i.e. that if G* proves A then G* proves ~B~A, or G* 
<br />
proves DA where D is ~B~, the diamond), just remember that by Solovay's 
<br />
theorem, if G* proves A then A is true for the machine, and thus 
<br />
obviously consistent. Careful: the machine itself cannot do that 
<br />
reasoning, but can bet on it, but only bet on it!
<br />
A proof which is much clearer than in my thesis has been given in this 
<br />
list here, where &quot;p-&gt;BDp&quot; is called LASE, for Little Abstract 
<br />
Schroedinger Equation:

<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm also still trying to get my head around the difference between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Z_1* and Z_1. The former is your quantum logic, but the latter has 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; no cul-de-sac conjecture proven.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Ot = Bt &amp; Dt.     (with D ==  ~B~) D is the diamond.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; V* proves it but not V (because G* prove Dt and G does not).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; So Z_1* proves Ot, but Z_1 does not. OK?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Any chance of an interpretation?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; In which sense? (I must go now)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm looking for an English interpretation, like G = logic of belief (or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; provability), and G* = logic of truth, G*\G = unbelievable truth
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Note that the modal operator B represent mathematical belief, but that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everyday (or perhaps scientific) belief seems to be more like P. What
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do your think?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Roughly speaking:
<br />
<br />Bp is the formal scientist  (it &quot;means&quot; provable p in a checkable way, 
<br />
it could mean &quot;paper accepted :)
<br />
<br />Bp &amp; p is the knower, or the correct justifier. I use Theaetetus' idea 
<br />
that 'knowing p' is &quot;p is correct (true) and justified&quot;. It is the most 
<br />
basic (and solipsistic)  definition of the first person notion. New 
<br />
name: THEAE_1 (from my last paper). It gives Cp.
<br />
<br />Bp &amp; ~B~p is the gambler. Cf my explanation to Lee Corbin: p is true in 
<br />
all accessible world, and we escape the cul-de-sac problem by 
<br />
explicitly adding the existence of an accessible world by the adjunct 
<br />
of ~B~p to Bp. Careful the price is formally big given that we loose 
<br />
the Kripke semantics, and this will entail the probable disparition of 
<br />
universes capable of glueing together all the machines' dreams. It 
<br />
corresponds to the first person plural (where populations of machine 
<br />
are coherently duplicated). New name: THEAE_2. It is written Pp (In 
<br />
SANE04).
<br />
<br />Bp &amp; ~B~p &amp; p is the correct gambler, or the &quot;feeler&quot;.  It makes 
<br />
possible to talk with the machine about phantom limbs! New name: 
<br />
THEAE_3.  (Op in SANE04).
<br />
<br />Probably: everyday beliefs are some consistent or inconsistent mixture 
<br />
of those &quot;primitive&quot; machine's beliefs.
<br />
<br />We are not a long way from the COMP-PHYSICS; which is given by the 
<br />
composition of three moves: SOL, which exploits the G-G* gap, THEAE_i 
<br />
(which exploits the Theaetetus's ideas), and COMP, which is just given 
<br />
by the adjunct of p-&gt;Bp to G, p atomic!, and which corresponds to the 
<br />
translation of comp in the language of the machine:
<br />
<br />COMP-PHYS_i = SOL(THEAE_i(COMP(G)))
<br />
<br />The UDA reasoning shows (in a non speculative way, I insist) that if 
<br />
comp is true then physics is derivable from computer science. The 
<br />
translation of the UDA in computer language gives the actual derivation 
<br />
of physics from computer science: it is what I called COMP-PHYS, and so 
<br />
to test comp it is enough to compare COMP-PHYS to Physics. As you see, 
<br />
there are some room for maneuvers due to the fact that we have 3 main 
<br />
Theaetetus moves). Amazingly enough the three moves gives a sort of 
<br />
quantum logics. But this I will explain later after some introduction 
<br />
to non classical logic in general and quantum logics in particular. The 
<br />
combinators can help here, and I have used it in my last paper.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps a little bit.
<br />
<br />Kind Regards,
<br />
<br />Bruno
