<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Bruno: And this is perhaps the very root of a possible disagreement. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; not compare &quot;mathematical&quot; with &quot;tautological&quot;, nor with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;conventional&quot;. This should be clear after the Godelian fall of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; logicism. We know today that even just the &quot;arithmetical&quot; realm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (studied by number theorist) is not compressible into a unique theory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Actually a complete theory of the number realm has to be infinite, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; even of a type of infinity not nameable in any effective way. Math is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; as full of surprises (and even of contingent facts when seen from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; inside) than physics is. As David explained in FOR, mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; reality quick back. Still I appreciate your quote in 'physical&quot;, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the whole ambiguity (relatively to the comp emulation of the mind) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; rest in what you mean exactly by those &quot;quote&quot; and what you mean by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; difference you are making between &quot;efficacious&quot; and &quot;descriptive&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; David: Bruno, your observations go to the heart of the matter!  I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could be clearer on some of these points - let me try, but forgive me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if I don't adopt precisely the order of your comments.  First, you are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correct that my starting point is in assigning primacy to what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (conventionally or otherwise) we think of as 'physical'.  I don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intend this in any 'mystical' sense, but rather as a hopefully robust
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; epistemological point of departure.
</em><br />
<br /><br />It seem a little bit ontological for me.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  So, I am claiming that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structures and relationships elucidated within this domain
</em><br />
<br /><br />But &quot;this&quot; domain is full of obscurity. Now, with the QM and the MW, 
<br />
some light appears at the horizon, but even just among physicist 
<br />
sincerely interested in conceptual issues, it is hard to say there is a 
<br />
consensus.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; are what is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; efficacious in producing both 'objective' and 'subjective' phenomena -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a distinction, I suggest, that is dependent on 'point of view'.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Well, I do agree with you, here. But I still find your notion of 
<br />
&quot;efficacious&quot; unclear. Linking it with a putative 'physical' thing 
<br />
makes things harder imo.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Consequently, I also claim that the type of emulation, and associated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; isomorphism, necessary to be causally efficacious either 'physically'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or 'experientially' must be 'physically constructable'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A Turing emulation, despite the fact that it runs on a 'physical' TM,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does not 'physically construct' the subject of the emulation in this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense, because the necessary isomorphisms exist merely descriptively.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I meant that the mathematical form of this description is in this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense 'tautological'.  However, I wouldn't press this point.  The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; crucial issue is that the description is quite different in form from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the thing described.  And the description has, if any, a different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; causal efficacy than the thing described.
</em><br />
<br /><br />In the case of a simulation, I would agree with (quasi by definition), 
<br />
but the fact is that computer science provides that non trivial notion 
<br />
of emulation.
<br />
To be sure I don't really believe in any basic notion of causality 
<br />
other than IF p divides aq, and if p and q are primes then p divides a. 
<br />
Things like that.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course, we as observers perceive the isomorphisms as metaphors, for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; example when we read the listing of the relevant programs, but what is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'constructed' on the physical substrate of the run-time system is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; syntactical narration of the program, not a physical isomorph of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subject of the narrative.  This is not dissimilar to what occurs when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a story is 'instantiated' in a storybook.  The 'emulation' at the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; level of the pages of the book is decriptive and syntactical.  When we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; read the narrative, we physically/ experientially construct an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; isomorph of the subject, and so 'bring it to life'.  Unless a TM/
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; digital computer possesses the same physically constructive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; capability, it cannot achieve this.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I don't pretend you are wrong. But I think that if you are right here, 
<br />
you will need to assume actual uncomputable operations to actualize the 
<br />
mind in your physical constructions (not to mention making that mind 
<br />
unique).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Of course you may be true, but from what you say here, it could even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; more speculative in the sense that with such a proviso, after you are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; digitally duplicated, you could tell me that the copy is a zombie. You
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; will agree the doppelganger looks like you and behave like you because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the &quot;descriptive (intensive)&quot; sense has been preserved, but it would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; a zombie because the copying was not &quot;efficacious&quot; in the &quot;(extended)&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; sense. This means, assuming comp, that your doppelganger will have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; hard time to be respected as person ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This depends on whether a 'description' of a person will turn out to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be  sufficient to completely emulate the behaviour of a 'real' person,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; let alone 'be' one.  This IMO is still an open empirical question.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree, but probably for a different reason. I think that IF we are 
<br />
capable of surviving a copying process (including annihilation of the 
<br />
&quot;original&quot;) from a reconstitution made itself at some correct level of 
<br />
substitution, then if we observe ourself or our neighborhood close 
<br />
enough (meaning at a level equal or least than our substitution level) 
<br />
then we must see the trace of the many computations. In *that* sense, 
<br />
modern or pure QM (= QM without collapse) already confirms that comp 
<br />
prediction. Would we have strong argument that physical reality is 
<br />
unique, then we would have empirical support for a primitive actually 
<br />
infinite and non-Turing-emulable matter playing a role in our 
<br />
brain/mind processes.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is felt by some to entail answering the riddle of whether
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'consciousness' is causally efficacious or in some sense a disposable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'epiphenomenon'.  For what it's worth, my own view is that this is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; category error and that the necessary move is to see that reality and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unmediated self-intimacy are equivalent.
</em><br />
<br /><br />That's not so clear...
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The alternative is an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; infinite regress of 'observers'.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Most infinite regress have fixed point in computer science.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Consequently, a 'zombie', in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense of a structural isomorph that somehow lacks an experiential
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; field, is a bad case of the grin without the cat.  If he exists
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physically, then IMO he is by this token self intimate.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Should I understand you would accept that a robot or a 100% cyborg 
<br />
would be conscious with a physical body, but not with a virtual body 
<br />
implemented with a &quot;real concrete&quot; (which makes sense with your 
<br />
&quot;primitive matter&quot; hypothesis) computer?
<br />
Or just (what is more common) that consciousness will be there in each 
<br />
case where the simulation are eventually grounded in some physical 
<br />
universe (as opposed to a purely arithmetical reality)?
<br />
In both case that would violate the consequences of the comp hyp. The 
<br />
first case is easy to show, the second case is less easy to show ... (I 
<br />
mean I don't pretend all this is obvious).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; content of his self intimacy - his experiential field - depends
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; critically on his 'physical construction', not merely his ability to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; embody a Turing emulation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Notwithstanding this, it may turn out that Turing's vision of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behaviourally indistinguishable intelligent being is possible, without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the accompanying experiential constructs (or at least, with different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ones).  Or it may not.  In the case that it is, the question then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arises: are either we, or our emulated doppelgangers, intelligent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; enough to deduce from an examination of our internal representational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; specifications which type of entity we are?
</em><br />
<br /><br />It is bit like asking a doctor for knowing if you are in pain, it seems 
<br />
to me.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If so, then our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doppelganger would realise that although he could get 'd-wet' from a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'd-typhoon', he wouldn't need to go to the expense of buying a real
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; umbrella.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Somehow your argument is similar (corect me if not) to the argument of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; those that a computer cannot really simulate a typhoon because you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; never be wet due to a computer simulation of a typhoon. But the comp
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; point is that you need to feel wet by a virtual typhoon only when you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; are emulated yourself in front of the typhoon. Again, this can be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; shown
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; not making you feeling to be wet, only if you have not been simulated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; at the right level or if that level does not exist, and it is up to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to explain us what specifically there is not turing emulable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Have I done this?  As I suggest above, I agree that a Turing emulation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could embody a narrative at any arbitrary level of detail, but I deny
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that it is constituted so as to construct the content or subjects of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that narrative.  So the narrative may contain the element that 'I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; believe there is a typhoon and that I am wet', but this does not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entail that either the typhoon or my structural/ experiential isomorph
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is thereby constructed and in fact feels, and gets, wet.  The 'right
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; level' - and this is the critical difference I am claiming in our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; views - is a level unattainable to comp.
</em><br />
<br /><br />All right. That could exist if matter matters indeed. I think only the 
<br />
relations are needed.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is a level attainable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only by construction.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I think you will have an hard time defining &quot;construction&quot; from your 
<br />
&quot;matter&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It may be that there is a belief that comp
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simply IS construction because of an underlying assumption that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'physical' is a computation and that its structural relationships are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fundamentally computationally/ syntactically established.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Not necessarily. If comp implied physics, comp will implied the 
<br />
existence of internal notion of construction. I do believe it is 
<br />
actually already the case.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But even in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this case there would still exist IMO a real distinction between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'comp' (within comp reality) and 'construction' (within comp reality).
</em><br />
<br /><br />Ah! But OK then.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Sure. That is why I propose in some thought experiments to consider a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;generalized brain&quot;, so as to put any part of the (multi)verse
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; necessary for the emulation of your consciousness. The question 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; remains
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; for this generalized brain: is it Turing emulable. If yes, you will be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; driven the &quot;immaterialist&quot; consequence of comp, imo. If not, I will 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ask
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; what is the precise non-comp processes you think about, and how will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; you ascribe consciousness to it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As I have remarked above, I prefer to think in terms of reality as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entailing unmediated self-intimacy.  The question of 'consciousness'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then collapses into how reality self-structures its physical/
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiential fields.
</em><br />
<br /><br />All right.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; A TM engaged in Turing emulation is of course a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical/ experiential structure by this token, but the crucial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; question is whether what it constructs has equivalent causal efficacy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the subject of emulation.  I say that it cannot have this unless it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constructs equivalent physical/ experiential isomorphisms, which in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; virtue of its syntactical mode of operation, it does not.  So the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'non-comp' processes I have in mind are physically constructive ones,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not merely descriptive or narrative.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is analogous to pointing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; out the difference betweeen describing in complete detail the building
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of a house, and actually building one.
</em><br />
<br /><br />... where I think this is relative.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But if the digital transformation does preserve the relevant morphism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; it will either mean that the level of digital substitution has been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; chosen incorrectly, or that such a level does not exist, in which case
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; computationalism is just false.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, it may be that computationalism in the context we are discussing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is just false. IMO, the rock upon which it may founder is the issue of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; construction versus emulation.  Computational emulation is successful
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if the behaviour of the emulated system (transformation of inputs to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; outputs) is invariant in the face of differences in the internal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; processing that mediates them.  But if you hold, as I do, that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; content of reality is determined by the structure of the physical/
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiential field, then the form of the processing is critical to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience, even if the input/ output relationships are preserved.  My
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; claim is that computational isomorphisms are thus merely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; transactional, but that the type of isomorphism required for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiential equivalence is structural.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Mmmmmmhhh.... I think you have a good intuition but that you are dead 
<br />
wrong when you want attach physical and experiential in one field. I 
<br />
can understand the willingness to proceed in that way, but you will 
<br />
have to introduce actual infinities. With comp you do inherit of actual 
<br />
infinities (indeed), and actual indeterminacies, but only from some 
<br />
first person point of views. And then you don't need to introduce them. 
<br />
&quot;First person&quot; is what Everett called the &quot;subjective&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ... only if the &quot;generalized brain&quot; is not turing emulable. With both
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; comp and the quantum, only the &quot;geographical&quot; or the contingent is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; computable * from a first person point of view*, like observing a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; electron spin up in the z direction after having prepared it in the up
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; + down state, or finding oneself in Washington after a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Washington/Moscow self-duplication.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Again, I think you are relying on a transactional level of equivalence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; here if you claim that the Turing emulation of 'reality/ experience'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; effectively constructs it. I disagree with this view.  I think that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what you are calling here a 'first person point of view' is rather
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more accurately 'a description of a first person point of view'.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Ah, now I must &quot;cc&quot; this to the everythinglist where, if you are 
<br />
interested, you can follow sequences of attempts to explain this in 
<br />
more details.
<br />
But the beauty here is that computer science can explain why, although 
<br />
the first person admits some description, such a description is 
<br />
inaccessible from the person itself and from others person of similar 
<br />
complexity (alas some technics are needed to believe this weird fact).
<br />
<br />Comp makes any first person as unnameable as the big one itself ...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; My
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; claim is that an embedded first person perspective is possibly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; re-constructable, but not computable.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Believe it or not, but this is a consequence of comp. It follows from 
<br />
some incompleteness-like results that accepting comp entails accepting 
<br />
many non computable things. Incompleteness itself is a consequence of 
<br />
the law of Post (Church thesis).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  This may well be a semantic/
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; syntactic distinction, in the case that 'semantic' implies the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; construction of the full blown structural network of physical/
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiential relationships, and syntactic merely a specification of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the same.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I can accept this.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course, I agree in either case that the contingent or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indexical are neither computable nor constructable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; You should elaborate on this, but again your argument will need an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; actual non-computable invariant (as opposed to uncomputable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; contingencies) to make it &quot;critically different&quot; with respect to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; turing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; emulability.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My non-computable invariant is that of structural isomorphism within
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the physical/ experiential field.  This is non-computable because it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is not preserved within a purely transactional emulation.  It is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; however re-constructable (just as we can re-construct a house from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; plans, even though we can't live in the plans).
</em><br />
<br /><br />I think you miss the incompleteness phenomena, which somehow makes us 
<br />
more humble (especially with comp) with respect to what is possible or 
<br />
not with machines. I agree with a lot of what you say at some perhaps 
<br />
deep level, but I don't see any reason why the comp hyp could 
<br />
jeopardize your intuition. On the contrary, it could make it more 
<br />
precise.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the whole ambiguity (relatively to the comp emulation of the mind) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; rest in what you mean exactly by those &quot;quote&quot; and what you mean by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; difference you are making between &quot;efficacious&quot; and &quot;descriptive&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is this any clearer now? (as mud, probably!) It rests on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fundamental distinction I have attempted to draw between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'construction' and 'emulation'.
</em><br />
<br /><br />This is akin to the important distinction between first and third 
<br />
person discourse (and the content of these discourses). If that is the 
<br />
case I would say comp is on your side.  The price seems to be: many 
<br />
many many many differentiating realities in all directions. Do you 
<br />
think *this* should be wrong?
