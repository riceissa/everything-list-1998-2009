<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; it seems that we have skipped
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; past the question that I am trying to pose: Where does distinguishability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and individuation follow from the mere existence of Platonic Forms, if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;process&quot; is merely a &quot;relation&quot; between Forms (as Bruno et al claim)?!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     In my previous post I tried to point out that *existence* is not a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; first-order (or n-th order) predicate and thus does nothing to distinguish
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one Form, Number, Algorithm, or what-have-you from another.

I don't know about that; I do know that 34 and 3 are not the
<br />
same thing, nor are they very similar. I wonder if you are
<br />
joining those who might say that I cannot speak of 34 or 3
<br />
without mentioning the process by which I know of them. (In
<br />
my opinion, that puts the cart before the horse. A lot more
<br />
people in history were more certain, and rightly so, that there
<br />
was a moon than that they had brains.)
<br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think of the meaning of what you just wrote if you where to remove all 
<br />
references that implied in one form or another some kind of &quot;act of 
<br />
distinguishing&quot;.... I am merely trying to drill down to the source of our 
<br />
notion of the act of &quot;distinguishing&quot; and to see what remains when we strip 
<br />
away all forms of notions of &quot;observers&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The property of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; individuation requires some manner of distinguishability of one &quot;thing&quot;,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;process&quot;, etc. from another. Mere existence is insufficient.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     We are tacitly assuming an observer or something that amounts to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; same thing any time we assume some 3rd person PoView and such is required
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for any coherent notion of distinguishability to obtain and thus something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;to whom&quot; existence means/affects.

Well, I just disagree. Before there were people or even atoms, quarks
<br />
and leptons were not the same thing. They didn't have to be perceived
<br />
by anyone in order for that to be true. I know that you disagree with
<br />
this: they didn't even have to affect anything in order for that to
<br />
be true. If there had been just one quark and one electron in the whole
<br />
universe, and if they were separately by almost infinitely many light-
<br />
years, then there would still have been one quark and one electron.

<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interesting claim, especially if we where to buy into the thinking of 
<br />
many prominent physicist today: If we where to go back in time far enough we 
<br />
would find that all the particles would indeed be identical to each other! 
<br />
But I digress. ;-)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not making any claims about whether or not some statement is true, 
<br />
I am merely trying to make sense of the metaphysical positions that we are 
<br />
taking here on the Everything List. I wish to be sure that we are not 
<br />
allowing assumptions to be made about metaphysical primitives that may lead 
<br />
us into deep errors. For example, my appearent &quot;attack&quot; on Platonism is an 
<br />
attempt to understand its intricate details and implications, especially 
<br />
when they are taken the the wonderful extreems that Bruno is toiling to 
<br />
explain to us. ;-)

Unfortunately, I probably can be of no more assistence to you on this
<br />
question.
