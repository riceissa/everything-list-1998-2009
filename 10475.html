Le 16-août-06, à 18:36, Tom Caylor a écrit :
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I noticed that you slipped in &quot;infinity&quot; (&quot;infinite collection of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computations&quot;) into your roadmap (even the short roadmap).  In the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;technical&quot; posts, if I remember right, you said that at some point we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; were leaving the constructionist realm.  But are you really talking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about infinity?  It is easy to slip into invoking infinity and get away
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with it without being noticed.  I think this is because we are used to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it in mathematics.  In fact, I want to point out that David Nyman
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; skipped over it, perhaps a case in point.  But then you brought it up
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; again here with aleph_zero, and 2^aleph_zero, so it seems you are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; really serious about it.  I thought that infinities and singularities
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are things that physicists have dedicated their lives to trying to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; purge from the system (so far unsuccessfully ?) in order to approach a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;true&quot; theory of everything.  Here you are invoking it from the start.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No wonder you talk about faith.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Even in the realm of pure mathematics, there are those of course who
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think it is invalid to invoke infinity.  Not to try to complicate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things, but I'm trying to make a point about how serious a matter this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is.  Have you heard about the feasible numbers of V. Sazanov, as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discussed on the FOM (Foundations Of Mathematics) list?  Why couldn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we just have 2^N instantiations or computations, where N is a very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; large number?
</em><br />
<br /><br />I would say infinity is all what mathematics is about. Take any theorem 
<br />
in arithmetic, like any number is the sum of four square, or there is 
<br />
no pair of number having a ratio which squared gives two, etc.
<br />
And I am not talking about analysis, or the use of complex analysis in 
<br />
number theory (cf zeta), or category theory (which relies on very high 
<br />
infinite) without posing any conceptual problem (no more than 
<br />
elsewhere).
<br />
Even constructivist and intuitionist accept infinity, although 
<br />
sometimes under the form of potential infinity (which is all we need 
<br />
for G and G* and all third person point of view, but is not enough for 
<br />
having mathematical semantics, and then the first person (by UDA) is 
<br />
really linked to an actual infinity. But those, since axiomatic set 
<br />
theory does no more pose any interpretative problem.
<br />
True, I heard about some ultrafinitist would would like to avoid 
<br />
infinity, but until now, they do have conceptual problem (like the fact 
<br />
that they need notion of fuzzy high numbers to avoid the fact that for 
<br />
each number has a successor. Imo, this is just philosophical play 
<br />
having no relation with both theory and practice in math.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The UDA is not precise enough for me, maybe because I'm a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematician?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm waiting for the interview, via the roadmap.
</em><br />
<br />UDA is a problem for mathematicians, sometimes indeed. The reason is 
<br />
that although it is a &quot;proof&quot;, it is not a mathematical proof. And some 
<br />
mathematician have a problem with non mathematical proof. But UDA *is* 
<br />
the complete proof. I have already explain on this list (years ago) 
<br />
that although informal, it is rigorous. The first version of it were 
<br />
much more complex and technical, and it has taken years to suppress 
<br />
eventually any non strictly needed difficulties.
<br />
I have even coined an expression &quot;the 1004 fallacy&quot; (alluding to Lewis 
<br />
Carroll), to describe argument using unnecessary rigor or abnormally 
<br />
precise term with respect to the reasoning.
<br />
So please, don't hesitate to tell me what is not precise enough for 
<br />
you. Just recall UDA is not part of math. It is part of cognitive 
<br />
science and physics, and computer science.
<br />
The lobian interview does not add one atom of rigor to the UDA, albeit 
<br />
it adds constructive features so as to make possible an explicit 
<br />
derivation of the &quot;physical laws&quot; (and more because it attached the 
<br />
quanta to extended qualia). Now I extract only the logic of the certain 
<br />
propositions and I show that it has already it has a strong quantum 
<br />
perfume, enough to get an &quot;arithmetical quantum logic, and then the 
<br />
rest gives mathematical conjectures. (One has been recently solved by a 
<br />
young mathematician).
