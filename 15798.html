Dear Bruno,
<br />
<br />I decided so many times not to reflect to the esoteric sci-fi assumptions
<br />
(thought experiments?) on this list - about situations beyond common sense,
<br />
their use as templates for consequences.
<br />
Now, however, I can't control my 'mouse' - in random and probabilistics.
<br />
*
<br />
Bruno quotes in  &quot; -- &quot;  lines, like the starting proposition:
<br />
&quot;It is because an event can be random or probabilistic...&quot;
<br />
*
<br />
&quot;...the perfect throwing of the perfect coin gives an random
<br />
experience with a probability &quot;measure&quot;
<br />
HEAD = 1/2, TAIL = 1/2....&quot;
<br />
<br />Wrong.
<br />
A &quot;PERFECT coin PERFECTLY thrown gives ALWAYS either HEAD or TAIL. It is
<br />
those imperfections unobserved(?) that makes the difference in the outcome
<br />
to 50-50. The only difference that really counts is the starting condition -
<br />
whether it is thrown head or tail UP.
<br />
<br />To your subsequent 3 questions the answer is YES - depending how you
<br />
identify 'probability'. (I don't).
<br />
To your evaluating paragraph &quot;Fair Enough&quot;: fair enough.
<br />
That makes my point.
<br />
*
<br />
The &quot;experiments with sleeping in the room with whiskey&quot; are above my head
<br />
(=my common sense). The Einstein conclusions show that even a big genius
<br />
like him cannot cope with epistemic enrichment coming AFTER his time.
<br />
(Which extends into the contemporary novelties as well?!)
<br />
<br />&quot;...Einstein missed comp by its &quot;conventionalist math&quot; blindness perhaps,
<br />
togethet with the fact that he was not interested in computer science. ...&quot;
<br />
<br />I admire Kim's scientific tenacity to absorb your 'explanations' to the
<br />
level of asking resonable questions.
<br />
I could not spend so much time to submerge myself - and - maybe I am further
<br />
away from your domain to do so.
<br />
<br />Thanks for the (*) added post scriptum, I missed it so far.
<br />
<br />One word of how I feel about probability:
<br />
In the conventional (scientific/math) view we consider model domains for our
<br />
observation (interest). Within such domain we 'count' the item in question
<br />
(that is statistical) irrespective of occurrences beyond the boundaries of
<br />
that domain. The &quot;next&quot; occurrence in the future history is undecided from a
<br />
knowledge of the domain's past history in our best effort: we can consider
<br />
only the 'stuff' limited into our model, cannot include effects from 'the
<br />
rest of the world', so we cannot tell a 'probability' of the 'next'
<br />
occurrence at all.
<br />
Ominscient is different. I am not.
<br />
<br />Thanks for an interesting reading.
<br />
<br />John M

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; In this step, one of me experiences (or actually does not experience)

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; reconstitution on Mars. The same thing will now happen to one of &quot;me&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in the duplication-plus-delay in Step 4. Essentially, Step 4 is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; identical to Step 2 with duplication as the only added feature. We
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; cannot attribute a measure to my 1-pov in either step because the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; outcome is truly random.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is because an event can be random or probabilistic that we have to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; put a measure on it (like a distribution of probabilities, or of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; credibilities).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Example: the perfect throwing of the perfect coin gives an random
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience with a probability &quot;measure&quot; HEAD = 1/2, TAIL = 1/2.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I will ask you questions, if you don't mind. I prefer to ask question
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and illustrate the use of the word in place of teaching you the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probability theory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - Do you agree that if you throw a coin, you have a probability of 1/2
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to get HEAD?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - Do you agree that if you throw a dice, you have a probability of 1/6
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to get &quot;six&quot;?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - Do you agree that if you play lottery, you will win the biggest
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; price with a probability like 1/&lt;big number&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In most discrete case, we can infer equivalence of the elementary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; events on the base of symmetry (like in the old Pascal probability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; calculus).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Here I would merely like to ask, random to whom?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *Fair enough.* In all situation which will interest us: it means &quot;random
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for the subject who performs the (first person) experience&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You are the one throwing the dice? Then it will be random for you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (despite it will be random for your friend too, but perhaps not for God).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Doesn't random mean  that no conscious mind (mine or &gt;yours) can see the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; determinism behind it?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I could agree, although it is not necessary to dig on such detailed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; analysis, imo.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; We are tempted to say &quot;probability 1/2&quot; but that is only &gt;a comp-style
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;bet&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am not sure I understand. There is just one comp bet: the &quot;yes doctor&quot;,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which we can be paraphrased in step 1by &quot;I survive (or I go to Mars) with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probability 1&quot;. (and idem in step 2)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But in step 3, ASSUMING comp, it is hard for me to see any difference with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the throwing of a coin, *for the subject of the experience*.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Suppose I propose the following two type of experiences/experiments.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The ROOM ZERO and the ROOM ONE are NOT distinguishable from inside
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (but are of course distinguishable from outside). In particular, to make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things 100% clear later, i add in both room a close box with a bottle of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whisky inside. And you know this fact about the rooms.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Type 1 experience: I make you asleep, then I throw a coin, if the outcome
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is HEAD I put you in the ROOM ZERO, if I get TAIL, I put you in the ROOM
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ONE. In the room, I wake you up, and I ask you to evaluate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the chance of finding whisky in the box, and then the chance (probability)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of being in room ZERO.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Type 2 experience: I make you asleep, then I scan you and annihilate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you, and I reconstitute you in both rooms ZERO and ONE.  I wake you up in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; both room. In both rooms, you have to evaluate the chance (probability) of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being in room ZERO or ONE,  and the chance of finding whisky in the box.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  From the first person points of view, sequences of such experience will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seem equivalent, except for the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; or &quot;white rabbit&quot; youS, which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will believe in special computable sequences. OK?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now the question can be asked BEFORE you undergo the experience. You can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; predict you will have whisky with probability 1.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So you can predict that you will NOT know in which room you are with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probability one. So you can predict with certainty that you *will be*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; uncertain of which room you are. So you are now not knowing in which room
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be. So the 1/2 can be lifted in your past. You could not have known!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (This I sum up by the drawing: Y = II, bifurcation of &quot;futures&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; differentiates the &quot;pasts&quot;)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You explained on this in Step 2:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;We see that the MEC hypothesis, generally considered as imposing a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; strong determinacy in nature, introduces on the contrary a form of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; strong indeterminacy. Even a God, or whatever possible Omniscient
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Being, cannot predict to you, before a duplication (of you)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; experiment, where you will feel to be after. If he told you &quot;you will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; feel to be the one in room A&quot;, the &quot;Kim&quot; in room A will say that such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; God was right, but the one in room B will know or believe that that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; God was wrong, and the point of MEC is that we have no reason to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; listen more to one Kim than to the other Kim. In particular the Kim of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; room A will not convince the Kim of room B, that &quot;God&quot; was right. No
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Kim will ever be able to convince its counterpart about any possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; method of prediction for the particular future.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I want to grok this more. At this stage I can only believe you.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No, please, you should'nt. Hope the explanation above has clarified. Take
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your time, ask any question.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I have  always felt (with Einstein) that reality is &gt;fundamentally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deterministic, even if we have to point to &gt;stochastic features along  the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I follow Einstein. Like the Everettian. Everett provide an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interpretation of QM where reality is fundamentally deterministic, yet,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shows that the deterministic main equation of QM, SWE, explains why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observers, from their point of view, met indeterminacies, and how they can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; put measure on them and do the usual quantum probability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; calculus. In a nutshell: the observation of a quantum superposition is seen
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as a self-duplication experience, or a differentiation of a history.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I know you will be able to debunk this easily and  to my &gt;(and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Einstein's) satisfaction.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  From what Einstein said in the EPR paper, and from the extreme
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; confirmation of QM which has continued, I would think that Einstein would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have adopted Everett, and then eventually comp. It is the same philosophy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Einstein missed comp by its &quot;conventionalist math&quot; blindness perhaps,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; togethet with the fact that he was not interested
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in computer science.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Maybe dwell a little on this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK. Tell me if you get the point of above. Throwing a coin, and self-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; duplication are identical first person experiences.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You have to really do the thought experiences.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If I duplicate you in room 1 and 2, with repetition (iteratively), you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could predict that you will be the one with the diary 111111111...,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But all your doppelganger (the 1011100010..., the 0000000...) will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; know they were wrong. The &quot;111111111...&quot; *is* the first person white
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rabbit experience, that we should not, in this protocol, take into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; account.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and then move
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; on to Step 5 where you manage to email me to me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hmmm... It is just a teleportation without annihilation of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; original. I scan you on earth, and then I send the info on Mars where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you are reconstituted. the question is what is the probability that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you will find yourself on Mars, what is the probability you stay on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Earth. from you first person point of view you will not live both. OK?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is really a duplication, with a zero delay on one of its branch.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This is truly scary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; because here I meet &quot;myself&quot;. I recall with horror what Angier did
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; about his double in &quot;The Prestige&quot;...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Actually, I believe I have already met my double.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, yes, you should already in step 3 ! In all duplication you can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meet your doppelganger. It is the main relationship between the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prestige and comp: self-duplication. It is the key basic construction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the UDA and AUDA. I got all this by looking at amoeba, paramecium,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Euglena, and even Bacteria. I am inspired by &quot;real&quot; biology at the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; start. I have discovered computer science in the jacob and Monod paper
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on the Operon Lactose (a genetic sugar regulation system in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bacteria Escherichia Coli). My first models of self-replication where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; carbon based until i discover Gödel's proof which makes me suspect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that carbon has nothing to do with the key life principles.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Once, a man stopped
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; outside my house and stroked my cat, which was on the verandah. I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; greeted him and he told me that he had a cat that looked exactly like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; my cat and that it was his dearest and most cherished friend (I feel
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; much the same way about my cat). I then asked him what name he had
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; given his cat. He told me &quot;Cindy Bingy&quot;. I think my mouth must have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; fallen open in shock because that is the name of my cat too. From

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; memory, the man looked rather like me as well. He then walked off
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; while I stood there wondering about the improbability of all this (I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; cannot remember whether cannabis was in my system at the time)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So I will not try to interpret this :)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Tell me if you agree that self-duplication entails, from the first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point of view of the person(s) a feeling of uncertainty on their first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person future, and, when knowing the protocol, some means to evaluate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; their chance. I can use other thought experiences, like with the movie
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which I can explain in more details (perhaps the number
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2^(16180*10000)*(60*90)*24 of KIM 2.3 is not easy for you(*).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Best,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (*) I repeat there (quote from my post to Abram and you: KIM 2.3:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  don't want to give a definition of what is a normal machine, just that you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; feel the point.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let me give you another illustration which exploits the freedom of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thought a bit more. Indeed, let me duplicate you, or better,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; polyplicate you into 2^(16180*10000)*(60*90)*24.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I explain. I multiply you by 2^(16180*10000) in front of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (16180*10000) pixels screen, with each possible images (black and white) on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And I reiterate every 1/24 of a second that multiplication, and this during
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 90 minutes, that is 90*60 seconds.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What do you predict you will feel, as personal, subjective, first person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience. What do you think is more probable, among:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I will feel seeing a white screen
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I will feel seeing a black screen
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I will feel seeing a movie
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I will feel seeing a good movie
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I will feel seeing &quot;2001 Space Odyssey&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I will feel seeing &quot;2001 Space Odyssey&quot; with the subtitle of Caligula
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I will feel seeing a random-noise-movie (what you see on TV when there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is no emission).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course there is a sense to say: I will see all possible movies, but this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; means you are talking about yourself at the third person point of view, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; here what is asked, is what do you expect to experience or live in your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; future if you are invited to practice it. By MEC, you survive, and any of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your first person experience is unique, on which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the above you would bet? What bet will you do if I tell you that I will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; accompany you in the multiplication. And send you to hell if your bet is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wrong. What bet you will do if you want to optimize the chance of not going
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to hell?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The rest of the UDA reasoning shows that &quot;this&quot; thought experience happens
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all the time in arithmetic, but the &quot;probabilities&quot;, which eventually could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be credibilities or other uncertainty measure, are constrained by computer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; science/number theory. It extends the notion of normality from the protocol
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; above to the whole Universal Deployment (which I will (re)define in KIM 3).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Exercise: define the notion of &quot;normal first person experience&quot; for machine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the protocol above. With the UD protocol, things are so much complex that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I will interview the Universal Machine directly to provide hints ...
