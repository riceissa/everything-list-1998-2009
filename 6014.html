<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Can a kernel of information be self inconsistent?  From Bruno's last post 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I think it is possible to impose this idea on the All.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I'm afraid I said the contrary (unless I misunderstand what you are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;pointing at through the expression &quot;kernel of information&quot;). If you agree 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that a kernel of information is like a theory or any finitely describable 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;machine, then only such a thing can be said inconsistent.
</em><br />
<br />At this point I have talked myself into the position that since the All is 
<br />
absent information then we have no way to describe it as consistent or 
<br />
inconsistent in the usual logic meaning that I understand.  It may contain 
<br />
self inconsistent kernels or pair wise inconsistent kernels but this seems 
<br />
to sum to a neutral position.
<br />
<br />Pair wise [or better group wise] inconsistent kernels would differ in the 
<br />
truth value assigned to the same internal component but sum to a neutral 
<br />
position to maintain the overall nature of the All.  I am not saying they 
<br />
exist but allow for it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The &quot;All&quot;, I put it on the semantical side, I don't see how that can be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;made inconsistent in any interesting way. It is *our* attempts to manage 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the &quot;All&quot; which can lead to our inconsistencies. In case we discover some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of those inconsistencies we better should backtrack. I think. No?
</em><br />
<br />I now agree with this as above.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;..I'm also interested in the implicit use of time, or sequence, in many 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;of the ideas discussed here.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;For instance you might say that some of your Somethings are 'bitstrings' 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;that could make up one of Bruno's or Jürgen's worlds/observers.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Remember that comp, as I present it, make &quot;worlds&quot; non computable. It is a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consequence of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the self-duplicability, when distinguishing 1 and 3 person points of view.
</em><br />
<br />Do you mind then a little more non computability re the third person point 
<br />
of view as per my dynamic?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Part of our idea of a string is the convention that one element comes 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;first, then the second, then the third, et cetera.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;However, the information that accounts for that convention is not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;contained in the string itself.   'Taking' a Something as a bitstring 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;involves some degree of external convention.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Indeed, it needs a universal machine, and even an infinity of them. But 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;all that exists and describes by the set of (sigma1) true arithmetical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;propositions. See Podniek's page
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;<a href="http://www.ltn.lv/~podnieks/gt.html">http://www.ltn.lv/~podnieks/gt.html</a>
</em><br />
<br />I may not have time left for yet another schooling but I intend to take a 
<br />
much closer look at your material after I resolve my issues with residual 
<br />
information and the origin of the dynamic which this thread might accomplish.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;So my question is, what do you mean when you say &quot;a universe that has a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;sequence of successive states that follow a set of fixed rules?&quot;  What 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;could make one state &quot;give rise&quot; to the &quot;next&quot; state?    Citing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;&quot;causality&quot; just gives a name the problem; it doesn't explain it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I completely agree with you. The primitive &quot;causality&quot; of the comp 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;platonist is just the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;implication&quot; of classical propositionnal logic. Most of the time (sorry 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;for the pun) time of a computation can be described using no more than the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;axioms of Peano Arithmetic, including especially the induction axioms: 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that if P(0) is true and if for all x (P(x) -&gt;P(x+1) ) then for all x we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have P(x).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(Witten B(0) &amp; Ax(B(x)-&gt;B(Sx)) -&gt; AxB(x) in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;<a href="http://www.ltn.lv/~podnieks/gt3.html#BM3">http://www.ltn.lv/~podnieks/gt3.html#BM3</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(S x) is x + 1
</em><br />
<br />As I said in another post I think the idea of one state giving rise to the 
<br />
next creates issues with accumulating algorithmic complexity.  However, a 
<br />
sequence in which each state is independent of any other state could look 
<br />
causal for long strings of states.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;And I don't think introducing a Turing machine helps with this basic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;problem, since in any automaton you have rules that say e.g. state X at 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;time T begets state Y at time T+1, again placing a convention of sequence 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;(time, here) external to the system itself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But that &quot;time&quot; can be substituted by natural numbers, enumerating for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;exemple the states of some universal machine (itself described in arithmetic).
</em><br />
<br />This sounds like kernels to me.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;This question doesn't engage with your schema head-on; it's more of a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;side detour I've thought of asking about many times on the list; I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;thought it might get explained at some point.  Well, now I'm asking.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now, if you ask where natural numbers comes from, that's a real mystery.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But then I can explain you why no Lobian Machine can solve that mystery, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and why, if we want to talk about all the natural numbers, we are obliged 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to postulate them at the start.
</em><br />
<br />My kernels would be describable by natural numbers so are they actually 
<br />
natural numbers?

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;consider things like the collection of all possible sets to itself be a &quot;set&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Exactly. It is the machine which gives a name to something too big which

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;will take the risk of being inconsistent. The big &quot;all&quot; is not made

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;inconsistent by allowing the possibility of inconsistent machines.
</em><br />
<br />As I said I now agree with this since the All contains no information - see 
<br />
above.  As I said in an earlier post the inconsistency I desire to be in 
<br />
the All is not the same as the inconsistency of a kernel.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Remark.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Actually it is already consistent for a consistent loebian machine to be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;inconsistent, and this is not only true *about* any consistent Lobian 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;machine, but it is communicable by any of them (provable by G* but already 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;by G). Cf FU.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It is again the second incompleteness theorem: (t = true or &quot;p_&gt;p&quot;)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;CONSISTENT t -&gt; NOT(PROVABLE(CONSISTENT t)), or by the duality between 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;CONSISTENT and PROVABLE:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;CONSISTENT t -&gt; CONSISTENT (NOT (CONSISTENT t))
</em><br />
<br />I think this means that it is consistent for a kernel representing a 
<br />
Loebian machine [I am not pretending I know what a Loebian machine is] to 
<br />
be internally inconsistent.

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;I think it would be simpler if you responded directly to quotes from my

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;previous post, rather than just making general statements about issues

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;raised in that post. For example, here you continue to *assert* that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;there is something inherently time-based about logical statements, but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;you don't in any way explain what is wrong with my counterargument from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;that post:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;   I was still having reading difficulties with my new lenses so this was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; easier for me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;OK, no problem.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;'The laws of logic need not be thought of as rules of &quot;discovery&quot;, they 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;can be thought of purely as expressing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;&quot;Expressing&quot; seems to be a time dependent process.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I don't think it needs to be. When we say a certain set of symbols 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;expresses&quot; something, in the most abstract sense we're just saying 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;there's a mapping between the symbols and some meaning.
</em><br />
<br />That would be static information within a kernel.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;  static relationships between static truths, relationships that would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; exist regardless of whether anyone contemplated or &quot;discovered&quot; them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;As are my kernels of information.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;For example, in every world where X and Y are simultaneously true, it is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;also true that X is true, even if no one notices this.'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Sure,  That is a kernel.  Observation does not make a kernel a kernel.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;OK, but this isn't really relevant to my question, namely, why does any of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this require time?
</em><br />
<br />A kernel does not need a set of rules to make the informational 
<br />
relationships within it what they are.  The very words &quot;rules&quot;, &quot;laws&quot; and 
<br />
the like carry the implication of a process where the rules and laws are 
<br />
consulted and followed.  This is a hidden assumption of some ordered 
<br />
sequence - time.  I do not know how to be clearer than that.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;Likewise, you didn't address my point that &quot;I can't think of any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;historical examples of new mathematical/scientific/philosophical ideas 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;that require you to already believe their premises in order to justify 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;these premises&quot;,
</em><br />
<br />I do not believe that Cantor would be sympathetic with that.  I think you 
<br />
need to believe in infinity in order to justify working to understand it 
<br />
and thus justify it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I believe Bruno said that some information systems included a set of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;beliefs.  As I recall the &quot;premises&quot; are these beliefs.  Justification 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;comes from emotions [based on other beliefs] surrounding the resulting 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;system such as simplicity, elegance of apparent explanation etc.   So it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;seems to me that justification is part of belief.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;My point is that if I want to demonstrate the truth of some statement X to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you (without appealing to new empirical evidence), I look for some set of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;premises that we *already* share, and then try to show how these premises 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;imply X. I can't think of any historical example where someone's new idea 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is accepted by other people without the person appealing to common 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;premises they already share. Can you?
</em><br />
<br />See above re &quot;infinity&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;and you didn't address my question about whether you think there could 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;be a world/kernel where a vehicle simultaneously
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Again time inserts itself as the notion of &quot;simultaneously&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;Simultaneously&quot; shouldn't be taken too literally, &quot;X and Y are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;simultaneously true&quot; is just a shorthand way of saying that X and Y are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;truths that both apply to exactly the same domain, whether &quot;same domain&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;means &quot;same universe&quot;, &quot;same time&quot;, or whatever. For example, if I say 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;Ronald Reagan was President of the U.S. in 1985&quot; and &quot;Bill Clinton was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;President of the U.S. in 1995&quot;, these are two non-contradictory truths 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that apply to the domain of &quot;U.S. history in our universe&quot;, so in that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sense they are &quot;simultaneous&quot; truths about this domain even though they 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;refer to different dates. On the other hand, if I said &quot;Ronald Reagan was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;President of the U.S. in 1985&quot; and &quot;Lex Luthor was President of the U.S. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in 1985&quot;, and both applied to the domain of &quot;U.S. history in our 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;universe&quot;, then this would be a contradiction. But if I made clear that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the first statement applied to the domain of &quot;U.S. history in our 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;universe&quot; and the second applied to the domain of &quot;U.S. history in an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;alternate universe&quot; then there would no longer be any contradiction in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;these statements.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;had different numbers of wheels,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;If the world was a CA and half the applicable cells were in a two wheel 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;state and half in a three wheel state what would that be?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I can't really picture a CA where the state of a cell specified a number 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of wheels, but never mind--this would clearly involve no contradiction, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;because the statements &quot;the cell is in a 2-wheel state&quot; and &quot;the cell is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in a 3-wheel state&quot; would not apply to the same domain, since they refer 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to two *different* cells. There is only a logical contradiction here if 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;both apply to exactly the same domain--in this case, the same cell in the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;same &quot;world&quot; at a single time.
</em><br />
<br />My intent in the above was for both kinds of cells to be in the same 
<br />
universe.  If cells are on the order of the Plank distance in diameter and 
<br />
half of the applicable states were in a two wheel state and the rest in a 
<br />
three wheel state then what would an observer many orders of magnitude 
<br />
larger observe?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Do you think it could be possible for two contradictory statements about 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the state of a single cell at a single moment in a single world to *both* 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be true?
</em><br />
<br />I still think that Bruno has allowed for such a case - see above re 
<br />
&quot;Loebian machine&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Should we have the hubris to impose this somewhat questioned concept on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;all other universes?  In my view the states of all universes preexist 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in the All [as some of the kernels] and &quot;Physical Reality&quot; washes over 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;them in some sequentially inconsistent way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;So do believe the statement &quot;the states of all universes don't preexist 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;in the All, and 'Physical Reality' does not wash over them in any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;sequentially inconsistent way&quot; would be false? If so, it seems that you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;yourself have the &quot;hubris&quot; to apply the logical law of noncontradiction 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;to statements about reality as a whole.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I am just try to think of the simplest system that contains no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;information and yet has a dynamic that could support what might be the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;universe some may believe they inhabit.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;But then is there really a process like &quot;think&quot;?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;The All as I defined it [my current proposed belief] contains a kernel 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;for the Nothing as well as a kernel for the All thus the nesting.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; From the inside perspective we are forced to be in, all we have to justify
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;such a belief system is our own beliefs re efficiency, beauty, etc. etc. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;so our beliefs justify our beliefs.  Is this not self referential?  I do 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;not intend to impose that on the system as a whole.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;You didn't really answer my question above. What I'm asking is, every time 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you make a statement about reality as a whole, do you intend to deny that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the negation of your statement is true? For example, above you say that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;The All contains a kernel for the Nothing as well as a kernel for the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;All.&quot; If I make the statement &quot;The All does *not* contain a kernel for the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Nothing *or* a kernel for the All&quot;, would you then say my statement is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;false? Please give me a yes-or-no answer to this question, if at all possible.
</em><br />
<br />One has to at least stick with the definitions that establish the 
<br />
system.  A zero net information system that actually contains all 
<br />
information would have to contain all kernels.  Within the context of my 
<br />
beliefs [permises] then I would answer yes since your statement violates 
<br />
this premise.  This is not a matter of the &quot;Laws of Logic&quot; but rather an 
<br />
informational relation within the system. See below re alternate systems
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I do not agree with your &quot;rather&quot; based cancelation of the residual 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;information issue since I see it as an unnecessary complication of my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;own method.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;rather based cancellation.&quot; If you're 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;talking about my point that every statement could be simultaneously true 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;and false if you throw out the laws of logic, obviously *I* don't 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;believe this is a good way to solve the &quot;residual information issue&quot;, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;since I think it's nonsensical to allow logical contradictions. But 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;since you seem to be saying the laws of logic aren't absolute, I was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;just pointing out that you would have no basis for denying that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;statements about reality can be simultaneously true and false. If you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;say that it is an &quot;unnecessary complication&quot; to allow statements about 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;reality as a whole to be both true and false, then you are in effect 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;saying it would be an unnecessary complication to claim that the laws of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;logic don't apply to reality as a whole!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I just believe in my own sense of neatness.  You gave two apparently 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;contradictory statements which when put in the same pot seem to sum to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;what I propose for the whole system absent the &quot;rather&quot;. I wish to avoid 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;including our &quot;laws of logic&quot; as a necessary component of a kernel.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But if you &quot;wish to avoid&quot; allowing statements about reality to be both 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;true and false, that means you &quot;wish to avoid&quot; allowing reality as a whole 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to contain logical contradictions! The two ideas are exactly equivalent.
</em><br />
<br />What has that got to do with what I said above?  Would both of your 
<br />
statements not be in the same meta system?  I can in fact - as I said - 
<br />
accept both because in my opinion they add up to what I am saying.  I think 
<br />
there is miscommunication here re the ideas of true, false, logical, 
<br />
contradiction, reality, etc. etc.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;My point is that it is more pleasing to think of the dynamic as being 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;inconsistent [each state has no cause effect link of any sort to any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;other state] if there are other components of the All that are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;inconsistent.  But these are not really the same thing and I begin to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;think the latter is a side bar issue.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;There is nothing &quot;inconsistent&quot; in a logical statement about having no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;causal links between states--such an idea does not imply any logical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;contradictions (ie it doesn't imply that two contradictory statements can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;both be true in precisely the same domain).
</em><br />
<br />I said exactly this when I said  &quot;But these are not really the same thing 
<br />
and I begin to think the latter is a side bar issue.&quot; right above.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;indicated that as much
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I think you are misunderstanding what the &quot;laws of logic&quot; really mean, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; examples like different cells of a cellular automata having different states
</em><br />
<br />See above: Its in the eye of the beholder.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;or different states in a series
</em><br />
<br />Where did &quot;series&quot; come from?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;having no causal relationship to one another don't contradict the laws of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;logic in any way.
</em><br />
<br />I was not talking about the &quot;laws of Logic&quot; I was asking if the universe in 
<br />
question did not in fact have a vehicle with both two wheels and three 
<br />
wheels from the point of view of an observer much larger than a cell.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;Does that mean you say the statement &quot;each state of the dynamic is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;completely dependent on the current state&quot; is false?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I believe we should avoid applying logic to a zero internal information 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;entity such as the All.  I believe this causes problems.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;You didn't answer my question. Would you say the statement &quot;each state of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the dynamic is completely dependent on the current state&quot; is false, or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would you say it's true, or would you say it is neither true nor false, or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;what?
</em><br />
<br />How do you justify the question?  My quest is zero information in the whole 
<br />
system.  I established a system I believe meets this criteria.  Its 
<br />
premises could I suppose be taken as &quot;true&quot; without proof in the usual 
<br />
manner.  However, if my system indeed has no information how do the &quot;laws 
<br />
of logic&quot;, &quot;truth&quot;, &quot;contradiction&quot;, etc apply to no information by any 
<br />
justification?  Any other premise set establishes an alternate system.  Am 
<br />
I to presuppose that there is not a meta system that has more than one zero 
<br />
information system in it or that such a system could not somehow contain a 
<br />
negation of one or all of my premises?  See also above.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As to does mathematics contain information, mathematics has the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;potential to erect boundaries so by my definition it is information.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;But doesn't *any* statement you make about reality as a whole, like 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;each state of that dynamic has to be completely independent of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;current state&quot;, erect a &quot;boundary&quot; between itself and its negation, in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;this case &quot;each state of the dynamic is completely dependent on the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;current state&quot;?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I distinguish between actual boundaries and the potential to erect one.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;The All is full of boundaries between kernels but has no potential to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;erect more.  In your &quot;dependent&quot; case one has to manage the dependency 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;rules - a necessary potential to erect boundaries.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;How about the statement &quot;The All is full of boundaries between kernels but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;has no potential to erect more&quot;. Isn't there a &quot;boundary&quot; between this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;statement and its opposite, namely &quot;The All contains no boundaries between 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;kernels but does have potential to erect more&quot;?
</em><br />
<br />Interestingly enough given the way I define information that may be a seed 
<br />
of a meta system such as I mention above.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Would you say the first statement is true and the second is false?
</em><br />
<br />See above.
