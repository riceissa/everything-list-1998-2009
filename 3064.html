Thank you Bruno for the clear explanation.
<br />
Let me rephrase your explanation in my own words.
<br />
For any point X in the Plenitude corresponding to an observer-moment, a state of
<br />
consciousness, or state of a CA, the UD* is just that portion of the Plenitude
<br />
constrained by
<br />
1) that point taken as a boundary condition
<br />
2)LOGICAL and LOCAL consistency  from any point to any point in the transition
<br />
(&quot;extensions&quot; , &quot;projections&quot;) paths.
<br />
<br />Hence the concept of &quot;cone&quot; since the number of points reacheable from a given
<br />
initial boundary condition is expected to grow. In fact, we may have a double
<br />
cone joined at the vertex to represent the logical past and the logical future.
<br />
(I do not want to introduce yet the concept of time)
<br />
<br />The cone also illustrates the indeterminacy associated with point X. The further
<br />
we are from X the greater the indeterminacy. This indeterminacy is of course a
<br />
first person perspective from X.
<br />
<br />Please also notice my emphasis on the concept of logical and local consistency
<br />
on any point along that cone. It may imply that a consciousness my change along
<br />
the way.
<br />
<br />Bruno, so far, I agree with you 100%.
<br />
<br /><br />One more point. In my opinion, the concept of first person and third person
<br />
perspective is really a special case of a continuum. I will discuss this in a
<br />
new thread
<br />
<br /><br />George
<br />

&gt; &gt;&gt; It is better to read (change in capital):
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;   &lt;&lt;This is of course still countable when you look at the domain
&gt; &gt;&gt; from a third person point of view. But, as you aknowledge in
&gt; &gt;&gt; question 7, the delays does not count for the first person, so
&gt; &gt;&gt; the domain of 1-indeterminacy, which BEARS ON first persons EXPERIENCE
&gt; &gt;&gt;  is, thanks of that delays elimination, given by the
&gt; &gt;&gt; union (which is just the set theoretical interpretation of the or)
&gt; &gt;&gt; of all portion of UD* (the execution of the UD, an infinite
&gt; &gt;&gt; three dimensional cone in case the UD is implemented in a
&gt; &gt;&gt; two dimensional cellular automaton) in which my &quot;preparing coffee&quot;
&gt; &gt;&gt; state appear. (Reread that sentence slowly, I have written
&gt; &gt;&gt; it slowly, and without doubts it's too long).&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; So it is a third person measure on first person experiences.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;ssssiiiiiigggggghhhhhhh!!!!!!
&gt; &gt;I read the sentence many times and it still does not make sense to me.
&gt; &gt;Should I read it again?
&gt;
&gt; Read it three times at breakfast, and one time in the evening
&gt; jumping the parenthesis.
&gt;
&gt; Ok, ok. My diagnostic is that either you have forget the question
&gt; 7 or 8, (see below) or you are forgetting what the UD does.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;What is:
&gt; &gt;&quot;the union of all portion of UD*  in which my &quot;preparing coffee&quot; state
&gt; &gt;appear.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Suppose that the UD is written in Fortran. I guess you know what the
&gt; trace of a program is.
&gt;
&gt; UD* is the infinite trace of the UD. It is describe by the
&gt; sequence of its subsequent states (as a program fortran).
&gt;
&gt; It is an infinite tree describing all possible computations in fortran.
&gt; (which includes fortran simulation of all program in Lisp, all Fortran
&gt; simulation of the COBOL version 5.3 emulation of all linear
&gt; transformations,
&gt; all the unitary transformations, etc.
&gt;
&gt; Some of those computations will generate the 3-states corresponding to my
&gt; &quot;preparing coffe 1-state&quot;. Because we accept comp. Now if I prepare a
&gt; cup of coffee, my brain will go through a sequence of states (third person
&gt; describable computational state, at the right level of description
&gt; of myself). and I have pick one of those state---like in a duplication
&gt; experiment).
&gt;
&gt; So the UD generates that state eventually (by going through a computation
&gt; which emulates my doing or dreaming of doing that cup of coffe).
&gt;
&gt; The UD will generates that state eventually. Let us say in 10^googol
&gt; years (or steps). Our poor &quot;universe&quot; has disappeared, but we don't
&gt; care because the UD run in Plato Heaven, or if you prefer,
&gt; the whole UD* (the trace of the UD) lies staticaly but completely
&gt; in Plato heaven). UD* is the block &quot;mindscape&quot; (mindscape borrowed to
&gt; Rudy Rucker's &quot;Infinity and the Mind&quot;.).
&gt;
&gt; And we don't care of the number of steps and of the time that UD would
&gt; have
&gt; take to get that states because, as first person we cannot be aware
&gt; of those delays. Ok?
&gt;
&gt; Please reread ten billions times, after lunch, the question 7 and 8.
&gt; Especially 8. (copy and past from
&gt; <a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m2992.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m2992.html</a>  below)
&gt;
&gt; Note in passing that a copy and paste is a duplication without
&gt; annhilation of the original.
&gt;
&gt; The apparition in UD* of that third person description of the precise
&gt; state &quot;where is my cup now?&quot; (occuring when I am preparing my
&gt; cup of coffee (existing by comp)) is provided by the fact that
&gt; the UD generates all computations.
&gt;
&gt; Saying yes to 7 and 8, makes that &quot;event&quot;, executed by the UD
&gt; equivalent with a delayed reconstitution without demolition of the
&gt; original.
&gt;
&gt; So with comp you *must* bet that at each instant you are copy and paste
&gt; somewhere in your domain of indeterminacy.
&gt;
&gt; But, after a much longer time (much
&gt; longer that 10^googol (the DU *dovetails*, so that it has a lot of work
&gt; while generating and executing the other programs) it generates a new
&gt; reconstitution of that states, so he builds little by little your
&gt; entire domain of 1-indeterminacy. The fact that the DU builds the
&gt; reconstitutions so slowly does not change the first person
&gt; experience because of the non awareness of the delay.
&gt;
&gt; So when I am preparing my coffee cup, if I want to predict my next
&gt; possible instant, I must have a measure on the set of computational
&gt; histories generated by the DU going through the state corresponding
&gt; to my particular  &quot;preparing my coffee cup&quot; state. Or a measure
&gt; on all the &quot;reconsitution&quot; in UD*.
&gt;
&gt; We just cannot care that some of those reconstitution appears
&gt; at step n1, some other at step n2, other at step n3, ....
&gt; The domain of reconstitution will be the union of all the portion
&gt; (subset or substring or subspace, or whatever
&gt; depending on the choice of representation)
&gt; ... portion containing the virtual (or arithmetical) reconstitution.
&gt;
&gt; Find a LISP interpreteur, run the UD at
&gt;       <a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m2793.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m2793.html</a>
&gt; If you don't like LISP, write yourself a UD in COBOL (why not)
&gt; Run it.
&gt; Stop it after two days. You have a portion of UD*.
&gt; Stop it after three days, you get a bigger portion of UD*.
&gt; By comp there is a day it will generate (and &quot;reconstitute&quot; de
&gt; facto) my coffee-state of mind (the 3-comp state corresponding
&gt; for that state which exist.
&gt;
&gt; If you answer yes to question 8, you should understand
&gt; why it is not necessary to
&gt; annihilate me when I am in that state, here in Brussels, for
&gt; making myself survive somewhere in UD*.
&gt;
&gt; Even if there is a &quot;real physical universe&quot;, if you accept comp,
&gt; you can bet the next instant that you have been copy and past in UD*.
&gt; So it is preferable to accept we have never leave it.
&gt;
&gt; The only way to hunt the white rhabbits is to extract
&gt; Turing tropically the stability of regularities.
&gt;
&gt; All this a priori. No doubt some equivalence quotient can be
&gt; attempted relatively, and some structure can exists on those
&gt; first person view of the computational neigborhood.
&gt; (And that happen indeed in the arithmetical translation of
&gt; the UDA).
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Is the cone in space, time, or what? Why three dimensions?
&gt;
&gt; 3 = 2 (because of the two dimensionality of the chosen CA (for exemple
&gt; game of life)- + 1 (time step). Little more below.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Why
&gt; &gt;not four or five? Where are these dimensions coming from?
&gt;
&gt; &gt;From the choice of cellular automata for describing the &quot;programs&quot;
&gt;
&gt; &gt;The sentence is
&gt; &gt;not too long... it's just that it assumes too much background.
&gt;
&gt; Sorry. (I was talking to Joel, Please look Joel'CA animation
&gt; which illustrates. But no problem keeping COBOL. For running
&gt; a UD any UM is good enough ...).
&gt;
&gt; &gt;How
&gt; &gt;does UD* relate to UD? Is it the complement, the conjugate, the inverse, or
&gt; &gt;what?
&gt;
&gt; Yes I should have recall that. See above. It is just the trace of the UD.
&gt; A description of its execution. An infinite tree, or graphe, or set,
&gt; or cone, according to the representation you prefer.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;In any case, the whole issue of restricting an implementation to a
&gt; &gt;particular cellular automaton in any dimensional configuration is abhorrent
&gt; &gt;to me.
&gt;
&gt; A particular universal one which generates all executions in all
&gt; language. The choice of the universal system does not matter. Why not
&gt; a CA?
&gt;
&gt; &gt;If finite inputs are considered any  automaton can be replaced with a
&gt; &gt;huge look up table.
&gt;
&gt; Not those with growing memories. In particular not the universal
&gt; one.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;And as any electrical engineer knows, any automaton,
&gt; &gt;Turing machine or computer can be implemented by circuits consisting solely
&gt; &gt;of  NAND gates (with additional initialization levels of 0 and 1.) That's
&gt; &gt;it. Just NAND gates. Pure logic. No three dimensional cones or any other
&gt; &gt;kinds of cones.
&gt;
&gt; Yes but please give it as much rubber, space, virtual memory, etc,
&gt; as long it generated UD*.
&gt;
&gt; This is just a question of language. I was talking CA with Joel, because
&gt; he talks CA.
&gt;
&gt; Do you know the game of life. The fact that the game of life is
&gt; universal makes it (for me) a perfect way for talking on UD and UD*.
&gt;
&gt; The UD, in the game of life,  is a finite life pattern.
&gt; And its trace is just the sequence
&gt; of evolution step put on top of each other. Of course the pattern
&gt; extends itself 3-dimensionaly (it generates all programs, and
&gt; runs more and more executions).
&gt;
&gt; You stop it after one day. You get a truncated cone.
&gt; Two day, a bigger one. etc.
&gt; UD* is the infinite cone. It is just a representation. No problem
&gt; choosing nand circuits, quantum nor circuits, or cobol version x.
&gt;
&gt; I hope this helps. Tell me.
&gt;
&gt; Bruno
&gt;
&gt; ===================== Question  7  &amp;  8 =================
&gt; from <a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m2992.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m2992.html</a>
&gt;
&gt; Question 7: You are at Brussels (let us say), ready for a duplication WM.
&gt; Let us consider the two following 3-experiments/1-experiences:
&gt;
&gt; 1) just the simple duplication WM, where the W and M reconstitutions are
&gt; made simultaneously.
&gt; 2) A duplication WM where an arbitrary reconstitution delay is made at
&gt; Moscow.
&gt;
&gt; Do you agree that again the two sets of 1-experiences remains unchanged
&gt; (from a 1-pov), although they are 3-different?
&gt; Put in another way, do you agree that if we quantify the WM
&gt; 1-indeterminacy
&gt; by a uniform probability distribution, then you should do the same for
&gt; the second experiment.
&gt;
&gt; That question is a mix of question 3 and question 5.
&gt; The following question is question 7 with a null delay.
&gt;
&gt; Question 8: Let us consider the simple teleportation Sofia Brussels.
&gt; Except that now we don't destroy the original at Sofia. Or, if you prefer
&gt; we detroy it and rebuild at the same place in zero time.
&gt; Do you agree that in case P(W) = P(M) = 1/2 in the WM duplication then
&gt; P(S) = P(B) = 1/2 in the Sofia Brussels teleportation without destruction
&gt; of the original?
