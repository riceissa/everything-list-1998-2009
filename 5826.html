Norman Samish:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The &quot;Flip-Flop&quot; game described by Stathis Papaioannou strikes me as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;version of the old Two-Envelope Paradox.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Assume an eccentric millionaire offers you your choice of either of two
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sealed envelopes, A or B, both containing money.  One envelope contains
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;twice as much as the other.  After you choose an envelope you will have the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;option of trading it for the other envelope.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Suppose you pick envelope A.  You open it and see that it contains $100.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now you have to decide if you will keep the $100, or will you trade it for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;whatever is in envelope B?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;You might reason as follows: since one envelope has twice what the other 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;has, envelope B either has 200 dollars or 50 dollars, with equal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probability.  If you switch, you stand to either win $100 or to lose $50.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Since you stand to win more than you stand to lose, you should switch.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But just before you tell the eccentric millionaire that you would like to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;switch, another thought might occur to you.  If you had picked envelope B,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you would have come to exactly the same conclusion.  So if the above
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;argument is valid, you should switch no matter which envelope you choose.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Therefore the argument for always switching is NOT valid - but I am unable,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;at the moment, to tell you why!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />Basically, I think the resolution of this paradox is that it's impossible to 
<br />
pick a number randomly from 0 to infinity in such a way that every number is 
<br />
equally likely to come up. Such an infinite flat probability distribution 
<br />
would lead to paradoxical conclusions--for example, if you picked two 
<br />
positive integers randomly from a flat probability distribution, and then 
<br />
looked at the first integer, then there would be a 100% chance the second 
<br />
integer would be larger, since there are only a finite number of integers 
<br />
smaller than or equal to the first one and an infinite number that are 
<br />
larger.
<br />
<br />For any logically possible probability distribution the millionaire uses, it 
<br />
will be true that depending on what amount of money you find in the first 
<br />
envelope, there won't always be an equal chance of finding double the amount 
<br />
or half the amount in the other envelope. For example, if the millionaire 
<br />
simply picks a random amount from 0 to one million to put in the first 
<br />
envelope, and then flips a coin to decide whether to put half or double that 
<br />
in the other envelope, then if the first envelope contains more than one 
<br />
million there is a 100% chance the other envelope contains less than that.
<br />
<br />For a more detailed discussion of the two-envelope paradox, see this page:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://jamaica.u.arizona.edu/~chalmers/papers/envelope.html">http://jamaica.u.arizona.edu/~chalmers/papers/envelope.html</a>
<br />
<br />I don't think the solution to this paradox has any relation to the solution 
<br />
to the flip-flop game, though. In the case of the flip-flop game, it may 
<br />
help to assume that the players are all robots, and that each player can 
<br />
assume that whatever decision it makes about whether to switch or not, there 
<br />
is a 100% chance that all the other players will follow the same line of 
<br />
reasoning and come to an identical decision. In this case, since the money 
<br />
is awarded to the minority flip, it's clear that it's better to switch, 
<br />
since if everyone switches more of them will win. This problem actually 
<br />
reminds me more of Newcomb's paradox, described at 
<br />
<a href="http://slate.msn.com/?id=2061419">http://slate.msn.com/?id=2061419</a> , because it depends on whether you assume 
<br />
your choice is absolutely independent of choices made by other minds or if 
<br />
you should act as though the choice you make can &quot;cause&quot; another mind to 
<br />
make a certain choice even if there is no actual interaction between you.
<br />
