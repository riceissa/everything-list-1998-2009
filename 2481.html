This time I'll annotate your entire message to demonstrate how many 
<br />
things I tend to find unclear in your texts. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; From: Marchal &lt;marchal.domain.name.hidden&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Juergen wrote (among things):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;But how to answer an ill-posed question?  You promise that &quot;time and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;space will disappear at the end of the reasoning&quot;, but your question
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;is about delays, and how can we speak about delays without defining
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;time? Simulation time? Real time? Both? How? There is no way to continue
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;without formal framework.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We were doing a thought experiment. I haven't say that the delays were
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; virtual. This is done much later in the reasoning. Of course, as George
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Levy says the permutation real/virtual makes no changes in the first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person point of view, and does not change the distribution either.
</em><br />
<br />To derive consequences we need to know the assumptions. Of course, this
<br />
holds for thought experiments as well. Without defining delays you cannot
<br />
derive something from delays.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; IF we accept COMP we survive with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an artificial brain (Well: in case we were betting on a correct level
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of substitution).
</em><br />
<br />What is a &quot;correct level of substitution&quot;?
<br />
Where does the betting come in? On which alternatives can we bet?
<br />
Which is the distribution on the alternatives?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; That means the doctor scan (at the right level) your brain, destroy
</em><br />
<br />What is the right level?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; it, and then from the recollected information he builds a new one.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The state of the artificial brain mirrors the state of your brain.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You survive (with comp!).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now let us suppose the doctor keeps the information hidden in a drawer 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; during one year. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Real time delay, in the every day-type of life.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; After that delay he makes the &quot;reconstitution&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am just saying that, with comp, from the point of view of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one who survive, that delay cannot be perceived. It has not influence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the kept information of your brain.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; From the first person point of view the delay introduced by the doctor
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has not been and cannot been directly perceived.
</em><br />
<br />That seems obvious, but what exactly do you mean by &quot;perceive,&quot;
<br />
as opposed to &quot;directly perceive&quot;?  You open your eyes - things have
<br />
changed - another time, another place. Which are the limits of perception here?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; (that's why I insist sometimes that reconstition booth has no windows!).
</em><br />
<br />why sometimes, why sometimes not?  Anyway, in general things will
<br />
have changed - you may need some technical equipment to detect the
<br />
changes, still, in principle you could find out things are different,
<br />
at least in the real world. If you cannot, then why not - which are the
<br />
assumptions here?  Maybe you are talking about a virtual reality that you
<br />
can fully control? Then which is the precise set of virtual realities
<br />
you are considering? Is there a probability distribution on this set
<br />
(if not, you cannot predict anything)? Which one?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Are you seeing my point ? It does also not change first person perception
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in case of self-multiplication.
</em><br />
<br />Your point is the revival of an old science fiction theme.
<br />
But as soon as you want to derive something you need to state formal
<br />
assumptions, otherwise you'll end up with empty philosophic blabla.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;There is no way to continue without formal framework.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I isolate a unique formalisation by an informal reasoning. 
</em><br />
<br />Which unique formalisation? Please write it down!
<br />
How can you possibly isolate it by informal reasoning? 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; To formalise
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at this stage would automatically  put the mind-body problem 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; under the rug. 
</em><br />
<br />Didn't you just say there is a unique formalisation? 
<br />
Why does formalisation suddenly &quot;put the mind-body problem under the rug&quot;?
<br />
What's the problem with the mind-body problem? Why is it incompatible
<br />
with formalisation?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; A TOE which doesn't address (at least) the mind-body
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem is a TOS (a theory of *some* thing).
</em><br />
<br />Without formal assumptions you have 
<br />
no theory of everything, no theory of something, no theory at all.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But as I show below, those self-multiplication are easily 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; formalised (at least the third person description of those experiment
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are easily formalised). You can easily write a program which multiplied
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; yourself (still betting on a correct level of course) relatively to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; virtual environments. 
</em><br />
<br />Correct level? Betting? On what - which are the alternatives?
<br />
Which is the distribution on the alternatives?
<br />
<br />The program that multiplies observers _seems_ to go into the direction
<br />
of a formal ansatz, although it remains vague. How does the program
<br />
identify an observer, or myself? It is much easier to write a program that
<br />
copies entire computable universes together with the embedded observers,
<br />
because such a simple program does not need to identify observers
<br />
and separate them from their environment.  Please state precisely what
<br />
you really mean. Don't give another informal example, be precise.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Are you among those who argues that talk on consciousness is a hoax ?
</em><br />
<br />Not necessarily.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; How do you manage consciousness in your TOE-approach?
</em><br />
<br />Algorithmic TOEs are about computable probability distributions on
<br />
universe histories computable in the limit.  Such histories subsume
<br />
all computable evolutions of all computable observers, including the
<br />
conscious ones, if there are any.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; How do you relate consciousness and computation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm afraid you are making &quot;unspoken assumption&quot; about the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mind/body/computation relation all along  your work.
</em><br />
<br />No. There is no need for a definition of what it means to be conscious,
<br />
or how to identify a conscious observer in his environment.  We may
<br />
remain agnostic as to whether &quot;consciousness&quot; is a well-defined concept
<br />
at all.  Just like we may remain agnostic as to whether &quot;greenishness&quot; is
<br />
a well-defined concept.  If there are any conscious computable observers
<br />
then they will be computed as parts of certain computable universes.
<br />
If there are any greenish computable observers then they will be computed
<br />
as well.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;What exactly is this indeterminacy?
</em><br />
<br />Yes, what is it?  Is it something different from an ordinary distribution?
<br />
If so, what is it?  If not, why don't you call it a distribution?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let us reiterate the self-duplications, applied on you, 16 times.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I ask to all (2^16) Schmidhubers if they can predict the W,M
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sequences appearing on their T-shirt.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Some, like WWMWWMWWWWMMMMMM will pretend that the sequence is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computable: it is indeed the beginning of the binary 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; developpement of PI.  Most will accept it is just not computable.
</em><br />
<br />Only the drunken Schmidhubers will say it is incomputable. Most will
<br />
just say &quot;the history so far is computable by a lengthy program&quot;.
<br />
<br />An essential issue is: are they all equally likely? Do you you assume
<br />
a uniform distribution on the possible futures?  Is that what you mean
<br />
by indeterminacy?  If so, why not simply call it a uniform distribution?
<br />
<br />Note there are many alternative distributions besides the uniform one,
<br />
that is, there are many alternative TOEs.  Different TOEs, different
<br />
predictions. Why restrict yourself here to a uniform distribution?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; To make things a little more formal, you can program that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-multiplication, including yourself as a subroutine, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; making Washington and Moscow virtual.
</em><br />
<br />As mentioned above the program P for self-multiplication within a given
<br />
universe is in principle much more challenging than program Q which
<br />
multiplies entire universe histories.  Q does not care for any observers
<br />
it multiplies, while P somehow has to identify them and separate them
<br />
from their environment. It is far from clear what that might mean.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In particular the UD does that. But I am still anticipating.
</em><br />
<br />What is it you are anticipating?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Is the distribution computable?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;How does the distribution depend on your delays and other computable (?)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;things?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The point is that the &quot;credibility-distribution&quot;, whatever form
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it will take, cannot depend, with comp, on arbitrary delays for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reconstitutions. Nor can it depend on space, nor on any subtance ...
</em><br />
<br />What is a &quot;credibility-distribution&quot;?  Is it a probability distribution?
<br />
If so, why not call it a probability distribution?  Define &quot;credibility,&quot;
<br />
define &quot;arbitrary delays,&quot; define &quot;reconstitutions,&quot; taking into account
<br />
the issue of separation of environment and reconstituted being, if that
<br />
is important to what you are doing.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; (I anticipate, but you can read my CC&amp;Q paper, cf my URL below).
</em><br />
<br />I found your CC&amp;Q paper as vague as your other texts.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In another post you say:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Yes. My point is: as long as we are not forced by evidence, why assume
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;the existence of something we cannot describe or analyze in principle?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If I fall from a flying plane, being a realist (though not a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subtancialist) I believe I will fall somewhere, although I have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no means to describe or analyse where.
</em><br />
<br />This is again the issue of describability, given current knowledge, vs
<br />
describability in principle. We are talking about the latter, of course.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Just to see how much constructive philosopher you are,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if you have the time, tell me if you accept the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; following proof ?  Perhaps you know it.
</em><br />
<br />I accept all formal proofs derived from formal assumptions.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So we know for sure that either (sqr(2)) ^ (sqr(2))
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or ((sqr(2)) ^ (sqr(2))) ^ (sqr(2)) provide the solution, although
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we don't know which one. Do you accept we have nevertheless
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prove that there exists couple of irrational numbers (x,y) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such that x^y is rational ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (The problem with constructive philosophy is that there are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quite a lot of them. I am trying to find which one).
</em><br />
<br />If there is a formal system and a formal way of deriving theorems,
<br />
and one of the theorems is a symbol string such as:
<br />
exists(x, y): x^y=p/q and x,y in R and p,q in N,
<br />
then where should be the problem with this?
<br />
<br />Since your example is about numbers computable in the limit, it is maybe
<br />
not quite as challenging as you wanted it to be. Let me try to give
<br />
another example that seems to pose a greater challenge to constructivists
<br />
as it seems to concern &quot;uncountable&quot; things: There is a formal system
<br />
producing theorems such as &quot;exists(x): x=2^aleph_0&quot;.
<br />
<br />No problem though. &quot;exists(x): x=2^aleph_0&quot; is just a finite bistring
<br />
derived from certain axioms that tell you how to manipulate finite symbol
<br />
sequences such as 2^aleph_0.
<br />
<br />The interpretation of 2^aleph_0 is another issue.  Some have a vague idea
<br />
of uncountably many things represented by the symbol string 2^aleph_0.
<br />
But that is indeed just a vague idea without formal justification.
<br />
Any first order theory with an uncountable model has a countable model
<br />
as well. There is no need to map the string 2^aleph_0 onto this vague,
<br />
undescribable concept of &quot;cardinality of the continuum&quot;, whatever
<br />
that may be.
