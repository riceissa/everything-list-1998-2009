<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ok, so, in your view, some states code for 1-OM roles (qualia) and

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some

</em><br />
<br /><br />Actually the states are the same. It is the same states which codes  
<br />
for the 1-OM, and the 3-OM, but they are interpreted differently by  
<br />
the universal machine (the one which plays the role of the observer,  
<br />
as opposed to the one which could play the role of the most probable  
<br />
local universe).
<br />
<br />Platonia = Arithmetical truth, all the rest is &quot;arithmetical truth&quot; as  
<br />
accessed and interpreted by internal universal system, themselves  
<br />
belonging to arithmetical truth.
<br />
<br />We will have 1-OM = 3-OM, and a proof that the machine cannot believe  
<br />
that &quot;1-OM = 3-OM&quot;, and that is why 1-OM and 3-OM will, from the point  
<br />
of view of the machine, obey different logic.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Most states code for nothing.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I cannot say, because it is ambiguous.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What is a 3-OM? Do you mean a 3rd-person view description of an OM?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (for instance the &quot;zombie&quot; coding of a COMP state in a light-beam sent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from Earth to Mars)?
</em><br />
<br />It is almost that, OK. (it more the immaterial information than the  
<br />
physical implementation of the description).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; expressible. It is still an open problem if comp leads to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; solipsism, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; all the evidences available today, are that it does not lead to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; solipsism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Which evidence? Is that one of your technical results? Which one?
</em><br />
<br /><br />It is the fact that if we are able to share a physical world, we have  
<br />
to share a first person indeterminacy, and thus we have to share a  
<br />
logic of qualia (a quantum logic as the one given by the fourth and  
<br />
five arithmetical hypostases), and this is confirmed by QM, where we  
<br />
share first person (plural) indeterminacies. With QM the whole planet  
<br />
is polyplicated all the times.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; It would not be a dualism, it would be mind-monism, but the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;objects&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; being computed would not be OMs directly but some kind of basic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; mind-components - this idea is not new, in fact these objects would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; correspond to the &quot;dharmas&quot; of yogacara (and also Theravada  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Buddhism,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; but not so clearly there). (see
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharmas#Dharmas_in_Buddhist_phenomenology">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharmas#Dharmas_in_Buddhist_phenomenology</a>)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; One would lose the wonderful OM-COMP correspondence (which I think  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; is an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; important feature of your COMP)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; and get some kind of &quot;binding problem&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; again - how a unified consciousness results from the &quot;dharmas&quot;;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; but one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; would be able to better explain how we have shareable histories  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; (which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; is I think a _weak point_ of COMP if related directed to OMs - as  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; already been mentionend on the list, we can drift into solipsism  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; COMP quite easily (and I don't see why shareable histories of any  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; great
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; measure should evolve)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; And I would be interested what you think of the idea to let COMP  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; govern
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; a &quot;dharma&quot;-level and not an OM-level directly.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I am asking myself if you are not doing a 1004 fallacy(*).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (*)Like when Bruno said &quot;about 1004 sheep&quot; in &quot;Sylivie and Bruno&quot; by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Lewis Carroll.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &lt;snip&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's not a 1004 fallacy, it is rather an attempt to recover some  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aspects
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of materialism. (See the Chalmers excerpt I have included below on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; type-F monism)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But then, of course, it would succumb also to the MGA argument (that  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it does not go together with COMP).
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Try to explain, like if it was to to a &quot;layman&quot;,  the difference you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; make between &quot;dharma-level&quot; and &quot;OM-level&quot;.  Which OM?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I guess I mean the difference between type-F monism and pure idealism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (see again Chalmers text included below). Your view is a pure  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; idealism,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the type-f monism is a bit nearer to mainstream views (though still  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; widely held).
</em><br />
<br /><br />I have no view. Only an argument or even a theorem which asserts that  
<br />
IF digital mechanism is correct, then &quot;pure idealism&quot; is not an  
<br />
option, it is a necessary consequence (with the usual weak Occam razor).
<br />
I don't say &quot;I don't need matter&quot;, I am saying that &quot;I cannot use  
<br />
matter for explaining consciousness&quot;. It is quite different.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (remember that the superveneience thesis  is more conscience/  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;relative
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; implementation of states&quot;, than conscience/implementation of states&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The relativity will add the probability (or credibility) of context  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; histories.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ah ok - so you mean that also with COMP and UDA there could be &quot;raw
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; feels&quot; instantiated in Platonia (that would be dharma-level) - or some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; kind of protoexperential?
</em><br />
<br />Yes of course. It is full experiential (not protoexperential).  
<br />
&quot;platonia&quot; (arithmetical truth) is all there is, with occam. So  
<br />
consciousness is a internal feature of platonia.
<br />
Note that we could still eliminate consciousness if we want, and, like  
<br />
positivist, to contend ourself with the study of the many stable  
<br />
discourse of the machines living and developing themselves relatively  
<br />
in Platonia. But given that those numbers keep pretending that they  
<br />
are not zombie, that there is something they cannot doubt, yet cannot  
<br />
defined, well,  given that they are both correct (as a mathematician I  
<br />
study only those which are correct, the &quot;simple&quot; Lobian machines), and  
<br />
given that they are asserting that they are not zombies, why should I  
<br />
distinguish them from myself?
<br />
For making this &quot;rigorous&quot; I have to interpret &quot;consciousness&quot; by a  
<br />
bet on something in between truth and consistency, which, remarkably  
<br />
enough, is what you get once you interpret literally Theatetus' notion  
<br />
of knowledge (Bp &amp; p) in arithmetic (p = any arithmetical definition,  
<br />
and Bp is the usual Gödel Bew('p').  Consciousness = &lt;O&gt;p  =  
<br />
Consistent p or p.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let me rephrase my question: with MAT, we have certain ideas (which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; might be wrong) on what mind could supervene on: on brains, that is,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certain organic chemical structures which exhibit high complexity and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; causal interaction.
</em><br />
<br />Yes. It is the physical supervenience thesis. It is even the one which  
<br />
makes us saying &quot;yes&quot; to the doctor, at the start.  It remains true  
<br />
throughout the whole reasoning if you keep the sense of &quot;physical&quot;  
<br />
evolving thoughout the whole reasoning.  For many, at the beginning  
<br />
(step 1) &quot;physical&quot; means the real material brain and the real  
<br />
material computer which replaced it, the details of which being left  
<br />
to the doctor; and at the end of the reasoning &quot;physical&quot; means the  
<br />
third plural representation of myself which enhanced (makes higher the  
<br />
probabilities) my first person experience in my normal (most probable)  
<br />
computational histories.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And this consciousness is a _unified_ experience
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (which also makes it a bit mysterious for MAT).
</em><br />
<br />Consciousness is the attribute of persons betting on their own  
<br />
consistency, which will be equivalent in their beliefs in a reality  
<br />
sustaining themselves.
<br />
<br />Consciousness is an undivisible one. It is first personal. That first  
<br />
person is not divisible, and not first personal duplicable. In comp,  
<br />
like in Everett, no one can feel the &quot;split&quot;. Consciousness is lived  
<br />
as a unified experience because the first person is intrinsically one.
<br />
<br />You could perhaps read the neurophysiologist Penfield for the discover  
<br />
that no physical brain pertubation can divide the &quot;self-feeling&quot;,  
<br />
despite the fact that again, we can multiply it (apparently, Sperry  
<br />
experience for example: hard to get definite conclusion of course ...).
<br />

<br />
Press, New Jersey.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; With COMP, I am not sure on what consciousness would supervene. On a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; single step of a computation? On a turing machine state? On a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; number-theoretic relation? On a proof?
</em><br />
<br /><br />On all that!  More precisely, the consciousness of the relative  
<br />
universal machine supervenes on all possible relative state of all  
<br />
universal machines. Any local and relative particularisation of that  
<br />
universal machine differentiates it into particular experience  
<br />
supervening on all number theoretical relations (at once) occuring or  
<br />
defined by the universal deployment (or Sigma_1 Truth).
<br />
But we can interview, obviously, only the chatty universal machine  
<br />
which can talk about themselves and the bet they made on realities,  
<br />
that is why I interview &quot;all&quot; Lobian machine in Platonia (all at once,  
<br />
thanks to Gödel, Löb, Solovay).
<br />
<br />Sometimes I think I should insist that Platonia is very different  
<br />
before and after Godel. Assuming comp &quot;we&quot; are in Platonia, and &quot;we&quot;  
<br />
put the mess in it (&quot;we&quot; the universal machine). The regular solids  
<br />
and clean truth remains, but what is &quot;new&quot; is the irregular solids and  
<br />
the *very* (but relative) complex phenomena. Now we know that there  
<br />
can be typhoons, tornados and tsunami in Platonia, and we have to  
<br />
learn the wisdom of insecurity (cf Alan Watts).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And is the supervenient consciousness always tied to an integrated  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whole
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like a person,
</em><br />
<br />Yes. Could be a planaria or a drosophila or any universal machine (or  
<br />
sub-universal machine, gosh, there are nuances ...).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; or, as I asked above, could also &quot;raw feels&quot; supervene on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some parts of a computation which, relatively to others, constitute  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; part
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of a computation on which a unified experience would supervene. (maybe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that is what you mean with &quot;conscience/ &quot;relative implementation of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; states&quot;?
</em><br />
<br />I would say no. Consciousness supervenes on the locally relevant  
<br />
bundle of number theoretical relations. The measure depends on some  
<br />
equivalence relation. You have to take account of all computations (in  
<br />
Platonia) going through a state. Somehow consciousness supervene  
<br />
vacuously on any particular implementation. The implementation makes  
<br />
the particular experience relatively stable to you, and thus capable  
<br />
of manifesting itself relatively to you in your normal histories.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is that also why you think that COMP is not solipsistic? For  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; example, if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness directly supervenes on some form of computation, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical appearances (SWE etc) have to be derived from the measure on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; outgoing computations, you must also be aware that all humans in your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience are &quot;physical objects&quot; - they would only _not_ be zombies  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they are &quot;fully computed&quot; (such as your OM) - but how can you  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; guarantee
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that with the idealistic interpretation that you have? With the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;relative implementations&quot;?
</em><br />
<br />Honestly I cannot guarantee that, now.
<br />
<br />Perhaps you still miss the point. I have no theory nor interpretation.  
<br />
I am just saying that if you say yes to the doctor, then there is no  
<br />
room for a notion of primarily existing matter.
<br />
<br />It is not that we don't need any more the notion of matter, it is that  
<br />
we can no more invoke it to singularize the experience of the mind. We  
<br />
have to redefine it by a relative measure on consistent extensions,  
<br />
and this in a particular precise way, and this makes mechanism testable.
<br />
<br />Now the discovery of the arithmetical hypostases makes Everett  
<br />
confirming the most startling consequence of comp: the fact that we  
<br />
are polyplicated all together. Without Everett confirmation, I would  
<br />
have believed that comp leads to solipsism, and abandon it.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think that there is a bit of a difficulty hidden there.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am interested in your thoughts.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Please, I am not the one hiding the difficulties. I use comp because  
<br />
it makes the difficulties much more transparent, and mathematically  
<br />
expressible. With MEC, the mind theory is relatively easy (= the study  
<br />
of what numbers can say about themselves and their realities), but the  
<br />
theory of matter get far more complex: the measure on all relative  
<br />
consistent continuations for universal machine. This is mainly a gate  
<br />
to a sequence of precise mathematical open problems. My point is that

we have to solve them to get the &quot;real TOE&quot;, once we say yes to the  
<br />
doctor.
<br />
<br />If COMP leads to solipsism in the sense that only Bruno Marchal  
<br />
exists, then I will abandon comp.
<br />
If COMP leads to solipsism in the sense that only the Universal  
<br />
Machine exists, then it will depends on what that could mean.
<br />
<br />I am not the one proposing a theory, I am the one showing that a  
<br />
theory (believed by many) leads to precise and intersting  
<br />
difficulties, and also gives another view on &quot;reality&quot; (not so &quot;other&quot;  
<br />
given that it is in the line of Plato).
<br />
<br />Best,
<br />
<br />Bruno
