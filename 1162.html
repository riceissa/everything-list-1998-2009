<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I like very much your sense of humour, Gilles.
</em><br />
<br />thanks, it tends too be more prominent after some weeks of vacations!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Again all this stuff relies on what I called comp2, ie the hypothesis that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;a digital simulation can be at some level completely equivalent to an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;analogic physical system.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Being digitalisable ourself (with comp) we don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;need to be emulated at *any* analogical level (if that exist at all).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Comp = there is a level where we are psychologicaly  equivalent, no more.
</em><br />
<br />Of course that's exactly the questionable point. I know we've had this
<br />
discussion many times , and that we have not succeeded in convincing each
<br />
other!
<br />
<br />To tell it again, I think we are &quot;too much&quot; analogical to be
<br />
&quot;psychologically equivalent&quot; to anything else than ourselves. For our
<br />
psychology implies a representation of our environment and of ourselves.
<br />
But it is impossible to build a machine who would have a correct
<br />
representation of its environment, but not of itself (believing it is a
<br />
human).
<br />
You escaped the question of the environment in your thesis by considering a
<br />
dreaming machine. But if the machine is not able to interact with the
<br />
environment, it is very improbable that it actually dreams, even if it
<br />
pictures perfectly a dreaming brain, bacause you cannot dream of something
<br />
you never experiment in the reality. It is another form of
<br />
counterfactuality: you can dream only if you could be able to be sensitive
<br />
to what you dream of (i.e. be awake).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;One practical problem is how can you check that your system is really
<br />
thinking?
<br />
<br />I thought recently that the Turing test could well be not so good as I used
<br />
to think before. I found Turing's definition of a thinking machine very
<br />
smart  because it avoided to give an objective definition of consciousness,
<br />
which is impossible to do. However I think now there is a fundamental flaw
<br />
in it : for a thinking machine should not behave like a human, if it is
<br />
really thinking. It should behave like a machine knowing it is a machine,
<br />
which is very different. I think the Turing test may have led people to try
<br />
to imaginate artificial systems emulating human beings, and that may have
<br />
been misleading.
<br />
<br />For example if I am sitting in front of a screen connected to a computer
<br />
that writes  &quot;Hi Gilles my name is Bruno, I live in Belgium etc...&quot; I would
<br />
immediately conclude that the machine does not know anything about the real
<br />
world, and that it imitates a human behaviour without feeling anything- in
<br />
fact it would be a zombie, that is, if you don't believe in zombie, it
<br />
won't be a thinking machine.
<br />
BUT if I am sitting in front of a screen that says
<br />
&quot;Hi Gilles ; I'm a new generation machine that can think like you, except
<br />
some differences due to my electrical nature. For example I can feel very
<br />
well the  40 Hz electromagnetic emission from your brain...&quot; I would think
<br />
&quot;Waouw that COULD be really a thinking machine!&quot; - although it would not
<br />
satisfy the Turing test , and nor be a digital analogous of any human
<br />
brain...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Do you really think that someone believe a digital machine can emulate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in extenso (completely) an analogical machine (if that exist) ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I don't believe that such an idea ever emerged from computer science.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If that idea is what you mean by comp2, I think that this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;crackpot idea emerges in your own mind.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />I think many contributors said that, including James in his last mail!
<br />
