</em><br />
The Soft, Medium and Hard Problems of Consciousness
<br />
The problem of mind and consciousness is one of the most important in
<br />
philosophy, because the stubborn inexplicabiliy of some aspects of
<br />
consciousness has important metahysical ramifications, which
<br />
themselves have knock-on effects in other areas. Given the current
<br />
state of play in philosophy, mind-body issues are almost all that
<br />
hinders an all-encompassing physicalism. Physicalism has wider
<br />
implications. For instance, it ahas the capacity to imply that
<br />
determinism is true and free-will false, possibly in conjunction with
<br />
other theories, which itself would have major consequences in ethical
<br />
and political thought. Moreover, alternatives to physicalism -- such
<br />
as idealism, the idea that &quot;all is mind&quot; and mind-matter dualism --
<br />
are obviously shaped by the mind-body problem. From a modern point of
<br />
view, where Man is no longer the Centre of All Things, it seems odd
<br />
that anyone would want to make human mentality a central feature of
<br />
the universe, as both of those alternatives do. Yet, they cannot be
<br />
rejected without some sort of solution to the Mind-Body problem.
<br />
<br />Consciousness presents a number of features and problems. In
<br />
increasing order some of them are:-
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* What you are aware of, and what you are aware with.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Behaviour: Consciousness as opposed to unconsciousness.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Sense of Self
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Intentionality
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Binding/synthesis
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Phenomenality
<br />
<br />The mere fact that consciousness is multi-faceted has implications: if
<br />
it is a &quot;rag-bag&quot; of features, it is unlikely to be a basic
<br />
constituent of the universe as some people maintain.
<br />
<br />People who have read Marx or with leftish political leanings often use
<br />
&quot;consciousness&quot; to mean the mindset of an individual or group -- so
<br />
that is is possible to &quot;raise&quot; one's consciousness by becoming aware
<br />
of more or different things. For the purposes of investigating the
<br />
metaphysical implications of the Mind-Body Problem, that is not what
<br />
the word &quot;consciousness&quot; means . We take it to mean what you are aware
<br />
withnot what you are aware of.
<br />
<br />The word &quot;conscious&quot; can also be used to indicate that someone is
<br />
awake and interacting with their environment, as opposed to somnolent.
<br />
If this were all the philosophical problem consisted of, it would be a
<br />
lot simpler! The philosophical problem is about the nature of the
<br />
faculty of consciousness, not whether it is &quot;switched on&quot; -- whether
<br />
someone is displaying it at a certain point in time. Nonetheless, this
<br />
tells us that there is an external behavioural aspect to
<br />
consciousness. We should not think of it as a deely hidden,
<br />
impenetrable mystery. Hopefully, we should not think of it as nothing
<br />
butbehaviour either. We can and do attribute consciousness to other
<br />
individuals (quite possibly including non-humans) on the basis of
<br />
their behaviour, but what we attribute to them is not just behaviour
<br />
-- it is an &quot;inner world&quot; of thoughts and feelings we introspectively
<br />
detect in ourselves, and link with certain kinds of our own external
<br />
behaviour.
<br />
<br />The sense of self is perhaps the easiest feature of consiousness to
<br />
deal with. It is easy to see why organisms need a sense of self --
<br />
they would not want to absent-mindedly chew off one of their own
<br />
limbs, as Daniel Dennett reminds us. We can naturalistically
<br />
understand consciousness as a kind of virtual reality system, and the
<br />
sense-of-self as a kind of figure that is manipulated within the
<br />
simulation to explore counterfactual situations. We can imagine
<br />
information processing-systems that process information about
<br />
themselves, that have an internal self-representation. Indexical
<br />
pronouns, and recursive functions show how self-awareness can be
<br />
leveraged syntactically.
<br />
<br />The sense of the self is made to explain other aspects of
<br />
consciousness in &quot;homuncular&quot; theories in which an inner self lends
<br />
intentionality, phenomenality and so on to consciousness in some
<br />
inexplicable way. This class of theory is often and rightly criticised
<br />
for its infinite regress, yet remains eternally popular.
<br />
<br />Of course I have been talking about the &quot;sense of self&quot; in a rather
<br />
fictive sense, not as an actually existing entity. But, as
<br />
philosophers from Buddha to Hume have noticed, an inner self -- above
<br />
and beyond both the body and mental contents such as thoughts and
<br />
feelings is not discernable. There may be a thought &quot;I am&quot; which
<br />
accompanies all other thoughts, as Kant believed (or a felling or
<br />
quale that fulfils a similar role) -- but they are thoughts and
<br />
feelings of self -- not selves ! Of course such an inner self is not
<br />
detectable objectively within the brain, which seems to be fairly
<br />
decentralised organ, either,
<br />
<br />I strongly suspect that people who believe in an inner self, do not
<br />
detect an inner self as such within themselves. Rather they feel they
<br />
must have a &quot;little (wo)man&quot; inside them to make everything work; i.e.
<br />
it is a theory masquerading as a fact.
<br />
<br />Intentionality is regarded as the very mark of the mental by some.
<br />
Intentionality means &quot;aboutness&quot;, the ability of mental contents such
<br />
as thought and beliefs to be about something. If you think about a
<br />
rock, you do not have a rock in your head, you have, in some sense, a
<br />
thought. Intentionality is closely allied to the ability to form
<br />
representations -- examples of external representations include words
<br />
and pictures --which is not particularly mysterious. Whilst
<br />
intentionality has its puzzles, it does not challenge physicalism in
<br />
any basic way. Moreover, it is now universally acknowledged that there
<br />
can be unconscious mental contents, and therefore unconscious
<br />
inentionality. So intentionality is part of the problem of mind rather
<br />
than the problem of consciousness.
<br />
<br />At one time, teleology was regarded as the mark of them mental, and as
<br />
the nub of the mind-body problem (or, rather, a wider life-mecahnism
<br />
problem). It is now regarded as resolvable by a reduction of teleology
<br />
in favour of mechanistic causation. &quot;Teleological&quot; entities have some
<br />
internal representation of a a future state, and act in order to bring
<br />
it about. Nothing more than mechanism is needed to explain that. We
<br />
have been able to build teleological devices since the 50s.
<br />
(Cybernetics)
<br />
<br />Binding or synthesis is the way that different sensory modalities
<br />
combine into a unified representation of the world. This was known to
<br />
ancient philosphers like Aristotle, who thought it required a &quot;sixth
<br />
sense&quot;, to modern philosophers like Kant who called it the Synthetic
<br />
Unity of Apperception, and to neurologists who call it the Binding
<br />
Problem. A magic homunculus, a central Scrutiniser suggests itself to
<br />
some as an solution to this problem; everything comes together at the
<br />
Central Scrutiniser. But, as usual, this is not very explanatory. Does
<br />
the Scrutniser have another scrutiniser within it ?
<br />
<br />Ultimately the Binding problem is structural and behavioural, and
<br />
therefore within the grasp of a scientific approach. The real problem
<br />
-- the Hard Problem -- is subjective experience.
<br />
<br />Whilst subjective experience can be analysed into aspects that are
<br />
unchallenging physically (see Appendix) there are other aspects which
<br />
are much more problematical. The technical term for aspects of
<br />
subjective experience is &quot;qualia&quot;.
<br />
<br />Qualia Introduced
<br />
Qualia are the way things seem to us, experiences considered purely as
<br />
experiences. They are conceptually distinct from the physical
<br />
experiences outside the cranium that cause them (if any--dreams and
<br />
hallucinations are qualia as much as anything), and are also defined
<br />
without prejudice to whatever intra-cranial events may or may not
<br />
accompany or implement them. That is to say, they are not defined as
<br />
neurological events (although the definition does not preclude their
<br />
being identified with such events by some process of explanation). An
<br />
example would be the way lemons taste to you, as opposed to their
<br />
chemical composition.
<br />
C.I Lewis' Original Definition of Qualia
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;There are recognizable qualitative characters of the given, which
<br />
may be repeated in different experiences, and are thus a sort of
<br />
universals; I call these &quot;qualia.&quot; But although such qualia are
<br />
universals, in the sense of being recognized from one to another
<br />
experience, they must be distinguished from the properties of objects.
<br />
Confusion of these two is characteristic of many historical
<br />
conceptions, as well as of current essence-theories. The quale is
<br />
directly intuited, given, and is not the subject of any possible error
<br />
because it is purely subjective.&quot;
<br />
<br />Infallibility and other Epistemic Issues
<br />
People like Dennett make much of the infallibility clause (&quot;is not the
<br />
subject of any possible error&quot;). He argues that because we could be
<br />
wrong about qualia, the whole notion is dispensible. However, we could
<br />
be wrong about anything. We make mistakes about external objects, does
<br />
that mean an external world is dispensible? An epistemological verion
<br />
of Fank Jacksion's Mary woudl nto be know what qualia are either,
<br />
despire being familiar with every shade of infallibility and
<br />
ineffability. What qualia re explains their inieffability, not the
<br />
other way round!
<br />
What is the problem of qualia?
<br />
The problem of qualia is the problem of their relationship to the
<br />
physical description of the world. Many people have the intuition that
<br />
showing a brain-scan of someone, John, eating lemons to someone else,
<br />
June, with no sense of taste would not tell June what lemons taste
<br />
like even if she knew everything there is to know about neurology.
<br />
This intuition is called the 'explanatory gap'. Many people also have
<br />
an intuition that everything can be explained by the behaviour of
<br />
matter at the most fundamental level, i.e that all sciences will
<br />
eventually be reduced to physics. This intuition is called
<br />
reductionism and has the clear implication that there cannot
<br />
ultimately be any explanatory gaps. If you have both intuitions, you
<br />
are going to have a problem with qualia.
<br />
<br />What Qualia Are and Are Not
<br />
Is there a need for the word &quot;qualia&quot;: What qualia are not
<br />
I do need the term qualia to clearly differentiate the experiential
<br />
aspects from
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The physical properties of objects that are giving rise to
<br />
experiences. This is a point brought out in CI Lewis's definition.
<br />
Under &quot;naive&quot; — that is, pre-scientific — theories, it is assumed that
<br />
things are as they seem; the perceived properties of objects start off
<br />
attached to the object itself, and are just copied by perception. This
<br />
simple picture was picked apart by the development of a scientific
<br />
picture of how the sense organs work.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The neural correlates of the experience -- considered as such.
<br />
To say that a quale is a different thing from nueral behaviour simply
<br />
begs the question against some proposed solutions to the MBP, such as
<br />
token identity theory. However, experiences do not seem like neural
<br />
activity. Our ancestors had all sorts of experiences without realsiing
<br />
there are such things as neurons. So long as &quot;qualia&quot; labels the way
<br />
things seem they can be held as being not necesarily the same as their
<br />
neural correlates, without begging any questions about what they
<br />
&quot;really&quot; are.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. The behavioural accompaniments of experience. This is relevant
<br />
to Dennett's thinking, in that he associates experience with the
<br />
tendency to produce reports.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Information or knowledge (cognition as opposed to perception).
<br />
Being told about the Eiffel Towers is not the same as sseing it,
<br />
althought the same information may be conveyed. Cognition is not
<br />
phenomenally vivid in normal people. There is a condition called
<br />
synaesthesia where words, ideas, etc are phenomenally vivid. Trying to
<br />
identify phenomenality with cognition would render this well-attested
<br />
psychological peculiarity incomprehensible.
<br />
<br />Qualia and Intentionality
<br />
Straightforward identification of qualia with brain states is hindered
<br />
by the fact that brain states do not have the properties qualia seem
<br />
to have; for instance if a green triangle, is seen, there is nothing
<br />
in the brain that is green and triangular, either. (Nor is there
<br />
necessarily any external object with those properties within the field
<br />
of vision). A similar problem also occurs with intentionality.
<br />
(Intentionality labels the tendency of thoughts or words to be about
<br />
something). To think about rocks is not to have rocks in the head.
<br />
This does not startle us because we are used to the fact that symbols
<br />
and represetations are not the same as the things they represent. You
<br />
cannot sit on the word &quot;chair&quot;. So all that is needed to solve this
<br />
puzzle in the case of intentionality is the idea that the mind/brain
<br />
is some kind of symbolic or representational system.
<br />
<br />Can this trick be made to work for qualia? The essential problem of
<br />
qualia is their inability to be expressed in language; that is the
<br />
problem from which the privacy of the mental stems, and from which the
<br />
subjectivity of the mental further stems. It could be argued at a
<br />
stretch that qualia are the intentions of a &quot;language of thought&quot;, a
<br />
language that underpins our mental processes but to which we do not
<br />
have conscious access. However, a complete physical description of the
<br />
brain must include such a language-of-thought as one of its aspects,
<br />
so this theory contains the implication that qualia could be captured
<br />
in physicalese (since they are already captured in a language-of-
<br />
thought which itself is captured by a complete physical description).
<br />
If the indescribability of qualia is already present, and most severe,
<br />
in physicalese, it is very difficult to see how accessing the LOT via
<br />
physicalese would help.
<br />
Qualia and naive realism
<br />
Naive realism is the view that we perceive things just as they are. It
<br />
is undermined by a number of essentially scientific discoveries:-
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Optical illusions are not properties of the object being viewed.
<br />
The whole point of the Muller-Lyer illusion is that the lines are
<br />
really of equal length. If the apparent inequality is a real property
<br />
of the diagram, whence the equality?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. People see the same thing differently. Three people looking at a
<br />
coin might see an oval, a circle and a rectanlge. Yet these cannot all
<br />
be the actual shape of the coin.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. The phenomenal appearances of dreams, hallucinations cannot be
<br />
properties of real, external objects. Hence the hard problem of
<br />
consciousness arises from the combination of a scientific world-view
<br />
and introspective access to consciousness.
<br />
<br />In total, these create a need for some concept of perceived qualities
<br />
even if it is not a concept of qualia. Possible alternatives include
<br />
&quot;sense data&quot;, &quot;Percepts, and so on.
<br />
Negative definitions and limiting concepts: &quot;Qualia&quot; as a non-
<br />
referring term.
<br />
Outright qualia-denial is quite implausible; it is the claim that
<br />
smells don't smell and pains don't pain. A related manoeuvre is to
<br />
deny the usefulness of the word &quot;qualia&quot;. The word is often used to
<br />
point out something which is unexplained within current theories of
<br />
consciousness, something unknown. How can a word which doesn't mean
<br />
anything be of any use? Surely it can be eliminated without changing
<br />
anything.
<br />
<br />There is a distinction between two different kinds or shades of
<br />
meaning made by Frege. &quot;Reference&quot; is the external-world object a
<br />
symbol is &quot;about&quot;. &quot;Sense&quot; is the kind of meaning a symbol has even if
<br />
does not have a reference. This shows that a referentless term can
<br />
still be meaningful, but it does not quite show that there is a
<br />
benefit in employing such terms. (After all, many examples of
<br />
referntless terms are obviously useless -- words such as &quot;pixie&quot;,
<br />
&quot;unicorn&quot; and so on).
<br />
<br />We need to be aware of the limitations of our knowledge. We need a
<br />
vocabulary to indicate those limitations. Without one, we might
<br />
prematurely decide that we understood everything. There is a
<br />
philsophical tradition of such negative or limiting concepts, with
<br />
Kant's noumenon perhaps being the most famous example.
<br />
<br />But, continues the argument, such terms are scientifically useless
<br />
even if they are employed by philosophers.
<br />
<br />The demand that all scientific terminology be pre-equipped with
<br />
referents is self defeating. The purposes of many scientific
<br />
programmes is precisely to find the referent of some term. Science
<br />
progresses by investigating mysteries, not by sweeping them under the
<br />
carpet. We don't know what &quot;dark matter&quot; names, but we need a label
<br />
for the mystery so we can get on with investigating it. Our ancestors
<br />
didn't really know what &quot;water&quot; means. Where would we be if some proto-
<br />
Dennett had advised them to abandon the term?
