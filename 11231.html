<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Anything provable by a finite set of axioms is necessarily a finite 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; string of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; symbols, and can be found as a subset of my Nothing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You told us that your Nothing contains all strings. So it contains all 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; formula as &quot;theorems&quot;. But a theory which contains all formulas as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theorems is inconsistent.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am afraid you confuse some object level (the strings) and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory-level (the theorems about the strings).
</em><br />
<br />Actually, I was wondering if you were making this confusion, owing to
<br />
the ontological status you give mathematical statements. The
<br />
Nothing, if interpreted in its entirety, must be inconsistent, of course. Our
<br />
reasoning about it need not be, and certainly I would be grateful for
<br />
anyone pointing out inconsistencies in my writing.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps the exchange is unfair because I react as a &quot;professional 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logician&quot;, and you try to convey something informally. But I think that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at some point, in our difficult subject, we need to be entirely clear 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on what we assume or not especially if you are using formal objects, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like strings.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />I'm not that informal. What I talk about are mathematical objects, and
<br />
one can use mathematical reasoning. However, the objects are more
<br />
familiar (to a mathematics student) than the ones you discuss (its
<br />
just standard sets, standard numbers and so on), so I suspect you read
<br />
too many nuances that aren't there...
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I should note that the PROJECTION postulate is implicit in your UDA
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; when you come to speak of the 1-3 distinction. I don't think it can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; derived explicitly from the three &quot;legs&quot; of COMP.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm afraid your are confusing the UDA, which is an informal (but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rigorous) argument showing that IF I am &quot;digitalisable&quot; machine, then 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics  or the &quot;laws of Nature&quot; emerge and are derivable from number 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory, and the translation of UDA in arithmetic, alias the interview 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of a universal chatty machine. The UDA is a &quot;reductio ad absurdo&quot;.  It 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumes explicitly consciousness (or folk psychology or grandma 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; psychology as I use those terms in the SANE paper) and a primitive 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical universe. With this, the 1-3 distinction follows from the fact 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that if am copied at the correct level, the two copies cannot know the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence of each other and their personal discourse will 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; differentiate. This is an &quot;illusion&quot; of projection like the wave packet 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *reduction* is an &quot;illusion&quot; in Everett theory. 
</em><br />
<br />Fair enough, the &quot;Yes Doctor&quot; is sufficiently informal that perhaps it
<br />
contains the seeds of the PROJECTION postulate. When we come to the
<br />
discussion of the W-M experiment, there are 3 possible outcomes:
<br />
<br />1) We no longer experience anything after annihilation at Brussels
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(contradicts YD)
<br />
2) We experience being both in Moscow and Washington simulteously
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(kinda weird, and we dismiss as a reductio, but could also be seen
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as contradicting PROJECTION)
<br />
3) We experience being in one of Moscow or Washington, but not both,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and cannot predict which.
<br />
<br />I've noticed a few people on this list arguing that 2) is a possible outcome -
<br />
probably as devil's advocates. That would certainly be eliminated by
<br />
something like the PROJECTION postulate.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The UDA reasoning is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simple and the conclusion is that there is no primitive physical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe or comp is false. Physics emerges then intuitively from just 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;immaterial dreams&quot; with subtle overlappings. The UDA does not need to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be formalized to become rigorous. But having that UDA-result, we have a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thoroughly precise way to extract physics (and all the other 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hypostases) from the universal interview. For *this* we need to be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entirely specific and formal. That is why in *all* my papers (on this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subject) I never separate UDA from the lobian interview. This is hard: 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would not have succeed without Godel, Lob and other incompleteness 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theorems.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have a problem with your way of talking because you are mixing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; informal talk with formal object (like the strings). Like when you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; write:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The Nothing itself does not have any properties in itself to speak
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of. Rather it is the PROJECTION postulate that means we can treat it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; as the set of all strings, from which any conscious viewpoint must
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; correspond to a subset of strings.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It looks like a mixing of UDA and the lobian UDA. It is too much fuzzy 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />I'm sure you know about mathematical modelling right? Consider
<br />
modelling populations of rabbits and foxes with Lotka-Volterra
<br />
equations. The real system differs from the equations in a myriad of
<br />
ways - there are many effects like drought, the fact that these
<br />
animals breed sexually etc. that aren't represented in the
<br />
equations. Nevertheless, the two systems, formal LV equations, and
<br />
informal real fox/rabbit system will behave concordantly provided the
<br />
systems stay within certain limits.
<br />
<br />In this case, I would say the &quot;Nothing&quot; is an informal concept, and
<br />
the set of all strings (U say) is a formal concept that models it. I
<br />
would go further and say that whatever we observe, whatever we
<br />
construct, corresponds to that subset of U whose elements mean (or
<br />
describe) what we observe etc. This is the PROJECTION postulate. It is
<br />
also an act of faith that this model is the best we can possibly do as
<br />
conscious observers, so that this model is a candidate for a Theory of
<br />
Everything (or Theory of Nothing). Ultimately, one hopes for testable
<br />
predictions, and indeed there do appear to be predictions of sorts,
<br />
although whether these are empirically verifiable is another
<br />
matter. Obviously, there are a number of other seemingly reasonable
<br />
assumptions (which I have tried with utmost care to extract as
<br />
postulates) needed to connect the dots. So empirical falsification
<br />
will not necessarily bring down the entire ediface, but would
<br />
certainly lead to some interesting insights.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; But it is neither &quot;nothing&quot;. It is the natural numbers without 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; addition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; and multiplication, the countable order, + non standard models.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I disagree - it is more like the real numbers without order, addition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and multiplication group structures, but perhaps with the standard
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; topology, since I want to derive a measure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Are you saying that your Nothing is the topological line? Again it is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not nothing (or it is very confusing to call it nothing), and what you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intend will depend on your axiomatization of it. 
</em><br />
<br />It is the set of all infinite length strings (in some alphabet). There
<br />
is a probability measure defined on infinite subsets - this would be
<br />
enough to show that the measure of the subset 1* (for binary strings)
<br />
is 0.5 and so on. Looks like a topological line, but would need to
<br />
check the axioms.
<br />
<br />It is &quot;Nothing&quot;, because of the modelling relation, and the insistence
<br />
that all we can know of anything comes in the form of strings.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you stay in first 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; order logic, this will give an even weaker theory than the theory of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; finite strings: you will no more be able to prove the existence of any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; integer, or if you take a second order logic presentation of it, then 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your &quot;nothing&quot; will contain much more than what the ontic comp toes 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; needs, and this is still much more than &quot;nothing&quot;. 
</em><br />
<br />This comment sounds like it is coming from arithmetic
<br />
realism. Theories about something, don't have to be the something. One
<br />
can use whatever mode of logical reasoning one is comfortable with -
<br />
the onotological status is simply given by the modelling
<br />
relation. When I say &quot;The set of all strings (or descriptions)
<br />
exists&quot;, I am making an ontological statement. When one shows that this
<br />
leads to Occams razor, one is doing logic, not ontology.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; To be franc I am 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; astonished you want already infinite objects at the ontological level. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If *all* infinite strings are in the ontology, that could be a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; departure from comp (and that would be interesting because, by UDA, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that would make your theory predicting a different physics and then we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could test it (at least in principle), and only when your theory will 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be precise enough.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />I'm not convinced it is a departure from COMP, but as you say it would
<br />
be interesting if true. Can you elaborate further on your reasons,
<br />
perhaps saying which infinite strings cannot be found in UD* for example?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I though your ontic TOE (the strings) was similar to RA, but I guess I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was wrong, so I am less sure I understand what you try to do.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />I would say it is more like assuming that UD* exists, whilst remaining
<br />
silent on the topic of whether a universal dovetailer exists, or even
<br />
on the prerequisites such as AR or the CT thesis.
<br />
<br />Of course, a certain amount of this is taste - assuming that UD* is
<br />
identical to the set of all infinite length strings (which your
<br />
previous comments have given doubt). Either you presuppose the
<br />
existence of some simple program, or you note as I do that the set of
<br />
strings is the simplest possible object (by definition of simplicity).
<br />
<br />Cheers
