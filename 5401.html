<br /><br />New Data on 2 Doomsday Ideas, Big Rip vs. Big Crunch
<br />
<br />February 21, 2004
<br />
&nbsp;By JAMES GLANZ 
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />MARINA DEL REY, Calif., Feb. 20 - A dark unseen energy is
<br />
steadily pushing the universe apart, just as Einstein
<br />
predicted, suggesting the universe may have a more peaceful
<br />
end than recent theories envision, according to striking
<br />
new measurements of distant exploding stars by the orbiting
<br />
Hubble Space Telescope. 
<br />
<br />The energy, whose source remains unknown, was named the
<br />
cosmological constant by Einstein. In a prediction in 1917
<br />
that he later called &quot;my greatest blunder,&quot; Einstein
<br />
posited a kind of antigravity force that was pushing
<br />
galaxies apart with a strength that did not change over
<br />
billions of years of cosmic history. 
<br />
<br />Theorists seeking to explain the mysterious force have
<br />
suggested that it could, in fact, become stronger or weaker
<br />
over time - either finally tearing the universe apart in a
<br />
violent event called &quot;the big rip&quot; or shutting down in the
<br />
distant future - tens of billions of years from now. 
<br />
<br />If the force somehow shut down, gravity would again
<br />
predominate in the cosmos, and the universe would collapse
<br />
on itself. That version of oblivion is sometimes called
<br />
&quot;the big crunch.&quot; 
<br />
<br />On Friday, Dr. Adam Riess of the Space Telescope Science
<br />
Institute in Baltimore presented the first broad set of
<br />
observational figures that gauge the strength of the
<br />
antigravity force over time. The information, he said,
<br />
suggests that the cosmos will gradually expand, cool and
<br />
darken, more akin to a slide into senescence rather than a
<br />
violent apocalypse. 
<br />
<br />Dr. Riess and his team, which included Drs. Louis Strolger
<br />
of the science institute and Alexei V. Filippenko of the
<br />
University of California at Berkeley, used the Hubble to
<br />
search for exploding stars, or supernovae, that are swept
<br />
up in the cosmic push of the dark energy. They discovered
<br />
42 new supernovas in their survey area, including six of
<br />
the seven most distant known. 
<br />
<br />Rather than seeing the changes in the push that many
<br />
theorists had predicted, Einstein's unchanging cosmological
<br />
constant fits the data better than any of the alternatives.
<br />
<br /><br />&quot;What we've found is that it looks like a semipermanent
<br />
kind of dark energy,&quot; Dr. Riess said. &quot;It appears like it's
<br />
been with us for a long time. If it is changing, it's doing
<br />
so slowly. Einstein's theory is looking a lot better than
<br />
before this data.&quot; 
<br />
<br />A cosmologist not involved in the work, Dr. Michael S.
<br />
Turner of the University of Chicago, said: &quot;This is the
<br />
biggest mystery in all of science, whether or not dark
<br />
energy varies with time. It's a big, big clue, and this is
<br />
the first information we have.&quot; 
<br />
<br />Although the new results favor Einstein's nearly
<br />
century-old prediction, Dr. Turner said, they still do not
<br />
rule out some alternative theories. The information
<br />
specifically leaves open the chance that the antigravity
<br />
force will eventually strengthen and tear apart planets,
<br />
stars and even atoms in a big rip, among other exotic
<br />
possibilities. 
<br />
<br />Dr. Turner said that future measurements were quite likely
<br />
to turn up smaller changes in the force over time and that
<br />
those subtleties could help unravel the mystery. 
<br />
<br />The results do suggest that any ultimate cataclysm could
<br />
not occur for, perhaps, 30 billion years, Dr. Riess said.
<br />
Several physicists said that those estimates were highly
<br />
uncertain, but that the findings could lead to a
<br />
wide-ranging reassessment of models that predict strange
<br />
variable energy densities in space. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Models which predict wild dark energy densities which
<br />
change a lot with time don't look so good,&quot; Dr. Yun Wang, a
<br />
cosmologist at the University of Oklahoma, said. &quot;Everybody
<br />
will go back to the drawing board.&quot; 
<br />
<br />Dr. Filippenko presented some of the results at a
<br />
conference here on Sources and Detection of Dark Matter and
<br />
Dark Energy in the Universe. 
<br />
<br />The measurements raise new questions about the NASA
<br />
decision, which is under review, to let the Hubble die a
<br />
slow death in space rather than try another service mission
<br />
with a space shuttle. The administrator of National
<br />
Aeronautics and Space Administration, Sean O'Keefe, has
<br />
said a service mission would be too risky after the
<br />
disaster of the Columbia space shuttle. 
<br />
<br />Dr. Riess said he disagreed with the decision to stop the
<br />
Hubble, which would halt the research for years to come. He
<br />
pointed out that the remarkable clarity of the work
<br />
depended on the Advanced Camera for Surveys, which
<br />
spacewalking astronauts installed in Hubble two years ago. 
<br />
<br />The organizer of the conference here, Dr. David B. Cline
<br />
of the University of California, Los Angeles, said that in
<br />
view of the team's results, he was inclined to agree with
<br />
Dr. Riess's assessment. 
<br />
<br />&quot;They really shocked everybody by showing they could do
<br />
this,&quot; Dr. Cline said. &quot;You have to say obviously it's
<br />
shame that the Hubble can't continue its life.&quot; 
<br />
<br />All the scientists agreed that because the problem had
<br />
become so knotty, a complete solution might have to wait
<br />
for a proposed satellite, tentatively called the
<br />
Supernova/Acceleration Probe, or SNAP, which is planned to
<br />
observe thousands of exploding stars from space. 
<br />
<br />&quot;It's so tantalizing and so beautiful to see this kind of
<br />
data set,&quot; said Dr. Saul Perlmutter, a physicist at
<br />
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory who is leading the
<br />
SNAP team. &quot;This kind of result is so exciting for those of
<br />
us who are eager to get to that next step.&quot; 
<br />
<br />Einstein invented the cosmological constant 1917 to explain
<br />
why the universe, filled with countless stars and galaxies
<br />
that are attracted to one another by gravity, did not
<br />
collapse on itself. He added a constant term, called
<br />
lambda, to his equations of general relativity, which
<br />
describe the workings of gravity and the curvature of space
<br />
on large scales. Lambda provided a repulsive force to
<br />
counteract gravity. 
<br />
<br />In 1929, the astronomer Edwin Hubble, for whom the space
<br />
telescope is named, discovered that the universe was
<br />
expanding - from the primeval explosion called the Big
<br />
Bang, scientists would learn. In that picture, gravity
<br />
would slow the expansion and, possibly, reverse it at a
<br />
far-off time. Einstein abandoned lambda as unnecessary and
<br />
called it a blunder. 
<br />
<br />Six years ago, however, two supernova groups - one led by
<br />
Dr. Perlmutter and the other by several scientists,
<br />
including Drs. Filippenko and Riess - found that cosmic
<br />
expansion was speeding up rather than slowing. The evidence
<br />
was that distant supernovas, swept up in some sort of
<br />
cosmic repulsion, were farther away than they would
<br />
otherwise be and therefore appeared dimmer. 
<br />
<br />Lambda was reborn, but astronomers still had little
<br />
information on whether the antigravity force was truly
<br />
constant. The latest results suggest, within the accuracy
<br />
of the measurements, at least, that something like
<br />
Einstein's cosmological constant is indeed at work. 
<br />
<br />&quot;His greatest blunders are our greatest ideas,&quot; Dr. Sean M.
<br />
Carroll, a cosmologist at the University of Chicago, said.
<br />
&quot;It is a triumph of general relativity.&quot; 
<br />
<br />Einstein's theory says nothing about why the energy of the
<br />
cosmological constant, or anything else, should be filling
<br />
space in the first place, Dr. Carroll said. Theorists have
<br />
turned to explanations as bizarre as parallel universes
<br />
that exert an influence on our own or extra unseen
<br />
dimensions in the fabric of space. 
<br />
<br />Dr. Carroll said the supernova findings might raise the
<br />
stock of certain ideas that have emerged from string
<br />
theory, which assumes that fundamental physics is a
<br />
manifestation of minuscule strings that vibrate in an
<br />
11-dimensional space. String theorists have calculated what
<br />
they call cosmic &quot;landscapes,&quot; in which empty space
<br />
contains energy densities that resemble a cosmological
<br />
constant. 
<br />
<br />Because dark energy has never been directly detected and
<br />
all these explanations are so bizarre, a few scientists say
<br />
the ultimate explanation might be something else entirely. 
<br />
<br />Others conceded that there was a bit of a letdown that
<br />
nearly a century after Einstein invented the cosmological
<br />
constant nary a crack in his theory had turned up. 
<br />
<br />&quot;This gives me a sinking feeling,&quot; Dr. Max Tegmark of the
<br />
University of Pennsylvania said. &quot;My nightmare is that
<br />
we're going to be forever stuck with this puzzle.&quot;
