Wei Dai:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm not a fan of the &quot;all possible interpretations&quot; approach. First the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence of all possible objects can be deduced from a simplicity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumption, so the &quot;all possible interpretations&quot; approach is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessary. Second I don't think the subjective experience of an observer is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessarily open to interpretation. We don't know what it feels like to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; someone else, but that doesn't mean there is no matter of fact about what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it feels like to be that person.
</em><br />
<br />Thinking about interpretations brought me to the all-universes position!
<br />
You may remember the early stages of the rumination in in Mind Children,
<br />
where I discussed possible beings in Fourier and other transforms of
<br />
normal space, each transform being a different interpretation and an
<br />
independent universe, for which the others were merely background noise.
<br />
The interpretation route connects a lot of possible worlds to our
<br />
present experience, and opens the possibility of seeing some of
<br />
them.  I imagined a gadget that, as you turned a knob, scanned through
<br />
a large number of possible transforms, say of the sun.  Most of the
<br />
setting would show noise, but just possibly you find a transform where
<br />
intelligent beings had evolved like the ones I postulated in
<br />
the Fourier domain.  (Visual and audio interfaces to simulators and
<br />
video games already do this in a premeditated way, allowing
<br />
us to interpret confusing electron motions in a handful of silicon bits
<br />
as the exciting life of the Super Mario Brothers.)
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Attribution of subjective  experience is a festering issue for those
<br />
of us who presume to assemble messes of inanimate components into
<br />
robots,
<br />
and then wish to claim the results have a subjective life on the basis
<br />
of internal models that allow the robots to discuss their experiences,
<br />
goals, likes and dislikes just like conventionally grown persons.
<br />
<br />On the one hand, an engineer who completely understands a robot has no
<br />
need to attribute subjectivity to it, since she can fully explain, and
<br />
even predict, everything the robot does from a mechanistic model
<br />
of the designed interaction of its parts. 
<br />
<br />On the other hand, normal folks interacting with the robot, which is
<br />
built to act like normal people, will instinctively attribute
<br />
feelings to it, especially when the robot discusses how it feels
<br />
(and asks them how they feel, updating its models of them on the basis
<br />
of the conversations).  And in its own mind (when it is interpreted
<br />
as having one) it believes it has feelings, and for that matter that
<br />
it has beliefs.  Just ask it.
<br />
<br />If you're so inclined, you can laugh this anthropomorphic
<br />
&quot;subjective life&quot; interpretation of the robot's behavior, which is
<br />
explained more accurately by the engineer's purely mechanical
<br />
interpretation.  Many AI critics say just that about any possible
<br />
computer AI.
<br />
<br />Now suppose an alien super-engineer lands near you.  It takes out its
<br />
ultra volume-scanning camera, and gets an atomic-res snapshot of all
<br />
your many parts, inside and out.  From the scan, and its knowledge of
<br />
physics, it deduces a precise mechanical model of your behavior.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From analysing the model, it deduces that directing the odd
</em><br />
sequence of noises at you: &quot;please bring me that refreshing glass of
<br />
water if you would be so kind&quot; will make you, by a predictable
<br />
mechanical chain of cause and effect among your parts, supply
<br />
fusion fuel for its vehicle.  It would laugh at anyone who suggested
<br />
an unnecessary and sloppy subjective interpretation to your actions,
<br />
which are explained much more precisely by its totally mechanical
<br />
interpretation of what you are.
<br />
<br /><br />The only satisfactory way I've found out of this and related
<br />
confusions is to accept subjectivity as an interpretation or
<br />
attribution like beauty or value (or computation or belief).  But,
<br />
when one attributes subjectivity to an entity one may grant it the
<br />
ability to make its own attributions.  And then it can attribute
<br />
subjectivity to itself.  It may not really think, but it thinks it
<br />
does.
<br />
<br />By the same reasoning, beings in the many universes may not
<br />
really exist, but they think they do.
<br />
<br />i.e. existence itself is an attribution.
