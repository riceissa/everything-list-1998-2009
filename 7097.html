Hi everyone (in this world and all relevantly similar ones :-),
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I like the solution to the Induction / Dragon / Exploding Cow problem that I
<br />
see in work by Malcolm, Standish, Tegmark, and Schmidhuber. So I forwarded
<br />
references to Alexander Pruss, whose dissertation raises the Induction
<br />
Objection to modal realism. The full context is on my blog at
<br />
<a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/knowinghumans?p=8">http://blog.360.yahoo.com/knowinghumans?p=8</a>.  I'm interested in how the
<br />
folks on this list would respond to Pruss's most recent comment, below.  Can
<br />
anyone recommend a primer on probability in transfinite contexts like ours?
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
--------------------------------
<br />
Remember that I am working in David Lewis's framework. Each world is 
<br />
a physical object: a bunch of matter, connected together 
<br />
spatiotemporally. So I do not need to work with specifications, but 
<br />
with concrete chunks of stuff. There is nothing further illuminating 
<br />
to be said in a lewisian context, really, about what makes two 
<br />
concrete chunks of stuff the same chunk, is there?
<br />
<br />That said, I am making an assumption that there is only one copy of 
<br />
each world. I suppose one could recover the &quot;measure&quot; the authors 
<br />
you cite have if you suppose that there is a copy of each world for 
<br />
every arrangement-description of it. But I do not see why one would 
<br />
suppose that.
<br />
<br />In the Lewisian setting, it is intuitively plausible that the 
<br />
probability that I exist in w1 should equal the probability that I 
<br />
exist in w2, as long as w1 and w2 contain intelligent observers in 
<br />
equal numbers. The &quot;measures&quot; from the authors you cite do not 
<br />
satisfy this criterion IF there is one world for a class of 
<br />
equivalent descriptions, as is going to be the case under the 
<br />
assumptions I am making.
<br />
<br />Most observers are going to be in worlds with a much higher 
<br />
cardinality of stuff than our world contains. Our world probably 
<br />
only has a finite number of particles. The cardinality of worlds 
<br />
just like ours until tomorrow but where \aleph_8 neutrons appear in 
<br />
San Francisco down-town, causing everything in the universe to 
<br />
collapse is much greater than the cardinality of regular worlds. In 
<br />
fact, I think what I am saying here will apply even on information- 
<br />
theoretic measures. (The one or two papers you linked to that I 
<br />
looked at made the assumption that there was a fixed maximum 
<br />
cardinality of things. But why assume that?)
<br />
---------------------------
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
For one thing, Pruss seems mistaken to assume that a possible world consists
<br />
necessarily of matter in a connected spacetime. (I think he inherits this
<br />
mistake from Lewis, who uses spatiotemporal connectedness rather than causal
<br />
connectedness to define worlds, because Lewis wants to explain/define
<br />
causality instead of making it a primitive.)  It seems better to define a
<br />
possible world as a causal closure than as a spatiotemporal closure.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
But the main problem perhaps is that Pruss misses (or disagrees with?) the
<br />
point that in the information-theoretic paradigm for specifying possible
<br />
worlds, the number of worlds with unobserved/unobservable irregularities
<br />
will vastly outnumber the ones with the observed irregularities like his
<br />
example, even if those irregular worlds vastly outnumber the lucky few
<br />
worlds that are like ours and have no irregularities whatsoever, even
<br />
unobserved/unobservable ones.
