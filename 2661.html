<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Prove&quot; is a strong word.  I don't think you can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prove that we perceive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3-space...
</em><br />
I guess it depends on what you mean by &quot;perceive&quot;.
<br />
<br />If I develop software that behaves a certain way in
<br />
3-space combining observations, a plan, and then
<br />
demonstrating an action in that 3-space, I'd say that
<br />
system perceives in 3-space.
<br />
<br />If I take a black box and train it to do the same
<br />
thing, without knowing anything about how the blackbox
<br />
internals are implemented, I'd still say that system
<br />
perceives 3-space.
<br />
<br />In the pleasure example, one can perceive pleasurable
<br />
acts in this realm. They can do so without being
<br />
limited to experiencing pleasure in this realm. I
<br />
would argue that pleasure is not a law limited to the
<br />
physical realm.
<br />
<br />Likewise, one can perceive in 3-space without being of
<br />
it. What I mean here is that we may observe or deduce
<br />
physical facilities (in the human body) for perceiving
<br />
3-space. It does not mean one perceives 3-space as a
<br />
result of, and only-because-of that facility.
<br />
<br />You might observe these things or facilities (physical
<br />
mechanisms) and assume that's how such abilities can
<br />
be. I'd argue these things are apparent, and provide
<br />
an interface between one realm and another.
<br />
<br />One might consider software operating in a computer.
<br />
<br />The machine is the mechanism used to animate the
<br />
software. The software's operation implies and
<br />
expresses a logical (usually) intent of the
<br />
programmer. So we have three layers of expression. One
<br />
is mechanical, one is descriptive (software itself),
<br />
and one is the actual intent of the programmer (what
<br />
it does). We can say that the entity formed at the 3rd
<br />
layer (what it does) is not bound to what lies beneath
<br />
it. We could say (similarly to what some sculptors
<br />
say) that it was always there (what it does), and the
<br />
software and the machine it runs on, simply revealed
<br />
it. I would further say, that not only is the act of
<br />
writing the software and running it simply revealing
<br />
something that was already there, but it reveals it
<br />
*here* (physical) from somewhere else (non-physical
<br />
realm).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; you can only observe behavior (careful!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are you assuming
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3-space in which to observe). 
</em><br />
<br />What is it to &quot;observe&quot; in a non-temporal realm?
<br />
<br />If a behavior is expressed non-temporally, you have a
<br />
static picture (crude approximation). Then did the
<br />
person producing the behavior create that picture? Or
<br />
did they simply journey to a place where it already
<br />
existed? If so, why can't an observer do the same? If
<br />
he can, what is observation?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; On the other hand
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is plenty of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non-verbal as well as verbal evidence for pain and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pleasure (avoidance,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attraction...)
</em><br />
<br />I ment to say, that you may stimulate what is widely
<br />
considered pleasure in someone, and they might elect
<br />
to say that the stimulus is pleasurable.
<br />
<br />You might observe or deduce and test the apparent
<br />
physical mechanisms for that pleasure.
<br />
<br />What I am saying is that you can associate the two by
<br />
apparent cause and effect, but cannot prove the
<br />
physical mechanism is the reason for the pleasure
<br />
experienced by the consciousness of the person
<br />
stimulated.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  our thinking in this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  physical existence tends to express
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; things 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I can make no sense of these phrases.  You seem to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have in mind the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; monads of Leibnitz or Bertrand Russell.
</em><br />
<br />&quot;our thinking in *this* consciousness..&quot;
<br />
<br />I am using the term consciousness in terms of a
<br />
vehicle. So our thinking in *this* vehicle.
<br />
<br />In other words: 
<br />
<br />One's thoughts in a timeless-consciousness can be
<br />
organized as a temporal stream of descrete thought
<br />
frames...
<br />
<br />&quot;physical existence tends to express things..&quot;
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From a mystic standpoint, the physical realm is just
</em><br />
one place out of many, with it's own characteristics.
<br />
<br />One can take a a thing that is manifest in one place
<br />
one way, and bring it into the physical and have it
<br />
manifest another way.
<br />
<br />So in other words:
<br />
<br />Consciousness, normally timeless in expression, can be
<br />
manifest in the physical realm. In doing so (do to the
<br />
temporal nature of the physical realm) consciousness
<br />
tends to express temporally as well.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You seem to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have in mind the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; monads of Leibnitz or Bertrand Russell.
</em><br />
<br />I have no idea who those people are, nor do I have any
<br />
clue what a &quot;monad&quot; is. :)
