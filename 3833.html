<br />
One of the criticisms of no-collapse theories has always bothered me.
<br />
Some people say that the mystery of non-determinism in conventional
<br />
interpretations of QM is replaced by an equally baffling mystery in
<br />
no-collapse theories: why do I end up in *this* branch rather than
<br />
some other?
<br />
<br />The critics understand, I presume, that observers end up in all branches
<br />
asking themselves this question.  But they still seem to think there is
<br />
some mystery about the process, something that needs to be explained.
<br />
<br />I don't see what the mystery is.  We have often considered thought
<br />
experiments involving duplicating machines, which show the same
<br />
phenomenon.   A man walks into a duplicating machine and two men walk out,
<br />
each having equal claim to being the original.  Both ask this question:
<br />
&quot;Why did I end up as *this* person instead of the other one?&quot;
<br />
<br />Is that a question which needs an answer?  A question to which there
<br />
can be any answer?  I don't see it.  Each copy is guaranteed in advance
<br />
to be a continuation of the original.  There is no mystery, nothing
<br />
which needs to be explained, in the fact that each copy exists and has
<br />
separate consciousness.
<br />
<br />Traditionally, no-collapse models were also criticized on two other
<br />
grounds.  (I will ignore the complaint that the theory is inparsimonious
<br />
in its creation of multiple universes, because IMO this is more than
<br />
made up for by the simplicity of the theory.  Algorithmic complexity
<br />
theory teaches us that it is the size of the program that counts, not
<br />
the size of the data, and that is the measure we have used on this list.)
<br />
<br />One complaint is the non-uniqueness of the basis vectors for the
<br />
decomposition.  I think it is generally agreed today that this is solved
<br />
because in practice only one basis will give the vanishing of off-diagonal
<br />
elements in the density matrix, which corresponds to causally independent
<br />
worlds.  Ultimately this is due to the unexplained fact that the laws
<br />
of physics have a built-in concept of positional locality.  Locality
<br />
manifests itself in the dynamics of QM in such a way that natural basis
<br />
vectors correspond to well defined positions of macroscopic objects.
<br />
I think the paper of Tegmark's we discussed last month developed this
<br />
idea in more detail.
<br />
<br />The other critique is that the measure and probability functions are
<br />
introduced on a somewhat ad hoc basis.  I think this is still a valid
<br />
criticism.  We need to find some way to explain the MWI measure in similar
<br />
terms to how Schmidhuber explains it in the multiverse model.  He uses
<br />
the universal measure (sometimes), which can naturally be interpreted
<br />
as being proportional to the fraction of all countably-infinite size
<br />
programs which create the universe in question.  That is a very natural
<br />
and powerful explanation for measure, but nothing similar exists for the
<br />
MWI.  If there were an explanation for the MWI branch measures in terms
<br />
of a similar argument then I think this problem would be solved as well.
<br />
