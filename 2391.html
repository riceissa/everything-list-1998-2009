<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;does it?  At time T1 I was only multiplied by 2.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;You are right. But the universal dovetailer (UD) really multiply you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;by aleph_0, each belonging to 2^aleph_0 infinite computations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The key point is that the DU, which emulate all programs, build you again
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and again, and again ... and you cannot be aware of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the (rather big) delays between your (virtual) reconstitutions.
</em><br />
<br />Well, if your program is kept frozen between duplications, I agree that you 
<br />
won't notice the delays (although again I point out we're assuming that the 
<br />
flow of consciousness is real, which doesn't necessarily have to be the 
<br />
case).  But if the you endlessly duplicate frozen programs without 
<br />
restarting them, then you won't be able to restart them after aleph-0 
<br />
iterations...you must be restarting them after a finite number of 
<br />
iterations, or not restarting them at all.
<br />
<br />I suppose you could do an experiment where you create 2 copies of a frozen 
<br />
program, then restart 1...then create 4 copies of the frozen program, and 
<br />
restart 2...then create 8 copies of the frozen program, and restart 4...etc. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;In that case, if continuity of consciousness is real and identity is 
<br />
&quot;splittable&quot;, you could say that the odds are in favor of your &quot;next moment&quot; 
<br />
after freezing being one of the ones that took place after the largest 
<br />
number of iterations.
<br />
<br />However, you have to assume that restarted programs would have a way to tell 
<br />
which iteration they part of--maybe each would see a number in front of 
<br />
themselves, for example.  But even if this experiment could run 
<br />
indefinitely, no restarted copy would find that it had woken up on the 
<br />
&quot;aleph-0th iteration&quot;...the vast majority of restarted copies would simply 
<br />
find that the number in front of them was too large for their minds to fully 
<br />
comprehend, and thus their subjective experience would only diverge into a 
<br />
finite number of possibilities.
<br />
<br />My assumption here is that if you have two simulated universes containing 
<br />
identical simulated brains, and if the universes differ from each other but 
<br />
the states of the two brains do not diverge, then if I have the first-person 
<br />
experience associated with that brain I can't really say I'm &quot;in&quot; one 
<br />
universe or the other.  &quot;I&quot; am simply a pattern that has instances in each 
<br />
universe, but there is not really a true answer to which instance I am, at 
<br />
least not until after the two brain-simulations diverge.
<br />
<br />So even if the UD creates an infinite number of different simulated 
<br />
universes, it may still only create a finite number of possible &quot;successor 
<br />
moments&quot; to any given moment of experience...unless you believe that a 
<br />
successor moment can be arbitrarily more complex than the previous one, like 
<br />
a mouse-mind suddenly becoming a human mind.  This is not actually so 
<br />
implausible, but you have to go into details about what form you think a 
<br />
theory of consciousness/identity should be expected to take.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Have you read my post <a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m1726.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m1726.html</a>.
</em><br />
<br />I read it, but I'm still not clear on what you're saying--again, I think you 
<br />
need to make your assumptions about consciousness/identity more explicit.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Likewise, if it is possible to experience an infinite number of distinct
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;instants, then if I am duplicated at each instant, you could say that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;are 2^aleph_0 of me after I have experienced aleph_0 instants...but as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;long
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;as I have only experienced a finite number of instants, there will be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;only a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;finite number of me.  And I don't think it's possible to actually 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;experience
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;an infinite number of distinct instants, at least not if your mind is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;finite.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Like you, I don't think it is possible to experience an infinite number
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of distinct instants. But I belief that the probability of your *next*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;first person state depend on those infinite third person rebuilding made
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the DU.
</em><br />
<br />In the archive there was some discussion about what would happen if you had 
<br />
an experiment where a coin would be flipped, and if it landed heads you 
<br />
would later be duplicated, but if it landed tails you would not.  The 
<br />
question there was, would your subjective probability of seeing heads be 1/2 
<br />
or 2/3? (some people also suggested that this experiment is a good argument 
<br />
against continuity of consciousness over time...maybe all that exists are 
<br />
various moments of experience, so there is a 1/2 chance of observing the 
<br />
coin landing heads but a 2/3 chance of remembering it landing heads in the 
<br />
past).
<br />
<br />Are you saying that you support the 2/3 view, meaning that the probability 
<br />
of my &quot;next moment&quot; depends on a kind of integral over all possible future 
<br />
histories?
