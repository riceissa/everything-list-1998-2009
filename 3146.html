<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From: Marchal &lt;marchal.domain.name.hidden&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I recall that I am still waiting for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you showing a flaw in the UDA (the &quot;Joel&quot; version).
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually I am still waiting to see the full UDA argument!  I don't think 
<br />
you ever posted more than bits and pieces of it, without the precise 
<br />
definitions that I requested, and you referred people to papers written in 
<br />
French.  But I'll check ...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;But here you betraye yourself:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ... since it's a nonsensical belief.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;You admit not having read the &quot;reasons/explanations&quot; we propose because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you &quot;know&quot; at the start &quot;it's a nonsensical belief&quot;!!!
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I read everything that gets posted on the list, except perhaps for 
<br />
parts of some long posts that are not in direct reply to me.  I just haven't 
<br />
seen any explanations that make any sense.  I have seen only people 
<br />
restating that they believe it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;But I am still waiting *you* explain me how in the W M duplication, you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;can both still believe in comp and pretend the question of what I will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;feel is nonsense.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did explain my view, check the archive.  But don't say that I believe 
<br />
in what you call &quot;comp&quot;.  I never claimed to believe it, mainly because I 
<br />
have yet to see a clear definition of it.  I believe in computationalism, 
<br />
meaning that computations (effectively) give rise to consciousness.  The 
<br />
word &quot;survive&quot; appears nowhere in any definition of computationalism I might 
<br />
give.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Oh yes I remember, you don't see the difference between 1 and 3 person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;point of view ...
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More precisely, I don't see any 1st person view, other than as a 
<br />
description of what an observer-moment experiences.  But the set of all such 
<br />
experiences is what the objective (which you might call 3rd person, but I 
<br />
don't) view describes.  The objective truth has all the information, which 
<br />
we should guess as best we can.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Indeed I see you say that words like &quot;me&quot; or &quot;you&quot; are mere definition.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I believe the contrary, from the 1 person point of view, the word &quot;me&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is not even definissable.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You say &quot;me&quot; (and thus, the 1st person concept) can't be defined.  Maybe 
<br />
you have some idea of what you mean by it, but if you can't define it, 
<br />
there's no way you could ever convey that information to another person.  In 
<br />
that case, you might as well stop posting.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;That is what makes grandma psychology not really intuitive in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;multiplication settings, but that is why I replace it eventually by the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;self-reference logics where the consistency of comp immortality (and so at 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;least the sensicalness) is beyond doubt.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have little doubt that you pull some questionable tricks in reaching 
<br />
that conclusion, but here we get into the technical part that you have never 
<br />
fully explained on this list, I believe.  No doubt it would take a lot of 
<br />
time and effort to follow all the technical details.  So I can't refute it 
<br />
now, but neither will I take your word for granted on the matter.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Of course I have infinite doubt about that immortality, but I have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;no doubt comp entails it logicaly/arithmeticaly.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps it does, but if so the problem could well be in your very 
<br />
definition of &quot;comp&quot;.  You have never given a precise definition, but you 
<br />
always have the word &quot;survive&quot; in there, so maybe when you translate the 
<br />
implications of &quot;comp&quot; into precise mathematics you in effect are 
<br />
effectively assuming that conclusion from the start.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;About your saying you are sane, at first i take it for an attempt
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;being comical. Your last answer to Hal Finney is really uncomical.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Scientist always doubt ...
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's not meant to be comical.  Scientists always doubt that they really 
<br />
have the complete right answer, but one the other hand, it is much more 
<br />
certain to be able to identify a wrong answer.  Newtonian mechanics is 
<br />
certainly wrong, but our QM may not be the whole story.  (Yet I have little 
<br />
doubt that QM is basically right, for that matter.)  FIN is certainly wrong.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Also I (re)read you implementation paper where, as I said, you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;definitely and admittedly don't have solved the implementation problem,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;but then why do you injuriate us with seemingly certainties?
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where do I say I definitely haven't solved it?  It's just that I haven't 
<br />
proven it's a solution, nor have I yet gained enough evidence to trust it.  
<br />
On the other hand, it hasn't been falsified either, and I've tried although 
<br />
not as much as I would like to try.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I'm also less and less sure bayesian reasoning works in our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mathematically infinite context ...
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why?  I will, for purposes of this argument, grant one concession 
<br />
however.  To compare FIN vs. non-FIN, it is not acceptable to make the two 
<br />
categories of possible observations be something like A=&quot;I am younger than 
<br />
N&quot; and B=&quot;I am older than that&quot;, where N = some arbritrary age that may 
<br />
(perhaps secretly) be based on my own such as twice my age.  That would 
<br />
obviously be cheating to reject the FIN.  I do not cheat.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand if a more objective standard is used, like
<br />
A = &quot;I am younger than the 'thermodynamically unlikely' age for my species&quot;, 
<br />
or even better like A =&quot;I am young enough to calculate (and store) my own 
<br />
age (perhaps normalized so that the typical lifetime of my species is set to 
<br />
1)&quot;, and B= the opposite, then Bayesian reasoning is perfectly valid and 
<br />
appropriate in this context.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the FIN were (cough) true, then people using this reasoning would 
<br />
usually (100% of the time in fact) be older than that, so it would almost 
<br />
always (100% in fact) work, except for a set of effective probability 0.  If 
<br />
the FIN is not true, it would usually work, but not quite 100%.  So I am 
<br />
erring on the side of letting very old people believe the FIN.  Luckily I 
<br />
have other arguments against it.
