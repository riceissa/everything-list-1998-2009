<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     stream of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;      &gt; consciousness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     There's the rub.  Almost all my OMs *do not* include consciously
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     remembering being me (or anyone). And if you suppose there is an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     *unconscious* memory component of an OM then there's a problem with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     what it means to have an unconscious part of consciousness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Well, how do you maintain a sense of being you in normal life?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Certainly not consciously.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;If you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; are absent-mindedly staring at a tree you at least have a sense that you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; have been staring at the tree, rather than drowning in the ocean a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; moment ago.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have that sense transiently - and its isolated and unconnected to the OM
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in which I was staring at the tree, except through the content it shares,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; i.e. my staring at a tree - the one as perception and the other as memory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of a perception.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;You are also aware that you haven't grown 10cm taller or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; suddenly changed sex - that is, you would immediately be aware of these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; things had they happened, even though you are not actively thinking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; about them or their absence.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;So a bland sameness from moment to moment
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; constitutes a sense of memory and continuity of identity,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What's a &quot;sense of memory&quot;?  Is it conscious?  I'm not conscious of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one.  I'd say it's the default model we use when we think, &quot;Am I the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person I was a few minutes ago?  Don't feel and different.  Must be.&quot;
</em><br />
<br /><br />It seems you are using &quot;consciousness&quot; in a more specific sense than I am. I
<br />
am just referring to the process of having any experience - of not being
<br />
unconscious.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;since an OM
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that deviated substantially from this would either not be considered as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a successor OM or immediately alert you that something strange had
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; happened.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But as you argued earlier OMs don't communicate.  They are not related
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; except by their conscious content.  So an OM never has knowledge of another
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OM against which to measure its deviation.  One might experience an OM whose
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; content was, &quot;I'm a different person than I was ten minutes ago because I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; now notice a discontinuity in my memory.&quot; but I'm not sure even that would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; break my feeling of being me.
</em><br />
<br /><br />No, there are obviously multiple factors involved, from memory to continuity
<br />
of perception and perhaps even a primary sense of identity separate from
<br />
these other cues. But if at any moment these factors have zero conscious
<br />
activity, they could in theory be eliminated, although they might need to be
<br />
brought into play again in an instant.
<br />
<br />My point is that, at least as I experience it, consciousness, the inner
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; narrative we tell ourselves, is far too weak, to lacking in content, to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; create a chain of experience.  Memory cannot do it because one is rarely,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciously remembering anything.  What creates the chain is something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unconscious - something not observed and so not part of an OM.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Unconscious factors affecting our sense of continuity of identity must do it
<br />
through affecting conscious factors. Suppose some unconscious factor X were
<br />
partly responsible for placing my last second of consciousness in sequence.
<br />
That means that if X had been different, my conscious experience would have
<br />
been different. I can't claim that X plays a role while maintaining that I
<br />
would not have noticed anything different without X. You could use that as a
<br />
definition of unconscious: if it were removed, you would not notice any
<br />
change.
<br />
<br />Of course you can deny that there is any chain and think of it more like
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; network of paths with marked stepping stones.  Once in awhile there's a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stone that's marked, &quot;Remember you're Brent Meeker.&quot; and every path that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; includes one of these is &quot;me&quot;, even if the path also includes some marked
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Remember you're Stathis Papaioannou.&quot;
</em><br />
<br /><br />How could you tell the difference, from the inside, between such a path and
<br />
a chain?
