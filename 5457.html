I'm not sure I understand the argument, so here are some comments and
<br />
questions:
<br />
<br />Wei Dai writes:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Consider all possible worlds consistent with your memories and current 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiences. In other words, all possible worlds that contain at least one 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer with memories and current experiences exactly identical to yours. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Are there more than one such world?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (yes)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is every one of these worlds isomorphic to some mathematical structure?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (How do you define &quot;mathematical structure&quot;?)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A set class.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (then yes)
</em><br />
<br />I think a set class is intended to be the most general mathematical
<br />
structure possible, right?  There is nothing more general?  And that is
<br />
the point of this proposed definition for the set of possible worlds,
<br />
that it would be the most general mathematical structure possible.
<br />
<br />This line of reasoning is then more consistent with Tegmark's approach
<br />
than to Schmidhuber's, who suggests that universes are isomorphic to
<br />
computations.
<br />
<br />One thing I've never understood about this approach is exactly how a
<br />
computation is considered to be a set.  Take a 1D cellular automaton
<br />
for example as a simple computational model, with a specified set of
<br />
rules and particular initial conditions.  How would its computational
<br />
trace be expressed as a set?  (Or use a different computational model
<br />
if even simpler.)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What criteria would you use to decide which of these possible worlds is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; actual, given that they are all consistent with your memories and current 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiences?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (more observations, experiments)
</em><br />
<br />First, what does it mean for a possible world to be actual?  Does it
<br />
mean, that is &quot;the&quot; world we live in?  Or could it include the notion
<br />
of actual worlds different from the ones we are experiencing?
<br />
<br />For an example of the latter, consider the MWI where a binary measurement
<br />
has been made but I have not yet been made aware of the result.  Then
<br />
there are two universes which have split, both are actual, my mental
<br />
state is exactly the same in both, but I might consider that I am only
<br />
living in one of the two.
<br />
<br />Second, what is the Bayesian answer getting at with more observations and
<br />
experiments?  You go on to critique the answer, but what was the thrust
<br />
of it in the first place?  What kind of observations and experiments
<br />
would he make, and how would that determine which were possible and
<br />
which were actual?
<br />
<br />This relates to my first question as follows.  If you are asking which
<br />
world we &quot;actually&quot; live in, one source of uncertainty about possible
<br />
worlds is that we only have a finite amount of information about
<br />
the world.  For example, there are possible worlds where there is a
<br />
bird flying overhead right now, and some where there is not.  By going
<br />
outside I can narrow down the possibilities.
<br />
<br />But if you are asking which worlds are &quot;actual&quot; and which are only
<br />
&quot;possible&quot;, that is a philosophical question.  Some people believe
<br />
the other worlds of the MWI are actual and some are only possible, and
<br />
if this is ever decided it will be by very different means than going
<br />
outside and looking for birds.  It will be a philosophical argument,
<br />
one which ultimately will depend on observations (because that's all
<br />
we have to start with) but whose nature is quite different from going
<br />
outside and looking at the sky.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ok, but after every new observation or experiment, there will still be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more than one possible world that is consistent with the new emperical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; result, right?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (yes)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So then what?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (apply Bayes's rule)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Where does the prior come from?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (???)
</em><br />
<br />When you say, so then what, what are you asking?  Simple observation lets
<br />
me narrow down the number of possible worlds.  There's no argument about
<br />
that, right?  I can rule out any world inconsistent with my observations.
<br />
<br />But you, or the Bayesian, want to go further, and set up a probability
<br />
distribution over possible worlds, is that it?  That is the goal of
<br />
Bayes rule.  But to apply that you need a prior, and the Bayesian is
<br />
momentarily stumped.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Do you assign a non-zero prior to the class of all sets being the actual 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (yes)
</em><br />
<br />So here the &quot;actual&quot; world is larger than just the one (apparent) world
<br />
that I observe, right?  Now you are raising the possibility that, in
<br />
effect, an infinite number of worlds exist?  In speaking of the class
<br />
of all sets being the actual world, you mean that there would be an
<br />
infinite number of apparent worlds, each one corresponding to, what,
<br />
a set?  A class?  Basically the Tegmarkian concept, except where he
<br />
speaks of axixomatizable mathematical structures, you are generalizing
<br />
even beyond that?
<br />
<br />This philosophical proposal, while perhaps novel and initially unlikely
<br />
to the Bayesian, cannot be rejected out of hand, hence he has to assign
<br />
a non-zero prior probability to it, right?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Pragmatically, how does that differ from assigning a prior of 1 for the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; class of all sets?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (What do you mean by &quot;pragmatically&quot;?)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I mean are there any circumstances in which you'd act differently if you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assigned a prior of 1 instead?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (no)
</em><br />
<br />This is the part which really confuses me.  Assigning a prior of 1 would
<br />
mean that you are certain that the actual world is the class of all sets.
<br />
Assigning a prior of one in a billion would mean that you thought it
<br />
very unlikely.  Yet these two possibilites won't make any difference
<br />
in behavior?  Why not?
<br />
<br />Which of these two things are you saying: (A) there is no difference
<br />
in behavior no matter what priors you hold; or (B) there is something
<br />
special about the prior probability of the class of all sets being the
<br />
actual world, that for that one special case it makes no difference how
<br />
you will behave whether its probability is 1 or 1/1000000000?
<br />
<br />Neither of these is immediately plausible to me, but before breaking my
<br />
mind on one of them, I should know which one it is.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So why not just assume that the actual world is the class of all sets?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (My principles of reasoning do not allow me to do so.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you go back and look at how those principles of reasoning were derived 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or justified, it was on the basis of simplicity and avoiding absurd 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; actions (&quot;absurd&quot; being defined by intuition or common sense). The 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumption that the actual world is the class of all sets is equally 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; justified on the basis of avoiding absurd actions and is simpler than 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; having a prior over possible worlds, so why not?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (...)
</em><br />
<br />I can't speak to this part without understanding better why there is no
<br />
difference in behavior whether the class of all sets is assumed to be
<br />
the world or not.
