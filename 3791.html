<em class="quotelev1">&gt; now on my Everything mailing list. I wonder what that means... Anyway,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; welcome!
</em><br />
<br />Thanks. One of my motivations here is to a) learn, b) have a chance to 
<br />
explain what I have learned (which helps to learn), and c) avoid 
<br />
politics and policies and similar issues completely. (Unless there is 
<br />
talk of funding a National Everything Initiative, I think it's safe to 
<br />
say that politics won't enter!). The first couple of years, especially 
<br />
the first year, of Cypherpunks was heavy on learning and explaining, but 
<br />
politics was of course important. The last several years have been 
<br />
recyclings of older ideas...this can happen to any list, of course.
<br />
<br />I've known of the Everything list, and of course the 
<br />
Everett/DeWitt/Niven/Wheeler/Egan/Tegmark ideas for a while...I remember 
<br />
reading Larry Niven's &quot;All the Myriad Ways&quot; around 1970 or so. We used 
<br />
to sit around in the early 70s debating the Everett model, which a 
<br />
couple of science fiction writers were making much of, and which had 
<br />
gained new popularity after Bryce DeWitt dusted off the idea and began 
<br />
publishing a lot on it. (DeWitt assigned much credit to his student, RN 
<br />
Graham, and even called the MWI the &quot;Everett-Wheeler-Graham&quot; theory. Way 
<br />
too charitable to Graham, I think.)
<br />
<br />I learned of your list a while back, but wasn't super-interested in what 
<br />
I thought (and partially still think) is a fanciful idea, akin to the 
<br />
late David Lewis' &quot;plurality of worlds&quot; philosophy (that everything we 
<br />
can imagine must have reality). Saul Kripke's &quot;possible worlds&quot; work was 
<br />
more interesting, as it is closely linked to linguistics and AI and 
<br />
predictions about the future (&quot;If Oracle were to announce bad earnings 
<br />
tomorrow, then this is what would probably happen,&quot; a possible worlds 
<br />
&quot;story&quot; which is of course very close to some discussions of alternate 
<br />
_presents_. In fact, no different, except more practical.)
<br />
<br />Enough of this digression. I'll answer your question:
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I remember your post on the cypherpunks list about category theory, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have to admit I didn't pay it much attention since it didn't seem very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relevent at the time.
</em><br />
<br />I posted to that list just to let folks know I was exploring a new area. 
<br />
And because there actually be implications for areas of interest...I 
<br />
mentioned these in that post.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I guess this is my second chance to learn about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; category theory, so there are some questions for you.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Suppose I had the time for only one book, which would you recommend?
</em><br />
<br />I would start with Lee Smolin's &quot;Three Roads to Quantum Gravity.&quot; This 
<br />
is not about category theory, but provides a lot of the motivation. He 
<br />
discusses many of the points that I allude to. In bullet form:
<br />
<br />-- that we are embedded in the universe, that there is no &quot;omniscient 
<br />
observer who can see all of space-time&quot;
<br />
<br />-- that certain pieces of information are forever beyond our ability to 
<br />
see. These turn out to be important for why accelerating objects see a 
<br />
&quot;temperature&quot; of space, isomorphic to the temperature seen by a 
<br />
spacecraft hovering over a black hole expending fuel at the same rate. 
<br />
(I can explain separately if there's interest.)
<br />
<br />-- that space appears to be discrete at the Planck scale (a la the &quot;It 
<br />
from bit&quot; discreteness outlined by Wheeler 30 years ago, later by 
<br />
Fredkin, Toffoli, and others, and more recently by Wolfram)--this 
<br />
discreteness has not been proved, and may not be testable for many 
<br />
decades, but all three of the routes Smolin outlines essentially predict 
<br />
that space-time is not an infinitely differentiable (smooth) manifold 
<br />
made of real numbers: the holographic/Crane/Susskind route, the loop 
<br />
gravity/spin foam route, and the currently much popularized 
<br />
string/M-brane Schwartz/Witten/etc. route.
<br />
<br />-- that _relationships_ are more important than objects (which fits very 
<br />
closely with category theory, as I'll explain below)
<br />
<br />-- that the proper logic of understanding cosmology, given some or all 
<br />
of the above points, is not the &quot;omniscient&quot; logic of 
<br />
Aristotelian/Boolean logic (&quot;A or not-A, nothing in between&quot;), but a 
<br />
more general form of Intuitionist (bad political connotations for many!) 
<br />
Brouwer/Heyting logic, which also happens to be the natural logic of a 
<br />
topos, a category with certain properties of logic attached to it.
<br />
<br />Smolin spends a few pages discussing topos theory, but in such light 
<br />
detail that anyone not tuned in to spotting the phrase &quot;topos theory&quot; 
<br />
might even miss it. He refers to Fotini Markopoulou, a Greek woman who 
<br />
collaborates a lot with him and with the other biggies of the &quot;loop 
<br />
gravity/spin foam&quot; school, e.g., Rovelli, Ashketar, Baez, etc.
<br />
<br />If you want a straight intro to category theory, with none of the stuff 
<br />
about cosmology, space-time, and such, the Lawvere and Schanuel book 
<br />
&quot;Conceptual Mathematics: A first introduction to categories&quot; is the book 
<br />
I recommend.
<br />
<br />But perhaps before reading a book, surfing the Web is better. There are 
<br />
many tutorials and primers, and one can read a bunch of them to get the 
<br />
lay of the land. I've mentioned John Baez's site a couple of times. 
<br />
Chris Hillman has a good &quot;Categorical Primer,&quot; but it's incomplete. Some 
<br />
authors, like Barr and Wells, have even put their books up on the Web.
<br />
<br />Reading any of the main books will not show many _apparent_ links to 
<br />
Tegmark, Schmidhuber, etc. The same applies to reading Kleene's 1952 
<br />
opus, &quot;Metamathematics,&quot; or Lang's &quot;Algebra,&quot; or any math book. None of 
<br />
these will appear to be closely relate tp theories of everything, or 
<br />
multiverses. One has to read between the lines. For example, when 
<br />
reading about categories, think of Tegmark's diagram showing links 
<br />
between &quot;Abelian Fields,&quot; &quot;Manifolds with Tensors Fields,&quot; etc.
<br />
<br />A categorical approach is cleaner and shows the morphisms more clearly.
<br />
<br />Take a look at category theory for about 2 days (of 2-3 hours a day) and 
<br />
then look at Tegmark's paper again.
<br />
<br />(This is just for the formalisms he talks about, not the underlying 
<br />
philosophical point.)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Also,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can you elaborate a bit more on the motivation behind category theory? 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was it invented, and what problems does it solve?
</em><br />
<br />OK, on to some history.
<br />
<br />Mathematics had two great waves of consolidation and formalization in 
<br />
the past century. Around 1920 much had been done with symmetries, 
<br />
embodied in group theory. Much was known about integers and even the 
<br />
real number line, embodied in the work of Stephen Dedekind in the 19th 
<br />
century. Also, G. Peano, etc. This was mostly the algebra of rings and 
<br />
fields. (On mostly separate tracks, a lot of work in topology, logic, 
<br />
set theory.)
<br />
<br />Two associates/students of David Hilbert largely gave us our modern 
<br />
outlook on math in the 1920s: Emil Artin and Emmy Noether. In 
<br />
influential lectures in Germany during the 1920s they consolidated all 
<br />
of the bits and pieces about groups, rings, fields, modules, and vector 
<br />
spaces into a coherent, axiomatized whole. Others in this milieu were 
<br />
Herman Weyl, John von Neumann (different country, but still same 
<br />
milieu), David Birkhoff (in the U.S.), and others. One of those who 
<br />
transcribed Artin's and Noether's lectures was van der Waerden, who 
<br />
wrote an enormously influential book, &quot;Moderne Algebra,&quot; published 
<br />
around 1930-32 in German. Van der Waerden established the 
<br />
&quot;groups-rings-fields&quot; structure of nearly all of the abstract algebra 
<br />
books to come later, such as G. Birkhoff (David's son) and Mac Lane's 
<br />
1941 text in English, Jacobson's early 50s text, Mac Lane and Birkhoff's 
<br />
more advanced text, Herstein's &quot;Topics in Algebra,&quot; and so on. One of 
<br />
Emil Artin's students (both Artin and Noether moved to the U.S. in the 
<br />
early 1930s, part of the enormous wave of refugees from Germany and 
<br />
Europe) was Serge Lang, author of a dozen or more &quot;classics.&quot; (Warning: 
<br />
Lang's books are dry, but complete.)
<br />
<br />OK, so that was the first great wave of consolidation in &quot;real&quot; 
<br />
mathematics. (By &quot;real&quot; I mean the stuff mathematicians actually use 
<br />
every day...there were of course consolidations in foundational areas 
<br />
happening at about the same time, via Russell, Whitehead, Godel, Curry, 
<br />
Church, Kleene, etc.)
<br />
<br />This was the &quot;abstract math&quot; we all know and love.
<br />
<br />Around 1940 there was much work on applying algebra to topology, e.g., 
<br />
counting holes in surfaces, seeing which loops drawn on a surface could 
<br />
be contracted to points and which could not. Two of those working on 
<br />
this were Samuel Eilenberg, a young emigre from Poland (dubbed 
<br />
&quot;S-squared, P-squared, for &quot;Smart Sammy the Polish Prodigy&quot;) and an 
<br />
equally young Saunders Mac Lane, the same as the author of the Birkhoff 
<br />
and Mac Lane basic text on algebra.
<br />
<br />The combination of algebra and topology is of course algebraic topology.
<br />
<br />What Eilenberg and Mac Lane realized is that certain _structures_ were 
<br />
present in both algebra and topology, and that _structure-preserving 
<br />
maps_  were showing up all over the place. For example, deformations of 
<br />
an object would have the same structure as algebraic transformations. 
<br />
Even examples like counting holes in surfaces were in a deep sense 
<br />
isomorphic to counting things in purely symbolic or algebraic structures.
<br />
<br />They began thinking about what the abstract ideas were, and came up 
<br />
with  the core ideas:
<br />
<br />-- that maps, or arrows, or morphisms go between objects
<br />
<br />-- that the arrrows themselves can be studied, and that arrows between 
<br />
the arrows (morphisms of morphisms) are interesting to look at. (The 
<br />
arrows between arrows, or the morphisms between morphisms, are usually 
<br />
called &quot;functors.&quot;)
<br />
<br />(Digression: For example, look at _languages_. Words in English are 
<br />
mapped into their plural form in various ways, usually by adding an &quot;s.&quot; 
<br />
Sometimes in other ways (&quot;oxen&quot;). The morphisms between words can be 
<br />
compared (mapped) to morphisms between words in other languages, e.g., 
<br />
Chinese, German. There are functors going between plural formation in 
<br />
English and plural formation in German. And between other structures in 
<br />
each of these languages. In this sense, the &quot;structures&quot; of different 
<br />
languages can be diagrammed and compared in a more interesting way than 
<br />
simply talking about them or just by compiling descriptions.)
<br />
<br />-- that we can often take the set of objects and morphisms and view them 
<br />
as a &quot;picture&quot; (a model, sort of) of relationships
<br />
<br />-- that &quot;natural transformations&quot; are ways of &quot;sliding&quot; this picture 
<br />
into other categories, other domains
<br />
<br />-- critical to much of category theory is the analysis of diagrams, 
<br />
showing arrows from A to B, or A --&gt; B, arrows from C to D, etc., and 
<br />
then figuring out what is needed to make such diagrams commute (as an 
<br />
example). This leads to things I won't try to explain here (for space, 
<br />
and because I'm not the best person to look to for such explanations) 
<br />
such as &quot;pushouts&quot; and &quot;pullbacks.&quot; And it turns out that these diagrams 
<br />
are closely linked to physics issues (!). (If you turn on your morphing 
<br />
engines and begin playing with the words, you probably are already 
<br />
speculating that maybe Feynman diagrams are a kind of category theory 
<br />
diagram. And you would be right. See John Baez's &quot;From Causal Sets to 
<br />
Feynman Diagrams&quot; for more.)
<br />
<br />(Digression: By talking to you folks, by attempting to explain these 
<br />
ideas, I am essentially trying to take the picture which is inside _my_ 
<br />
head and plant some semblance of it in _your_ head. This is a kind of 
<br />
natural transformation, albeit much more complicated and fuzzier than 
<br />
most nice, formal, pristine examples in math!)
<br />
<br />So in 1945, delayed for 3 years by the war, Eilenberg and Mac Lane 
<br />
published their influential and very long paper on what they called 
<br />
&quot;categories.&quot; A category was like a set, except made up of objects and 
<br />
arrrows between the objects. Ordinary sets formed the category SET. 
<br />
Vector spaces formed the category VECT, and so on, for essentially all 
<br />
objects and relationships known to mathematics. And of course there are 
<br />
then ways to map one category into another, or to compare two categories 
<br />
(actually mapping and asking about the mapping are of course essentially 
<br />
the same thing, with just a change of direction or emphasis).
<br />
<br />Eilenberg and Mac Lane used category theory as a concise and unifying 
<br />
notation for talking about mathematics, especially for algebraic 
<br />
topology. Use of category theory for algebraic topology (particularly an 
<br />
important branch called &quot;homology theory&quot;) became widespread in the late 
<br />
40s and ever since.
<br />
<br />Aside: They coined the term &quot;category.&quot; Perhaps they should have called 
<br />
them something like &quot;structures.&quot; Then category theory would be 
<br />
understand at a glance (via those morphisms in our everyday language, 
<br />
those patterns!) as &quot;structure theory.&quot; Or as &quot;pattern theory.&quot; And then 
<br />
probably more people would have understand why it would likely to be 
<br />
very important.
<br />
<br />But much more was to come.
<br />
<br />In the late 1950s a couple of important extensions (obscure pun not 
<br />
intended) of Eilenberg and Mac Lane's &quot;notational language&quot; happened. 
<br />
Daniel Kan discovered the &quot;Kan extension&quot; and proved something called 
<br />
the &quot;adjoint functor theorem.&quot; Now physicists have used &quot;adjoints&quot; and 
<br />
&quot;self-adjoint&quot; concepts for years. When the category theory and algebra 
<br />
people showed the power of their diagrams, physicists began to take 
<br />
notice.
<br />
<br />And at around that time the great mathematician Grothendieck developed 
<br />
some notions which led to a particular kind of category called a topos. 
<br />
(No space in this already too-long article to try to explain what a 
<br />
topos is.) William (Bill) Lawvere was a young student of Eilenberg's. He 
<br />
was convinced that topos theory could provide a foundation for 
<br />
mathematics equvalient in power to that of set theory. Instead of sets 
<br />
consisting of points and axioms about inclusion we would have objects 
<br />
(not necessarily consisting of points) and arrows (morphisms). According 
<br />
to the story, Mac Lane warned him away from attempting this. The story 
<br />
goes that Eilenberg and Mac Lane were flying down to consult for the 
<br />
Pentagon in 1963 and Eilenberg handed Mac Lane the recently completed 
<br />
thesis of Lawvere. Bill Lawvere had largely established that toposes 
<br />
could form the basis of all of mathematics. (Some worked needed to be 
<br />
completed, and this was largely done by 1970.)
<br />
<br />Meanwhile, a couple of major theorems were solved in the 1960s with the 
<br />
use of category theory: the Weill Conjecture and Paul Cohen's work on 
<br />
&quot;forcing&quot; to
<br />
<br />Let me give a description I found of just one course in topos theory. 
<br />
This will mention a lot of buzzwords, including folks like Saul Kripke 
<br />
(logician, &quot;possible worlds&quot;), Grothendieck, etc. Don't expect to grok 
<br />
this from a course summary (!), but I include it to show some of the 
<br />
links:
<br />

<br />
<br />&quot;Topos Theory, spring term 1999
<br />
<br />&quot;A graduate course (6 course points) in mathematical logic.
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />&quot;Topos theory grew out of the observation that the category of sheaves 
<br />
over a fixed topological space forms a universe of &quot;continuously 
<br />
variable sets&quot; which obeys the laws of intuitionistic logic. These sheaf 
<br />
models, or Grothendieck toposes, turn out to be generalisations of 
<br />
Kripke and Beth models (which are fundamental for various non-classical 
<br />
logics) as well as Cohen's forcing models for set theory. The notion of 
<br />
topos was subsequently extended and given an elementary axiomatisation 
<br />
by Lawvere and Tierney, and shown to correspond to a certain higher 
<br />
order intuitionistic logic. Various logics and type theories have been 
<br />
given categorical characterisations, which are of importance for the 
<br />
mathematical foundations for programming languages. One of the most 
<br />
interesting aspects of toposes is that they can provide natural models 
<br />
of certain theories that lack classical models, viz. synthetic 
<br />
differential geometry.
<br />
<br />&quot;This graduate course offers an introduction to topos theory and 
<br />
categorical logic. In particular the following topics will be covered: 
<br />
Categorical logic: relation between logics, type theories and 
<br />
categories. Generalised topologies, including formal topologies. 
<br />
Sheaves. Pretoposes and toposes. Beth-Kripke-Joyal semantics. Boolean 
<br />
toposes and Cohen forcing. Barr's theorem and Diaconescu covers. 
<br />
Geometric morphisms. Classifying toposes. Sheaf models of infinitesimal 
<br />
analysis.
<br />
<br />&quot;We will assume some familiarity with basic category theory, such as is 
<br />
obtained in courses in domain theory or algebra. The course will be 
<br />
given English, in case someone requests this. &quot;
<br />
<br />(Sorry for the quoted material, but it sometimes helps to see someone 
<br />
else talking about something. At least I find it does.)
<br />
<br /><br />I'd best move on to answering or commenting the rest of Wei Dai's 
<br />
questions:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  What's the relationship
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between category theory and the idea that all possible universes exists?
</em><br />
<br />I believe it provides a natural language for talking about time-varying 
<br />
sets and &quot;sheaves&quot; (Jargon Alert: the &quot;sheaf&quot; in mathematics may not 
<br />
match exactly what one pictures a &quot;sheaf of histories&quot; to look like. But 
<br />
mathematicians usually pick names that bear _some_ resemblance to 
<br />
ordinary things, e.g., fibers, fiber bundles, sheaves, pre-sheaves, 
<br />
partially ordered sets, spaces, etc.)
<br />
<br />Personally, I'm not (yet) &quot;taking seriously&quot; either the David Lewis 
<br />
&quot;plurality of worlds&quot; or Max Tegmark &quot;everything&quot; or Greg Egan &quot;all 
<br />
topologies model&quot; ideas. At least not yet. I need to learn a lot more of 
<br />
the language first.
<br />
<br />(Without a good language, we end up just _talking_ and _speculating_. 
<br />
I'm finding my category theory reading is giving me a welcome new 
<br />
perspective on issues I've long been fascinated with, e.g., if a single 
<br />
atom were to have been moved on Sirius a million years ago, would the 
<br />
world around us be different? And how much different? The cascade of 
<br />
changes has what topology? Is it the Pachinko topology?)
<br />
<br />My strong hunch is that the universe at these levels (nature of 
<br />
space-time) will need all of the mathematical tools we can muster. Now, 
<br />
I'm not saying one needs to be an expert at group theory, for example. 
<br />
Or that one needs to know all of algebraic topology.  But it's pretty 
<br />
clear to me that mathematics has historically been our most important 
<br />
tool for all of the interesting branches of physics. No one can get far 
<br />
in relativity or quantum mechanics without mastering some interesting 
<br />
math.
<br />
<br />For me, category theory has been a stunning window on things. I regret 
<br />
that it is not taught, or even mentioned, to most physicists.  (This may 
<br />
be changing, with the books by folks like Robert Geroch, who starts with 
<br />
category theory and covers much of modern physics from this perspective, 
<br />
and the progress by the string theory and quantum gravity communities.)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Does it help understand or formalize the notion of &quot;all possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universes&quot;? I know in logic there is the concept of a categorical theory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaning all models of the theory are isomorphic. Does that have anything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to do with category theory?
</em><br />
<br />Yes, there are deep and important connections. Models form a category. 
<br />
The book I mentioned by Paul Taylor, &quot;Practical Foundations of 
<br />
Mathematics,&quot; is very good on these issues.
<br />
<br />In my view, category theory (and topos theory) represents the &quot;modern&quot; 
<br />
way of looking at a lot of seemingly unrelated areas.
<br />
<br />As we know, as Hal Finney and several of us used to discuss about ten 
<br />
years ago on the Extropians list, Chaitin's formulation of algorithmic 
<br />
information theory gives us a much more understandable and 
<br />
comprehensible proof of Godel's Theorem than Godel himself gave! (For 
<br />
the best explanation of this, and why this is so, either see Greg 
<br />
Chaitin's own papers and books or the wonderful summaries by Rudy Rucker 
<br />
in his &quot;Mind Tools&quot; book.
<br />
<br />These modern viewpoints are much more comprehensible than the classics. 
<br />
Which is not surprising. Shoulders of giants and all that.
<br />
<br />The same is true of category theory. It's a relentlessly modern approach 
<br />
to seeing the similarities that pervade mathematics and physics. Whether 
<br />
it answers the question about whether lots of other universes exist is 
<br />
doubtful...I'm not convinced we'll know the answer to that question in 
<br />
the year 3000.
<br />
<br />But it's a powerful and elegant approach, with perhaps a slightly 
<br />
misleading name, and it looks to me to be the right language for talking 
<br />
about the world around us and possibly the worlds we cannot directly see.
<br />
<br />I agree with Lee Smolin that topos logic is not just the logic of 
<br />
cosmology, but also the logic of our everyday world of limited 
<br />
information, bounded rationality, Bayesian decision making, and 
<br />
information horizons. Even if this is not useful for answering questions 
<br />
about &quot;the Everything theory,&quot; because we may need to wait 600 or 6000 
<br />
years for experimental tests to become feasible, I believe this outlook 
<br />
will be of great utility in many areas.
<br />
<br />I'll keep you all posted!
