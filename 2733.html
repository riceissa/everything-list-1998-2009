<br />I have. (<a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m2689.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m2689.html</a>)  :-)
<br />
<br />But there is no problem with repetition.
<br />
<br />The real problem is with the absence of pictures!!!!
<br />
<br />Please take a pencil and try to translate everything I say
<br />
with little drawings.
<br />
<br /><br />A relation R defined on a set W is just a subset of W X W.
<br />
Exemple:
<br />
1)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;W  =  {1, 2, 3}
<br />
<br />&nbsp;R =   { (1,1) (1,2) (2,2) (3,3)}
<br />
<br />In this exemple R is said to be reflexive because for each x in W we have
<br />
xRx   (we write aRb for saying that (a,b) is in the relation R)
<br />
indeed 1R1, 2R2, 3R3.
<br />
<br />In your drawing just draw three points and represent the relation
<br />
by arrows between the points. Of course the relation is reflexive means
<br />
that for each points there is an arrow from the point to itself.
<br />
<br />2)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;W = {John, Paul, Sophie}
<br />
<br />&nbsp;R = the relation &quot;is the father&quot;, and I tell you that John is the father
<br />
of Paul, and that Paul is the father of Sophie.
<br />
<br />R is of course not reflexive (because nobody is its own father).
<br />
<br />3)  W = {John, Paul, Sophie} 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;R is &quot;as tall as&quot;
<br />
<br />then R is reflexive (for all x we have xRx : John is as tall as John, etc.)
<br />
R is also symmetric (which means for all x and y  xRy entails yRx), because
<br />
if x is as tall as y, then y is as tall as x.
<br />
R is transitive (which means: xRy and yRz entails xRz).
<br />
Order (bigger than) and equivalence (like as tall as) are typically transitive
<br />
relation.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 1.     (W,R) respects []p -&gt; p  iff  (W,R) is reflexive,
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I find it easier to comprehend these theorems if I state them in English:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;1) If p is true in all worlds in set R, then p is true in world A. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This is true if A belongs to set R. (we could use a Venn diagram 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to prove this) ...... OK
</em><br />
<br />?
<br />
<br />You should not drink when reading the post. Where does the &quot;A&quot; come
<br />
from. Also: the set is W, and R is a relation on W.
<br />
<br />You translate []p by p is true in all worlds. But that is Leibniz
<br />
semantics. In Kripke semantics []p is true in the precise world w
<br />
if p is true in all world accessible from w. 
<br />
In math notation: []p is true in w if p is true for all x such that wRx.
<br />
<br />Then the proof that
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(W,R) respects []p -&gt; p  iff  (W,R) is reflexive,
<br />
<br />is hardly shorter than the one I give &lt;&lt;let me quote myself:
<br />
<br />Because of the &quot;iff&quot; we must prove two things.
<br />
<br />we must prove a) if R is reflexive then (W,R) respects []p -&gt; p,
<br />
and we must prove b) if (W,R) respects []p -&gt; p then R is reflexive.
<br />
<br />Let us prove a). 
<br />
To prove that &quot;if A then B&quot;, a traditional way consists in supposing
<br />
that we have A and  not B, and showing that this leads to a 
<br />
contradiction. (BTW you can verify that ((A &amp; -B) -&gt; FALSE) &lt;-&gt; (A-&gt;B))
<br />
is a tautology).
<br />
So, let us suppose that R is reflexive and that (W,R) does not
<br />
respect []p -&gt; p.
<br />
To say that (W,R) does not respect []p -&gt; p means that there is at
<br />
least one world w in which []p -&gt; p is false. Remember that worlds
<br />
obeys classical logic, so that if []p -&gt; p is false at w, it means
<br />
that []p is true at w and p is false at w (and -p is true at w).
<br />
But (by Kripke semantics) if []p is true at w, it means p is true 
<br />
at every world accessible from w. But R is reflexive, so we have wRw.
<br />
So p and -p are true at w. But then w does not obey to classical logic.
<br />
Contradiction.
<br />
<br />Let us prove b), that is: if (W,R) respects []p -&gt; p then R is 
<br />
reflexive.
<br />
Suppose (W,R) respects []p -&gt; p and that R is not reflexive.
<br />
And let us search a contradiction from that.
<br />
If R is not reflexive, it means that there is a world w in W such that
<br />
we don't have wRw. Let us build a model on that frame by defining
<br />
a valuation V such that V(p) = FALSE in w, and V(p) = TRUE on all
<br />
world accessible from w (if there is any(°)).
<br />
By Kripke semantics we have []p true in w. So now we have both
<br />
[]p and -p true at w. But we have suppose that (W,R) respects 
<br />
[]p -&gt; p, so []p -&gt; p is true at w, so p is true at w (because []p
<br />
has been shown true at w, and w obeys classical logic). But then
<br />
again p and -p are true at w. Contradiction. End of self-quoting&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />Make drawings, you will help yourself. Verify the theorem for little
<br />
reflexive frame like (W, R), with W having just two elements (worlds) and
<br />
R a simple reflexive relation you invent (like just xRx for the x in W).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; And, just because you promise me a prize for deriving SE from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the &quot;psychology of machine&quot; I tell you that I have decided
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to call the modal formula (the one for the symmetrical frame):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;                            p-&gt;[]&lt;&gt;p,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     the little abstract Schroedinger Equation (LASE),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In English:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If p is true in one world then in the set of all worlds, there is at least on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;world in which p is true....OK,  isn't that obvious? 
</em><br />
<br />It is obvious *in Leibniz semantics*. In kripke semantics it is &quot;obvious&quot; 
<br />
only for the symmetric frame. Try to build a little non symetric model which 
<br />
does not validate the formula.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;But to connect this to SE,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;where is the uncertainty? And in which world  is the observer located?
</em><br />
<br />Until now the word &quot;world&quot; means only that it is an element of a frame W,
<br />
by definition. I was anticipating for motivation. The relation between
<br />
p-&gt;[]&lt;&gt;p and SE will be based on quantum logic.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; as I have called before the (godel-like) formula
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;                           &lt;&gt;p -&gt; -[]&lt;&gt;p
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     the first theorem of machine's psychology. (FTMP)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; And our goal is to find a natural bridge from FTMP to LASE.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;In English:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;if there is at least one world where p is true, then it is false that in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the set
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of all worlds there is at least one world where p is true.
</em><br />
<br />Your translation in english is false. You still mixt Leibniz
<br />
semantics and Kripke. Be careful.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;This statement (&lt;&gt;p -&gt; -[]&lt;&gt;p) seems inconsistent.
</em><br />
<br />It is inconsistent in Leibniz semantics. 
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; When the box []p is interpreted in english as provable(p),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;You are saying that &quot;p is true in all worlds&quot; is identical to &quot;p is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;provable.&quot; You have lost me....
</em><br />
<br />Although you are a relativist you keep thinking in Leibniz
<br />
semantics. You are still victim off 2OOO years of Aristotelian
<br />
brainwashing :-)
<br />
[]p does not mean that p is true in all worlds. (that is Leibniz
<br />
semantics!)
<br />
With Kripke []p has no absolute meaning at all.
<br />
With Kripke, []p is defined only relatively to a world.
<br />
[]p is true at world w    means    p is true in all worlds
<br />
accessible from w. (i.e. p is true at all z such that wRz).
<br />
<br />So there is as much Kripke semantics than there is relation
<br />
of accessibility. And that is nice because it gives independant
<br />
semantics for most interesting modal formula.
<br />
Don't hesitate to read and reread the preceding post.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Again thanks for this course in logic
</em><br />
<br />I hope I will not give you too much work. You can find some drawing
<br />
in my french thesis. For exemple ideal frame can be 
<br />
found page 64. The Kripke semantics of the Aristotelian square, page
<br />
62, should help you.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Great adding an unprovable statement to a set of axiom is OK. But how do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you know it is not provable until you actually attempt to prove it... and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;how long will you attempt to do so?
</em><br />
<br />I will come back on this latter.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Consistency (&quot;logical thinking&quot;) is certainly a necessary condition for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consciousness (&quot;I think&quot; a la Descartes)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; A more psychological reading of that formula is, by identifying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (audaciously perhaps) consistency with consciousness (or awakeness)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; you get &quot;if I am conscious then I cannot prove it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;but consistency is not a sufficient condition for consciousness. Or is it?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;What else would be required?
</em><br />
<br />Consistency is indeed not a sufficient condition for consciousness.
<br />
What is required is some form of (automatic) anticipation of that
<br />
consistency. But that will not be relevant for the derivation of SE.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Yes I am.... but as the saying goes &quot;l'appetit vient en mangeant.&quot; We
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;shall see.
</em><br />
<br />We can take holiday at any moment, and even discussed other more
<br />
informal point, and then come back to the math.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Forgive me for not being too prompt....
</em><br />
<br />Take your time. Read the post carefully.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Responding to your posts is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;simply a matter of making a few cute remarks....
</em><br />
<br />I'm afraid y're right. This is because we try to go
<br />
for being more technical. BTW I am astonished that
<br />
people are not attacking us on that way to proceed.
<br />
I was expecting remarks like &quot;logic cannot be used
<br />
for solving philosophical problems, nor for solving
<br />
physical problems, etc.&quot;.
<br />
I'm used to such kind of arguments ...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;We are certainly going in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the right direction....
</em><br />
<br />I hope so.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I think that the basic ideas are probably very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;simple... 
</em><br />
<br />I'm not so sure. Do you know Hilbert Space, or Linear Space. We will
<br />
need them for quantum logic (which will explains why I call
<br />
p-&gt;[]&lt;&gt;p the little Schroedinger equation). 
<br />
Godel's theorem will also be needed (as you know). It is not
<br />
difficult, but then to say it is easy would be an exageration
<br />
too.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;the hard part is to communicate them.
</em><br />
<br />... especially without drawing facilities. I believe that those
<br />
who will just add a little pen to the e-mailing will make
<br />
lot of money !
<br />
<br />You know, when I teach modal logic, I do drawings and drawings
<br />
and drawings. I have even invented a sort of slide-comics technics
<br />
for the presentation of Kripke semantics.  Let us try to be
<br />
patient. 
<br />
<br />Bruno
<br />
<br />PS Those who understands my thesis AND are willing to study the
<br />
formidable paper by J.P. Rawling and S.A. Selesnick : &quot;Orthologic
<br />
and Quantum Logic: Models and Computational Elements&quot; should be 
<br />
able to explain where does quantum computation come from, and why
<br />
any modest lobian machine can discover their necessary existence
<br />
by pure introspection.
<br />
This paper could motivate you for quantum logic.
<br />
The paper is in &quot;Journal of the ACM, july 2000, Vol. 47, N°4,
<br />
page 721-751&quot;. (Not really easy, for sure).
