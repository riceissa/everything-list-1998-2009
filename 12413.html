SP: 'using the term &quot;comp&quot; as short for &quot;computationalism&quot; as something 
<br />
picked up from Bruno. On the face of it, computationalism seems quite 
<br />
sensible: the best theory of consciousness and the most promising 
<br />
candidate for producing artificial intelligence/consciousness'
<br />
<br />That is what I thought 'comp' meant. My approach to this is to adhere, 
<br />
as much as possible, to plain and simple English. Not being a 
<br />
'mathematician' I stick with my type of sceptical method. To me this 
<br />
does not seem deeply problematic although is does of course limit the 
<br />
scope of conversations I can participate in. As far as I can see, 
<br />
Bruno's grand scheme depends on 'assume', like the economists do. 
<br />
Unfortunately that which is assumed remains, I believe, unprovable. 
<br />
Furthermore there are deep, common sense, problems which undermine all 
<br />
these theories of universal emulation possibilities, never mind those 
<br />
potentially lethal :-) teleporting/fax holidays and cryogenic time shifts.
<br />
<br />The biggest hurdle is the requirement for infinite computing ability. 
<br />
This is simply the recognition that all measurements are approximations 
<br />
so the teleporter/fax machine could only ever send an approximate copy 
<br />
of me to whatever destination duty or holiday dreamings might lead me. 
<br />
Still, it is probable that I, as subjective experiencer, would not 
<br />
notice most anomalies, particularly if trying to fill in the temporal 
<br />
gaps caused by Bruno's gratuitous delays in reading me back out of his 
<br />
archive :-)
<br />
<br />This limitation hits all the 'Matrix' type scenarios as well: the 
<br />
emulation system would require essentially infinite computing capacity 
<br />
to reproduce any useful world that a real person inhabits. If on the 
<br />
other hand the Matrix is only concerned to make A world, its virtual 
<br />
reality inhabitants might be sustained [I am admitting this as a 
<br />
possibility] until they started engaging in real science. As I 
<br />
understand things the denizens of a Matrix type world would start to 
<br />
find real anomalies in their 'reality' unless the matrix machine could 
<br />
operate at a fineness of resolution unattainable by any experimental 
<br />
method the matrixians could devise. There would be much less, or even no 
<br />
problem at all if they were all believers in 'Intelligent Design' of 
<br />
course. [I can put that very rudely as: the problem is not 'If our mind 
<br />
were simple enough to understand then we would be too dumb to understand 
<br />
it' but rather 'If Intelligent Design were really true then we have been 
<br />
designed to be so dumb that it really doesn't matter!']
<br />
<br />Re &quot;Platonic objects&quot; - I think this is illusory. The numbers that 
<br />
people write down and think about are words in the language/s of 
<br />
logico-mathematics. They do what they do because they are defined as 
<br />
such but they do not exist apart from the systems which generate and 
<br />
record them - by which I mean brains, blackboards and computers, etc... 
<br />
The regularities, and exciting facts people discover about them are just 
<br />
that, regularities and exciting facts about languages. I don't mean that 
<br />
in any derogatory sense. We live largely BY MEANS OF our languages and 
<br />
certainly our cultural lives as human beings would be impossible without 
<br />
language in the general and inclusive senses. But the universe is not 
<br />
made out of languages, it just exists - for the moment at least.
<br />
[NB: it just occurs to me that certain G/goddists will say that the 
<br />
universe is made out of the mind of G/god/s which could perhaps be 
<br />
included as a or THE language of existence. To be 'perfect' however, 
<br />
this would need to be allowed to have infinite recursion, i.e. ''made 
<br />
out of(made out of(made out of(made out of ... -&gt; inf ... ))). As far as 
<br />
I can see however this would amount to an assertion of many layered 
<br />
uncertainty and/or a Heraclitan in-falling in the direction of 
<br />
smallwards due to the necessity of each layer of divinity maintaining 
<br />
omniscience, omnipotence, and so for, over and under its 'turf'. As this 
<br />
has the minimalist effect of underpinning either standard model QM, etc. 
<br />
or something like the Process Physics advocated by Colin Hales and 
<br />
friends [which I find attractive], all is well with the world. :-]
<br />
<br />But, seriously, all this stuff about 'supervening' and so forth is all 
<br />
based on the Cartesian assumption that mind-stuff has no physical 
<br />
extension. Well the Inquisition is no longer the authority or power base 
<br />
that it was and empirical science has moved on. I think the onus is 
<br />
falling ever more heavily on those who deny the identity of mind and 
<br />
brain to explain WHY they still do so. The 'distinction' between 1st and 
<br />
3rd person view points is simply raw fact. Both view points have limits 
<br />
which can be seen to derive from the view of reality they embody. 1st 
<br />
person viewpoint conflates the experience of being the embodiment of a 
<br />
view point with an experience of all that is viewable, the 3rd person 
<br />
viewpoint conflates objective models of things with the things 
<br />
themselves. There is a sense in which these are simply manifestations of 
<br />
the same raw fact of life: the model of something is not the thing, it 
<br />
is only ABOUT the thing. Amen!   :-)

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; SP: ' In the end, what is &quot;right&quot; is an irreducible personal belief, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; which you can try to change by appeal to emotions or by example, but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; not by appeal to logic or empirical facts. And in fact I feel much 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; safer that way: if someone honestly believed that he knew what was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;right&quot; as surely as he knew 2+2=4, he would be a very dangerous 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; person. Religious fanatics are not dangerous because they want to do 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; evil, but because they want to do good. '
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; MP: I agree with this, saving only that, on a 'numbers' basis, there 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; are those whose personal evolution takes them beyond the dynamic of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'good' or 'evil' into the domain of power for its own sake. This 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; entails complete loss of empathic ability and I think it could be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; argued that such a person is 'legislating' himself out of the human 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; species.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; MP: I think a key point with 'irreducible personal belief' is that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the persons in question need to acknowledge the beliefs as such and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; take responsibility for them. I believe we have to point this out, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; whenever we get the opportunity, because generally most people are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; reluctant to engage in analysis of their own beliefs, in public 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; anyway. I think part of the reason for this is the cultural climate 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; [meme-scape?] in which Belief in a G/god/s or uncritical Faith are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; still held to be perfectly respectable. This cultural climate is what 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Richard Dawkins and Daniel Dennet have been criticising in recent 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; books and articles.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; SP: 'I am not entirely convinced that comp is true'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; MP: At the moment I am satisfied that 'comp' is NOT true, certainly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; in any format that asserts that 'integers' are all that is needed. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'Quantum' is one thing, but 'digital' is quite another :-) The main 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; problem [fact I would prefer to say] is that existence is irreducible 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; whereas numbers or Number be dependent upon something/s existing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have fallen into sometimes using the term &quot;comp&quot; as short for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;computationalism&quot; as something picked up from Bruno. On the face of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it, computationalism seems quite sensible: the best theory of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness and the most promising candidate for producing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; artificial intelligence/consciousness (if they are the same thing: see 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; below). Assuming comp, Bruno goes through 8 steps in his Universal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dovetailer Argument (UDA), eg. in this paper:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/SANE2004MARCHAL.htm">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/SANE2004MARCHAL.htm</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; All of the steps are relatively straightforward until step 8, which 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; invokes an argument discovered by Bruno and Tim Maudlin demonstrating 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that there is a problem with the theory that the mental supervenes on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the physical. It seems that to be consistent you have to allow either 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that any computation, including the supposedly conscious ones, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; supervenes on any physical activity, or that computations do not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; supervene on physical activity at all but are complete in themselves, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness included, by virtue of their status as Platonic objects. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno concludes that the latter is the case, but Maudlin appears to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; take both possibilities as obviously absurd and thus presents the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; paper as a problem with computationalism itself. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; MP: Why are we not zombies? The answer is in the fact of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; self-referencing. In our case [as hominids] there are peculiarities 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of construction and function arisen from our evolutionary history, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; but there is nothing in principle to deny self-awareness from a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; silicon-electronic entity that embodied sufficient details within a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; model of self in the world. The existence of such a model would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; constitute its mind, broadly speaking, and the updating of the model 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of self in the world would be the experience of self awareness. What 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; it would be like TO BE the updating of such a model of self in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; world is something we will probably have to wait awhile to be told  :-)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It seems reasonable to theorise that if an entity could behave like a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious being, it must be a conscious being. However, the theory 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does not have the strength of logical necessity. It is quite possible 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that if nature had electronic circuits to play with, beings displaying 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intelligent behaviour similar to our own may have evolved, but lacking 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness. This need not lead to the usual criticism: in that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; case, how can I be sure my fellow humans are conscious? My fellow 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; humans not only behave like me, they have a biological brain like me. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We would have to invoke magic to explain how God has breathed 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness into one person but not another, but there is no such 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theoretical problem if the other person turns out to be a robot. My 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; personal view is that if a computer simply learned to copy my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behaviour by studying me closely if it were conscious it would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probably be differently conscious. If the computer attempted to copy 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; me by emulating my neuronal activity I would be more confident that it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was conscious in the same way I am, although I would not be 100% 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certain. But if I were copied in a teleportation experiment to a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; similar tolerance level as occurs in normal moment to moment living, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it would be absurd to seriously contemplate that the copy was a zombie 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or differed significantly in his experiences from the original.
