<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have the sort of minds which consider that one OM has a particular

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relationship to another OM, based partly, but not entirely, on memory. For

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; worried, because I feel there is a 50% chance that I will be the one; but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; come tomorrow, and I am not tortured, I am relieved, and feel pity for my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; copy screaming in the next room. This doesn't really make sense: today I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anticipate being both copies, and neither copy has greater claim to being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;me&quot; than the other, but tomorrow the situation is completely different. But
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the subjective view doesn't have to make sense. It's just the way we think,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a contingent fact of evolution.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />Do you agree that under ASSA, the fact that you find yourself as an
<br />
observer who was spared from torture should give you no relief, as
<br />
your next OM is equally likely to sample the tortured perspective as
<br />
it is to experience the spared perspective?  Shouldn't you be equally
<br />
as worried if anyone in the world (your copy or not) was to be
<br />
tortured, as the next sampled OM could be that person's.
<br />
<br />RSSA has never appealed to me because I see no logical reason to link
<br />
two observer moments from one time to another when those two observer
<br />
moments are not the same.  Intuitively it feels that each mind is on a
<br />
set track to only experience those OM's that follow from the birth of
<br />
an observer, but logically there are too many problems with this.
<br />
<br />Possible problems with RSSA:
<br />
<br />Quantum mechanics means each observer follows multiple paths, some of
<br />
which intersect with what might have been considered a different
<br />
observer previously, this forms a spectrum linking all observers
<br />
together.
<br />
<br />Time by its nature implies change, an observer's brain state is in
<br />
different from one time to another, if the brains are different the
<br />
observers are different.  By what rule set can two different observers
<br />
be said to be the same?
<br />
<br /><br />Common intuition and experience play many tricks on us.  It makes us
<br />
think that the current time (present) is special, because it is the
<br />
only thing point in time we are aware of.  It makes us think that the
<br />
current laws of physics and universe we see around us is special,
<br />
because it is the only set of laws we are aware of.  I propose the
<br />
same is true of personal identity, it makes us think that the self is
<br />
special, because it is the only observer's perspective we are aware
<br />
of.  For those who believe in block time, the present is no more
<br />
special or real than any other time.  To those on the Everything list,
<br />
the universe we perceive now is no more real than any other.  Our
<br />
current OM remembering previous OM's experienced from the same
<br />
observer's viewpoint creates the illusion that said observer is
<br />
travelling into the future and bound to experience the next logical OM
<br />
for this observer, but I hold this is only an illusion.
<br />
<br /><br />ASSA is closer to a one mind/all perspectives experienced
<br />
simultanesouly view because it removes the notion of observers that
<br />
travel through time from one OM to the next and treats only observer
<br />
moments.  Consider the infinite set of all OMs, by definition, the
<br />
existance of an OM necessitates its being experienced, but without a
<br />
multiplicity of observers who can say &quot;who&quot; is experiencing them?
<br />
There is no who, just the fact that each is being experienced.  Since
<br />
this set exists in the plentitude (which is timeless) then it follows
<br />
that all perspectives are being experienced simultaneously.
<br />
<br />The existance of a spectrum of related OM's means there is a choice in
<br />
interpretation of this infinite OM set.  Either you can hold that each
<br />
OM constitues its own mind, or if you believe there is any
<br />
relationship between OM's (i.e. You experience now AND you will
<br />
experience 10 seconds from now) then you must conclude there is only
<br />
one mind.  This is just my viewpoint on the issue and I invite others
<br />
to give their opinions on it and poke holes in it.
