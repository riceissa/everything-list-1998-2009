Hi,
<br />
When I read quantum mechanics and listen to those invested in the many 
<br />
places the mathematics leads, What strikes me is the extent to which the 
<br />
starting point is mathematics. That is, the entire discussion is couched 
<br />
as if the mathematics is defining what there is, rather than a mere 
<br />
describing what is there. I can see that the form of the mathematics 
<br />
projects a multitude of possibilities. But those invested in the  
<br />
business seem to operate under the assumption - an extra belief  - about 
<br />
the relationship of the mathematics to reality. It imbues the 
<br />
discussion. At least that is how it appears to me. Consider the 
<br />
pragmatics of it. I, scientist X,  am in a position of adopting 02 
<br />
possible mindsets:
<br />
<br />Position 1
<br />
1a) The mathematics of quantum mechanics is very accurately predictive 
<br />
of observed phenomena
<br />
1b) Reality literally IS the mathematics of quantum mechanics (and by 
<br />
extension all the multitudinous alternative realities actually exist). 
<br />
Therefor to discuss mathematical constructs is to speak literally of 
<br />
reality. My ability to mentally manipulate mathematics therefore makes 
<br />
me a powerful lord of reality and puts me in a position of great 
<br />
authority and clarity.
<br />
<br />Position 2
<br />
2a) The mathematics of quantum mechanics is very accurately predictive 
<br />
of observed phenomena
<br />
2b) Reality is not the mathematics of (a). Reality is constructed of 
<br />
something that merely appears/behaves quantum-mechanically to an 
<br />
observer made of whatever it is, within a universe made of it. The 
<br />
mathematics of this &quot;something&quot; is not the mathematics of kind (a).
<br />
<br />Note
<br />
1a) = 2a)
<br />
1b)  and 2b) they are totally different.
<br />
<br />The (a) is completely consistent with either (b).
<br />
Yet we have religious zeal surrounding (1b)
<br />
<br />I hope that you can see the subtlety of the distinction between position 
<br />
1 and position 2. As a thinking person in the logical position of 
<br />
wondering what position to adopt, position 01 is *completely 
<br />
unjustified*. The parsimonious position is one in which the universe is 
<br />
made of something other than 1b maths, and then to find a method of 
<br />
describing ways in which position 1 might seem apparent to an observer 
<br />
made of whatever the universe is actually made of.. The nice thing about 
<br />
position 2 is that I have room for *doubt* in 2b which does not exist in 
<br />
1b. In position 2 I have:
<br />
<br />(i) laws of nature that are the describing system (predictive of 
<br />
phenomena in the usual ways)
<br />
(ii) behaviours of a doubtable 'stuff' relating in doubtable ways to 
<br />
produce an observer able to to (i)
<br />
<br />In position 1 there is no doubt of kind (ii). That doubt is replaced by 
<br />
religious adherence to an unfounded implicit belief which imbues the 
<br />
discourse. At the same time  position 1 completely fails to explain an 
<br />
observer of the kind able to do 1a.
<br />
<br />In my ponderings on this I am coming to the conclusion that the very 
<br />
nature of the discourse and training self-selects for people who's 
<br />
mental skills in abstract symbol manipulation make Position 1 a 
<br />
dominating tendency. Aggregates of position 1 thinkers - such as the 
<br />
everything list and 'fabric of reality' act like small cults. There is 
<br />
some kind of psychological payback involved in position 1 which selects 
<br />
for people susceptible to religiosity of kind 1b. Once you have a couple 
<br />
of generations of these folk who are so disconnected from the reality of 
<br />
themselves as embedded, situated agents/observers... that position 2, 
<br />
which involves an admission of permanent ignorance of some kind, and 
<br />
thereby demoting the physicist from the prime source of authority over 
<br />
reality, is marginalised and eventually more or less invisible.
<br />
<br />It is not that MWI is true/false.... it's that confinement to the 
<br />
discourse of MWI alone is justified only on religious grounds of the 
<br />
kind I have delineated. You can be quite predictive and at the same time 
<br />
not actually be discussing reality at all - and you'll never realise it. 
<br />
I.E. Position 2 could be right and all the MWI predictions can still be 
<br />
right. Yet position 1 behaviour stops you from finding position 2 ... 
<br />
and problems unsolved because they are only solvable by position 2 
<br />
remain unsolved merely because of 1b religiosity.
<br />
<br />Can anyone else here see this cultural schism operating?
<br />
<br />regards
<br />
