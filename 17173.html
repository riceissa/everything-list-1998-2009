Against Physics
<br />
<br />Let me go through my full chain of reasoning here, before I draw my
<br />
conclusion:
<br />
<br />So the world that I perceive seems pretty orderly.  When I drive to
<br />
work, it's always where I expect it to be.  The people are always the
<br />
same.  I pick up where I left off on the previous day, and life
<br />
generally proceeds in an orderly and predictable way.  Even when
<br />
something unexpected happens, I can generally trace back along a chain
<br />
of cause and effect and determine why it happened, and understand both
<br />
why I didn't expect it and why I probably could have.
<br />
<br />In my experience thus far, there have been no &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;
<br />
style white rabbits that suddenly appear in a totally inexplicable
<br />
way, make a few cryptic remarks while checking their pocket watch, and
<br />
then scurry off.
<br />
<br />Why do I never see such white rabbits?
<br />
<br />Well, at first glance, something like physicalism seems like the
<br />
obvious choice to explain my reality's perceived order - to explain
<br />
both what I experience AND what I *don't* experience.  The world is
<br />
reducible to fundamental particles (waves, strings, whatever) which
<br />
have certain properties (mass, velocity, spin, charge, etc) that
<br />
determine how they interact, and it all adds up to what I see.
<br />
<br />In this view, what I see is ultimately determined by the starting
<br />
conditions of the universe, plus the physical laws that govern the
<br />
interaction of the fundamental elements of the universe, applied over
<br />
how-many-ever billions of years.  While no explanation is given for
<br />
the initial conditions, or why the fundamental laws of physics are
<br />
what they are, if you get past that then from a cause-and-effect stand
<br />
point physicalism offers a pretty solid explanation for why my world
<br />
is orderly and predictable, and why I don't see white rabbits.
<br />
<br />And in the form of functionalism/computationalism + evolution it even
<br />
offers a pretty good foundation for explaining the existence and
<br />
mechanism of human behavior and ability.
<br />
<br />But physicalism has a major drawback:  It doesn't obviously explain
<br />
the experience of consciousness that goes with human behavior and
<br />
ability.  Particles, waves, mass, spin, velocity...no matter how you
<br />
add them up, there doesn't seem to be any way to get conscious
<br />
experience.
<br />
<br />Which is a problem, since consciousness is the portal through which we
<br />
access everything else.  My conscious experience is what I know.  I
<br />
&quot;know&quot; of other things only when they force themselves (or are forced)
<br />
into my conscious awareness.
<br />
<br />So, physicalism does explain why we see, what we see, and why we don't
<br />
see white rabbits.  But it doesn't seem to explain the conscious
<br />
experience OF seeing what we see.
<br />
<br />Further, by positing an independently existing and well ordered
<br />
external universe to explain our orderly perceptions, we have just
<br />
pushed the question back one level.  The new questions are, why does
<br />
this external universe exist and why is it so orderly?  BUT, this
<br />
initially seems justified by the fact that physicalism explains how it
<br />
is possible for us to make correct predictions.
<br />
<br />BUT, actually it explains nothing.
<br />
<br />Nothing has been explained because we are PART of the system that we
<br />
are trying to explain by appealing to physicalism.  If the order and
<br />
predictability of our experiences are due to the initial conditions of
<br />
the universe and the laws of physics, then we inhabit a universe whose
<br />
entire future, including our existence and all of our activities and
<br />
experiences, is fixed.  Frozen in place by unbreakable causal
<br />
chains.
<br />
<br />Effectively (and maybe actually), the entire future of the universe
<br />
can be seen as existing simultaneously with its beginning.  We could
<br />
just as well say that the entire past, present, and future came into
<br />
being at one instant, and we are just experiencing our portion of it
<br />
in slices.
<br />
<br />But there is no &quot;explanation&quot; here.  This &quot;block universe&quot; just IS.
<br />
It just exists.  It came into being for no reason, for no purpose,
<br />
with no meaning.  It exists in the form that it does, and there is no
<br />
answer to the question &quot;why?&quot;.  We are part of that universe, existing
<br />
entirely within it and contained by it.  Therefore we also just
<br />
exist.  For no reason, for no purpose, with no meaning, our future
<br />
history also frozen in place by causal chains.  What is true for the
<br />
universe as a whole is true for it's contents.
<br />
<br />Any explanation we derive is purely local to our particular
<br />
viewpoint.  In reality there is no explanation.  Explanations are as
<br />
subjective as experience.  Of course this doesn't mean that I get to
<br />
pick my preferred explanations, BUT I don't get to pick my experiences
<br />
either.
<br />
<br />To try an make what I'm saying more clear:  let's imagine a real
<br />
block.  Say, a block of speckled granite.  Now let's consider two
<br />
adjacent specks of white and gray.  Why are they adjacent?  What
<br />
caused them to be adjacent?  Well, if we consider this block of
<br />
granite within the context of our universe, then we can say that there
<br />
is a reason in that context as to why they are adjacent.  There is an
<br />
explanation, which has to do with the laws of physics and the
<br />
contingent details of the geologic history of the area where this
<br />
block of granite was formed (which is in turn derived from the
<br />
contingent details of the initial state of our entire universe).
<br />
<br />BUT if we take this block of granite to be something that just exists,
<br />
uncaused and unique, like our universe, then there can be no
<br />
explanation.  The two specks are just adjacent.  That's it.  No
<br />
further explanation is possible.  The block of granite just exists as
<br />
it is and that's the way it is.  We CAN say something like, &quot;there's a
<br />
vein of white and a vein of gray in this block, and those two specks
<br />
exist at the boundary of the veins and so they are adjacent&quot;, BUT
<br />
while this sounds like an explanation, it really is just a statement
<br />
of observed fact.  It doesn't &quot;explain&quot; anything.  And even this
<br />
observation is made from &quot;outside&quot; the block, an option not available
<br />
with our universe.
<br />
<br />If some sort of conscious intelligence exists within speck patterns of
<br />
the 2-D slices of the granite block (2-D because we've lost a
<br />
dimension on our example...the third spatial dimension of the block
<br />
will be time for these speck-beings), then who knows whether they will
<br />
even be conscious of being made from specs of granite and of existing
<br />
within this granite block with it's grey and white veins.  Maybe the
<br />
speck-patterns that they are formed from will be such that their
<br />
experience is of living in a 3+1 dimensional world such as ours.  But
<br />
regardless, there can be no explanation as to why their experiences
<br />
are what they are.  Their experiences will be as uncaused as the
<br />
existence of the block whose speckled nature gives rise to those
<br />
experiences.
<br />
<br />So physicalism in fact offers no advantage over just asserting that
<br />
our conscious experience just exists.  Why are my perceptions orderly
<br />
and why are my predictions about what will happen next usually
<br />
correct?  Because that's just the way it is...and this is true whether
<br />
you posit an external universe or just conclude that conscious
<br />
experience exists uncaused.
