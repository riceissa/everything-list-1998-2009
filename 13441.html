<br />
Consciousness is a cognitive system capable of reflecting on other
<br />
cognitive systems, by enabling switching and integration between
<br />
differing representations of knowledge in different domains.  It's a
<br />
higher-level summary of knowledge in which there is a degree of coarse
<br />
graining sufficient to lose precise information about the under-lying
<br />
computations.  Current experience is integrated with past knowledge in
<br />
order to provide higher-level summaries of the meaning of a concept.
<br />
Any cognitive system capable of reflection in this sense is
<br />
conscious.  In essence, conscious is what *mediates* between different
<br />
representations of knowledge... as mentioned above... the ability to
<br />
switch between and integrate different representational systems.
<br />
<br />There are three general types of consciousness arising from the fact
<br />
that there are three different classes of cognitive systems which
<br />
could be potentially reflected upon.  The first are systems which
<br />
perceive physical concepts.  When this perception is reflected upon,
<br />
we experience sensations.  The second are systems which perceive
<br />
teleological concepts... closely related to our motivational systems.
<br />
When this is reflected upon, we experience emotions (or more
<br />
accurately feelings).  The third type of consciousness is very weak in
<br />
humans... it's the ability to reflect upon systems which perceive
<br />
logical/mathematical things.  Reflection upon these systems is
<br />
consciously experienced as an 'ontology-scape' (in a sense, conscious
<br />
awareness of the theory of everything).  But as mentioned, this last
<br />
type of consciousness is very weak in humans, since our ability to
<br />
reflect upon our own cognitive systems is quite small and not done by
<br />
the brain directly (when engaged in logical reasoning, we humans are
<br />
not generally reflecting on our thoughts directly, but via indirect
<br />
means such as verbal or visual representations of these thoughts).
<br />
<br />The third type of conscious mentioned above is synonymous with
<br />
'reflective intelligence'.  That is, any system successfully engaged
<br />
in reflective decision theory would automatically be conscious.
<br />
Incidentally, such a system would also be 'friendly' (ethical)
<br />
automatically.  The ability to reason effectively about ones own
<br />
cognitive processes would certainly enable the ability to elaborate
<br />
precise definitions of consciousness and determine that the system was
<br />
indeed conforming to the aforementioned definitions.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Much of the confusion surrounding these issues stems from the fact
<br />
there's not one definition of 'general intelligence', but THREE.
<br />
There's the ability to detect patterns (which does not require
<br />
sentience), there's the ability to engage in symbolic reasoning (which
<br />
also does not require sentience), finally there's the ability to
<br />
engage in reflective reasoning (reasoning about reasoning).  And it's
<br />
this third definition intelligence which DOES by necessity entail
<br />
consciousness.  It also, by necessity entails ethical behaviour.
<br />
<br />Now there those who point to powerful systems such as 'Corporations'
<br />
and 'Evolution' to try to argue that you can have intelligence without
<br />
consciousness.  But these arguments are not convincing.  It's true
<br />
that, for instance 'Evolution' is an intelligence system in ONE sense,
<br />
but it's certainly NOT a *reflective intelligence*.  Nor, is , for
<br />
instance a 'Corporation'.  A 'corporation' has SOME of the sub-systems
<br />
of person-hood, but not all of them.  The existence of  non-sentient
<br />
cognitive systems which display *some* of the features of
<br />
intelligence   is a LONG way from establishing that you can have
<br />
*reflective intelligence* without consciousness.  As has been pointed
<br />
out, RPOPS such as for instance 'Evolution' are NOT capable of
<br />
reflective intelligence and therefore cannot be taken as a disproof of
<br />
the claim that reflective intelligence must by necessity automatically
<br />
be friendly and sentient.
<br />
<br />The reason I elaborate this carefully is because you will, on certain
<br />
mailing lists, run into a number of artificial intelligence crack-pots
<br />
claiming that (1) You can have reflective intelligence without
<br />
consciousness and (2)  AI's with reflective intelligence don't have to
<br />
be ethical and might destroy the world.  Ignore these crack-pot claims
<br />
when you see them.
