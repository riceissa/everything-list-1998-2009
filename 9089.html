<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Comp is just my theory of mind.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That's fine.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You know, Bohr said about quantum mechanics that to understand it you 
<br />
need to understand that you don't understand it. Comp is very much like 
<br />
that, the more you grasp it, the less you can believe in it. It is a 
<br />
royal gate to the counter-intuitive land.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It is useful because it makes things
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; completely precise and testable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For instance?
</em><br />
<br /><br />For instance, what I was just saying above. With self-duplication 
<br />
thought experiments I can justify that the first person point of view 
<br />
cannot recognize itself into any third person description.
<br />
Also, if you accept the standard definition of knowledge à-la 
<br />
Theaetetus (cf the hypostases), you can make this mathematically 
<br />
precise.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; About consciousness?
</em><br />
<br /><br />The UDA justifies that matter arises in some way through consciousness 
<br />
in a verifiable way. So you can indirectly test theories on 
<br />
consciousness, and this keeping somehow the &quot;consciousness mystery&quot; 
<br />
intact. If you accept Helmholtz's theory of perception, then you can 
<br />
modelise &quot;consciousness&quot; by the unconscious (automated) inference of 
<br />
self-consistency. Mathematical logic can help to see that such an 
<br />
inference is equivalent with the inference of the existence of a 
<br />
(relative) reality or world-view. Then with computer science, you can 
<br />
even justify a role for consciousness like relative self-speeding 
<br />
ability, but also the aptitude of making decision in finite time in 
<br />
presence of partial information.
<br />
Comp is not just a philosophical idea, it is a way to apply computer 
<br />
science for dundamental question. It gives formula, like Lob's theorem 
<br />
(B(Bp-&gt;p)-&gt;Bp) which are as informative as schroedinger equation in 
<br />
physics.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I consider the possibility that mind emerges from matter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; activity.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I respect that, but this is just impossible in case comp is true (cf 
<br />
the Movie Graph Argument or Maudlin's Olympia, or UDA + occam razor, 
<br />
etc.).
<br />
If you want I can explain you this  bit by bit.
<br />
I am glad with this because I have never really understood what is 
<br />
&quot;matter&quot;.  Each time I ask, people oscillate between giving me a list 
<br />
of sensation (coffee smelling, table hurting), or measurement of 
<br />
numbers and correlations between numbers (real or natural, ...), or 
<br />
they invoke logical algebra, etc. At least with comp I know that the 
<br />
concept is useless, and quasi contradictory (even without occam).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think that modern physics and the synthetic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory of evolution provide a resonable (though partial)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; account for the &quot;technical&quot; capabilities of the human
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mind.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree that the theory of evolution has a great power of explanation. 
<br />
Roughly speaking, comp leads to a similar explanation for the origin of 
<br />
the physical laws, in terms of winning &quot;dreams&quot; where dreams are 
<br />
computations as seen from some first person point of view. The person 
<br />
point of view can be captured through the modal logic appearing 
<br />
naturally in computer science. It is not an evolution in time, but 
<br />
still an evolution in some logical space.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What remains unclear to me is &quot;consciousness&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The simplest explanation is that this is just the way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things appear to human organisms but I still find that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a bit short. Does Comp have more to say on this issue?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Comp can explain the whole picture minus one epsilon, but comp can 
<br />
explain why it is necessary that an epsilon will remain outside the 
<br />
explanation.
<br />
Precisely, once the identification between consciousness and first 
<br />
person view of self-consistency automated bet, comp can then explain:
<br />
<br />1) why consciousness is of the type true but uncommunicable, (and thus 
<br />
private);
<br />
2) self-speeding role of consciousness;
<br />
3) why it seems to be wholistic and integrated;
<br />
4) How consciousness of all lobian entities participate in the building 
<br />
of physical reality;
<br />
5) How consciousness can make you more clever;
<br />
6) How cleverness can make you LESS conscious;
<br />
7) Why there is something uncomputably more clever than a inference 
<br />
machine: two (or more) inference machines;
<br />
8) Why the errors, the illusions, the wrongness, the madness and 
<br />
eventually death (or its possibility) are needed for self-conscious 
<br />
expansion;
<br />
9) Why a tiny part of the mystery will necessarily remain, as far as we 
<br />
stay in the terrestrial or effective realm. It is an open problem to 
<br />
see if we can &quot;die alive&quot; and see truly beyond. My reading of Plotinus 
<br />
makes me think this should not be entirely unplausible with 
<br />
comp-weaker, but I'm not yet sure about that;
<br />
10) Why there is quantum and quale. Unexpected results: the quanta seem 
<br />
just to correspond to the first person plural notion of (sharable) 
<br />
qualia (part of this remains to be verified more accurately, though);
<br />
11) and then all this can be indirectly testable, given that with comp, 
<br />
the physical laws are entirely derivable by the consciousness theory 
<br />
attached to comp, and so we can derive physics from it and compare with 
<br />
the empirical physics. (Ah but this is the point 4, so I stop here).
<br />
<br />I certainly do think that comp explains a lot, although I believe the 
<br />
explanation comes more exactly from lobianity which is a consequence of 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;a much more general assumption like &quot;self-referential correctness&quot;. 
<br />
But then comp makes the reasoning easier.
<br />
<br />All this is explained in length in &quot;Conscience et Mécanisme&quot; (my 
<br />
Brussel's &quot;thesis&quot;). In France I have restricted myself (for the PhD at 
<br />
Lille) only on the comp *matter* theory.
<br />
<br />Hope I don't look too much pretentious but then the comp theory is 
<br />
already there, just waiting to be extended, or refuted, or corrected, 
<br />
or compared with similar of dissimilar approaches. Like in this list 
<br />
where many people shares some common intuition on fundamental 
<br />
questions, and are willing to discuss them.
<br />
<br />Bruno
