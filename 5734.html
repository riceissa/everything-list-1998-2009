John,
<br />
<br />I not sure whether we actually disagree about the human brain. Of course we 
<br />
can't say that our 2004 understanding of science is the final word on 
<br />
physics, or neuroscience, or anything else! There is much that we do not 
<br />
understand about the workings of the brain, just as there is much that we do 
<br />
not understand about, for example, how cancer develops, or the nature of 
<br />
black holes. But whatever the explanation behind brains, cancer and black 
<br />
holes is, even if we never actually discover it, it must be part of science. 
<br />
Now, do you agree with this last sentence, or do you believe that while 
<br />
cancer and black holes are subject to scientific laws, the human brain/mind 
<br />
works by some other process, outside the domain of science? This would then 
<br />
by definition be a supernatural explanation. I know that some people do in 
<br />
fact claim exactly this, but I have never encountered any plausible reason 
<br />
for such a claim.
<br />
<br />As for my reference to bats, I was alluding to a paper by philosopher Thomas 
<br />
Nagel, &quot;What Is It Like To Be A Bat?&quot;, exploring the nature of qualia. I 
<br />
believe it is available on the net if you search for it, although my copy is 
<br />
in the book by Hofstadter and Denett, &quot;The Mind's I&quot;, first published in 
<br />
1981 but still well worth reading.

I don't claim to know exactly how the human brain works, but I
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;do know (and so do you) that it works as the result of the complex

organisation
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of its constituent parts, (...)

[JM]:
<br />
I know it differently, unless you include into the 'constituent parts' of 
<br />
its COMPLEX ORGANIZATION more than just the flesh. Eg. the qualia of the 
<br />
organization (human) total. Besides for &quot;brain&quot; in such respect I understand 
<br />
more than the tissue filling the cranium. OR (if you wrote with an open mind 
<br />
for wholness-thinking beyond the
<br />
physics-books):
<br />
we have to agree that besides those physiological measurements on mostly 
<br />
(electro)chemistry of neuronal functions which are only a so-far detected 
<br />
(and studied) part of its function AND beyond those physical laws you 
<br />
mention as sacrosanct, there is more to be known (included). I want to bank 
<br />
on your subsequent expression:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;w-hich, like everything else in the universe,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interact according to the laws of physics, whatever those laws might be. &lt;
</em><br />
<br />-the &quot;whatever&quot;, if it means: 'unrestricted to the content of the 2004AD 
<br />
physics books'. My argument is: there was physics before the discovery of 
<br />
electricity or radioactivity and their discovery merged into 'physics' quite 
<br />
well, so I don't consider the 2004 'physics' as finally closed. (If you want 
<br />
to call it still 'physics').
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;As a matter of fact, I believe that consciousness (or qualia, or subjective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;experience) is something irreducible,...&lt;
</em><br />
<br />According to the 2004 status-quo of those (and only those) laws you 
<br />
mentioned. New discoveries may render them calculable (predictable?) by 
<br />
newly emerging parameters.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;... because even if we knew every detail
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;at the finest level of the workings of the brain of a bat, for example,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;there is still something we would not know: what it actually feels like to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be a bat. But it does not follow from this that there is something
</em><br />
magical -
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;meaning beyond the laws of physics - about consciousness.&lt;
</em><br />
<br />Please, don't substitute our human thinking for a bat-level mind. Such 
<br />
substitution is false. Hameroff and Penrose (JCS ~1992?) substituted the 
<br />
'bat' by a worm's feeling. I argued how wrong it is to think with our 
<br />
neuronal braincomplexity in terms of the ~1000 neurons of a worm. The 
<br />
complexity of the mind works WITH the material tool (10^11 neurons) and all 
<br />
that our present science is doing is to observe the tool-part and explain 
<br />
the whole (function) by the conclusions drawn therefrom (using the
<br />
word: somehow for the qualia-jump).
<br />
It is like explaining the car by the study of the piston and concluding that 
<br />
the piston is the cause of the running of the car. With proper conditioning 
<br />
(modeling, kept inside the adequately chosen boundaries) it may even be 
<br />
mathematically proven(?).
