</em><br />
<br />OK. I agree with that. But of course we differ on the meaning of
<br />
&quot;possible histories&quot;. And we tackle also the &quot;prior probability&quot;
<br />
in quite different ways. 
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Then, once we have observed a past history, we can use Bayes' rule to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;compute the probability of various futures, given the observations. Then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;we predict the most probable future.
</em><br />
<br /><br />It seems to me that Bayes' rule is what we *need* to build a plausible
<br />
*past* before, and concerning the future, and even the present, I prefer
<br />
a theory, or a philosophy (or religion), hoping it can put light on
<br />
the unknown.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The algorithmic TOE paper discusses several formally describable priors
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computable in the limit. But for the moment let me focus on my favorite,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the Speed Prior.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Mmh... You know that there exist class of infinitely speedable
<br />
programs (and theories), and even that those class correspond to a
<br />
superclass of universal machines. This entails the UD, 
<br />
the Universal Dovetailer, which I like to call sometimes
<br />
the 'splashed Universal Turing Machine',
<br />
(which btw makes UD* sort of denotational semantics of the UTM) could
<br />
generate and execute quicker and quicker version of itself. 
<br />
This means you need a non universal ontology. 
<br />
For helping other to understand the point I
<br />
propose to await discussing this point after I give the solution of the
<br />
problem in  &quot;diagonalisation 1&quot;: 
<br />
<a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m3079.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m3079.html</a>
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Assume the Great Programmer has a resource problem, just like any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;other programmer.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You told Wei Dai not taking the Great Programmer to seriously.
<br />
I am not sure I can imagine the Great Programmer having resource
<br />
problem. Unless you are a finitist! Knowing that the UTM emulating
<br />
the UD will use an unboundable part of its tape ...
<br />
How could the GP have a resource problem when he is the one
<br />
building universes in which resource problem can happen (apparently)?
<br />
Are you not presuposing some physical structure in advance somewhere?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;According to the Speed Prior, the harder it is to compute
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;something, the less likely it gets. More precisely, the cumulative prior
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probability of all data whose computation costs at least O(n) time is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;at most inversely proportional to n.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Very interesting idea. I would say: the harder it is to compute
<br />
something FROM here and now the less likely it gets from here and now. 
<br />
And I would
<br />
add that this is only true if your neighborhood is less complex than
<br />
yourself. I really believe your idea is interesting for some low level
<br />
computational physics. But when agent, including yourself, enters in the
<br />
play, its another matter, because it is intrinsically harder to compute
<br />
things then.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;To evaluate the plausibility of this, consider your own computer: most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;processes just take a few microseconds, some take a few seconds, few
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;take hours, very few take days, etc...
</em><br />
<br />?
<br />
In the work of the GP, that is in UD*, most processes takes billions
<br />
of googolplex kalpa ...
<br />
A lot of processes engaged by the UD simply does not stop.
<br />
Some are interesting and perhaps Turing Universal like the process
<br />
raising better and better approximations of the Mandelbrot
<br />
set. 
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;We do not know the Great Programmer's computer and algorithm for computing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;universe histories and other things. Still, we know that he cannot do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it more efficiently than the asymptotically fastest algorithm.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Are you really sure about that. If the GP is really *the* GP,
<br />
existing by Church Thesis, I think it follows from Blum Speed-up
<br />
Theorem that it has no asymptotically fastest algorithm.
<br />
But you are talking of &quot;our little program&quot; generated and executed
<br />
by the UD perhaps.
<br />
If this one has an asymptotically fastest algorithm, are you sure it
<br />
still can emulate a UTM? I bet the &quot;universe&quot; is universal.
<br />
Also:  how could we know and test we are in a quick or slow version of 
<br />
that little program. Is that not (absolutely) undecidable.
<br />
Should that program really be run? If yes, are you not presupposing
<br />
again a physical universe?
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The Speed Prior reflects properties of precisely this optimal algorithm.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It turns out that the best way of predicting future y, given past x,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is to minimize the (computable) Kt-complexity of (x,y).  As observation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;size grows, the predictions converge to the optimal predictions.
</em><br />
<br /><br />As observation grows knowledge grows, and we grows making everything
<br />
more complex that before. I guess you mean &quot;optimal predictions&quot; at 
<br />
some level. With comp the more knowledge grows, the more ignorance
<br />
grows.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;To address Bruno Marchal's questions: Many of my duplications in parallel
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;universes with identical past x will experience different futures y.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;None of my copies knows a priori which one it is. But each does know:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Those futures y with high Kt(x,y) will be highly unlikely; those with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;low Kt(x,y) won't.
</em><br />
<br /><br />It is indeed hard to write a little program which generate a long
<br />
Kolmogorov-Chaitin incompressible 01 string.
<br />
But, as I told you earlier, it is quite easy to write a little
<br />
program which generates them all. (It is the essence of the
<br />
everything idea imo).
<br />
<br />Take for exemple the iterated duplication experience/experiment. 
<br />
It can be automated by a very simple program. After 64 iterations
<br />
there will be 1,84467.10^19 agents, and most of them will have
<br />
an incompressible 01-history. With the comp indeterminism it is
<br />
much more likely you will get such a really random string 
<br />
(independently of the fact that you will be unable to prove it is
<br />
really random). Those with computable strings will be exceptional, so
<br />
that, if those agents work together they will consider (even with
<br />
Bayes) that the simple self-multiplying algorithm is the simplest
<br />
and shorter explanation, for those randomeness appearances.
<br />
