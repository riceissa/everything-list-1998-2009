Hi Hal,
<br />
<br />I don't follow you very well, and I tried to ask you two times a question 
<br />
which does not seems to be of interrest to respond (or maybe my english is so 
<br />
bad, that it doesn't mean anything ?). But I'll try once more.
<br />
<br />What I understand from that is as if you could influence probabilty, as if 
<br />
knowing something or acting in some way will change your &quot;future&quot; Hal by 
<br />
having him &quot;good moments&quot;... But if at every choice, every results exists 
<br />
(whatever the measures of each one).. Some Hal are always garanteed to have a 
<br />
&quot;bad' experience and some other garanteed to have a &quot;good&quot; experience, 
<br />
whatever you knew before the choice, whatever the measure. So my question is 
<br />
how could you think acting &quot;good&quot; change anything in this matter ? And also 
<br />
what is &quot;good&quot; and what is not &quot;good&quot; and how you classify these ?
<br />
<br />Thank you
<br />
Quentin Anciaux

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To clarify, I did indeed mean the equivalent of this latter case,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where by some means on even numbered days I had more measure, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on odd numbered days my measure was then reduced to a lower amount.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This might be done as you say by running a computer in lockstep with my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mind on even days and shutting it off on odd days, if you accept that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doing so will increase the measure of the even days.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My message is at <a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m6592.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m6592.html</a> .
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The argument is fundamentally that creating a bunch of good experiences is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; better than creating a bunch of bad ones.  Shutting the computer down
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doesn't matter.  That just means that the good experiences won't be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; remembered.  But they were still real, they were still experienced.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; After all, many people believe our own lives are finite in extent and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that after we die we will have no more memories of our lives.  But they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (mostly) don't conclude from that that it is irrelevant whether people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suffer or experience pleasure.  Even finite lives deserve to be as happy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as possible.  This is true whether they last for one day or 100 years.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And worse, almost all of the moments of our lives are forgotten within
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; days if not minutes.  Most moments make essentially no impact on our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; memories.  We can't remember what it felt like to brush our teeth on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; February 9.  Yet, even knowing this, we still try to make our lives as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pleasant and comfortable as we can.  Even though we would have known
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (had we thought about it) as we were brushing our teeth that day, that we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would not remember that moment, that it would soon be forgotten as surely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as if we had never lived it, we would still try to make the experience
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as pleasant and non-painful as possible.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; All these examples are meant to show that we act as though we care about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; giving good experiences even though we know they will be forgotten and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not have lasting impact.  If we extend that principle more generally,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think it follows that we should try to have good experiences on days
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; when we have high measure.
