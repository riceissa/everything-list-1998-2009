<br />
Here's a simple idea you might find interesting, or at least amusing.
<br />
<br />What is the measure of a transcript of The Phantom Menace? We can define
<br />
it to be its Solomonoff-Levin probability. The problem is that we must
<br />
decide on a UTM model (as opposed to a turing machine, which is its
<br />
bitstring + model). The compiler theorem saves the day by declaring that
<br />
we can prepend a bitstring to emulate other models. And the complexity
<br />
increase can not be greater than the length of this bitstring.
<br />
<br />Still, if I cook up a model that outputs the transcript of The Phantom
<br />
Menace if the first bit is '1', the measure can be said to be greater
<br />
than 1/2 (not with a straight face, though). Any hopes for an absolute
<br />
measure of a 'world', 'brain-state' or whatever are crushed. We could,
<br />
of course, stick with a 'normal' turing machine model and hope that it's
<br />
good enough. But this choice feels a bit arbitrary somehow.
<br />
<br />Perhaps one could assign a measure to the models? We could then hope
<br />
that models that are prone to output The Phantom Menace are given a low
<br />
measure. So, let us try:
<br />
O(p,m_A)=Output for model m_A, given a bitstring p.
<br />
M(m_A,m_B,N)=(number of bitstrings u~ of length N such that, for an
<br />
initial fraction u of u~, and for any bitstring p, O(u+p,m_B)=O(p,m_A)
<br />
)/1^2N
<br />
M(m_A,m_B)=lim(M(m_A,m_B,N),N-&gt;inf)
<br />
(1) sum(M(m_A,m_B)M(m_B)-M(m_B,m_A)M(m_A),m_B)=0
<br />
M(m_A)&gt;=0 for all m_A
<br />
sum(M(m_A),m_A)=1
<br />
<br />M(m_A,m_B) is roughly the 'ease' of having model m_B emulate model m_A.
<br />
Then we let the models 'rate' each other. That way, hopefully,
<br />
complicated models will get low measures. We could then truly define an
<br />
absolute measure
<br />
M(s,m_A)=Solomonoff-Levin probability of s, using the model m_A.
<br />
(2) M(s)=sum(M(s,m_A)M(m_A),m_A)
<br />
<br />Ok, but is there a unique non-trivial solution to the system of
<br />
equations (1)? It's an infinite order homogenous matrix equation. One
<br />
way of solving systems of linear equations is to let them define a set
<br />
of linear first order differential equations. A simple picture of this
<br />
is a graph with measure 'flowing' between the nodes. The structure of
<br />
(1) ensures that total measure is conserved. There's probably a plethora
<br />
of theorems on solvability of these types of systems in queue-theory and
<br />
even FEM analysis. I think it's a safe guess that there is at least one
<br />
solution. The problem is that it sounds plausible that there are several
<br />
solutions. Technically, we could still hope that (2) is well defined,
<br />
even if there are more than one solution, but it doesn't sound likely.
<br />
Also, this definition of measure could perhaps be claimed to be just as
<br />
arbitrary as simply sticking with a simple enough turing machine model.
<br />
<br />But let us pretend that the equations have a unique solution. Then we
<br />
can ask ourselves why we have to stick with universal turing machines.
<br />
These equations should work just as well/badly for general operators -
<br />
i.e. something that takes something and spits out something else. Well,
<br />
to make the definition of measure work without alteration, we should
<br />
perhaps stick with input as bitstrings. All we need is an equivalence
<br />
operator such that we can compare the output of two models, given a
<br />
bitstring. Etc...
<br />
<br />Disclaimer: Most of this stuff is probably old news/proven flawed, but I
<br />
plead incompetence.
