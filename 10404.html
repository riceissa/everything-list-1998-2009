<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Both have equal access to qualia as evidence. Qualia are evidence for

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; literally 'are' the universe but are merely 'about' it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For the record, how (if at all) does this differ from Chalmers'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; property dualism and his programme for 'psycho-physical laws'? And is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; his 'conceivability' of structure (ll) without appearance (l) relevant
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in your approach? This is where I part company from him. My
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conceivability apparatus just can't come up with this. For me a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; situation that doesn't know itself needs a mediator (little observer)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to do the knowing, and we know where that leads...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />No homunculus. I'm not sure of chalmers' 'conceivability'. It's a while
<br />
since I read him. But I think it might be relevant. The key to it is when
<br />
you realise that the structure (II) actually delivers the appearance (I) of
<br />
the rest of the structure. That is actually a defining criteria limiting
<br />
possibilities for the possible structures and any structural primitive used
<br />
in same. 
<br />
<br />There is no dualism here. The simplest solution is a monism of a posited
<br />
structural primitive, say, S(.). The universe is a structure of organised
<br />
S(.). One type and one type only. The structure itself is simply and
<br />
necessarily a hierarchically organised massive collection of S(.). In this
<br />
hierarchy the behaviour that generates appearances and that which does not
<br />
are indistinguishable. The whole question changes to one of visibility.
<br />
<br />As to physho-physical laws.... in consideration of hierarchical
<br />
organisations of a structural primitive one or more fundamental principles
<br />
are (will be) proven to be true _because_ qualia exist. Only when we let
<br />
ourselves look at such monisms will we be able to see what the parameters of
<br />
such fundamental laws might be. Then we may be able to devise tests that
<br />
take the structure to novel behavioural places...and the usual experimental
<br />
regime ... and science marches on....the sorts of experimental regimes I am
<br />
thinking of are the AI and 'asking it' (in a hardware sense) &quot;what it is
<br />
like&quot;....unlike with biology we can merge their brains and get them to see
<br />
what each other sees. The whole evidence problem goes away.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Qualia(appearances) are only intractible because we keep insisting on &amp;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; trying to use qualia (appearances, our scientific evidence) to explain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; them! Is it only me that sees that when the scientific evidence system
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (qualia) is applied to collect evidence in favour of a &quot;science of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; qualia&quot;, a science of _our evidence system_!!, that the evidence system
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; breaks down?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Can you say more about how a structure (ll) science approaches this?
</em><br />
<br />A structure that, from any point of view can, in principle supply a
<br />
perspective view of any other part of the structure is such a thing.
<br />
Cellular automata are one such structure (not a computer program, but
<br />
reality as a massively parallel cellular automata of S(.) )
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; FYI
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ['unsituated' means that the scientist is, despite the observer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dependence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; characterised by quantum mechanics, surgically excised from the universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; by the demand for an objective view that does not exist. 'Situated'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; science puts the scientist back inside the universe with the studied
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; items. Note that science only needs OBJECTIVITY (a behaviour) not a real
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'objective view' to construct correlations of type I (above). Dual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aspect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; science disposes of the cultish need for a delusion of a 3rd person view
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, this is broadly what I was aiming at with '1st-person primacy',
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; using words like 'embedded', 'present', etc. - but 'situated' is good,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'll adopt it.
</em><br />
<br />'SITUATEDNESS' is a very good standard term to use. There are mountains of
<br />
books on SITUATED AGENCY. It's quite well traveled, especially in computer
<br />
science, but also in biology (try and understand an elephant outside its
<br />
habitat!).
<br />
<br />What has not been done is to treat that biology called &quot;the scientist&quot; as a
<br />
situated agent inside its own habitat: the universe.
<br />
<br />&quot;Mysterious observer dependence&quot; in QM is not so mysterious when you
<br />
actually put the scientist inside the picture. Why not put the scientist
<br />
back inside the universe instead of objectively declaring something
<br />
'mysterious'! If situatedness is an intrinsic part of the mechanism behind
<br />
qualia generation...qualia would look really mysterious, wouldn't it? 
<br />
<br />Think about it...When you put the scientist back inside the picture, the
<br />
measurement process (qualia) that literally are qualia is directly causally
<br />
linked to the appearance you get! The underlying structure unifies the whole
<br />
system. Of course you'll get some impact via the causality of the
<br />
structure....via the deep structure right down into the very fabric of
<br />
space.
<br />
<br />In a very real way the existence of 'mysterious observer dependence' is
<br />
actually proof that the hierarchically organised S(.) structure idea must be
<br />
somewhere near the answer. 
<br />
<br />Note that we don't actually have to know what S(.) is to make a whole pile
<br />
of observations of properties of organisations of it that apply regardless
<br />
of the particular S(.). It may be we never actually get to sort out the
<br />
specifics of S(.)! (I have an idea, but it doesn't matter from the point of
<br />
view of understanding qualia as another property of the structure like
<br />
atoms).
<br />
<br />In Bruno's terms the structure of S(.) is what he calls 'objective reality'.
<br />
I would say that in science the first person view has primacy. I'd say that
<br />
we formulate abstractions that correlate with agreed appearances within the
<br />
first person view. However, the correspo0ndence between the underlying
<br />
structure and the formulate abstractions is only that - a correlation. Our
<br />
models are not the structure. The 'objective view' is virtual (like russel
<br />
said). I don't think we need any more jargon than that.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is another aspect, which I've been musing about again since my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; most recent exchanges with Peter. This is that if one is to take
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seriously (and I do) 'structural' or 'block' views such as MWI, it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seems to me that whatever is behaving 'perceivingly', '1st-personally',
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or 'subjectly' (gawd!) is the gestalt, not any particular abstraction
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; therefrom. It seems to me that this is necessary to yield:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) The unnameability of the 1st-person (i.e. 'this observer situation')
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) The consequential validity (?) of any probability calculus of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer situations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3) The dynamic quality of time as experienced (i.e. contrast between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'figure' and 'ground')
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4) Meta-experiential layering - e.g. 'coherent histories' of observer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; situations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Any views on this?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; David
</em><br />
<br />Yes....all these things rely on perceptual mechanisms which will
<br />
never...repeat...never...be found in quantum mechanics....nor any other
<br />
depiction of appearances.
<br />
<br />I recommend to stop trying to make/understand a universe by fiddling with
<br />
the appearance of quantum mechanics!...by inventing multiple universes and
<br />
all those other complexities...we simply do not need them...The universe is
<br />
NOT made of quantum mechanics! Nor is it made of any mathematical concoction
<br />
of circumstances designed to find a domain from which QM could be said to
<br />
'be' the universe. Deal with a reality that appears _to us_ like QM!
<br />
<br />The universe is made of a structure that behaves quantum-mechanical-ly when
<br />
our appearance generation system (the scientist) literally physically and
<br />
causally invades the universe at ultra-scale dimensions for the purposes of
<br />
perceiving it (no matter how tortuously long that causality trail might seem
<br />
to us).
<br />
<br />This is a completely different approach.
<br />
<br />The assumption that (QM = the structure) is the big problem here. QM is a
<br />
mathematical model of what our appearances see, not what the universe
<br />
actually is. Models of appearances (like QM) and models of structure (does
<br />
not exist yet) are two equally valid representations of the same thing and
<br />
they come about because we are literally part of the structure. Neither
<br />
model _are_ the 'structure' they are merely _about_ the structure. Qualia
<br />
are scientific evidence for both.
<br />
<br />I'd recommend spending time working on structures that 'look like' QM when
<br />
you are part of the structure.
<br />
<br />Make sense? I'll keep saying this until it sinks in. Somebody other than me
<br />
has to see this!
