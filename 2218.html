<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  what Eve should think,  she then average[s] over all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  observer-branch-moments which she, for all she  knows, might
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  currently be.
</em><br />
<br />This looks like a natural suggestion but it is not possible in my
<br />
version of the many-minds interpretation.  
<br />
<br />The problem here, relevant to any ``theory of everything'' or
<br />
any theory potentially compatible with a quantization of general
<br />
relativity, is to what extent the observer-moments of different
<br />
observers can be ordered.
<br />
<br />In the simple version of my many-minds theory, the probabilities of
<br />
different observer-histories can be calculated, given a quantum
<br />
field theory and a quantum state omega.  Omega is Everett's
<br />
``uncollapsing'' ``universal wave-function''.  It can be thought of as
<br />
an initial state, and I postulate that it is a particularly simple
<br />
state -- a vacuum state, for example.  
<br />
<br />Individual observer histories arise as possible sequences of
<br />
apparent ``wave-packet collapses'' each beginning separately from
<br />
omega.
<br />
<br />Because this is a many-minds theory, each individual observer
<br />
carries in his own history all the information which makes him who
<br />
he is.  Part of that information is his idea of past history prior to
<br />
his birth.  For us, therefore, the individual dinosaurs roaming the
<br />
earth millions of years ago are like so many Schroedinger's cats:
<br />
until we observe specific traces, their lives and deaths are
<br />
undecided possibilities.  The traces of them that we may potentially
<br />
observe in our futures are also undecided possibilities and so are
<br />
the number of our ancestors, the number of planets with observers,
<br />
the precise age and size of the universe, and our exact birth rank.
<br />
<br />Thus we cannot define ``birth rank as [ ] position in the class of all
<br />
[ ] observer-branch-moments''.  The best we can do is to look at an
<br />
observer's own personal current evidence as to his birth rank.  This
<br />
can be quite ambiguous and, in general, will be a matter for
<br />
interpretation rather than mathematical definition.
<br />
<br />I wrote
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Only if there was a class of observers all of whom are like Eve
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  except that they have different birth ranks would there be an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  objective probability which Eve could use as a genuine measure of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  the improbability of her birth rank.  But such classes are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  undefinable, even in my theory in which the set of all observers is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  well-defined and countable, because hints about her birth rank
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  have been built into everything Eve has ever known about herself.
</em><br />
<br />Bostrom replied
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  That wouldn't make it undefinable, just small. But for reasons
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  spelled  out in my dissertation, I think observer-moments should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  be grouped in the same reference class even when they are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  subjectively distinguishable, and I'm aware of no reason to limit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  this only to observer-moments that are subjectively distinct
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  only regarding their knowledge of their birth ranks but not in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  other ways.
</em><br />
<br />When I said ``undefinable'', I was speaking as a mathematician.  I
<br />
meant that I believe that there is no conceivable algorithm which
<br />
could take elements of the set of observers as I define it
<br />
(well-defined and countable although that is) and attach
<br />
unambiguous birth ranks to each one of them.  It is even less
<br />
plausible that there is an algorithm which will tell us whether a
<br />
possible observer is ``like Eve'' or not.  And even at the handwaving
<br />
level, I claim that ``like Eve'' can only be interpreted either
<br />
in a wide sense as ``like a woman'' or in a much more narrow sense
<br />
as ``like a woman who has considerable and lifelong evidence of
<br />
social isolation''.   This implies that, although it may be
<br />
reasonable for Eve to find her birth rank or social isolation
<br />
improbable, she should not expect to be able to define a precise
<br />
quantification of that improbability.  
<br />
<br />Moreover, we understand probability best when it is applied to
<br />
situations in which we can distinguish sequences of simple repeated
<br />
events with different possible outcomes which have occurred, or at
<br />
least could occur, under the observation of a single individual.  My
<br />
comments are also intended to stress how little Eve's social
<br />
isolation is like that paradigm.
<br />
<br />Bostrom wrote
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  You know what you are; no matter how improbable, you just have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  to take that for granted. The question is what else is true about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  the world.
</em><br />
<br />As I see it, *the question* is rather ``Given what I have learned
<br />
from my life up to now, how should I predict my future?''
<br />
<br />To answer this question, I do have to consider how improbable my
<br />
past observations would be under different possible physical
<br />
theories.  I can accept a considerable amount of personal
<br />
improbability either if it is inevitable -- I do have to be born
<br />
somewhen -- or as the price of a beautiful and simple overall
<br />
theory.
