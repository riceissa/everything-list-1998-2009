</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; OK, but the point is that the basic definition of &quot;bad&quot; is arbitrary.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps, but honestly I am not sure. In acomp, we can define a (very 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; platonist) notion of &quot;bad&quot;. The simpler and stronger one is just the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; falsity &quot;f&quot;. Then Bf, BBf, BBBf, BBBBf, BBBBBf, etc. gives a sequence 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of less and less badness, which translated in the Z (material) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hypostases gives the Df, DDf, DDDf, DDDDf, DDDDDf ... which are better 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; candidates for that notion of badness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (recall that G does not prove Bf -&gt; f, and that G* proves DBf (the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; astonishing godelian consistency of being inconsistent).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (note also that G* *does* prove Bf -&gt; f).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It might seem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that there would be some consensus, for example that torturing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; innocent people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is an example of &quot;bad&quot;, but it is possible to assert without fear of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; logical or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; empirical contradiction that torturing innocent people is good.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I disagree. Mainly for the reason alluded above. Please note I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand that there is no purely logical contradiction (f) in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; asserting that &quot;torture&quot; is good, but the purely logical operates at 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the third person level, in which there is no &quot;pain&quot; at all. Once you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; take incompleteness into account this should be much less evident, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; much more fuzzy. There is nothing illogical with an altimeter (in a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; plane) giving a wrong information (like the plane is at altitude = 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1000, instead of the correct 500), but you can understand this can lead 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to a catastrophe. Any BB...Bf can be seen as a promise for a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; catastrophe.

</em><br />
But there is no true/false in saying that torture is bad, unless there is another 
<br />
hidden assumption such as &quot;causing gratuitous suffering is bad&quot;, in which case 
<br />
the question becomes, why is causing gratuitous suffering bad? Ultimately you 
<br />
get to &quot;it just is, so there!&quot; It is the same in aesthetics: ultimately, you have to 
<br />
assert that you think this looks better than that because that's just what you 
<br />
think. 

<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; There are people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in the world who do in fact think there is nothing wrong with torture 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and although
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; they are not very nice peopel, they are not as a result of having such 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a belief deluded.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Honestly I doubt it. Of course some people can believe that torture can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be good for their own life, in case torture can prevent the enemy to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; drop some bomb. Of course some people are cynical and can, like Sade, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; defend torture with the (wrong imo) idea that nature &quot;defends&quot; the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; right of those who have the powers and thus that they have the right to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; follow their sexual perverse compulsion, but this could mean that they 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are inconsistent (they have some BBB...Bf as implicit belief). Then 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from the divine (starred G*) pov, they are (globally) inconsistent 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (although cannot know it).

</em><br />
What would you say to the Romans who attended events at the Colliseum, 
<br />
and thought there was nothing wrong at all with feeding people to wild animals? 
<br />
What would you say to an alien species which had reached a high level of 
<br />
technological development by routinely killing the less intelligent portion of the 
<br />
population in order to control their numbers and improve the gene pool? What 
<br />
would you say to a citizen of Nazi Germany 70 years down the track if Hitler had 
<br />
succeeded in conquering Europe and every schoolchild had grown up learning 
<br />
what a great man he was? You could try to persuade them that your values were 
<br />
better and nobler, but you couldn't persuade them that your values are more 
<br />
rational or more consistent with the facts, because they aren't. 

<br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Recall that even the (although very familiar) notion of natural 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; numbers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; or integers cannot be defined unambiguously in science. Science asks 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; us
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; only to be clear on primitive principles so that we can share some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; reasoning on those undefinable entities.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But there is a big difference between Pythagoras saying 17 is prime 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and Pythagoras
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; saying that eating beans is bad. You can't say that &quot;prime&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; are equivalent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in that they both need to be axiomatically defined.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hmmm... &quot;prime&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; cannot be equivalent in that sense. But 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;being a natural number&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; can. The nuance is that I grant the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; notion of natural number before defining &quot;prime&quot;. But my belief in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; natural numbers (my belief in the standard model of Peano Arithmetic, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Arithmetical truth) is as hard, even impossible, to define than is the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; notion of truth, good, etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Defining &quot;Prime&quot; is easy: (~(x = 1) &amp; Ay(y divides x) -&gt; (y = 1 v y = 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; x)) where (a divides b) is a macro for Ez(az = b).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Defining &quot;number&quot; is just not possible actually. Even with a richer 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory or second order logic you will have to rely implicitly on the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; standard model of the higher theory, which is less palatable than the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;standard model&quot; of PA.

</em><br />
There are several differences between the axioms of ethics and aesthetics on 
<br />
the one hand and those of logic, mathematics and science on the other. One is 
<br />
that you can bet that any sentient species would arrive at exactly the same rules 
<br />
of arithmetic and chemistry, but might have completely bizarre, or at least very 
<br />
different, notions of ethics and aesthetics. Another is that matters of ethics and 
<br />
aesthetics are not really third person communicable: an alien species may have 
<br />
notions about these that can only be understood by someone with their psychology. 
<br />
This is because ethics and aesthetics at a fundamental level involve emotion, whereas 
<br />
science and logic do not. An unconscious machine might systematically churn out 
<br />
mathematical theorems, but it won't ever provide an honest opinion as to whether 
<br />
eating beans is good or bad. Finally, although in scientific discourse people might 
<br />
eventually concede that they are dealing with axioms, in ethics especially this is 
<br />
often taken as offensive, and part of the purpose of religion is to give an absolute 
<br />
status to which at some level everyone knows is not absolute.

<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The problem is that some people think &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; are on a par 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; descriptive terms that every sentient species, regardless of their 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; psychology,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; could agree on. They are not.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not in any normative sense. But once we bet on a theory (like comp), 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then we get mathematical tools which can provide general explanation of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what is bad, and also explain why such definition cannot be normative, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; making the bad/good distinctions an ideal goal for complex sufficiently 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-sustaining machines societies.

</em><br />
What if they're Nazi machines?

<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Every sentient species would agree that a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; nuclear bomb going off in your face will kill you,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bad example for this list!  (CF quantum immortality or comp 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; immortality!). But ok, this is besides the point.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; but some would say this was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; good and others would say it was bad.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, but unless people are insane, most will give or try to give a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ratio. In such case it is a question of utility with respect of some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; notion of good and bad. It is not related with the hardness to define 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; completely what is good and what is bad. Like killing. Killing can be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; considered as bad but can be accepted in self-defense.

</em><br />
I am touched by your confidence that the rational will lead to the good, 
<br />
and I wish it were so, but it isn't and it never has been. I would only be 
<br />
a little less frightened of a rational murderous regime than of an irrational 
<br />
one.
