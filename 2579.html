<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;         Umm, let me break this down into chucks and try to see if we
</em><br />
are understanding
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; each other. My notion of a &quot;previous time&quot; was couched within a
</em><br />
notion that is similar
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to J. A. Wheeler's notion of a &quot;Surprise 20 Questions Game&quot; and I
</em><br />
did not state so
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; explicitly. I am playing with the idea that time is a &quot;first person&quot;
</em><br />
attribute and thus
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is not to be considered as &quot;objective&quot; nor absolute (as in the
</em><br />
Newtonian sense). I think
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that our ideas are similar but we may have semantic differences
</em><br />
here. ;-)
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [GL]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK but I am not familiar with Wheeler's game.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a good on-line elaboration of Wheeler's idea:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://suif.stanford.edu/~jeffop/WWW/wheeler.txt">http://suif.stanford.edu/~jeffop/WWW/wheeler.txt</a>
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My thinking generalizes to were we have to consider many
<br />
concurrently existing games, e.g.,
<br />
each observer would be a Questioner and it's Universe would be the
<br />
Answerer, or something along
<br />
that line. The game semantics and logics used would fall under the
<br />
computational concurrency
<br />
umbrella.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; [GL]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; In addition, the conscious points are multiply connected and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; connections are a function of the points themselves. In other
</em><br />
words each point could
<br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; have several priors and several successors.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     I would agree, but I would argue that we could cause some
</em><br />
confusion if we are not
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; careful.  We have to distinguish the a priori possible (or probable)
</em><br />
experiences from
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the a posteriori experiences themselves.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [GL]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't think I follow you. There is no such a thing as &quot;probable.&quot;
</em><br />
All connections are
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; actualized albeit in different degrees according to their RELATIVE
</em><br />
measures. We now get into
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the discussion of measure which has been endlessly debated before.
</em><br />
Suffice to say that I
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think that while measure can be relatively different between two
</em><br />
transitions, there is NO
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; WAY to establish an ABSOLUTE value for measure because of the infinity
</em><br />
of the plenitude.
<br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results of observations are &quot;probable&quot; prior to the actual
<br />
instatiation of a particular
<br />
observation. I am merely retaining as much of the structure of QM as
<br />
possible since &quot;it works&quot;.
<br />
;-)  I agree that there is no absolute value for the same reason that
<br />
there is no unique inner
<br />
product for the linear vector space of the states that represents the
<br />
complete and mutually
<br />
exclusive set of observations or occurrences prior to a particular
<br />
instatiation. (See Lee
<br />
Smolin's paper: Space and Time in the Quantum Universe for a good
<br />
discussion of this.) Perhaps
<br />
what you refer to as relative measure is similar to my idea. I am
<br />
considering the idea that each
<br />
observer (consciousness point) has its own set of a priori probable
<br />
observations, it is when we
<br />
introduce the possibility of communication between observers that these
<br />
sets alter...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [GL]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (i.e., Loosely speaking,  if each transition has infinite measure, the
</em><br />
only way to compare
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; two transitions is to take the limit of their ratios.)  Hence,
</em><br />
relatively to the observer,
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; his own measure can always be assumed to be one. This remains true as
</em><br />
long as the number of,
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or magnitude of the adversities in his environment remains of a lower
</em><br />
cardinality than his
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; own measure. When the adversities are too severe then his
</em><br />
consciousness stops from
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; propagating (being linked) to those very adverse states. It's kind of
</em><br />
a Cosmological
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Principle.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is interesting! Do you have more information on that?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I am exploring the idea that communication
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; between observers plays an important role in restricting and/or
</em><br />
distinguishing the two.
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I hope that you understand this difference between a priori and a
</em><br />
posteriori that I am
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; writing about. ;-)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [GL]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't understand. In the constext of Markov chain, all the
</em><br />
information is contained in the
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; current states.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right, but consider how it is that &quot;current states&quot; are concatenated
<br />
(strung together),
<br />
especially when you have to consider concurrency issues.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; [GL]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; The structure is &quot;web-like.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     Yes, I agree. I have been exploring this idea with several
</em><br />
people for some time
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; using the notions of Leibniz and Spinoza. Let me recap. Are you
</em><br />
saying that conscious
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; points (I can them them &quot;monads&quot; ala Leibniz) has a &quot;web-like
</em><br />
structure?&quot;
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [GL]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Kind of. They are connected by a web-like set of allowed logical
</em><br />
transitions.
<br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree. But could you get into detail on the nature of &quot;allowed&quot;?
<br />
What is the constraint?
<br />
(I think that all that is needed is the weak anthropic principle but I
<br />
could be missing
<br />
something.)  I think that we should consider the rule &quot;All is allowed
<br />
that is not Forbidden&quot; (by
<br />
logical contradiction) instead of the usual notion &quot; All is forbidden
<br />
that is not allowed&quot; (by
<br />
prespecification, e.g. a priori algorithms) Peter Wegner has done a lot
<br />
of research on this
<br />
issue:

<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; [GL]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; (The universe does not just splits with each Quantum event, it can
</em><br />
also merge)
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     Umm, here I have a problem! You say that the universe splits and
</em><br />
merges;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [GL]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sorry! In an effort to communicate, I was employing terms used in the
</em><br />
popular literature
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about the MWI. I should NOT have said that the universe &quot;splits.&quot; It's
</em><br />
not the universe that
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; splits and merge. It's our conscious flow through the interconnections
</em><br />
between the OM or
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious points. Schoedinger equation really describes the spread of
</em><br />
our consciousness
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; through the web.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok, when we agree.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [GL]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I think it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; best to view each points as a set of states independent of past
</em><br />
information (i.e.,
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; first order Markov chain). To make sense, a transition needs only
</em><br />
satisfy the
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; current states. The &quot;past&quot; states are irrelevant or ambiguous.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     We could think of the splitting and merging as local topological
</em><br />
properties of a
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; multiply connected manifold and I think that such a thought would be
</em><br />
in line with the
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; idea of first order Markov chains, but I am not sure now you are
</em><br />
thinking about how the
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; points are related (via transitions). It is obvious that &quot;past
</em><br />
states&quot; refer to
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; information that is encoded within the current state and that is
</em><br />
what I meant by my
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; statement. I think that we agree that the &quot;past&quot; is not something
</em><br />
that is &quot;out there&quot;
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; outside of the experience of the present moment. ;-)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [GL]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree with this.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     I am interested in your thoughts of Pratt et al's ideas. ;-)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sorry. Pardon my ignorance. I don't know who Pratt is. Would he be by
</em><br />
any chance one of the
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; two guys who make airplane engines. ;-)
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it is Vaughan Pratt and the Stanford Concurrency Group:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;<a href="http://boole.stanford.edu/chuguide.html">http://boole.stanford.edu/chuguide.html</a>
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;[SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     Ok, would we agree that the anthropic principle (weak?) is true
</em><br />
in the sense that
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; any observer will have first person perspectives (experiences) that
</em><br />
have a probability
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of 1 if and only if such are consistent with its existence. Also, if
</em><br />
you are going to
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; say that consciousness is a static phenomenon then could you explain
</em><br />
how the appearance
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of change comes about?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [GL]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In the same way a derivative describes movement while being itself
</em><br />
static.The logical links
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would have to contain directionality information.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure, I agree in principle with that but it is easy to see that
<br />
something somehow IS
<br />
changing. A purely static model of the Universe only need apply to the
<br />
Totality of existence
<br />
itself, there are several theorems and demonstrations that show that one
<br />
can recover motion and
<br />
change from a static and timeless totality. For instance see:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.kitada.com/#time">http://www.kitada.com/#time</a>
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Have you by chance read Julian Barbour's book The End of Time?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [GL]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sorry, I didn't have a chance.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is worth your time! I don't agree with Barbour's conclusions but
<br />
I still recommend it.
<br />
;-) It is almost as good as Penrose's The Emperor's New Mind...
