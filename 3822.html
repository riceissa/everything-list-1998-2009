<br />I'm not sure I do understand it. Do you think the &quot;measure of comp 
<br />
indeterminacy&quot; is relevant in decision theory? Before you answer that 
<br />
question, please read the book _Foundations of Causal Decision Theory_ 
<br />
that I recommended earlier so you can understand what it is that I'm 
<br />
asking. If the answer is yes, then please explain how it can be used in 
<br />
decision theory. If the answer is no, then I believe the &quot;lemma&quot; is 
<br />
meaningless.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps the trouble is that you are not really aware of the mind-body
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem?
</em><br />
<br />I'm aware of *a* mind-body problem. I'm not sure if it's the same one you 
<br />
have in mind. The one I have in mind is this: how do I derive a 
<br />
probability distribution for the (absolute) SSA from a third-person 
<br />
description of the multiverse?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't yet understand how Schmidhuber attach the mind to its computa-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tional history.
</em><br />
<br />I don't either, but I don't think he's claiming to have solved it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is where the list splits in two. Those aware of a measure problem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and the other ... It is linked to our all debate between RSSA and ASSA
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Relative Self-Sampling Assumption/Absolute SSA).
</em><br />
<br />I guess we're going in circles a little bit, except I now have a better
<br />
understanding of how decision theory would work given the absolute SSA. (I
<br />
still have to write down my thoughts on this matter.) But I still do not
<br />
see how it could work with the RSSA.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Because we want to understand the nature of reality and where does it comes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from. 
</em><br />
<br />I think we can do that without first-person indeterminancy.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Consciousness is part of the data we must explain, 
</em><br />
<br />That's still a hard problem (i.e. we have no theory of consciousness) but 
<br />
I don't see how first-person indeterminancy helps.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; physicals laws also. 
</em><br />
<br />I think that's fairly easy, at least conceptually. It's &quot;just&quot; a matter of 
<br />
showing that almost all observer-moments are experiencing or 
<br />
remembering lawful phenomena. Again, I think that can be done without 
<br />
first-person indeterminancy.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; With comp the laws emerge from the relation between numbers, but as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seen from inside, so that I don't see how to avoid the modal distinctions in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a search toward a toe. I think you fail to appreciate the &quot;proof&quot; character
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the uda.
</em><br />
<br />What axioms are you assuming for the proof?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm not sure you are not a sound machine especially when proving
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things on numbers. In the worst case take my &quot;restriction&quot; as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simplifying assumption. But I don't think there is any restriction here.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The amazing fact is that the sound machine has (through the Z logics) an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; amazingly large non-monotonical layer. Remember that &quot;inconsistency&quot; has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; been shown consistent in Peano Arithmetic, ZF theory, etc. Sound machines,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sound at the basic level I interrogate them, can be consistently very unsound
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; once entangled to deep computational histories. I am taking the full nuance
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; given by the second incompleteness theorem into account here.
</em><br />
<br />Unfortunately I don't understand much of what you say in this paragraph, 
<br />
especially these two sentences:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Remember that &quot;inconsistency&quot; has   
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; been shown consistent in Peano Arithmetic, ZF theory, etc. Sound machines,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sound at the basic level I interrogate them, can be consistently very unsound
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; once entangled to deep computational histories.
</em><br />
<br />The first sentence obviously refers to some result from metamathematics, 
<br />
but you have to remember that I'm still learning about it and be more 
<br />
explicit (at least use a standard name to refer to the result so I can 
<br />
look it up). I have no idea what the second sentence means.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You would be really unsound, through my basic use of the term, only if you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; were able to give a finite proof of a false proposition, not just pretend
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you could find it.
</em><br />
<br />Of course I can give a finite proof of a false proposition. I just have to
<br />
use an unsound logic to do the proof. If you restrict us to using sound
<br />
logics, then nobody can give a finite proof of a false proposition, so if
<br />
that's your definition of sound machine, I'm not sure what the point of
<br />
qualifying &quot;machine&quot; with &quot;sound&quot; is.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Because with comp the relation between our first person inspired decisions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and third person (or first person plural) realities remains to be explained.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The comp indeterminacy, by the invariance lemma, pertains on the whole
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of UD* (the computationalist form of everything).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course you can forget comp, postulate a reality (defined by what you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; see and expect to see) and take your decisions. But we are looking for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a toe, not a recipe for life. You don't need quantum gravity for everyday
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; decision do you? But you can imagine quantum gravity being related to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; search of a TOE, ok? Well, what I try to say is that if you take seriously
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the hypothesis that our private experience are invariant for functional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; substitution at some level, then the utimate explanation of quantum gravity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is accessible by UTMS pure introspection, and that the toe is a mixture
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of machine's machine psychology (G), and machine psychology (G*).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The advantage of my way is that it gives an explanation for the origin
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of physical laws and at the same time of physical sensations. It has no direct
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; use in decision theory, except perhaps by predicting new phenomena, perhaps
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exploitable, like any new theory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No doubt I make simplifications here and there, but what remains is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very complex and unknown. I would be glad if someone find a flaw or some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implicit hypothesis I use unconsciously ...
</em><br />
<br />I would be happy to try to find some flaw or implicit hypothesis in your 
<br />
argument, but I'm still waiting for the English paper you've promised us. 
<br />
:( Until then I'm just trying to understand your explicit assumptions and 
<br />
conclusions.
<br />
<br />BTW, quantum gravity will be useful in everyday decisions when we have the 
<br />
necessary technology to make use of it (for example to construct 
<br />
microscopic black holes for catalytic matter to energy conversion).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; About Schmidhuber's toe, perhaps you could try to explain me how you keep
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being in the same computation in front of the invariance lemma, knowing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that all computations exist.
</em><br />
<br />I don't have to explain how I &quot;keep being in the same computation&quot; because
<br />
I don't know or claim that. I'm not sure that's even a meaningful
<br />
sentence. All I do claim is that for any given computation, if I am in
<br />
that computation, I care about the future version of me in that
<br />
computation, and I can causally affect its future (and only its future).
<br />
In other words, the causal influence of my actions stay in the same
<br />
computation.
