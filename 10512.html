<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; According to Stathis Papaioannou:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Why would you not include the well-known fact that driving at high
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;speed is more likely to kill someone as &quot;evidence&quot;? If the driver
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;honestly did not know this, say due to having an intellectual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;disability, then he would have diminished responsibility for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;accident.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't know how you're using the term &quot;responsibility&quot;, but in any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; case the issue is whether a driver is willing to slow down despite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not seeing any obvious hazards.
</em><br />
<br />Evidence isn't always obvious. Past experience shows that there might 
<br />
be hazards around even though you can't see them, and you are being 
<br />
irresponsible if you ignore this fact. The only excuse is if you genuinely 
<br />
are unaware of this, in which case you have no reason to slow down if 
<br />
you see no hazards. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Astronomy does not really have an ethical dimension to it, but most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;other sciences do. Discovering that cyanide kills people is science;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;deciding to poison your spouse with cyanide to collect on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;insurance is intimately tied up with the science, but it is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;itself in the domain of science.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Precisely.  Good medical research is science, but medical practice
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; often involves matters of expedience, cultural bias, conflicts of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interest and habit.
</em><br />
<br />OK, but for the purposes of this discussion we should try to separate the 
<br />
purely scientific facts from the rest. If the scientific evidence shows that 
<br />
cyanide is good for headaches, and people die as a result, then perhaps 
<br />
the scientists have been negligent, incompetent, or deceitful.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;As for doing nothing often being the best course of action, that's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;certainly true, and it *is* a question that can be analysed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;scientifically, which is the point of placebo controlled drug trials.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But of course if the research is never done or never sees the light of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; day, something other than science is going on.
</em><br />
<br />Right, but we're getting away from the subject of epistemology and 
<br />
onto the specifics of particular treatments and the evidence supporting 
<br />
them. Personally, I have experience of several situations where I believed 
<br />
that a new treatment would be helpful on the basis of the published 
<br />
evidence but subsequently found, either through my own experience or 
<br />
through new evidence coming to light maybe years later, that it caused 
<br />
more harm than good. There is at least one example of a harmful drug 
<br />
side-effect (olanzapine causing diabetes) that was so obvious to me that 
<br />
it crossed my mind that adverse research findings may have been supressed; 
<br />
on the other hand, I also have experience of treatments with well-documented 
<br />
adverse effects which I never seem to encounter, and I don't surmise that 
<br />
in those cases the data has been faked to make the drug look bad.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;You are suggesting that certain treatments believed to be helpful
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;for mental illness by the medical profession are not in fact helpful.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;You may be right, because the history of medicine is full of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;enthusiastically promoted treatments that we now know are useless
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;or harmful. However, this is no argument against the scientific
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;method in medicine or any other field: we can only go on our best
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;evidence.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm not arguing against the scientific method.   I only wish medical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; science practiced it more often.  It is unscientific to equate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; absence of evidence with evidence of absence.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, and everyone is acutely aware that a new treatment may still be harmful 
<br />
even though the present best evidence suggests that it isn't. This needs to be 
<br />
taken into account in any risk-benefit analysis: that is, the &quot;risks&quot; equation 
<br />
should include not only the weighted probability of known adverse events, but 
<br />
also the weighted probability of as yet unrecognised adverse events. It is 
<br />
difficult to quantify this latter variable, but it does play a part in making clinical 
<br />
decisions, perhaps not always obviously so. For example, new treatments are 
<br />
generally used more cautiously than older treatments: in the more severely ill, 
<br />
in cases where the older treatments have failed, in lower dosages. As more 
<br />
experience is gained, it becomes clearer whether the new treatment is in fact 
<br />
better and safer than the old one, or better than no treatment at all, and it is 
<br />
used more widely and more confidently. 
<br />
<br />It would be interesting to retrospectively analyse the incidence and severity of 
<br />
adverse effects of medical treatments not suspected at the time of their initial 
<br />
clinical use, allowing a quantitative estimate of the abovementioned weighted 
<br />
probability for use in clinical decision-making. I don't know if this has ever been 
<br />
attempted.
