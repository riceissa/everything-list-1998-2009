Allright, I seem to have been mistaken about that.

<br />So the multiverse is not a falsifyable theory?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Don't tell me you were believing I was arguing.
</em><br />
<br />You were asserting a lot of stuff. That's commonly considered arguing, except
<br />
you weren't providing any evidence so far. So, maybe you weren't. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; About logic, it is a branch of mathematics. Like topology, algebra, analysis
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it can be *applied* to some problem, which, through some hypothesis,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can bear on some problem. With the comp hyp mathematical logic makes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it possible to derive what consistent and platonist machine can prove about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; themselves and their consistent extension.
</em><br />
<br />Except that machine doesn't exist in absence of implementations, be it
<br />
people, machines, or aliens. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;My point is that formal systems are a very powerful tool with very small 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;reach,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;unfortunately.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I never use formal system. I &quot;modelise&quot; a particular sort of machine by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; formal system, so I prove things *about* machines, by using works
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *about* formal system. I don't use formal systems. I prove things in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; informal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ways like all mathematicians.
</em><br />
<br />Above passage is 100% content-free.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Because we know that QM is not a TOE. You haven't heard?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; How could be *know* QM is not a TOE?  (I ask this independently of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the fact that I find plausible QM is not a *primitive* TOE).
</em><br />
<br />Because general relativity and quantum theory are mutually incompatible. So
<br />
both TOE aren't. We have several TOE candidates, and an increased number of
<br />
blips heralding new physics, but no heir apparent yet. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You believe that the theorem &quot;there is an infinity of primes&quot; is a human
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; invention?  (as opposed to &quot;a human discovery&quot;).
</em><br />
<br />Of course. Not necessarily human; there might be other production systems
<br />
which invented them. Then, maybe there aren't.
<br />
<br />Infinity is something unphysical, btw. You can't represent arbitrary values
<br />
within a finite physical system -- all infoprocessing systems are that.
<br />
You'll also notice that imperfect theories are riddled with infinities; they
<br />
tend to go away with the next design iteration. So infinities is something
<br />
even more primatish than enumerable natural numbers.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;I do not see how arithmetic realism (a special case of Platonic realism, is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;that correct?) is an axiom. I agree with the rest of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;your list.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps I have been unclear. By Arithmetic Realism I mean that Arithmetical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Truth is independent of me, you, and the rest of humanity. There exist
</em><br />
<br />Oh, I disagree with that allright. Nonliving systems don't have an
<br />
evolutionary pressure to develop enumerable quantities representation.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; weaker form of that axiom and stronger form. Tegmark for instance
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; defends a much larger mathematical realism (so large that I am not sure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what it could mean). As I said some ultrafinitist defends strictly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; weaker form of mathematical realism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The more quoted argument in favour of arithmetical realism is the one based
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on Godel's theorem, and presented by him too) which is that any formal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; systems (and so any ideally consistent machines) can prove, even in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; principle,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that is with infinite time and space, all the true proposition of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arithmetic.
</em><br />
<br />Sure. Notice that infinite time and space is unphysical, and of course a
<br />
machine which doesn't exist doesn't produce anything.
<br />
<br />I was hoping for a falsifyable argument, showing that this spacetime is an
<br />
operation artifact of some finite production system.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But look also to the site of Watkins
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://www.maths.ex.ac.uk/~mwatkins/zeta/index.htm">http://www.maths.ex.ac.uk/~mwatkins/zeta/index.htm</a>
</em><br />
<br />Oh, basically you're arguing that the unreasonable applicability of
<br />
mathematics in physics is anything but unreasonable, and that a TOE arisen
<br />
from a formal system is in fact the universe itself?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; for a lot of evidence for it (evidence which are a priori not related to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my more theoretical computer science approach).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now my goal (here) is not really to defend AR as true, but as sufficiently 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; plausible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that it is interesting to look at the consequences. You can read some
</em><br />
<br />I do not deny that a TOE can be immensely useful (but not necessarily so,
<br />
higher levels of theory tend to require increasing amounts of crunch to
<br />
predict anything useful), but that TOE has anything to do with the metalayer,
<br />
or that in fact that distinction is meaningful.
<br />
<br />You don't seem to disagree, so we're not actually arguing.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; main post I send to this list where I present the argument according to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which if we take comp seriously (comp = AR + TC + &quot;yes doctor&quot;) then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics is eventually a branch of machine's psychology (itself a branch
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of computer science&quot; itself a branch of number theory.
</em><br />
<br />Ah, some severe leap of faith required here.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you find an error, or an imprecision, please show them.
</em><br />
<br />I'm experiencing a severe cognitive dissonance, trying to understand why you
<br />
think formal systems do exist in absence of their production systems. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Or, if there is a point you don't understand, it will be a pleasure for me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to provide more explanations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Also, I thought you were postulating an universe, aren't you? (I just try
</em><br />
<br />Sure, we're having a conversation (albeit a bit surreal one), so we seem to exist.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; to figure out your philosophical basic hypothesis).
