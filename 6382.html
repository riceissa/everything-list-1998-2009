<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;    No, I disagree. The mere a priori existence of bit strings is not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;enough to imply necessity that what we experience 1st person view points. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;At best it allows the possibility that the bit strings could be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;implemented. You see the problem is that it is impossible to derive 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;Change or &quot;Becoming&quot; from Being. Think of this in terms of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;thermodynamics, if we assume a universe that is in perfect equilibrium 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;there will never be any possibility of a deviation from such equilibrium 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;unless we introduce some mechanism to &quot;disturb&quot; it. If we use the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;mechanism of a &quot;quantum fluctuation&quot; then we are forced to introduce some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;kind of &quot;potential to change&quot; into a structure that by definition has 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;none.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;    This has long been a problem for thinkers trying to understand the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;notion of Time. Unless we assume some form of change or Becoming as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;existing a priori to time and that out notion of Time is a &quot;local&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;measure of change, we are forced to construct ideas where we ask 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;questions like how fast is a second. We end up with a Time_ 1 to measure 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;the rate of change that is somehow different from the usual time (Time_0) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;and this, in turn, would have to have a Time_2 and thus a Time_3, etc.- 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;an infinite number of times, each to measure the rate of change of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;one below it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Why do you need to believe that there is any &quot;change&quot; at the ultimate 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;level at all?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;[SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    Honestly I have not problem at all with the idea that at the &quot;Ultimate&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;level of existence any notion of a measure of change, i.e., time, vanishes. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It is then we consider that there is no differentiation that occurs over 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the continuum between that Ultimate level and the Physical level that I am 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;trying to speak.
</em><br />
<br />But what does &quot;physical level&quot; even mean, if universes or observer-moments 
<br />
are just elements of the set of all mathematical forms, as many on this list 
<br />
believe?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;[JM]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;The idea of &quot;block time&quot; has always seemed plausible to me, where events 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;in the future and past (or various parallel futures and pasts, from a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;multiverse point of view) are just as real as events at other spatial 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;locations in a single moment (and relativity suggests that there is no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;unique definition of the 'present moment' anyway). This point of view is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;discussed in a nice article from Scientific American by physicist Paul 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Davies:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;<a href="http://www.american-buddha.com/myster.flow.physics.htm">http://www.american-buddha.com/myster.flow.physics.htm</a>

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;[SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    The problems that I have with the &quot;block time&quot; idea are exactly the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;same as the problem that I have with COMP, that a pre-specified 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;orchestration or harmony, as Leibniz proposed in his Monadology, exists 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that is both necessary and sufficient to explain the inescapable &quot;flow&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that we experience.
</em><br />
<br />&quot;orchestration or harmony&quot; between what and what? Like I said, we needn't 
<br />
believe the physical world is something separate from the Platonic realm of 
<br />
mathematical forms.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Where does the notion of &quot;running a polynomial number of steps&quot; occur in a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;realm that is Timeless Being?
</em><br />
<br />If you take the &quot;B series&quot; view of time by McTaggart that Davies discussed 
<br />
in his article, you can just imagine a list of numbered operations of a 
<br />
Turing machine which exists timelessly, without the notion that any step is 
<br />
specially marked out as the one that is happening &quot;now&quot;. The number of steps 
<br />
would just be the length of the list.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    The idea that &quot;solutions&quot; exists to these problems as Platonic forms in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;itself does nothing to address how these solutions are communicated. Do you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;recall that Plato himself had to invent the notion of &quot;noesis&quot; to give a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;name to the idea that somehow, by some mysterious means, our finite and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;imperfect minds somehow could connect to the Perfect and Timeless Forms.
</em><br />
<br />But Plato did not consider the possibility that there is no &quot;physical realm&quot; 
<br />
outside of the Platonic realm--that we ourselves, and the universe we live 
<br />
in, are just Platonic forms.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;    I have tried to explain the problem of &quot;block time&quot; in several posts, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;here on the Everything-list and on the F.o.R. list, the idea of block-time 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;simply ignores the fact that a &quot;block space-time&quot; - the notion from which 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;block time&quot; is derived
</em><br />
<br />What's the difference? I thought that &quot;block time&quot;, &quot;block spacetime&quot;, and 
<br />
&quot;block universe&quot; were all synonymous.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;- required that at least the initial or the final boundary of such a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;block&quot; have associated with it definite physical quantities, such as the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;positions, momenta, spin, charge, color, etc.
</em><br />
<br />What do you mean by &quot;initial boundary&quot;? Like the Big Bang singularity? Why 
<br />
would the boundary have to have these properties?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;    I am familiar with Davies' ideas, I have read every one of his books 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and found them self-aggrandizing and lacking in original content.
</em><br />
<br />Well, I didn't link to that article because it contained any original ideas 
<br />
by Davies, but just because it contained a good review of the block time vs. 
<br />
flowing time issue.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;For one thing, his statement &quot;Nothing in known physics corresponds to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;passage of time.&quot; really bothers me; who among us believe that the &quot;known 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physics&quot; is complete and omniscient?
</em><br />
<br />Sure, but that's why he was careful to say &quot;known physics&quot; rather than just 
<br />
&quot;physics&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;We still do not have a good and predictively falsifiable quantum gravity 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;theory published!
</em><br />
<br />No, but I think most physicists, not just Davies, would consider it fairly 
<br />
unlikely that any future theory of quantum gravity will violate 
<br />
Lorentz-invariance and introduce a preferred reference frame. Here's a 
<br />
discussion from an article on the problems with ether theories posted on 
<br />
sci.physics.relativity at 
<br />
<a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/sci.physics.relativity/msg/a6f110865893d962">http://groups-beta.google.com/group/sci.physics.relativity/msg/a6f110865893d962</a> 
<br />
:
<br />
<br />&quot;Symmetry in SR is a rich and varied topic. The basic symmetry of SR is
<br />
Lorentz invariance, and the essence of SR is encapsulated in the
<br />
statement that the laws of physics are locally Lorentz invariant (i.e.
<br />
unchanged under the operation of any member of the Lorentz group). This
<br />
is an instance of the modern approach to symmetries: a symmetry principle
<br />
states that something remains unchanged when a specific type of operation
<br />
is performed. Note that Einstein's original two postulates for SR are
<br />
both symmetry principles.
<br />
<br />&quot;Einstein was instrumental in bringing the importance of symmetries to
<br />
the forefront of modern physics, and SR is an excellent example of the
<br />
power of symmetry groups in determining the possible structure of
<br />
physical laws: considerations of group theory alone plus the simple
<br />
observation that pion beams exist are sufficient to derive the
<br />
equations of SR. In addition, an assumption of Lorentz symmetry and
<br />
the guess that electrodynamics is the simplest possible gauge theory
<br />
is enough to derive the Maxwell's equations. Symmetry principles are a
<br />
very powerful (nay indispensable) tool in modern theoretical physics.
<br />
<br />&quot;And none of the ether theories contain such a symmetry as a fundamental
<br />
part of the theory (LET has an &quot;accidental&quot; Lorentz symmetry, but it is
<br />
not a principle of the theory). It is highly doubtful that any of the
<br />
modern theories of physics would have been discovered without the
<br />
symmetry principles of SR leading the way -- modern gauge theories are
<br />
direct descendants of the geometrical description of SR; this includes
<br />
both GR and the Standard Model. Such a geometrical description is not
<br />
possible in any ether theory (geometry is inherently coordinate
<br />
independent, but the ether is not). &quot;
