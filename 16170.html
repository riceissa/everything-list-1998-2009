I noticed someone taking my name in vain. ;)  (though experiment where
<br />
I, Tom, am a clone of Will Riker)  The magic of thought experiments,
<br />
it's amazing.  I felt my measure decrease, but only after I read the
<br />
thought experiment.
<br />
<br />I trust this will not derail anyone's personal identity here, but I
<br />
have some subjectively random thoughts.  The importance of, the
<br />
necessary dependence of any model of reality on, our subjective view
<br />
of things has struck me lately.  For instance, I brought up the
<br />
&quot;should I worry about a clone dying?&quot; question a while back.  This
<br />
seems totally subjective to me.  And that's not a put-down, it's an
<br />
observation.  What if we started thinking about making a clone as sort
<br />
of like having a baby?  Then it would suddenly change from being
<br />
something uncertain to something exhilating, plus there probably
<br />
wouldn't be any diapers involved.  I'm not suggesting we do that, just
<br />
performing a thought experiment.  When we die, the &quot;personal identity&quot;
<br />
pain is less if we have passed on something of ourselves in some way.
<br />
But then of course we care if that passed-on stuff is discontinued,
<br />
for instance if one of our children die, or a symphony we've written
<br />
is forgotten.  The Golden Rule still applies.
<br />
<br />The latest Scientific American has an article about non-locality, and
<br />
it seems to me that this is related to this topic, through the causal-
<br />
chain aspect of it.  One thought-picture that was used to try to
<br />
convey non-locality is that it is like a fist punching in Chicago and
<br />
a face being hurt in Los Angeles.  So it occurred to me that it is
<br />
only in the presence of a consciously-aware assignment of cause that a
<br />
causal chain is present.  We are not omniscient, there is always
<br />
something in a universe which cannot be predicted by any model within
<br />
that universe.  There are always those faces feeling pain for which we
<br />
have no knowledge of the cause, so how can we claim that everything
<br />
has a cause?  So effectively there are things happening in any
<br />
universe which have no cause.
<br />
<br />But what does that mean (subjectively of course) to us?  It shouldn't
<br />
stop us from trying to find causes and do predictions, since this
<br />
works for everything that we need to work, macroscopic things, local
<br />
things.  Just rambing here, it seems to me that the whole quantum
<br />
entanglement/non-locality thing is fairly intuitive.  It is based on
<br />
the fact that you need at least three things to have meaning.  (For
<br />
instance, the distance between two points by themselves is
<br />
meaningless.)  And one of those things seems to be consciousness.
<br />
<br />Tom (Riker's brother)
<br />
<br />P.S. On your groggy morning, does the fact that you can have an
<br />
infinitely long tail but have a finite area underneath it have any
<br />
bearing?
