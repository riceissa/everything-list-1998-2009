<br />
Three years of college, no degrees, no status. Left school and started
<br />
writing, and authored three books about the existence and structure of
<br />
all possible universes, including &quot;Exploring A Many Worlds Universe&quot;
<br />
in 1997, arguing as the main theme in each book that our universe ends
<br />
in finite time (est. 120 billion years in '94) as expansion stretches
<br />
space perfectly flat, this causing time to end at a ground state of
<br />
absolute zero. The books were legally copyrighted in '94, '96, and
<br />
'97, all prior to 1998 when we discovered the expansion of the
<br />
universe is in fact accelerating us towards absolute zero. When I
<br />
wrote my first three books the mainstream of science considered a
<br />
finite end of time at zero to be impossible, and today the third law
<br />
still states it cannot happen, but old science often gets in the way
<br />
of new science. The recent measurements of acceleration indicate the
<br />
(phantom) dark energy density causing acceleration is increasing,
<br />
which makes the big rip scenario the leading future candidate.
<br />
Caldwell describes the possibility of time as ending at the &quot;ultimate
<br />
singularity&quot; and Sean Carroll is stating &quot;our universe ends as empty
<br />
space&quot; as if this is now obvious. I agree, but further state there is
<br />
no zero or a beginning from nothing in our past, the ultimate zero
<br />
exists only in our future. The universe has pronouncedly been
<br />
expanding at zero since time began because zero is the ultimate &quot;great
<br />
attractor&quot;, the very cause of time. My prediction that time ends at
<br />
zero was based upon a bounded model of all possible states, which also
<br />
predicts structure or limitations of the greater multiverse. My fourth
<br />
book, &quot;Everything Forever: Learning to See Timelessness&quot;, explains the
<br />
governing role a cosmic zero plays in the evolution of all universes
<br />
and all life.
<br />
<br />Thoughts of late:
<br />
<br />I believe there necessarily is only one &quot;pilot&quot; observer in each
<br />
universe or O-region. All third party observers in each pilot's
<br />
experience are subject to quantum mechanical sampling. The members of
<br />
this Everything-list from my particular experience are a probabilistic
<br />
sampling of the ultimate whole of what is possible considering this
<br />
scenario. Any feedback I receive will correspond to that same spectrum
<br />
of what is possible, therein reflecting a sampling of personalities,
<br />
knowledge, beliefs, responses, in accordance with what are most
<br />
probably found in a scientific discussion group about many worlds. So
<br />
am I the only real observer in this universe?
<br />
<br />The name of the movie escapes me where Dustin Hoffman uses a bed sheet
<br />
to portray parts of a single unified universe. His hand moves from one
<br />
place to another under the sheet, as he says this is the Eiffel tower,
<br />
this is you, this is me, this is a tree. It is all just one universe
<br />
he says, which suggests we are all just puppets of that universe. True
<br />
at least until you consider how quantum mechanics breaks the universe
<br />
up into discreet states, and even divides apart observers into
<br />
separate universes.
<br />
<br />We can only converse with the puppets of a quantum mechanical
<br />
universe. Pilots cannot communicate with one another, since observers
<br />
cannot communicate independent of governing probabilities. The only
<br />
saving grace is if all possible pilots and their O-regions exist, so
<br />
real pilots at least correspond to the quantum puppets of an observers
<br />
experience.
<br />
<br />Sorry, yes you are a puppet, well perhaps the reader of this post
<br />
isn't a puppet, but the responses I observe will be from puppets,
<br />
while only real pilots are left to question if the set of possible
<br />
pilots is more or less restricted than the spectrum of people a pilot
<br />
experiences in the quantum world adjacent one's consciousness.
<br />
<br />Are pilots and puppets identical and thus existentially the same?
