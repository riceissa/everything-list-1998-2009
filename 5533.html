<br />
The following is a combination of several of my previous ideas which forces 
<br />
me to raise a question re &quot;measure&quot; in this thread.
<br />
<br />1) The first step is to examine the act of definition. In this case the 
<br />
definition of a &quot;Nothing&quot;.  Any definition process simultaneously defines 
<br />
two entities.  The definition is a boundary between an entity of interest 
<br />
and the leftover building blocks.  In the special case of a &quot;Nothing&quot; the 
<br />
left over is an &quot;Everything&quot;.  Thus the two are dependent partners.  Since 
<br />
the &quot;Everything&quot; contains all information the definition pair must itself 
<br />
specify all information and can be represented by a normal real.
<br />
<br />2)  A &quot;Nothing&quot; has an interesting logical problem: It can not answer any 
<br />
meaningful question about itself.  Assuming there is a relevant meaningful 
<br />
question a &quot;Nothing&quot; would be incomplete.  An inescapable meaningful 
<br />
question is its own stability.  This is not only meaningful it is 
<br />
impossible to avoid answering.
<br />
<br />3) To attempt to answer this question a &quot;Nothing&quot; randomly and 
<br />
spontaneously &quot;decays&quot; towards an &quot;Everything&quot; to resolve its 
<br />
incompleteness.  But this is not sustainable since an &quot;Everything&quot; is not 
<br />
independent of a &quot;Nothing&quot;.  Therefore a &quot;Nothing&quot; rebounds from the decay.
<br />
<br />4) Thus the definition pair or boundary between the &quot;Nothing&quot; and 
<br />
&quot;Everything&quot; partners is randomly dynamic - equivalent to a random sequence 
<br />
of normal reals.
<br />
<br />5)  A universal dovetailer computer [the computer plus its collective 
<br />
dynamic input and output] is a good way to model a selector of a random 
<br />
sequence of normal reals.
<br />
<br />6) Notice that the &quot;Everything&quot; also has a logical problem.  Looking at the 
<br />
same meaningful question of its own stability it contains all possible 
<br />
answers.  Just one would constitute a selection i.e. net internal 
<br />
information which is not an aspect of the &quot;Everything&quot;.   Thus the 
<br />
&quot;Everything&quot; is inconsistent.
<br />
<br />7) Thus the entire system while being - apparently - the only game in town 
<br />
is also both incomplete and inconsistent.
<br />
<br />8) Universes are interpretations of sections of the normal real string.
<br />
<br />9) Now a question is how many of these interpretations have internal rules 
<br />
that allow input from an external random oracle?  If  we are to maintain a 
<br />
zero information system then the answer must be a randomly changing 
<br />
percentage.  So all interpretations must be able change character i.e. be 
<br />
subject to an external random oracle the internal rules of the particular 
<br />
interpretation notwithstanding.
<br />
<br />10) What this means is that there remains some information in the system - 
<br />
the computer itself is incorrectly defined - to get rid of this problem the 
<br />
computer has to function like any computer I ever used - it must make 
<br />
random errors.
<br />
<br />I do not see how one can extract from this any &quot;measure&quot; re anything which 
<br />
to me seems reasonable since there should be no information in there anyway.
