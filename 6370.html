In reply to Lee Corbin on the Fabric of Reality List
<br />
----------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />Lee,
<br />
<br />You gave us some wonderful examples of totally ridiculous Turing Machines
<br />
that are nevertheless possible (I would at this point ask somebody to take
<br />
away Charles' keyboard). You have noted that these TMs are improbable; we
<br />
would not expect them to be instantiated in any great measure throughout the
<br />
multiverse. They are similar to Harry Potter universes in this respect.
<br />
Surely, though, the fact that they are improbable is not a blow against
<br />
Bruno! His argument is concerned with measure and you are playing right into
<br />
that. Let me try to explain...
<br />
<br />To make this easier, let's forget about physical reality for a while. Let's
<br />
consider the Universal Dovetailer (UD). For those not in the know, the UD is
<br />
a TM that systematically lists and executes all possible TMs. Because there
<br />
are an infinite number of TMs, the UD cannot wait until all the TMs are
<br />
listed before it executes them. It also cannot allow any one TM to
<br />
monopolise the runtime, lest that TM never halts. So it must execute a step
<br />
of one TM, then a step of another TM and so on, and it must do this while
<br />
continuing to list the TMs. The first TMs off the list will be the simple
<br />
ones - those with the shortest bitstrings and these are the first to be
<br />
kicked off. Complex TMs with very long specifications will not be kicked off
<br />
until much later. At any point in time in which they are still running,
<br />
these complex TMs will have received less runtime than any simpler TM that
<br />
is still running. This is important, as we shall see.
<br />
<br />As we have discussed, some (an infinite subset) of the TMs will support
<br />
observers when they are executed. The observers and their worlds unroll as
<br />
computational histories.
<br />
<br />What does an observer observe? 
<br />
<br />It is important to see that the computational histories of different TMs can
<br />
be identical up to a point and then diverge. So different TMs can produce
<br />
the same observer history up to a point. The observer moment, then, is
<br />
&quot;simultaneously&quot; generated by many different TMs. You can't pluck one
<br />
history and say you are in that history. You are part of many identical
<br />
histories that are about to diverge. And you can't pluck one TM and say that
<br />
that is the TM that is instantiating you. Your history is generated by many
<br />
different TMs. These are very important points. And, I think, the source of
<br />
much confusion over Bruno's work.
<br />
<br />What an observer observes depends on all the computational histories their
<br />
current moment is in and how the histories branch. The question also depends
<br />
on what we mean by observer, but let's put that aside for now because I
<br />
don't yet understand this part. Note that observer time has no relation to
<br />
dovetailer time.
<br />
<br />Obviously, the computational history of a TM that consistently supports an
<br />
observer can't be random. It must perform the computations necessary for an
<br />
observer. Now the history might become random after the n-th step, at which
<br />
point the observer no longer exists. Or the observer might morph into a
<br />
completely different observer that has no memory of its former existence (I
<br />
would argue that the observer is now a new observer). Or fluffy white bunny
<br />
rabbits might appear. The TM's executing these histories first run an
<br />
observer and then do something strange. Presumably this makes the TM more
<br />
complex because the strangeness requires extra bits to specify. These TMs
<br />
therefore get less runtime than the &quot;unmodified&quot; TM. 
<br />
<br />OK, suppose you're in a set of identical computational histories that are
<br />
unfolding on many different TMs. Some of those histories are about to go
<br />
strange. For your existence as an observer to continue, they must go strange
<br />
in such a way that they still support you as an observer. Given what I have
<br />
said, do you think you are likely to branch into a strange world or to
<br />
continue on in your normal world, whatever that may be? The measure of the
<br />
computational history of the world where you continue on as normal is much
<br />
larger than the measure of the computational history of the strange branch
<br />
because the strange TMs receive less runtime (remember, many different TMs
<br />
instantiate you).
<br />
<br />So, if you were an observer on the dovetailer, your computational history
<br />
branches in such a way that some branches are much more probable than
<br />
others. The world the observer observes will likely not be totally stupid. 
<br />
<br />This is how you play into Bruno's hands!
<br />
<br />Writing the above has made me realize that I may have not been accurate in
<br />
some of my earlier statements about Bruno's work. Apologies to Bruno. All I
<br />
need now is to be convinced that we can give a satisfactory definition of an
<br />
observer. Oh, and that we are most likely to observe QM.
<br />
