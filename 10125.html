<br />
A useful model of computation is the Turing Machine.  A TM has a tape
<br />
with symbols on it; a head which moves along the tape and which can read
<br />
and write symbols, and a state machine with a fixed number of states
<br />
that controls head movement and symbol writing based on the current
<br />
state and the symbol at the head's current location.  It has been shown
<br />
that this relatively simplistic model is able to do anything that more
<br />
sophisticated computer models can do.
<br />
<br />We can consider the &quot;state&quot; of a TM to be made up of the conjunction of
<br />
three things: the current state of the tape (i.e. the string of symbols
<br />
written there); the position of the head; and the state of the internal
<br />
state machine.  Maybe it would be best to call this the superstate
<br />
because normally the &quot;state&quot; of the TM just refers to its internal state
<br />
machine state.  The TM can then be said to advance from superstate to
<br />
superstate according to its internal rules and the contents of the tape.
<br />
<br />If a TM ever gets into the same superstate twice, it is in an infinite
<br />
loop.  This is because the TM is fully deterministic and so it will
<br />
always go into the same successor superstate from a given superstate.
<br />
Halting TM's never get into the same superstate twice.  Therefore halting
<br />
TM's go through a unique succession of superstates, from the first to
<br />
the last.
<br />
<br />We can map or label a TM's superstates with successive integers,
<br />
corresponding to the order that it goes through the superstates of a
<br />
computation.  In this mapping, the only difference between two different
<br />
computations is their length.  If two computations had the same length N,
<br />
they would both go through states labeled 0, 1, 2, ..., N.
<br />
<br />What is a computation?  A TM computation has two parts.  One is the
<br />
initial conditions: the initial value on the tape, the initial head
<br />
position.  The other is the set of rules used, the internal state machine
<br />
that controls the machine.  Together these two parts define a trajectory
<br />
of the TM through a sequence of superstates.
<br />
<br />We often think of the internal state machine as being like the &quot;program&quot;
<br />
and the initial contents of tape as being the &quot;data&quot;.  However, as
<br />
Turing was the first to recognize, this distinction is not always useful,
<br />
and sometimes it makes more sense to think of at least part of the tape
<br />
contents as being program rather than data.  In particular, the Universal
<br />
TM treats part of the tape as a specification for a specific other TM
<br />
that it will emulate, and the remainder of the tape is then the input
<br />
to that TM.
<br />
<br />Generally, when we think of counterfactuals in a TM computation we mean
<br />
to change the data, not the program.  We don't mean to ask, what would
<br />
happen if you ran a different program on the same data.  Rather, we
<br />
mean, what would happen if you ran the same program on different data.
<br />
We want to say that two computations are equivalent only if they have
<br />
the same counterfactual behavior - that is, if the programs would behave
<br />
the same on all data.
<br />
<br />One problem with this is noted above, that we cannot always cleanly
<br />
distinguish program and data.  In the case of the UTM, is the prefix part
<br />
of the tape, that defines the particular TM to emulate, program or data?
<br />
If it is program, we would not try to vary it in considering whether
<br />
two computations are equivalent.  If it is data, we should consider
<br />
such variations.  In general, I don't think we can always distinguish
<br />
these cases cleanly.  UTMs can be nested to any desired degree.  What is
<br />
program to one is data to another.  More complex UTM computations may be
<br />
aided by certain patterns on the tape which will disrupt the computation
<br />
if they are changed.
<br />
<br />Another problem is that a more complex mapping may be able to be set up
<br />
between two different computations even if we consider counterfactuals
<br />
as all different initial tape configurations.  We could make the mapping
<br />
be a function of the superstate as defined above.  Two computations with
<br />
different initial tapes will start in different superstates, hence the
<br />
mapping is still unique.  And it will be robust over all possible inputs
<br />
and hence all possible counterfactual computations.
<br />
<br />On these considerations, It seems to me that there are problems
<br />
with basing the distinction between computations on support for
<br />
counterfactuals.  TMs make the very notion of counterfactuals rather
<br />
fuzzy, and still admit the possibility of mappings between computations
<br />
that remain robust even in the face of counterfactuals.
<br />
<br />My preferred view is to focus on the algorithmic complexity of the
<br />
mapping between two computations, and to ask whether the information
<br />
needed to specify the mapping is less than the information needed to
<br />
write down the computation from scratch.  If not, if the mapping is
<br />
substantially bigger than the computation it purports to describe,
<br />
then the correspondence is an illusion and is not real.
