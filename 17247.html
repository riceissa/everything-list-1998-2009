Hi David,
<br />
<br />This is a nice post, but you are still putting the horse before the  
<br />
cart.
<br />
Now I can see that you have not yet grasp the main UDA point. Hope you  
<br />
have no problem with being frank, and a bit undiplomatical, OK?

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Colin's recent interesting (not to say impassioned!) posts have - yet
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; again - made me realise the fundamental weakness of my grasp of some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the discussions that involve Turing emulation - or emulability - on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the list.  So I offer myself once more as lead ignoramus in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stimulating some feedback on this issue .  Anyway, here's what I think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I know already (and I beg you patience in advance for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inaccuracies):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) A Turing machine is an idealised digital computer,
</em><br />
<br />No, Turing tried to capture the notion of a human computer, working  
<br />
with a pencil and paper.
<br />
He tried to define mathematically what is human computable, and he is,  
<br />
with Post, and some other are the discoverer of a purely mathematical  
<br />
notion of computation, and this before the appearance of concrete  
<br />
computers. Computers have appeared after. Turing has played a role in  
<br />
that later appearance.  A platonist could say those concrete beings  
<br />
are just pale approximation of the real thing. Later this statement  
<br />
will be made precise, but with the step 8, we just cannot invoke any  
<br />
physical things or physical reality.
<br />
To be sure, the fact that computer have been discovered in math,  
<br />
before &quot;in nature&quot; is not an argument, yet it helps a lot to see that,  
<br />
especially for the grasp of the comp supervenience thesis. And that is  
<br />
the reason why I explain that absolutely fundamental mathematical  
<br />
discovery. Computation has nothing to do with physics at the start.
<br />
Note that I abstract myself from the pioneer building of a computer by  
<br />
Babbage.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; based on a tape
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (memory device) of potentially infinite length,
</em><br />
<br /><br />The human computer can use as many papers, or even the wall of its  
<br />
cavern, or of its living room, ... He is a finite being embedded in a  
<br />
non finite available memory-time space.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; that has been shown to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be capable of emulating any type of digital computer,
</em><br />
<br /><br />This has not been shown. But this follows from Church Thesis.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and hence any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other TM.
</em><br />
<br /><br />What Turing has shown, is that there is a universal Turing machine,  
<br />
capable of simulating all Turing machines. Then that Universal machine  
<br />
can be shown to emulate all existing universal machine, and by Church  
<br />
Thesis: all universal (and particular) machines.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The meaning of 'emulation' here entails transforming
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; precisely the same inputs into the precisely same outputs, given
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sufficient time.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK. But there is an intensional Church thesis, which can be deduced  
<br />
from Church thesis, saying that not only two universal systems can  
<br />
compute the same functions, but they can compute them in the same way  
<br />
(same algorithm).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In effect, digitally 'emulating' a computation is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conceptually indistinguishable from the computation itself; or to put
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it another way, computation is deemed to be invariant under emulation.
</em><br />
<br />... at some level. OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) Insofar as the causal processes of physics are specifiable in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; form of decidable (i.e. definitely stopping) functions, they are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; capable of finite computation on a TM - i.e. they are TM emulable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What this amounts to is that we can in principle use a TM to compute
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the evolution of any physical process given the appropriate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; transformation algorithm.  Since we're dealing with QM this must
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entail various probabilistic aspects and I don't know what else: help
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; here please.  But the general sense is that the mathematics of physics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could in principle be fully Turing-emulable.
</em><br />
<br />Step 08 forbids us to introduce anything physical. The reversal is done  
<br />
at that step. I guess you are right that it could be a better idea to  
<br />
do the step 8 before, but it is more difficult for most. Any way,  
<br />
computational supervenience is defined after step 8.
<br />
Then we will discover that &quot;Colin is right&quot; no piece of matter should  
<br />
be Turing emulable. The mathematics of physics will have to escape the  
<br />
turing emulable. The apparent turing emulability of the world around  
<br />
us, is a threat to indexical comp (the idea that &quot;I am machine&quot;).
<br />
Of course I disagree with Colin's reasoning where he deduce the non  
<br />
Turing emulability of nature from the non emulability of mind. UDA  
<br />
deduces the non Turing-emulability of matter from the non Turing- 
<br />
emulability of the mind. And the proof is constructive. It redefines  
<br />
precisely what &quot;matter&quot; consists in.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3)  Now we get into more controversial territory.
</em><br />
<br />Really? I don't think so. Difficult, not yet very well known, and  
<br />
rather subtle, no doubt.
<br />
But I don't think there is anything controversial. Nobody told me that.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Bruno has shown (at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; least I agree with him on this) that for the mind to be regarded as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computation,
</em><br />
<br />The wording is a bit dangerous. All I know after UDA is that my state  
<br />
of mind at time and place (x,t) has to be linked to an infinity of  
<br />
computations going through that state, and that my next state, from my  
<br />
first person point of view is indeterminate on the set of all those  
<br />
computations.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; essentially everything else must also be regarded in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; same light: IOW our ontology is to be understood entirely from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perspective of numbers and their relations.
</em><br />
<br />True, but this excludes quickly that it can be conceived a priori as  
<br />
computations. Immaterial relation between numbers, sure, but not  
<br />
necessarily computable relation. Cf the first person indeterminacy.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is not universally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; accepted, but more on this in the next section.
</em><br />
<br />This is not universally understood, nor really studied. But it is  
<br />
understood quickly or slowly when studied. To my knowledge.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Suffice it to say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that on this basis we would appear to have a situation where the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appropriate set of computations could be regarded not as mere
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'emulation', but in fact *as real as it gets*.  But this of course
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; also renders 'stuffy matter' irrelevant to the case: it's got to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; numbers all the way down.
</em><br />
<br /><br />No. With the first person indeterminacy it would be more correct to  
<br />
say that it's got to be number all the way up. It makes the comp  
<br />
immaterial appearance of &quot;stuffy matter&quot; infinitely complex and non  
<br />
turing emulable, a priori. I suspect you have not yet really see the  
<br />
role of UDA1-6 in the step-7.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4) If we don't accept 3) then we can keep stuffy matter,
</em><br />
<br />We can't by step 8; but by the whole UDA 'stuffy matter&quot; does no more  
<br />
make sense at all. The comp &quot;stuffy&quot; matter has to be made by a  
<br />
infinite sum of infinite computations including infinities of white  
<br />
rabbits-computations. The apparent computability of the physical laws  
<br />
*is* a problem for the indexical computationalist.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; but at the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cost of losing the digital computational model of both mind and body.
</em><br />
<br />Most want introduce a stuffy matter because they believe they can save  
<br />
computation for both mind and body. Colin is correct for saying bodies  
<br />
cannot be computable, but this follows from the mind being  
<br />
&quot;computable&quot;, in the &quot;yes doctor&quot; sense, not from the scientist mind  
<br />
being non computable.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not everyone agrees with that radical assessment, I know;
</em><br />
<br />Who disagree? It is not a question to agree or not. It is a question  
<br />
of understanding or not (or to find a mistake).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; but even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; those who don't concur presumably do hold that everything that happens
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; finally supervenes on something stuffy as its ontological and causal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; basis, and that numbers and their relations serve merely to model
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this.
</em><br />
<br />That is comp, before UDA, before the necessary reversal.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The stuffiness doesn't of course mean that the evolution of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical systems can't in principle be specified algorithmically,
</em><br />
<br />Comp-stuffiness *is* a priori not algorithmic.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'emulated' on a TM if that is possible; we still have mathematics as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; model of stuff and its relations.
</em><br />
<br />UDA entails there is no stuff at all. No stuff capable of justifying  
<br />
in any way the observation of stuff.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But it does entail that no digital
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emulation of a physical system can - as a mere structure of numbers -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be considered the 'real thing': it's got to be stuffy all the way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; down.
</em><br />
<br />Well, with comp+physicalism. But this is inconsistent, at the  
<br />
epistemological level.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 5) We might call 03 the numerical (necessary) model, and 04 the stuffy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (contingent) model of reality -
</em><br />
<br />Hmm... The &quot;numerical model&quot;, but non-computational model,  is  
<br />
necessary by reasoning. The contingent realities are well explained,  
<br />
and the stuffy model is not contingent but impossible.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; but of course I don't insist on this.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Rather, it seems to me that in our various discussions on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emulability or otherwise of physics, we may sometimes lose sight of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whether we are interpreting in terms of numerical or stuffy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ontologies.
</em><br />
<br />But &quot;stuffy&quot; or just primitively physical, after UDA has no more any  
<br />
meaning.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And I think this has something to do with what Colin is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; getting at: if your model is stuffy, then no amount of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; digital-numerical emulation is ever going to get you anything stuffy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that you didn't have before.  A physical-stuffy TM doing any amount of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whatever kind of computation-emulation remains just a physical-stuffy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; TM, and a fortiori *not* transmogrified into the stuff whose causal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure it happens to be computing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now of course this stricture wouldn't necessarily apply to model 3).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But the 'comp' that Colin claims to refute is, I suspect, not this but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stuffy-comp - i.e. the comp based on stuff rather than numbers, that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Olympia, in her lazy but decisive way, dismisses as ephemeral.  This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is also the comp that I have argued against, but I don't intend this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; merely to be a re-statement of my prejudices.  I know that Colin isn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; precisely a proponent of model 3) nor model 4), arguing strenuously
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for a distinctive alternative; so it would be interesting (certainly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for me) if he'd care to characterise precisely how it diverges from or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; extends the foregoing stuffy-numerical dichotomy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Be that as it may, the punchline is: do we find this analysis of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distinction between numerical 3) and stuffy 4) to be cogent with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *specific* respect to the significance and possible application of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concept of 'emulation' in each case?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />You don't yet have grasped the UDA yet. It makes the stuffy things not  
<br />
just useless for having computations and relative emulation, but it  
<br />
makes, it is the big hard point, any notion of stuffiness, irrelevant  
<br />
for physical objects too.
<br />
There is just no stuff available. Even if we introduce it, it makes no  
<br />
change in consciousness, and can't have any relation with what we  
<br />
observe in nature. We will come back on this.
