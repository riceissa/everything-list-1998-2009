<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I spent tens of thousands of hours designing, building, benchtesting and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; commissioning zombies. On the benchtop I have pretended to be their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; environment and they had no 'awareness' they weren't in their real
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; environment. It's what makes bench testing possible. The universe of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; zombies was the universe of my programming. The zombies could not tell if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they were in the factory or on the benchtop. That's why I can empathise so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; well with zombie life. I have been literally swatted by zombies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (robot/cranes and other machines) like I wasn't there....scares the hell
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; out of you! Some even had 'vision systems' but were still blind.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so....yes the zombie can 'behave'. What I am claiming is they cannot do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; _science_ i.e. they cannot behave scientifically. This is a very specific
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; claim, not a general claim.

</em><br />
You're being unfair to the poor zombie robots. How could they possibly tell if 
<br />
they were in the factory or on the benchtop when the benchtop (presumably) 
<br />
exactly replicates the sensory feeds they would receive in the factory? Neither 
<br />
humans nor robots, zombie or otherwise, should be expected to have ESP. 

<br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;- it's all the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; same - action potential pulse trains traveling from sensors to brain.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; No, it's not all the same. Its coded in a very complex way. It's like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; saying the information in you computer is &quot;all the same -- its all ones
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and zeros&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; yes you got it - all coded....I am talking about action potential pulse
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; trains. They are all the same general class. Burst mode/Continuous mode,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all the same basic voltage waveform, overshoot, refratory period...LTP,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; LTD, afterhyperpolarisation.... all the same class for sight, sound,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; taste, imagination, touch, thirst, orgasm etc etc... coded messages
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; travelling all the way from the periphery and into the brain. They are all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the same...and..
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; None of it says anything about WHY the input did what it did. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; causality outside the zombie is MISSING from these signals. They have no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intrinsic sensation to them either. The only useful information is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; body knows implicitly where they came from..which still is not enough
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Try swapping the touch nerves for 2 fingers. You 'touch' with one and feel
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the touch happen on the other. The touch sensation is created as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; phenomenal consciousness in the brain using the measurement, not the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; signal measurement itself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now think about the touch..the same sensation of touch could have been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generated by a feather or a cloth or another finger or a passing car. That
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; context is what phenomenal consciousness provides.

</em><br />
But it is impossible to differentiate between different sources of a sensation unless 
<br />
the different sources generate a different sensation. If you close your eyes and the 
<br />
touch of a feather and a cloth feel the same, you can't tell which it was. If you open 
<br />
your eyes, you can tell a difference because the combined sensation (touch + vision) 
<br />
is different in the two cases. A machine that has touch receptors alone might not be 
<br />
able to distinguish between them, but a machine that has touch + vision receptors 
<br />
would be able to.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; The zombie cannot possibly distinguish the novelty from the sensory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; data
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; and has no awareness of the external world or even its own boundary.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Huh? It's perfectly possible to build a robot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that produces a special signal when it encounters input it has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; not encountered before.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes but how is it to do anything to contextualise the input other than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correlate it with other signals? (none of which, in themselves, generate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any phenomenal consciousness, they trigger it downstream in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cranium/cortex).

</em><br />
That's all we ever do: correlate one type of signal with another. The correlations 
<br />
get called various things such as &quot;red&quot;, &quot;circular&quot;, &quot;salty&quot;, or perhaps &quot;a weird taste 
<br />
I have never encountered before, somewhere between salty and sweet, which 
<br />
also spills over into a sparkly purple visual sensation&quot;.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; re robot...now do science on a signal and use the signal to make a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; statement about the natural world that generated/caused the signal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; elsewhere away from/outside the robot. It can't. It's blind, deaf, can't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; taste or smell or touch. Having the sensor transduction does not give it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sight... that is scientifically proven fact. EG There is a HUGE neural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sensory transduction/actuation system along the wall of your intestines,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of which you have no awareness at all, but is hammering away like a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; factory squeezing and pushing all day...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Put it this way.... a 'red photon' arrives and hits a retina cone and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; isomerises a protein, causing a cascade that results in an action
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; potential pulse train. That photon could have come from alpha-centuri,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bounced off a dog collar or come from a disco light. The receptor has no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; clue. Isomerisation of a protein has nothing to do with 'seeing'. In the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; human the perception (sensation) of a red photon happens in the visual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cortex as an experience of redness and is 'projected' mentally into the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; phenomenal scene. That way the human can tell where it came from. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mystery of how that happens is another story. That it happens and is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessary for science is what matters here.

</em><br />
I don't think that's correct. It is impossible for a human to tell where the photon 
<br />
came from if it makes no sensory difference. That difference may have to involve 
<br />
other sensations, eg. if the red sensation occurs simultaneously with a loud bang 
<br />
it may have come from an explosion, while the same red sensation associated with 
<br />
a 1 KHz tone may have come from a warning beacon. 

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The main fact is that the zombie does not have sensation at all and that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as a result it cannot do science on the world outside the zombie. It's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doesn't even know there is a world to do science on. All it can do is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correlate measurements with each other, measurements that could have come
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from anywhere and the zombie can never tell from where.

</em><br />
Alas, I am no better than the zombie in this respect.
