Hi,
<br />
<br />I'm overrun with stuff at uni, but I have this one issue - solipsism- which
<br />
is hot and we seem to be touching on, so I thought you may help me collect
<br />
my thoughts before I run off. gotta leave all those threads hanging
<br />
there.and I left them in an awfully under engineered state.sorry!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />SIDE ISSUE (infinity and the UDA)
<br />
<br />Fromthe UDA you can show that to make comp false you need to introduce
<br />
actual infinities in the subject.
<br />
<br />The infinitely small and infinitely large are two sides of the same thing.
<br />
One can construct an infinitesimal as an identity = the difference between
<br />
two very nearly cancelling infinities (type A and type B) or from a single
<br />
infinity consisting of an infinite number of random simple transitory events
<br />
(changes from state A to B and back) that acts as an effective average
<br />
'NOTHING'.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From this 'change based' model of infinity, based on mere statistical
</em><br />
happenstance, an infinitesimal's existence (albeit transitory) is
<br />
predictable logically by the nature of the impossibility of infinity (a
<br />
perfect NOTHING requires infinite cancellation of all A with all B under all
<br />
circumstances). Indeed, rarely, you will get extraordinarily large (not very
<br />
infinitesimal!) collections of transitory events as temporary coherence of
<br />
massive quantities of simultaneous state A or state B.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />The infinitesimal is therefore evidence of actual infinities, but in an
<br />
'as-if' sense. Whether this constitutes the introduction of 'actual
<br />
infinities' in the context of disproof of the UDA you can work out yourself.
<br />
There is a possibility it may do the job. I hope I have made sense. The
<br />
important nuance to this idea is the intrinsic parallelism of it (massive
<br />
numbers of identical instances of a transitory event).that is where the UDA
<br />
can fail, for the parallelism is innate.not 'computed'..which means that if
<br />
any property of nature occurs as a result of the innateness, replacement by
<br />
computational abstractions will not replicate it. Am I making sense?.
<br />
probably not. oh well.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />BACK TO THE REAL ISSUE (solipsism)
<br />
<br />I am confused as to what the received view of the solipsist is. As us usual
<br />
in philosophical discourse, definitions disagree: 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />&quot;An epistemological position that one's own perceptions are the only things
<br />
that can be known with certainty. The nature of the external world - that
<br />
is, the source of one's perceptions - therefore cannot be conclusively
<br />
known; it may not even exist.&quot;
<br />
<br />or
<br />
<br />&quot;belief in self as only reality: the belief that the only thing somebody can
<br />
be sure of is that he or she exists, and that true knowledge of anything
<br />
else is impossible&quot;
<br />
<br />or
<br />
<br />&quot;the belief that only one's own experiences and existence can be known with
<br />
certainty&quot;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />The definitions are all variants on this theme..
<br />
<br />---------------------------------
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Q1. As a solipsist, if you say 'belief in self as the only reality' does
<br />
this entail the disbelief in anything else other than 'self' (=experiential
<br />
reality of the observer)? .i.e. ...the active denial of any reality other
<br />
than your experience?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />This denial seems a tad optional from the definitions. That denial would
<br />
necessitate magical intervention in the provision of phenomenal
<br />
consciousness (Berkeley-esque beliefs) that constitute a mass-delusion of
<br />
relentless detail.. a belief which is also bereft of empirical parsimony.. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />It seems to me that the denial or otherwise can have little effect on
<br />
scientific behaviour. A scientist does not get up in the morning, deny
<br />
reality and then use that denial to alter procedures. (apart from giving up
<br />
altogether! - &quot;for what's the point&quot;!).so the denial seems a little moot..
<br />
nevertheless I'd like to have an opinion or two..
<br />
<br />---------------------------
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Q2. If experiences are all that are known with certainty, then why have
<br />
scientists universally (a) adopted the explicit appearances (of the external
<br />
reality) within experience as scientific evidence of an external reality, to
<br />
the complete exclusion of (b) the implicit evidence that the existence of
<br />
any experience at all provides that it is caused by something (and that
<br />
something is also external reality)? This is rather odd, since in the
<br />
'certainty' stakes (b) wins.
<br />
<br />-------------------------
<br />
<br />Q3. How does a solipsistic denial of 'other minds' fit into the above in the
<br />
context of provision of scientific evidence?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />I have others but this will do as a start.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Regards
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Colin Hales
