<br /><br />Not meet them so much in my experience. Positive Religious (like

Muslim, Catholic, ...) have build-in solution. It is most of the time

tabu to question them. Negative Religious (like Atheist) have build-

in solution, but are generally not aware of the religiosity of their

solutions. Only (serious) philosopher of mind/cognitive scientists  
<br />
are aware of the problem.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  that 3 classes of solutions (at least) have been presented over

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the centuries, namely, (1) Physicalist solutions (there is no mind

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  stuff!) (2) Pure Idealist solutions (there is no body- 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stuff=matter) and (3) Dualist varieties where both exist and you  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; try to figure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  out how the two stuffs interact etc... It seems to me that your  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attempted solution is of type (2), Am I right?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Well OK. I guess you make the difference between solipsism and  
<br />
idealism which can be realist or platonist. The mind stuff is just  
<br />
numbers and their dreams ...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You do however
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  invoke a favorite classical physicalist hypothesis in the form of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; YD and than you &quot;turn the tables&quot; on it, so to speak, no?
</em><br />
<br />YD has nothing with classical physicalism, unless you assume  
<br />
physicalism at the start. YD does not assume a universe physically  
<br />
exist, only that &quot;I&quot; exists and that I am supported by a relatively  
<br />
stable (sheaf) of computations. Actually the use of the YD in the UD  
<br />
reasoning is accompanied by an explicit postulation of a physical  
<br />
universe for making the reasoning easier, but that hypothesis is  
<br />
explicitly eliminated toward the end of the reasoning.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I think that the YD motivation is the weakest link in your chain  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (a real Trojan horse because it is physically untenable)
</em><br />
<br /><br />I really don't understand. To make YD false you must associate  
<br />
yourself to something non-turing emulable. Nobody has ever found a  
<br />
non, turing emulable process. Recall that quantum-like indeterminacy  
<br />
can be retrieved in the self-discourse of self-duplicating machine.  
<br />
Also, with some notable exception like Penrose, everybody accept YD.  
<br />
I teach about it since more than 30 years, and only strict dualists  
<br />
(with assumes explicit substancial soul) criticize it. I told you  
<br />
that those who get my point (of the UD Argument) and still soes not  
<br />
accept the conclusion prefer to abandon Arithmetical Realism. It is  
<br />
an empirical discovery in the sense that (I think we agree here), it  
<br />
is almost nonsense for me to abandon arithmetical realism.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; to so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  if you use just to demolish it later, why use it at all?
</em><br />
<br /><br />This is the eleventh time you confuse &quot;p -&gt; q&quot; with &quot;q -&gt; p&quot;. Unless  
<br />
(here) you mean by &quot;demolish YD&quot;, the non use of YD in the  
<br />
translation of UDA in arithmetic.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why not proceed to that interview directly?
</em><br />
<br />You can.  But this is like going from physics to the study of  
<br />
differential equation. Here it would consist to go from cognitive  
<br />
science to pure mathematics. Actually if you justify that probability  
<br />
*must* obey to the Bp -&gt; Dp rule (probability one of p entails the  
<br />
probability of ~p is not one), then OK, you can extract the comp- 
<br />
physics from math alone. But how will you explain the Bp -&gt; Dp rule  
<br />
in that context? Why suppress a motivation which also makes the link  
<br />
with theology: the fact that the comp-doctor cannot pretend that  
<br />
&quot;science&quot; has show that you can survive with an artificial brain (in  
<br />
case comp is true).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Can that be done and leave your argument intact? That would make it  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a lot more interesting in my opinion...
</em><br />
<br /><br />You are in minority here, but this is just because most people agree  
<br />
with YD (or at least it makes sense as an hypothesis in the cognitive  
<br />
science).
