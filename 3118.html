<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     The problem comes when some people consider death in this context.  I'll 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; try to explain the insane view on this, but since I am not myself insane I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will probably not do so to the satisfaction of those that are.
</em><br />
<br />I have mixed feelings about this line of reasoning, but I can offer
<br />
some arguments in favor of it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     OK.  Now, suppose there are two exactly identical twins who lead exactly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; identical lives up until a moment when suddenly, one of them is killed.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (This serves as a model of the case with people in parrallel universes 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; acting as 'twins'.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Obviously, if you care about these twins, the death was a bad thing to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happen.  There is now less of these people.  True, one twin survived, but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; supposing he is still happy, there is still only half as much happiness in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the world due to the twins as there would be if one had not died.  I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; formalize this by saying that the measure of such conscious observations has 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; been reduced by a factor of 2.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     The insane view however holds that the mind of the &quot;killed&quot; twin somehow 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; leaps into the surviving twin at the moment he would have been killed.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thus, except for the effect on other people who might have known the twins, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the apparent death is of no consequence.
</em><br />
<br />It's not that the mind &quot;leaps&quot;.  That would imply that minds have
<br />
location, wouldn't it?  And spatial limits?  But that notion doesn't
<br />
work well.
<br />
<br />Mind is not something that is localized in the universe in the way
<br />
that physical objects are.  You can't pin down the location of a mind.
<br />
Where in our brains is mind located?  In the glial cells?  In the neurons?
<br />
The whole neuron, or just the synapse?  It doesn't make sense to imagine
<br />
that you can assign a numerical value to each point in the brain which
<br />
represents its degree of mind-ness.  Location is not a property of mind.
<br />
Hence we cannot speak of minds &quot;leaping&quot;.
<br />
<br />It makes more sense to think of mind as a relational phenomenon, like
<br />
&quot;greater than&quot; or &quot;next to&quot;, but enormously more complicated.  In that
<br />
sense, if there are two identical brains, then they both exhibit the
<br />
same relational properties.  That means that the mind is the same in
<br />
both brains.  It's not that there are two minds each located in a brain,
<br />
but rather that all copies of that brain implement the mind.
<br />
<br />Further support for this model can be found by considering things from
<br />
the point of view of that mind.  Let it consider the question, which
<br />
brain am I in at this time?  Which location in the universe do I occupy?
<br />
There is no way for the mind to give a meaningful, unique response to
<br />
this question.  It does not occupy just one brain or just one location.
<br />
Any answer will be both wrong and right.
<br />
<br />In this model, if the number of brains increases or decreases, the mind
<br />
will not notice, it will not feel a change.  In fact, it has no way
<br />
of telling.  No introspection will reveal the number of implementations
<br />
of itself that exist in a universe or a multiverse.  (Possibly it can
<br />
tell that there are more than zero implementations, but even that will
<br />
be questioned by some.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     This they call the &quot;quantum theory of immortality&quot; (QTI) because, due to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quantum mechanics, there would always be some parrallel universe in which 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any given person would have copies that live past any given age, and they 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; figure the minds would always leap into those copies.  I will from now on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; call it the &quot;fallacious immortality nonsense&quot; (FIN).  Those beliefs are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dangerous by the way, since they can encourage suicide or worse.
</em><br />
<br />This is only dangerous if the belief is wrong, of course.  The contrary
<br />
belief could be said to be dangerous in its way, if it were wrong as well.
<br />
(For example, it might lead to an urgent desire to build copies.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;    I have repeated pointed out the obvious consequence that if that were 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; true, then a typical observer would find himself to be much older than the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; apparent lifetime of his species would allow; the fact that you do not find 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; yourself so old gives their hypothesis a probability of about 0 that it is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the truth.  However, they hold fast to their incomprehensible beliefs.
</em><br />
<br />This is a different argument and has nothing to do with the idea of
<br />
&quot;leaping&quot;, which is mostly what I want to take issue with.  All this
<br />
argument shows is that measure or probability decreases with time.
<br />
The implications of this for how minds should regard changes in their
<br />
numbers of implementation are complex and IMO unresolved.  (For example,
<br />
is adding a new implementation to be desired as much as the destruction
<br />
of one implementation is to be avoided?  What about size, are big
<br />
implementations better than small ones?  How about speed, does it
<br />
matter if the implementations get out of phase, how much does it affect
<br />
probability and measure?)
