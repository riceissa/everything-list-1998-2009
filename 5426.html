Hi all,
<br />
<br />Regarding the graviton theory I've found an interesting description:
<br />
<br />&quot;It is proposed that the photon is the sole elementary particle in nature; energy consists of helical wave photons and
<br />
matter of orbital interlocking photons; gravitons are spinning linear wave photons which are emitted at a constant rate
<br />
to preserve matter; the uneven transmission of gravitons causes the gravitational force and that the gravitational lens
<br />
is a misnomer.&quot;
<br />
<br />I've found an article that in a simplistic way gives an overview of matter, energy and gravitational force. This article is a bit old but helps to
<br />
understand the graviton subject.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www2.rideau.net/gaasbeek/spap3.html">http://www2.rideau.net/gaasbeek/spap3.html</a>
<br />
<br />It seems that gravitons are a form of photon emission different from the one that is defined as energy waves and the one that defines mass. Is this
<br />
logical? Well, at least I think
<br />
it is a good start for discussion.
<br />
<br />Cheers,

<br />Subject:    Black Holes and Gravity Carrier
<br />
<br /><br />Greetings again to the list. It has been a while since I posted something
<br />
to think
<br />
about, and in that case I did a lot of arguing for my cause! I enjoyed it a
<br />
lot, and I
<br />
hope others did too. But I again must stress that I do not rise to the
<br />
level where I
<br />
can appreciate deep mathematical discussion, and so I hope that discussion
<br />
on this
<br />
topic that I will now raise can be expressed by logic (I have argued before
<br />
that logic
<br />
includes mathematics as a subset of logic but that logic also includes all
<br />
things that
<br />
mathematics seems to have no good way to define -- because mathematics is
<br />
ultimately digital and so mathematics by its nature can only approximate
<br />
the
<br />
analog). Ok, on to the topic!  :)
<br />
<br />Some experiments have indicated that gravity is associated with a force
<br />
carrier, and
<br />
that this force carrier moves somewhere below or at the speed of light.
<br />
Experiments
<br />
continue as the indications have not been absolutely proven. Perhaps I will
<br />
be
<br />
corrected on this, but it is my understanding that a force carrier is
<br />
generally thought
<br />
of as some sort of particle that transfers mass/energy between other
<br />
particles.
<br />
<br />This presents a logical problem relative to black holes. Beyond the event
<br />
horizon,
<br />
nothing with mass can escape there from and make itself known to our
<br />
observable
<br />
universe. Apparently every particle has at least some mass, however tiny,
<br />
else a
<br />
black hole would be seen to radiate for reasons other than absorbsion of
<br />
half of a
<br />
virtual particle pair. (I always had trouble with that absorbsion mechanism
<br />
of black
<br />
hole evaporation, since it seemed logical to me that on the average 50% of
<br />
what
<br />
gets absorbed would be matter as we know it and 50% would be anti-matter,
<br />
with an
<br />
average net gain of zero absorbsion).
<br />
<br />The only logical way that I can fathom for energy to escape from a black
<br />
hole, and
<br />
express itself as gravity, is if the force carrier &quot;particle&quot; has
<br />
absolutely no mass.
<br />
Again, perhaps I will be corrected, but it is my understanding that gravity
<br />
can only
<br />
affect particles that have mass. But a &quot;particle&quot; expressed only as energy
<br />
does not
<br />
equate with e=mc^2  (e=0 * [the speed of light squared]) because e must
<br />
then = 0.
<br />
<br />If a gravity carrier has any mass whatsoever then by what mechanism could
<br />
it
<br />
possibly and in such abundance escape from a black hole event horizon and
<br />
make
<br />
itself known in our observable universe?
<br />
<br />Or could it be that gravity is, in reality, pure nothing -- that gravity is
<br />
an expression
<br />
of the case where e really does = absolutely zero? Is gravity really just
<br />
an attempt
<br />
by matter to interact with an absolute nothing? If so, then is a black hole
<br />
really --
<br />
nothing? Could it be that gravity is expressed relative to the *inverse* of
<br />
e=mc^2?
