<br />
I thank everyone again for their questions.  Below is a new accumulated and 
<br />
corrected statement of my approach for easy reference.
<br />
<br /><br />POSTULATE:
<br />
<br />All counting numbers exist with countably infinite copies in a seething 
<br />
foamy fractal.
<br />
<br />Call this fractal Everything.
<br />
<br />In this fractal every universe Uj is isomorphic to a non deterministicly 
<br />
self sorting sequence Uj(i) of these numbers that, upon chance encounters 
<br />
between numbers, they self sort according to:
<br />
<br />1) pj(i) = {Rj(pj(i - 1)) + PLj(i)} is the compressed form of Uj(i).
<br />
<br />where Rj(pj(i - 1)) is the fixed rule set of a particular universe acting 
<br />
on the previous Uj(i) and the underlying FAS structure is:
<br />
<br />a) It has a single axiom unique to a particular family of universes which 
<br />
is in pj(1), it serves as pj(0) and initiates the recursion.
<br />
<br />b) It has a fixed set of rules = Rj
<br />
<br />c) It has an alphabet = differently sequenced strings of bits I call types 
<br />
of &quot;regions&quot;.  Each region type is isomorphic to a physical structure that 
<br />
has existence such that the location of a discrete space point inside a 
<br />
small fixed portion of a grid is coded by each region type.  [In our case I 
<br />
believe the grid to be 3D and most likely Face Centered Cubic.]  The axiom 
<br />
contains the entire initial alphabet for a particular universe.
<br />
<br />Uj(i) contains a theorem of this FAS giving a specific arrangement of 
<br />
regions - a configuration of a particular universe.
<br />
<br /><br />2) Uj(i) grows in length [number of bits] randomly to avoid Chaitin's limit 
<br />
on how much information you can put into an N-bit number.  Since pj(i) can 
<br />
not yield pj(i) unless pj(i -1) is empty and each pj(i) is clearly longer 
<br />
than pj(i - 1) the sequence can not stop on a finite number.  To sustain 
<br />
this growth in complexity of Uj(i) the FAS - again as per Chaitin - must 
<br />
also increase in complexity - randomly adding additional alphabet elements 
<br />
- new types of regions.
<br />
<br />3) When Uj(i) gets to have a countably infinite number of bits the sequence 
<br />
ends. From Turing [limits to FAS size] and Hilbert [Mathematical 
<br />
existence]- See Tegmark Section II.
<br />
<br />The numbers in the fractal non deterministicly self sort upon encounters 
<br />
because of (2) and Uj(i -1) contains Rj and recognizes any PLj(i) suitably 
<br />
higher valued than its own PLj(i -1) - i.e.  Uj(i -1) picks the first good 
<br />
number it encounters out of a countably infinite set of potential successors.
<br />
<br />(2) and (3) may not be independent of (1).
<br />
<br />The fractal contains all universes potentially an infinite number of times.
<br />
<br />Alternate beginning: No numbers exist.  This is unstable logically. It 
<br />
contains no answer to its own stability.  It decays into the above fractal 
<br />
which is sufficient to contain the answer.
<br />
<br />Once Nothing becomes Everything to answer its own stability, the question 
<br />
of the stability of Nothing is no longer meaningful to Everything neither 
<br />
is &quot;Nothing?&quot; itself, so Everything is now stuck as Everything.
<br />
<br />What I just wrote down is just spontaneous self replication with mutation, 
<br />
in another word Life - it is a potential in every universe.
<br />
<br />Additional considerations and comments:
<br />
<br />First Person:
<br />
<br />My equation is life. Each universe is an &quot;I&quot;. Some sub strings of a 
<br />
universe's Uj(i) may carry the illusion of an individual &quot;I&quot;. See also 
<br />
Tegmark, footnote # 2 - each of my universes is its own SAS.
<br />
<br />Nothing:
<br />
<br />My point in having an alternate initiation, as I have said many times, is a 
<br />
logical one - you can not prove a postulate. In this case - if we have 
<br />
arrived at the correct conclusion - Everything exists - [or at least 
<br />
someone's concept of Everything] there must be more than one postulate that 
<br />
results in the same conclusion. Neither will have an argument that can 
<br />
exclude the other otherwise it amounts to a proof. This seems only straight 
<br />
forward.
<br />
<br />Deterministic vs non deterministic:
<br />
<br />Please note that my equation is piecewise computational.  Each 
<br />
computational run in Uj(i) is separated from another by non deterministic 
<br />
jumps.  In a way it unifies both views.
<br />
<br />Note:
<br />
<br />My fractal:
<br />
<br />My fractal is more than the usual description of &quot;Everything&quot; that I have 
<br />
seen. It has no selection at all up to the Hilbert/Turing limit [Which copy 
<br />
of all copies would a person select to form the usual version of the &quot;All 
<br />
strings exist.&quot; approach?],  and it is dynamic in the sense that it is 
<br />
overall not deterministic from the point of view of a particular &quot;I&quot; - a 
<br />
particular Uj(i). This &quot;I&quot; is not a selection either since there would be a 
<br />
countable infinity of identical &quot;I&quot;'s and so too for the sub string 
<br />
illusions of &quot;I&quot;.  Each string at a given &quot;i&quot; has a fixed history, but an 
<br />
uncertain future.  Each universe &quot;j&quot; has no interaction with another.
<br />
<br />As to not going to a continuum in my fractal I do not see how that can 
<br />
satisfy Hilbert - i.e. consistency - given Turing - i.e. no proofs beyond a 
<br />
countably infinite number. In my opinion consistency has no application 
<br />
beyond Turing's limit to &quot;proof&quot;.
<br />
<br />A suitable metaphor for my equation.
<br />
<br />Think of a very tall highly branched bush.
<br />
On the lower levels ants wink into existence and start climbing the bush.
<br />
At each junction of the bush an ant must select a single up-going branch.
<br />
At each selection the ant morphs - grows more hair or something.
<br />
When the ant gets to the top it winks out.
<br />
Wherever the ant goes on the bush there are ants ahead of it and ants 
<br />
behind it.
<br />
There is a countably infinite number of kinds of bushes each with a 
<br />
countably infinite number of copies each with a countably infinite number 
<br />
of ants.
<br />
Individual ants randomly jump to other bush types that are identical to 
<br />
their current bush below their current position but differ above.
<br />
<br />When it comes to no selection you have to get serious.
<br />
The remarkable thing is there is an equation for it.
<br />
<br />How I see &quot;regions&quot; making up our particular universe can be found in my 
<br />
papers posted at:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.connix.com/~hjr/model01.html">http://www.connix.com/~hjr/model01.html</a>
<br />
<br />though the current version needs much work to inject the above much neater 
<br />
version of my core model.
<br />
<br />Hal
