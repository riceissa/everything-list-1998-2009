Dear George,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I read your post I was struck by the necessary assumptions that you noted:
<br />
<br />1) that the black hole is large enough that the tidal forces do not rip apart the observer falling into it
<br />
2) death occurs in one branch of the multiverse but not in another.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What if we considered the case where we used the size (mass) of the black as a parameter to evaluate the communicability of our hypothetical infinite computer? What would be the analogue in the multiverse?
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been re-reading my copy of Bohm and Hiley's The Undivided Universe and in particular the discussion of Gell_Mann and Hartle's consistent histories interpretation and comparison with MWI. It occurs to me that the size of the black hole (a function of its mass) and the differences between a pair of branches of the multiverse (a function of the non-commutability of their associated operators?) both seem to be 3-person notions (borrowing Bruno Marchal's term) while the idea of infinite computing that we are discussing seems to be a 1-person notion. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relation that Hawking et al have written about between a black hole's mass and its entropy seem to be 3-person notions and we seem to be in need of a 1-person analogue. Could it be that the notion of decoherence could be this 1-person analogue?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will be reading the papers that Jean-Michel referenced and dreaming up a thought experiment. Do you have any ideas at this time?
<br />
<br />Kindest regards,
<br />
<br />Stephen

<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Stephen,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Amazingly, I had kind-of the same thought. From the point of view of information flow, there seems to be an analogy between 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;1) falling down into a black hole and 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;2) &quot;dying.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Both events results in the cessation of information flow between two observers. In both cases one of the observers appears to &quot;die&quot; from a third person point of view, but stays alive from a first person point of view.  In the first case the cessation of information flow is due to a relativistic effect. In the second case, the continuing of the information flow is due to a quantum effect. The following must be assumed: 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;1) that the black hole is large enough that the tidal forces do not rip apart the observer falling into it
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;2) death occurs in one branch of the multiverse but not in another.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;There is definitely a relationship between entropy and black holes as Hawkings has shown and there is a relationship between entropy and information. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;This topic is ripe for a nice thought experiment.
<br />

<br />Dear Jean-Michel and Hal,

<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All good humor aside, Hal makes a good point! The conditions that would
<br />
exist as one approaches the event horizon seem to be such that any signal
<br />
would be randomized such that the end result would be that Nature prevents
<br />
infinite information (or conclusions requiring infinite computational power)
<br />
from reaching any finite part of itself.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interestingly this seems to be the same situation as what forms an event
<br />
horizon (around a space-time singularity) in the first place. Could it be
<br />
that this is an active example of the so-called anthropic principle? It also
<br />
reminds me of a solution to the Quantum Suicide problem!
<br />
<br />Kindest regards,
