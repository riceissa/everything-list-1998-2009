<br />What is the point? Do we have experimental procedure to validate
<br />
the opposite of the fanciful scenario? Giving that we were talking about
<br />
first person scenario, in any case it is senseless to ask for
<br />
experimental procedure. (experience = first person view; experiment =
<br />
third person view).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;If you insist to label me thusly. But, really, instead of glib assertions and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;pointers to your thesis (what has formal logic to do with reality?) you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are not being very convincing so far.
</em><br />
<br />Don't tell me you were believing I was arguing.
<br />
About logic, it is a branch of mathematics. Like topology, algebra, analysis
<br />
it can be *applied* to some problem, which, through some hypothesis,
<br />
can bear on some problem. With the comp hyp mathematical logic makes
<br />
it possible to derive what consistent and platonist machine can prove about
<br />
themselves and their consistent extension.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;My point is that formal systems are a very powerful tool with very small 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reach,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;unfortunately.
</em><br />
<br />But I never use formal system. I &quot;modelise&quot; a particular sort of machine by
<br />
formal system, so I prove things *about* machines, by using works
<br />
*about* formal system. I don't use formal systems. I prove things in informal
<br />
ways like all mathematicians.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Because we know that QM is not a TOE. You haven't heard?
</em><br />
<br />How could be *know* QM is not a TOE?  (I ask this independently of
<br />
the fact that I find plausible QM is not a *primitive* TOE).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;This is ridiculous. You're referring to a specific notation, which needs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;systems to produce and to parse. Remove all instances of such systems, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;everything is instanstly meaningless.
</em><br />
<br />You believe that the theorem &quot;there is an infinity of primes&quot; is a human
<br />
invention?  (as opposed to &quot;a human discovery&quot;).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Perhaps we should put our hypothesis on the table. Mine is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; comp by which I mean arithmetical realism, Church thesis, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the &quot;yes doctor&quot; hypothesis, that is the hypothesis that there is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a level of description of myself such that I don't detect any differences
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in case my parts are functionaly substituted by digitalizable  device.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Do you think those postulates are inconsistent?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I do not see how arithmetic realism (a special case of Platonic realism, is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that correct?) is an axiom. I agree with the rest of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;your list.
</em><br />
<br />Perhaps I have been unclear. By Arithmetic Realism I mean that Arithmetical
<br />
Truth is independent of me, you, and the rest of humanity. There exist
<br />
weaker form of that axiom and stronger form. Tegmark for instance
<br />
defends a much larger mathematical realism (so large that I am not sure
<br />
what it could mean). As I said some ultrafinitist defends strictly
<br />
weaker form of mathematical realism.
<br />
The more quoted argument in favour of arithmetical realism is the one based
<br />
on Godel's theorem, and presented by him too) which is that any formal
<br />
systems (and so any ideally consistent machines) can prove, even in principle,
<br />
that is with infinite time and space, all the true proposition of arithmetic.
<br />
But look also to the site of Watkins
<br />
<a href="http://www.maths.ex.ac.uk/~mwatkins/zeta/index.htm">http://www.maths.ex.ac.uk/~mwatkins/zeta/index.htm</a>
<br />
for a lot of evidence for it (evidence which are a priori not related to
<br />
my more theoretical computer science approach).
<br />
Now my goal (here) is not really to defend AR as true, but as sufficiently 
<br />
plausible
<br />
that it is interesting to look at the consequences. You can read some
<br />
main post I send to this list where I present the argument according to
<br />
which if we take comp seriously (comp = AR + TC + &quot;yes doctor&quot;) then
<br />
physics is eventually a branch of machine's psychology (itself a branch
<br />
of computer science&quot; itself a branch of number theory.
<br />
If you find an error, or an imprecision, please show them.
<br />
Or, if there is a point you don't understand, it will be a pleasure for me
<br />
to provide more explanations.
<br />
Also, I thought you were postulating an universe, aren't you? (I just try
<br />
to figure out your philosophical basic hypothesis).
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />
<br />Bruno
