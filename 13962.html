<br />
Bruno, that was quite a response. Let me just include those part to which I
<br />
have something to say - in most cases your 'half-agreement' cuts my guts.
<br />
==============
<br />
&quot;...I like very much David Deutsch's
<br />
idea that if we are scientist we are in principle willing to know that
<br />
our theory is wrong, but to discover this we have to take them
<br />
seriously enough.&quot;
<br />
<br />I never said I am a scientist, I just speculate (and allow to change my
<br />
mind). What I brought together is in my distsinction a 'narrative', not a
<br />
theory, not even a hypothesis.
<br />
<br />&quot;(JM)&gt; And i still did not get an acceptable explanation why 'numbers' are
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the basics of everything (and WHAT they may be).
</em><br />
(BM) Nobody can KNOW that. The fact is that ONCE you take the comp hyp
<br />
seriously enough into consideration, then you can, by work, be
<br />
eventually convince that our own immateriality (which follows easily by
<br />
comp) has to be &quot;contagious&quot; on our possible neighborhoods.&quot;&lt;
<br />
<br />(JM):
<br />
Why don't I take the 'comp hyp (whatever it is) seriously BEFORE I know
<br />
about numbers?
<br />
I see it circular: unless 'comp' has nothing to do with numbers. I cannot
<br />
take seriously a 'thing' to get to that 'thing'. As you wrote:
<br />
<br />(BM):
<br />
&quot;...we are not talking about those numbers humans
<br />
(re)invented, but on those which have to exist independently of us once
<br />
we accept some minimal amount of computer science, without which we
<br />
could infer nothing fron comp (our, well mine, working hypothesis)....&quot;
<br />
<br />(JM):  -RE-invented? if we agreed (D. Bohm) that the numbers we use as
<br />
numbers
<br />
are human inventions, how did they exist independentloy of us?
<br />
Is even the 'littlest' computer science feasible without numbers?
<br />
And I would not accept something to exist before it came into existence just
<br />
to make
<br />
a 'hyp' workable - which I don't see feasible without such circularity.
<br />
<br />BM:  (Bohm) denies comp -
<br />
(JM): I do not. I don't know what it is. I hope it is not that embryonic
<br />
digitality-churner we have on our desk (don't even mention 'binary'), but if
<br />
it is named ptoperly (comp?) it has 'something' to do with computationality
<br />
(involving numbers to handle). Now this may be your mystical unknowable
<br />
'number' what I was willing to call (not condoning) the Almighty Creator, or
<br />
anything else - of course not emulable by an (embryonic level) Turing
<br />
machine.
<br />
&nbsp;I just wonder WHY NUMBER? because Plato talked numbers? That was 2500 years
<br />
ago at the epistemic cognitive level of that time!  OK, our mind is still
<br />
not capable of thinking beyond the level it can think, but to substitute the
<br />
ORIGIN by something invented in the course much much later on, because we
<br />
have some idea about THAT, does not seem to me 'scientific' enough.
<br />
Unless you give me a better explanation - if you care.
<br />
<br />(BM):
<br />
All proof in math are particular case of thought experiments. In
<br />
philosophy-of-mind, theology, theoretical physics and math, the only
<br />
tools available are the thought experiments.
<br />
<br />(JM):
<br />
(I wrote: &gt; I also keep away from ANY thought experiences, they are products
<br />
of
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OUR state of the mind at the time they are 'invented'....&lt;
</em><br />
in which &quot;experience&quot; is a typo, it should read &quot;experiment&quot;. Sorry about
<br />
it)
<br />
<br />I was referring to those 'thought experiments' (EPR, teleportation etc.)
<br />
which imagined physical tests on imaginary (unreal?) circumstances to prove
<br />
a position. To &quot;test&quot; ideas
<br />
in mental domains is a mental  effort, not what I would call a 'thought
<br />
experiment'.
<br />
<br />(JM):
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am in subconscious trouble with the machine, which is differently
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; identified by Robert Rosen and I find a lot acceptable in his ideas.
</em><br />
(BM):
<br />
Imo, Rosen is wrong on Church thesis. But this could wait when I
<br />
succeed to explain more about CT later ..
<br />
(JM):
<br />
I was referring to his nomenclature of the 'formal' (reductionist,
<br />
conventional) terms vs his tems in the impredicative view of the total
<br />
interconnective 'cpmplexity'. &quot;His&quot; machine is computer-emulable while his
<br />
'natural systems' always have noncomputable elements.
<br />
I consider the latter as part of the world, while the restricted view -
<br />
mostly topically selected within boundaries we set for our presently
<br />
accessible observations - is what I call  &quot;model&quot;, encompass the
<br />
conventional sciences. He worked in math and theor. biology as well.
<br />
(I am looking forward to reading your explanatory piece about the CT. )
<br />
Interesting match in your par:
<br />
&quot;Just keep track of the definitions. By angels and gods (note the
<br />
plural) I mean things which are not turing-emulable, or if you prefer,
<br />
any entities which are provably not machines.&quot;
<br />
(JM):
<br />
&quot;provably&quot; is ambiguous. i would accept &quot;per definitionem&quot;.
<br />
<br />(BM): What is conventional sciences.
<br />
(JM): basically: what you and Nietzsche described. I consider it the
<br />
historical figment of the ever changing (advancing?) observational skills
<br />
and explanational levels, built upon the previous flight of knowledge-base
<br />
in the human (scientific) establishment. It applies math to calfculate the
<br />
quantities deduced from the developing observations on the 'model-view' (see
<br />
above). Such incomplete information may lead to paradoxes. Thinking is
<br />
'reduced' to the actual level of epistemic content viewed as &quot;all that there
<br />
is&quot;.
<br />
I call it reductionistic, (the only way we can think!) building an ingenious
<br />
edifice of a physical world and its mental attributes. I disagree with
<br />
conclusions drawn from 'within boundaries' (i.e. models) and applied to
<br />
'beyond boundaries' (the 'totality?) - what (conventional science) has a
<br />
habit to do.
<br />
<br />(BM):
<br />
Science = doubt and modesty. When scientist
<br />
pretend to know the truth, they are mad, that's all.
<br />
<br />(JM): i think - while doubt and modesty are good attributes - there must be
<br />
some more to it. I could not identify, what, but some understanding and
<br />
ordering of signs(?) we perceive
<br />
(and i am also realist enough to believe in such) has also its place in it.
<br />
There is no &quot;truth&quot; only &quot;my truth&quot; or &quot;your truth&quot;. Experience is (1P)
<br />
interpretation, even 3P communication.
<br />
<br />(BM): (on atoms - molecules):
<br />
&quot;Plotinus (+300) did already understand that such notions were inconsistent
<br />
with the
<br />
more primitive platonic ideas. Now, I could accept that atoms (the modern
<br />
one), like the spherical hypothesis about the earth are excellent local
<br />
theories.
<br />
<br />(JM):
<br />
I try to keep out of comparisons in long obsolete levels in
<br />
knowledge-development. Those elements I try to think within are products of
<br />
the most recent advancement. In old times the guys were smart, logical, even
<br />
wise and their underdeveloped circumstances may disturb our mind in
<br />
speculations in novelties FOR the future development.
<br />
I ;ove your distinction of the &quot;local theories&quot; - it may save our sanity.
