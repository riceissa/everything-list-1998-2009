One might ask Bob, what is the measure of Universes in which a Bob finds M but heeds M' without being suicidal or at least hazardous to his own health? At any rate, Bob could hardly have reached in sound mind &amp; body the cognitive height of many-worlds ideas without heeding M instead of M'. &quot;Why not stick with them's what brung you, Bob?&quot; (Also, it seems to me that Bob might well have to be at least partially heeding familiar M in order to function well enough to try to heed M'.)
<br />
<br />Of course, Bob could quip, &quot;Denial is not just a river in Egypt.&quot; To some extent, we all stick to one or another interpretation in spite of the interpretation's apparent incoherence, &amp; in spite of apparent contrary evidence. The fact that the incoherence or contrariness may be merely apparent is the temptation (we revise core ideas more reluctantly than others, &amp; rightly so) -- the temptation to go wrong &amp; persist even against a wind of disconfirming information. There is no surefire formula to avoid errors in any of these directions. There's open-mindedness (good) &amp; there's flakiness &amp; wishy-washyness (bad.) There's respect for what has stood the test of time so far (good) &amp; there's dogmatism (bad). (As a practical matter, as regards knowingly to play by a different set of rules than that of the reality which one lives -- it seems to me that psychologically &amp; biologically we are constituted so that we can't do that unless we are insane, &amp; unlikely to be argued back to sanity

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Now suppose that two people, Alice and Bob, somehow agree that a measure M is the objectively correct measure, but Bob insists on using measure M' in making decisions. He says &quot;So what if universe A has a bigger measure than universe B according to M? I just care more about what happens in universe B than universe A, so I'll use M' which assigns a bigger measure to universe B.&quot; What can Alice say to Bob to convince him that he is not being rational? I don't see what the answer could be.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;How about if she whacks him on the head?  Maybe that would knock some sense into him.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Seriously, she could confront him with the reality that in the universe branch they are in, measure M works, while M' does not.  Reality, whether in the form of a knock on the head or more peaceful interactions, is not subjective.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now, true, there would be branches in the multiverse where M' worked while M did not.  Believers in objective measure would say that those branches are of low measure and so &quot;don't matter&quot;, but as you point out, Bob can argue symmetrically that this branch where he is stuck with Alice and M has worked is also, to him, of low measure.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;But we can solve this conundrum while retaining symmetry.  Rationality should demand allegience to the observed measure.   It is irrational to cling to a measure which has been rejected repeatedly by observations. If classical definitions of rationality don't have this property, we should fix them.  Bob is irrational to hold to M' in a universe whose observations reveal M.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now, this will demand that in White Rabbit universes, ones where the quantum or thermodynamic laws just happen to fail due to bad luck, a rational person would have to abandon his (correct!) belief in a lawful universe and come to believe (incorrectly!) in miracles.  However this is actually a reasonable requirement, since we are stipulating that such
</em><br />
miracles have been observed.
