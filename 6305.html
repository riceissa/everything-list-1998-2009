Dear Danny,
<br />
the farthest thing from my mind is hostility or acrimony. 
<br />
<br />I am not up to those theroetical considerations of you, which Russell found reasonably treatable in his response. I am open to the 'unrealistic' - my own worldview is beyond the reductionist scientific domains - and I thought about your formulations something similar. I was referring mostly to the language: it resembled to me as a 101 physics text with ideas coming from the unrealistic. 
<br />
Or is it strongly realistic - just not in my terms? 
<br />
<br />New ideas should not be left for those with 'adequate scientific background' because the prejudice of the model-based sci. limitations is hard to overcome. (Model in my terms here: meaning a boundary-enclosed topical - or other - segment of the totality (wholeness) considered as a substantial 'unit').
<br />
In such respect Q science is a model, time is a problem-spot for me in which I have not reached a me-satisfying solution yet, I consider the Multiverse limitless in terms of an &quot;in our universe defined 'space' concept&quot; and so 'unmappable' in our views. 
<br />
Your questions refer to things not applicable to my concepts.
<br />
Which does not mean anything like &quot;I am right and you are wrong&quot;, or vice versa, just that I am not thinking in these terms.
<br />
<br />Sorry for my style.
<br />
<br />John M

<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I certainly have no ill intent, and am a little disappointed that an idea can not be addressed in a proper way,  that being to simply explain the inherent problems.  No need for hostility or acrimony.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, John has a valid point (if he showed up on my legal lists that I am a member of and started giving legal advice perhaps the reaction would be the same, though I'd like to think we, even as attorneys believe it or not, might be a little kinder) and the &quot;theories&quot; (or rampant speculations John may suggest) and explanations thereof really should be left to those with adequate scientific background to handle them, and I therefore overstepped my bounds to an extent.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, I do have two questions:  
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;1.  If it is true that &quot;This is the distinctive core of the quantum concept of time:  Other times are just special cases of other universes&quot; (Deutsch, FOR, p.278), in the multiverse context, how can time be thought of as anything other than an area map of the multiverse?; 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Does it really matter if the cube is really a rectangle?  Regardless of the size of the &quot;time area,&quot; (and it's proportionality to the &quot;real&quot; spatial dimensions) you would still have to divide it by the length of the world line, eliminating the volume.  
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said before, this is speculative.  But hopefully someone will be willing to point out the error of my ways, which I am sure would help more than just myself understand all of this a little better.        
<br />

John, you make out like Danny is trying to &quot;Sokal&quot; out this list. I
<br />
don't think that is the case. His use of terminology is very muddled -
<br />
he is a lawyer, remember, and lawyers use language in a different way
<br />
to the rest of us.
<br />
<br />I was trying to see if he had the germ of an idea here, that properly
<br />
expressed might provide an interesting insight. Alas I haven't been
<br />
successful so far...
<br />
<br />Cheers

&nbsp;&nbsp;Danny,
<br />
(I think) I made the mistake to read your post below.
<br />
Did you compose it from the habitual vocabulary of physics-related sciences
<br />
to construct a gobbledygook that sounds VERY scientific?
<br />
I enjoyed it as abstract paintings. Don't look for sense in those either.
<br />
I figured you may have an identification for 'time' to image it as
<br />
geometrical.
<br />
I heard about one relationship netween (physical) space and (physical) time
<br />
it is called (physical) motion. You wrote:
<br />
[DM]: &quot;It would be like drawing a square and asking why height is
<br />
proportional to length.  The relationship is necessary. &quot;
<br />
Same with your &quot;cube(???)&quot; and the time expressed as area. Or whatever.
<br />
<br />I post these remarks only to make listmembers (whom I honor no end) to think
<br />
twice before spending their time and braingrease to work into it and -
<br />
maybe - getting a Nobel prize (ha ha).
<br />
<br />If there is something logical, understandable, followable, in your position,
<br />
I would be happy to learn about it.

<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I was asking is why you think &quot;time-area&quot; should be proportional

<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Russell,
<br />
<br />Thanks for your interest in this.  I did not make this any easier by
<br />
bungling the initial concept a little in my first post.  To directly
<br />
answer your question, I am assuming space-time is a single entity, with
<br />
time representing the spatial area of the multiverse.  Therefore, the
<br />
question you pose really wouldn't make sense.  It would be like drawing
<br />
a square and asking why height is proportional to length.  The
<br />
relationship is necessary.
<br />
<br />Going back to all of our multiverse stacks with the cube on it, all
<br />
these stacks would equal the time-area.  This is the &quot;depth&quot; of the cube
<br />
in the multiverse, that would allow the cube to store 10^300 bits of
<br />
information.  The time area equals the cube in it's totality in the
<br />
multiverse.  So why, in our universe, can we only store information
<br />
equal to the surface area?  Well we know we don't have access to the
<br />
whole cube, because we are not in all of the universes that this cube
<br />
exists in.  So we have to divide the cube by something to represent the
<br />
fact that we are only on one stack.  The proper divisor would be the
<br />
length of the cube, because we are existing on a time-line.  The
<br />
information that can be stored is limited to a single set of outcomes- a
<br />
line along the plane of the time area (a stack of pictures).
<br />
<br />This leaves us with the Holographic principle.
<br />
<br />Please note this is an interesting concept (to me) I am proposing
<br />
because the geometry of it makes sense when I picture it mentally.  You
<br />
or others much smarter than I will have to explain why this works or
<br />
doesn't work mathematically in QM or TOR.  Colin Bruce suggests in his
<br />
book that the cube volume contains multiverse information (as a
<br />
speculative ending to his book), and when I started thinking about it I
<br />
realized if you take the &quot;multiverse block&quot; concept seriously, and
<br />
consider time a spatial dimension through the multiverse, a cube of
<br />
space would only provide a full content of information before it was
<br />
seperated out into all of the individual outcomes as it moved through
<br />
time (or how about &quot;multiverse space&quot;?).
<br />
<br />A cube of space really does hold it's volume in information.  But we
<br />
have to divide by time.  Particularly, the length of the time plane
<br />
because the rest of the time area has been lost to the other
<br />
outcomes/universes/stacks (or whatever allows you to conceptualize it
<br />
the best).  This is speculative (obviously).  I'd like to hear some
<br />
feedback, as this explains a lot (to me anyway) if the concept is right.
