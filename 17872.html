<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if the machine cannot find &quot;mechanically&quot; the f_n, what can we do or

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hope for? What is the price of universality?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Gödel's theorem has forced us to abandon the notion of universal  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; provability (in the realm of the relations and functions on

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; numbers), and this results mainly from the use of a diagonal

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argument 5Godel 1931). So when Church told him that he decided to

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thought this was impossible, and that he could by diagonalization

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; refute that universality pretension. But 'overnight', after failing

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to diagonalize against lambda-calculus, he realize that Church *may*  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be correct, and he invented the vocable of &quot;Church thesis&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; CHURCH's (original) thesis: a function from N to N is computable if  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we can explain in lamdda-calculus how to compute it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What could be so special about Church language that it could define  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ALL computable functions from N to N, and yet be immune to the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; diagonal argument?
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK. I have defined a computable function (from N to N) as being a  
<br />
function which can computed from a finite description in some  
<br />
language, and this makes them intuitively enumerable. The admittedly  
<br />
vague idea here, is that any set of finite things is either finite or  
<br />
enumerable.
<br />
<br />But of course, this is not entirely convincing, we could use a non  
<br />
enumerable set to multiply non enumerably finite beings, and a case  
<br />
could be made that if we allow a non enumerable set of languages, or a  
<br />
non enumerable set of beings understanding those languages, we could  
<br />
find for *any* functions, a language defining that function or a being  
<br />
computing that function, making all function computable, by some  
<br />
being, and this would make the notion of computability relative if not  
<br />
trivial.
<br />
<br />Let me do something which illustrates this in a non trivial way,  
<br />
though, but which relies on what I have already said about the  
<br />
ordinals some times ago. I will repeat the definition.
<br />
<br />I will write as if I was criticizing myself.
<br />
<br />The notion of computable function does not make sense, by the argument  
<br />
above. To define a notion of computability, you have to define first a  
<br />
fixed language L, in which the correct grammatical expressions will be  
<br />
definition of functions, that is will correspond to the description of  
<br />
how to compute those functions, on each of their arguments. In that  
<br />
case, the f_n are clearly *computably* enumerable. The bijection n -&gt;  
<br />
f_n has to be computable, then. But in that case,  the g function,   
<br />
the one defined by g(n) = f_n(n) + 1,  is clearly computable, and the  
<br />
Cantor-like diagonal argument just showed that that g is NOT  
<br />
*definable* in the language L. L cannot be universal.
<br />
<br />And given that the argument seems not to depend on which language L,  
<br />
it looks like we have proved that there is no universal language.
<br />
<br />After all I could build a new language now, by adding a primitive  
<br />
computing g to the L language. Diagonalizing again would provide a new  
<br />
function g2, which we can add as new primitive again, and so one,  
<br />
getting
<br />
<br />L, g, g2, g3, g4, ...
<br />
<br />I could even build a more powerful language by adding a primitive  
<br />
which computes all gi automatically, giving a new primitive, that I  
<br />
can add to L, so that this process can be extended into the  
<br />
constructive tranfinite (if you remember the post on the growing  
<br />
functions, and the ordinals).
<br />
<br />Could such a process converge toward a language computing all  
<br />
computable functions? That is, is there a universal language in which  
<br />
we can define all computable function?
<br />
<br />It will not converge for any effective, or constructive of computable  
<br />
ordinal, because if it does, we would get a computable bijection from  
<br />
N to N^N-comp. This we already know cannot exist, the diagonal leads  
<br />
to 00 = 1.
<br />
<br />Could it converge on non effective ordinals. Yes, and this can be used  
<br />
to make precise the idea that by liberalizing enough the notion of  
<br />
language we can define universal language. But using a non effective  
<br />
ordinal to define the notion of computable would illustrate only how  
<br />
non universal that notion could be.
<br />
<br />All this to make more amazing the seemingly naive proposal by Church,  
<br />
to Kleene, for a definition of computability:
<br />
<br />A function is computable only if I can described in my language (which  
<br />
was lambda calculus, the famous cousin of the combinators).
<br />
<br />Kleene will try to diagonalize on Church functions, but will not  
<br />
succeed. The reason is that Church language defines a vaster class of  
<br />
functions that N^N-comp. Those will be noted phi_n, to distinguish  
<br />
them from the computable functions. That class is computably  
<br />
enumerable, the bijection n ==&gt; phi_n is computable, but not all are  
<br />
computable functions from N to N, so may be undefined. This saves the  
<br />
language from the diagonal: now g can belong to the class, and so g  
<br />
will be some f_k, and f_k(k) will be equal f_k(k)+1. But f_k(k) will  
<br />
be undefined, the computation of f_k(k) will run forever, the computer  
<br />
is crashing, if you want.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;If the language L is universal, it defines all computable functions  
<br />
from N to N. This means that in the computable enumeration of the  
<br />
partial computable functions from N to N., phi_n, that is
<br />
<br />phi_1, phi_2, phi_3, ....
<br />
<br />All the f_n will appear, here and there. The f_n constitute a  
<br />
enumerable subset of the phi_i. But certainly not a computably  
<br />
enumerable subset. If L is universal, then there is absolutely no  
<br />
algorithm for telling, in general, if phi_j is a total function or a  
<br />
strictly partial function. If that would exist, we would be able to  
<br />
effectively filtrated the f_n from the phi_n, to provide an effective  
<br />
enumeration of all N^N-comp, which gives 0 = 1.
<br />
<br />Note this. Here we have used arithmetical realism. If you remember, it  
<br />
was the use of the excluded middle which provides me the tool to prove  
<br />
that there are irrational numbers x and y such that x^y  is rational,  
<br />
showing you only that the solution was in the set {sqrt(2)^sqrt(2),  
<br />
(sqrt(2)^sqrt(2))^sqrt(2)}. Here, by assuming a language L is  
<br />
universal (for N^N-comp) we have to accept that the functions f_n are  
<br />
non constructively dispersed in a vaster set: the phi_i. The  
<br />
universality of the language makes that dispersion absolutely non  
<br />
computable. We see that the price of universality is the unability to  
<br />
compute definable feature of nameable of objects, and unpredictible  
<br />
behavior.
<br />
<br />Is Church thesis true?
<br />
<br />There are four deep reasons to find CT rather plausible.
<br />
<br />1) The closure of the class of partial computable functions for the  
<br />
diagonalization.
<br />
2) All attempts, some very independent, some very different, to define  
<br />
a general notion of computability has always given the same class N^N- 
<br />
comp.
<br />
3) Anything proved comp-insoluble remains unsolved
<br />
4) the common impression we do share the elementary intuition of  
<br />
finite things and of applying finite things on themselves repetitively  
<br />
up to a possible but not guarantied satisfaction.
<br />
<br />The rational x^y disperse itself non constructively in  
<br />
{sqrt(2)^sqrt(2), (sqrt(2)^sqrt(2))^sqrt(2)}, but I told you that  
<br />
complex mathematics can show that the precise solution is  
<br />
sqrt(2)^sqrt(2). But the non constructive dispersion of the f_n in the  
<br />
phi_n cannot be dispensed with. The diagonal above shows exactly that,  
<br />
and that is what makes arithmetical realism indispensable if we want a  
<br />
notion of universality. Here realism really means an acceptance of a  
<br />
universal modesty about our ways to separate the f_n from the phi_n,  
<br />
and many propositions relating those objects and the machines which  
<br />
compute them.
<br />
<br />Let &lt;x,y&gt; represents a the image of a computable bijection from NXN to  
<br />
N, so that we can code a couple of numbers by one number. Let phi_n be  
<br />
a &quot;universal enumeration&quot; (that is an enumeration of all partial  
<br />
computable functions)
<br />
I will say that a number u is universal, if phi_u(&lt;x,y&gt;) = phi_x(y).
<br />
<br />I have to go. Ask question, and don't worry if it seems difficult. It  
<br />
is difficult.  Conceptually, just not for the notations and the typo  
<br />
errors .... I will sum up soon all what the same diagonalization proved.
<br />
<br />Diagonalization and non constructive reasonings are the key tools for  
<br />
the study of machine's theology and machine's machine's theology ....   
<br />
You can see this as the self-study of an abyssal intrinsic ignorance,  
<br />
with the discovery that it is related to life forms and many other  
<br />
unknowns and mysteries ....
<br />
<br />Questions, remarks?
