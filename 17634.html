<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Right.  And Dennett is choosing his words carefully, so as to advance
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; his social re-engineering agenda.  He want's to keep the idea of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; responsibility for utilitarian reasons..it's hard to keep a society
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; going without it, and so he redefines it's meaning to be compatible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; with determinism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It's not &quot;responsiblity&quot; in the common usage,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sure it is.  It's what justifies reward and punishment.
</em><br />
<br />In the common usage it is what justifies the death penalty.
<br />
<br />In the common usage, responsibility justifies vengence, as well as
<br />
deterrence and rehabilitation.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; it's &quot;Dennettian
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; compatibilist responsibility&quot;.  He just shortens the latter to plain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;responsibility&quot; in an attempt to mislead the unwary.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The common usage of &quot;responsibility&quot; may not be logical, but it has a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; definite meaning, and it's not the meaning that Dennett assigns to it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; in that quote.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And what meaning is that?  Can you give an operational definition, an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ostensive definition, any definition other than &quot;it is what it is&quot;?
</em><br />
<br />In the common usage responsibility implies that the buck stops here.
<br />
Not because it's convenient, not because you choose not to pass the
<br />
buck, but because it literally stops here.  The causal chain should
<br />
not be traced further back.  We don't need to worry about your
<br />
childhood conditions, or how much your mommy and daddy loved you, or
<br />
whether you are a good person, or hoped for better things.
<br />
<br />There's no point in examining the conditions that led to your action,
<br />
because YOU are responsible for that action, and you will bear the
<br />
full weight of the consequences.  Not because you will learn
<br />
something.  Not because it will produce better behavior in the future.
<br />
&nbsp;Not because it will deter others from acting as you did.  But because
<br />
you are responsible.
<br />
<br />That's the common usage.  And, given determinism, I say there's no
<br />
such thing.  Given determinism, the whole concept is crazy.
<br />
<br />Dennett also says there's no such thing, but he wants to claim the
<br />
word and re-purpose it for his own uses.  Not because it's such a
<br />
great word that rolls off the tongue, but because he wants to pull a
<br />
slight of hand, and keeps it's law-and-order, no-nonsense,
<br />
tough-on-crime-tough-on-criminals connotations while changing it's
<br />
actual definition.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Dennett knows this, but he wants society to adopt his
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; terminology and view point, so he keeps throwing it out there in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; hopes that it'll stick.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; If determinism is true, then there is no responsibility (common
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; usage).  My acts are an inevitable result of the initial state of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; universe and the laws that govern its evolution...neither of which are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; my doing.  I get neither credit nor blame for anything, as events
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; could not have transpired other than they did.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; First, some things may be random (like the way your brain developed).
</em><br />
<br />Not given determinism, right?  And Dennett isn't arguing against
<br />
determinism.  He's arguing FOR compatibilism.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Second, the utilitarian definition of responsibility - something that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; justifies you being punished or rewarded for you actions - applies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *only* if what you do is determined by your experience.
</em><br />
<br />I know.  Animal training basically.  Social conditioning.
<br />
<br />But that's not the common usage.  In my experience at least.  Usage
<br />
determines meaning.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Otherwise there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would be no justification for giving you the experience of reward or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; punishment.
</em><br />
<br />Reward and punishment probably aren't the right words.  Probably we
<br />
should say &quot;positive and negative reinforcement&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; You (and Dennett) can redefine responsiblity and then say, &quot;there, you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; have that&quot;.  But this is a change from the common usage...and so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; effectively a new word.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You haven't defined it at all.  In fact you seem to assert it doesn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exist and hence no one is allowed to define it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />I actually would rather not have it used.  The word &quot;responsibility&quot;
<br />
carries too much moralistic &quot;libertarian free will&quot; baggage I think.
<br />
I think the common usage of responsibility is nonsense, and trying to
<br />
redefine it more logically while keeping the old connotations just
<br />
results in confusion and continued irrational thinking amongst the
<br />
&quot;Old Testament&quot;-inclined.
<br />
<br />SO, with that in mind...what were you implying when you added that
<br />
quote?  What was your motivation?  What were you accusing me of?
<br />
<br />In short...why did you introduce that Dennett quote into this thread?
