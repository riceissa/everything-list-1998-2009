</em><br />
<br />So are you agreeing it makes sense to talk about the laws of logic 
<br />
&quot;expressing&quot; some truths without this being a time-dependent process?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  static relationships between static truths, relationships that would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;exist regardless of whether anyone contemplated or &quot;discovered&quot; them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;As are my kernels of information.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;For example, in every world where X and Y are simultaneously true, it is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;also true that X is true, even if no one notices this.'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;Sure,  That is a kernel.  Observation does not make a kernel a kernel.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;OK, but this isn't really relevant to my question, namely, why does any of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;this require time?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;A kernel does not need a set of rules to make the informational 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;relationships within it what they are.  The very words &quot;rules&quot;, &quot;laws&quot; and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the like carry the implication of a process where the rules and laws are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consulted and followed.  This is a hidden assumption of some ordered 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sequence - time.  I do not know how to be clearer than that.
</em><br />
<br />I agree that world/kernels don't need to consult the &quot;laws of logic&quot; in 
<br />
order to avoid logical contradictions. I'm just saying that if you look at 
<br />
the facts of each world/kernel and translate these facts into propositions 
<br />
like &quot;all ducks have beaks&quot; (within this particular world/kernel), then you 
<br />
will find that no proposition or collection of propositions about a single 
<br />
world/kernel violate the laws of logic--for instance, you won't find that a 
<br />
proposition and its negation are *both* true of a single world/kernel, in 
<br />
exactly the same sense (ie applying to the same 'domain' like I talked about 
<br />
earlier).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Likewise, you didn't address my point that &quot;I can't think of any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;historical examples of new mathematical/scientific/philosophical ideas 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that require you to already believe their premises in order to justify 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;these premises&quot;,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I do not believe that Cantor would be sympathetic with that.  I think you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;need to believe in infinity in order to justify working to understand it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and thus justify it.
</em><br />
<br />Why do you say that? Cantor's ideas about infinity could be justified in 
<br />
terms of existing commonly-accepted mathematical notions. For example, 
<br />
mathematicians already thought the idea of sets made sense, so he defined 
<br />
the notion of special sets called &quot;ordinals&quot;, each of which was a set of 
<br />
smaller ordinals, with the smallest ordinal being the empty set. Then, since 
<br />
there seems to be no obvious contradiction in considering the &quot;set of all 
<br />
countable ordinals&quot;, it's easy to see that this set is itself an ordinal but 
<br />
cannot be a countable one, so its cardinality must be higher than the 
<br />
countable ordinals--he defined this cardinality as &quot;aleph-one&quot;. Then if you 
<br />
consider the set of all ordinals with cardinality aleph-one, this must be an 
<br />
ordinal with cardinality higher than aleph-one, which he called aleph-two, 
<br />
and so on. See my post at <a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m4919.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m4919.html</a> 
<br />
for a little more explanation. All this could be described in terms of 
<br />
preexisting ideas about set theory, he wasn't requiring anyone to already 
<br />
believe his ideas about infinities in order to prove them.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;I believe Bruno said that some information systems included a set of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;beliefs.  As I recall the &quot;premises&quot; are these beliefs.  Justification 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;comes from emotions [based on other beliefs] surrounding the resulting 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;system such as simplicity, elegance of apparent explanation etc.   So it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;seems to me that justification is part of belief.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;My point is that if I want to demonstrate the truth of some statement X to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;you (without appealing to new empirical evidence), I look for some set of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;premises that we *already* share, and then try to show how these premises 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;imply X. I can't think of any historical example where someone's new idea 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;is accepted by other people without the person appealing to common 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;premises they already share. Can you?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;See above re &quot;infinity&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />Well, see my comments above, I don't think that's a valid example.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and you didn't address my question about whether you think there could 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;be a world/kernel where a vehicle simultaneously
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;Again time inserts itself as the notion of &quot;simultaneously&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;&quot;Simultaneously&quot; shouldn't be taken too literally, &quot;X and Y are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;simultaneously true&quot; is just a shorthand way of saying that X and Y are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;truths that both apply to exactly the same domain, whether &quot;same domain&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;means &quot;same universe&quot;, &quot;same time&quot;, or whatever. For example, if I say 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;&quot;Ronald Reagan was President of the U.S. in 1985&quot; and &quot;Bill Clinton was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;President of the U.S. in 1995&quot;, these are two non-contradictory truths 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;that apply to the domain of &quot;U.S. history in our universe&quot;, so in that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;sense they are &quot;simultaneous&quot; truths about this domain even though they 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;refer to different dates. On the other hand, if I said &quot;Ronald Reagan was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;President of the U.S. in 1985&quot; and &quot;Lex Luthor was President of the U.S. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;in 1985&quot;, and both applied to the domain of &quot;U.S. history in our 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;universe&quot;, then this would be a contradiction. But if I made clear that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;the first statement applied to the domain of &quot;U.S. history in our 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;universe&quot; and the second applied to the domain of &quot;U.S. history in an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;alternate universe&quot; then there would no longer be any contradiction in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;these statements.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;had different numbers of wheels,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;If the world was a CA and half the applicable cells were in a two wheel 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;state and half in a three wheel state what would that be?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I can't really picture a CA where the state of a cell specified a number 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;of wheels, but never mind--this would clearly involve no contradiction, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;because the statements &quot;the cell is in a 2-wheel state&quot; and &quot;the cell is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;in a 3-wheel state&quot; would not apply to the same domain, since they refer 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;to two *different* cells. There is only a logical contradiction here if 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;both apply to exactly the same domain--in this case, the same cell in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;same &quot;world&quot; at a single time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;My intent in the above was for both kinds of cells to be in the same 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;universe.  If cells are on the order of the Plank distance in diameter and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;half of the applicable states were in a two wheel state and the rest in a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;three wheel state then what would an observer many orders of magnitude 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;larger observe?
</em><br />
<br />Like I said, I don't know what you even mean in saying a cell expresses 
<br />
&quot;number of wheels&quot;--what exactly would an observer measure when he looked at 
<br />
these cells? Would the cells just have little number-labels on them? If so, 
<br />
if they were too small to read, the observer just wouldn't be able to tell 
<br />
what state they were in, he wouldn't somehow conclude a single cell was in 
<br />
two different contradictory states. Likewise, if we think of cells that can 
<br />
be either black or white like in the &quot;Game of Life&quot; cellular automata, if 
<br />
the cells were too small to see then we would just see various shades of 
<br />
gray, we wouldn't believe a single cell was in two contradictory states. If 
<br />
you're imagining he's measuring the states of cells in some other way 
<br />
besides examining them visually, you need to specify what kind of 
<br />
measurement you're talking about. In any case, I can't imagine *any* type of 
<br />
measurement that would lead a reasonable observer to think he had observed a 
<br />
logical contradiction, so if you think this idea makes sense you'll have to 
<br />
flesh out the scenario a bit.
<br />
<br />In any case, even if an observer *mistakenly* concludes two contradictory 
<br />
statements about states are true, the fact remains that within this 
<br />
world/kernel, there are no *actual* contradictions in the set of true 
<br />
propositions about the states of different cells at different times. So 
<br />
you're still not really addressing the main issue, which is whether you 
<br />
believe a world/kernel can contain a genuine contradiction, two 
<br />
contradictory truths about precisely the same domain within this 
<br />
world/kernel that are both true.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Do you think it could be possible for two contradictory statements about 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;the state of a single cell at a single moment in a single world to *both* 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;be true?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I still think that Bruno has allowed for such a case - see above re 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;Loebian machine&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />I don't understand exactly what Bruno was talking about here, but I suspect 
<br />
he just means that a Loebian machine can &quot;believe&quot; or print out two 
<br />
contradictory statements, I'm confident he doesn't mean that the world 
<br />
containing this machine would be inconsistent, or that a third-person 
<br />
observer would actually see any inconsistent truths about what the machine 
<br />
was doing or saying. In other words, the observer might see a machine that 
<br />
at 4 o' clock says &quot;X is true&quot; and then at 5 o' clock says &quot;X is false&quot;, but 
<br />
this is not a contradiction from the observer's point of view, there is 
<br />
still a single definite truth about what the machine was doing at any given 
<br />
moment. An actual contradiction would be if the observer saw it was true 
<br />
that at 4 o' clock the machine printed out &quot;X is true&quot; but also saw it was 
<br />
true that at 4 o' clock the machine did *not* print out &quot;X is true&quot;.
<br />
<br />We've already been through this issue before in the context of axiomatic 
<br />
systems--the fact that an axiomatic system or Turing machine may print out 
<br />
statements whose *meaning* (in terms of some model) is contradictory does 
<br />
not prove that the universe is contradictory, it just proves that it's 
<br />
possible to create axiomatic systems/Turing machines which print out false 
<br />
statements as well as true ones. Only if you were arguing that any set of 
<br />
statements printed out by an axiomatic system/Turing machine must correspond 
<br />
to sets of truths in an actual world in &quot;the All&quot; would this show that the 
<br />
All is contradictory, but of course there's no need to believe this.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Should we have the hubris to impose this somewhat questioned concept on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;all other universes?  In my view the states of all universes preexist 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in the All [as some of the kernels] and &quot;Physical Reality&quot; washes over 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;them in some sequentially inconsistent way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;So do believe the statement &quot;the states of all universes don't preexist 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in the All, and 'Physical Reality' does not wash over them in any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;sequentially inconsistent way&quot; would be false? If so, it seems that you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;yourself have the &quot;hubris&quot; to apply the logical law of noncontradiction 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to statements about reality as a whole.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;I am just try to think of the simplest system that contains no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;information and yet has a dynamic that could support what might be the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;universe some may believe they inhabit.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;But then is there really a process like &quot;think&quot;?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;The All as I defined it [my current proposed belief] contains a kernel 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;for the Nothing as well as a kernel for the All thus the nesting.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;From the inside perspective we are forced to be in, all we have to justify
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;such a belief system is our own beliefs re efficiency, beauty, etc. etc. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;so our beliefs justify our beliefs.  Is this not self referential?  I do 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;not intend to impose that on the system as a whole.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;You didn't really answer my question above. What I'm asking is, every time 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;you make a statement about reality as a whole, do you intend to deny that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;the negation of your statement is true? For example, above you say that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;&quot;The All contains a kernel for the Nothing as well as a kernel for the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;All.&quot; If I make the statement &quot;The All does *not* contain a kernel for the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Nothing *or* a kernel for the All&quot;, would you then say my statement is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;false? Please give me a yes-or-no answer to this question, if at all 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;possible.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;One has to at least stick with the definitions that establish the system.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;A zero net information system that actually contains all information would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have to contain all kernels.  Within the context of my beliefs [permises] 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;then I would answer yes since your statement violates this premise.  This 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is not a matter of the &quot;Laws of Logic&quot; but rather an informational relation 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;within the system.
</em><br />
<br />I think this is ducking the issue, since you're just saying that statements 
<br />
about &quot;informational relations within the system&quot; cannot be contradictory, 
<br />
which means you are demanding that these statements obey the laws of logic, 
<br />
even if you don't justify this demand in terms of &quot;the laws of logic&quot;. Call 
<br />
it whatever you want, it still amounts to the same thing.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I do not agree with your &quot;rather&quot; based cancelation of the residual 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;information issue since I see it as an unnecessary complication of my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;own method.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;rather based cancellation.&quot; If you're 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;talking about my point that every statement could be simultaneously true 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and false if you throw out the laws of logic, obviously *I* don't 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;believe this is a good way to solve the &quot;residual information issue&quot;, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;since I think it's nonsensical to allow logical contradictions. But 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;since you seem to be saying the laws of logic aren't absolute, I was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;just pointing out that you would have no basis for denying that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;statements about reality can be simultaneously true and false. If you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;say that it is an &quot;unnecessary complication&quot; to allow statements about 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;reality as a whole to be both true and false, then you are in effect 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;saying it would be an unnecessary complication to claim that the laws of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;logic don't apply to reality as a whole!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;I just believe in my own sense of neatness.  You gave two apparently 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;contradictory statements which when put in the same pot seem to sum to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;what I propose for the whole system absent the &quot;rather&quot;. I wish to avoid 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;including our &quot;laws of logic&quot; as a necessary component of a kernel.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;But if you &quot;wish to avoid&quot; allowing statements about reality to be both 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;true and false, that means you &quot;wish to avoid&quot; allowing reality as a whole 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;to contain logical contradictions! The two ideas are exactly equivalent.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;What has that got to do with what I said above?
</em><br />
<br />Sorry, I misread what you were referring to in the &quot;wish to avoid&quot; statement 
<br />
there. But again, it's irrelevant whether you think of &quot;the laws of logic&quot; 
<br />
as some separate thing which must be &quot;included&quot; in a kernel, that's not what 
<br />
I've been arguing. I'm just arguing that that if you list the complete set 
<br />
of true propositions about a given kernel, you will find that these 
<br />
propositions do not violate the laws of logic. Are you disagreeing with 
<br />
that? Are you saying there could be kernels where &quot;X is true&quot; would be a 
<br />
true statement about the kernel, but &quot;X is false&quot; would also be a true 
<br />
statement about the kernel, with the understanding that both statements 
<br />
apply to exactly the same &quot;domain&quot; within the kernel?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Would both of your statements not be in the same meta system?  I can in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;fact - as I said - accept both because in my opinion they add up to what I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;am saying.
</em><br />
<br />When you say &quot;both of your statements&quot;, which two statements of mine are you 
<br />
referring to?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;My point is that it is more pleasing to think of the dynamic as being 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;inconsistent [each state has no cause effect link of any sort to any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;other state] if there are other components of the All that are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;inconsistent.  But these are not really the same thing and I begin to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;think the latter is a side bar issue.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;There is nothing &quot;inconsistent&quot; in a logical statement about having no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;causal links between states--such an idea does not imply any logical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;contradictions (ie it doesn't imply that two contradictory statements can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;both be true in precisely the same domain).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I said exactly this when I said  &quot;But these are not really the same thing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and I begin to think the latter is a side bar issue.&quot; right above.
</em><br />
<br />But you said the statements are &quot;inconsistent&quot;, I disagree with your use of 
<br />
that word to describe a lack of causal links between states, just like I 
<br />
disagree with the idea that if a machine prints out two inconsistent 
<br />
statements, that would somehow show that the world/kernel containing the 
<br />
machine was inconsistent. I am using &quot;inconsistent&quot; solely to refer to 
<br />
actual logical contradictions in the set of true statements about a single 
<br />
world/kernel.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;indicated that as much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  I think you are misunderstanding what the &quot;laws of logic&quot; really mean, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;examples like different cells of a cellular automata having different 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;states
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;See above: Its in the eye of the beholder.
</em><br />
<br />I disagree, there will be no situation where a reasonable observer would 
<br />
conclude that two inconsistent statements were both true, in exactly the 
<br />
same sense.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;or different states in a series
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Where did &quot;series&quot; come from?
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From your own comments about a series of states with no causal connection to 
</em><br />
each other.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;having no causal relationship to one another don't contradict the laws of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;logic in any way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I was not talking about the &quot;laws of Logic&quot; I was asking if the universe in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;question did not in fact have a vehicle with both two wheels and three 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;wheels from the point of view of an observer much larger than a cell.
</em><br />
<br />Truths about a world do not depend on what an observer thinks. If I believe 
<br />
that the sky is green, it's still true that the sky in this world is 
<br />
actually blue.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Does that mean you say the statement &quot;each state of the dynamic is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;completely dependent on the current state&quot; is false?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;I believe we should avoid applying logic to a zero internal information 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;entity such as the All.  I believe this causes problems.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;You didn't answer my question. Would you say the statement &quot;each state of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;the dynamic is completely dependent on the current state&quot; is false, or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;would you say it's true, or would you say it is neither true nor false, or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;what?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;How do you justify the question?
</em><br />
<br />I'm just asking whether, when you make statements about reality as a whole, 
<br />
you are assuming that the negation of these statements are false. If you 
<br />
are, then your statements about reality as a whole obey the laws of logic, 
<br />
even if you are for some reason hesitant to use the words &quot;laws of logic&quot; to 
<br />
describe this feature of your statements.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;My quest is zero information in the whole system.  I established a system I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;believe meets this criteria.  Its premises could I suppose be taken as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;true&quot; without proof in the usual manner.  However, if my system indeed has 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;no information how do the &quot;laws of logic&quot;, &quot;truth&quot;, &quot;contradiction&quot;, etc 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;apply to no information by any justification?
</em><br />
<br />If you believe the laws of logic are &quot;information&quot; (I don't agree), and yet 
<br />
statements about your system never violate these laws (ie if a given 
<br />
statement about your system is true, the negation is always false), then one 
<br />
of your premises must be false--either the premise that requiring a set of 
<br />
statements to obey the laws of logic introduces additional &quot;information&quot; 
<br />
into the system, or the premise that you have indeed succeeded in devising a 
<br />
system that contains zero information.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Any other premise set establishes an alternate system.  Am I to presuppose 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that there is not a meta system that has more than one zero information 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;system in it or that such a system could not somehow contain a negation of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;one or all of my premises?  See also above.
</em><br />
<br />I don't understand what you mean by &quot;a meta system&quot; here, or what relation 
<br />
that has to what we were talking about above.
