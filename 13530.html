Hi again,
<br />
<br />Russel:
<br />
I'm sorry, but you worked yourself up into an incomprehensible
<br />
rant. Is evolution creative in your view or not? If it is, then there is
<br />
little point debating definitions, as we're in agreement. If not, then we
<br />
clearly use the word creative in different senses, and perhaps defintion
<br />
debates have some utility.
<br />
<br />Colin:
<br />
There wasn't even the slightest edge of 'rant' in the post. Quite calm,
<br />
measured and succinct, actually. Its apparent incomprehensibility? I have
<br />
no clue what that could be.... it's quite plain...
<br />
<br />RE: 'creativity'
<br />
... Say at stage t the biosphere was at complexity level X and then at
<br />
stage t = t+(something), the biosphere complexity was at KX, where X is
<br />
some key performance indicator of complexity (eg entropy) and K &gt; 1 ....
<br />
<br />This could be called creative if you like. Like Prigogine did. I'd caution
<br />
against the tendency to use the word because it has so many loaded
<br />
meanings that are suggestive of much more then the previous para.
<br />
Scientifically the word could be left entirely out of any desciptions of
<br />
the biosphere.
<br />
<br />The bogus logic I detect in posts around this area...
<br />
'Humans are complex and are conscious'
<br />
'Humans were made by a complex biosphere'
<br />
therefore
<br />
'The biosphere is conscious'
<br />
<br />That assumes that complexity itself (organisation of information) is the
<br />
origin of consciousness in some unspecified, unjustified way. This
<br />
position is completely unable to make any empirical predictions about the
<br />
nature of human conscousness (eg why your cortex generates qualia and your
<br />
spinal chord doesn't - a physiologically proven fact).
<br />
<br />The same bogus logic happens in relation to quantum mechanics and
<br />
conscsiousness:
<br />
&quot;Quantum mechanics is weird and complex&quot;
<br />
&quot;Consciousness is  is weird and complex&quot;
<br />
therefore
<br />
&quot;Quantum mechanics generates consciousness&quot;
<br />
<br />I caution against this. I caution against using the word 'creativity' in
<br />
any useful scientific discussion of evolution and complexity.
<br />
<br />cheers
<br />
