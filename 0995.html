<br />
Let me offer an alternative approach to the Maudlin/Marchal implementation
<br />
question which is consistent with computationalism but avoids some of
<br />
the difficulties.
<br />
<br />Computationalism says that implementation of a certain class of algorithms
<br />
is necessary and sufficient for consciousness.  Maudlin presents an
<br />
experiment where a seemingly minor and (he argues) irrelevant change makes
<br />
the difference between whether a conscious computation is implemented
<br />
or not.
<br />
<br />However to conclude that Maudlin's change (adding an inert block) makes
<br />
consciousness go away (even assuming computationalism) is a fallacy.
<br />
We agree that the initial computation (sans block) is conscious.
<br />
We agree that adding the block changes the computation (by changing
<br />
counterfactual behavior).  But we cannot conclude from this that the
<br />
resulting computation is not conscious.
<br />
<br />The new configuration, with the block, implements a different computation
<br />
than without (if you take counterfactuals into consideration).  But have
<br />
we proven that this new computation is not conscious?  No!  All we have
<br />
proven is that this is different from the computation we started with.
<br />
<br />But more than one computation can be conscious, obviously.  It is
<br />
conceivable that the new computation, although different, is conscious
<br />
as well.  This is a possible escape from Maudlin's argument.
<br />
<br />Let me further offer a rationale for why this might be plausible.
<br />
<br />Consider a human brain which is listening to music with its eyes closed.
<br />
It will not be having very much activity in the visual cortex.  Now we,
<br />
acting as a demon, come along and shut off much of the visual cortext.
<br />
We disturb the neurons so that they will not behave properly.  In fact,
<br />
we set it up so that the whole brain will shut down if a certain level
<br />
of activity is reached in the visual cortex.
<br />
<br />Now as long as the brain keeps its eyes closed and keeps listening to
<br />
music, it will not notice these changes.  But if it opens its eyes, it
<br />
will experience a drastic change, including loss of consciousness.
<br />
<br />The question is whether, as long as the brain keeps its eyes closed, the
<br />
brain will continue to be conscious even though we have made this change.
<br />
I think the answer is clearly, or at least very plausibly, yes, it will
<br />
remain conscious.  All the neural activity will stay the same as it
<br />
would have if we had not intervened, and there is no reason to expect
<br />
consciousness to evaporate just because we made a change which *could*
<br />
terminate conciousness if certain events occur.
<br />
<br />If you agree with this, I would argue that getting to Maudlin's
<br />
situation (with the block) is now just a matter of degree.  In the
<br />
listening-to-music case, the change we made was relatively minor, and we
<br />
left the brain with a considerable amount of freedom of action before
<br />
it would stumble onto a counterfactual state which would terminate it.
<br />
In Maudlin's case, the brain is much more restricted.  It has only a
<br />
minutely narrow path it must follow before it falls into a counterfactual
<br />
state which will make it stop.  As long as it stays on that path, doing
<br />
exactly what we predicted, it will behave normally and will not be &quot;aware&quot;
<br />
that danger lurks at every step.
<br />
<br />We can imagine a range of situations where we provide greater or
<br />
lesser amounts of restrictions in terms of counterfactuals.  If minor
<br />
restrictions leave the brain conscious, it seems plausible that major
<br />
restrictions would do so as well.
<br />
<br />If we agree with this argument, we can have both supervenience and
<br />
computationalism, it seems to me.  We agree that Maudlin's machine changes
<br />
the program which is instantiated, but we claim that the new program
<br />
is also conscious.
<br />
