Hi folks,
<br />
I am finally getting somewhere. My paper has just been published. :
<br />
<br />Hales, C. 'Dual Aspect Science', Journal of Consciousness Studies vol. 
<br />
16, no. 2-3, 2009. 30-73.
<br />
<br />Under dual aspect science exploration and deliverables take on two 
<br />
fundamental forms:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laws-of-appearance ( = T, what we do now) 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laws-of-structure( = T' what we are recently/partly doing but wasn't 
<br />
organised/recognised).
<br />
<br />A physics of P-consciousness becomes empirically tractable under the DAS 
<br />
framework set of  structure (T') descriptions.  The DAS paper resulted 
<br />
from empirical science (observation of scientists) and is a framework 
<br />
which is empirically testable - the procedure is in the paper. No 
<br />
philosophy is required. The observed behaviour of scientists operating 
<br />
under the framework is decisive.
<br />
<br />I can deliver a .PDF of the paper to anyone who is interested (off list).
<br />
<br />The idea is that science's output (= &quot;laws of nature&quot;) actually has two 
<br />
intimately enmeshed 100% mutually consistent but very different forms:
<br />
T     (grammars as per usual)
<br />
T'   (computational output in a generalised dynamic form of cellular 
<br />
automaton)
<br />
<br />The former is a set of forever-uncertain rules about 100% certain 
<br />
(agreed) things.
<br />
The latter is a set of 100% certain (chosen/agreed) rules about  
<br />
forever-uncertain structural primitives.
<br />
<br />The two are 'joined' and empirically supported by the one single 
<br />
evidence system - P-consciousness.
<br />
<br />This nicely (mirror-) symmetric knowledge framework eliminates a raft of 
<br />
strange behavioural inconsistencies in science (in the behaviour of 
<br />
scientists). DAS finally enables us to formally deal with the underlying 
<br />
structure of things in an empirically viable way. It means that 
<br />
scientists trading in loops, strings, froth, branes etc etc finally have 
<br />
a home. All we have to do is use our theory to make a prediction of the 
<br />
appearance brain material consistent with the delivery of 
<br />
P-consciousness as predicted by the T' aspect structural primitive of 
<br />
choice. T-aspect science cannot possibly do this. In the paper is a 
<br />
large list of the kinds of predictions to expect of your T'-aspect.
<br />
<br />I have used my loop structure - cellular automaton. It predicts brains 
<br />
look and operate like they do, although its hard to see at first.  It is 
<br />
to be written up and published ASAP. Maybe others would like to see how 
<br />
they can do the same with other structural primitives.
<br />
<br />The abstract is below. I also have a 'DAS how to/reader user guide' 
<br />
which will help you distil the DAS paper - which is a bit of a monster - 
<br />
43 pages. The computational exploration of loops is, in effect, the 
<br />
actual scientific delivery-form of the 'entropy calculus' I have spoken 
<br />
about from time to time here.
<br />
<br />I discuss the nature and forms of TOE in the DAS paper. They have 2 
<br />
forms as well. Indeed the T'-aspect TOE is literally the rules and 
<br />
initialisation of the 'natural CA'. You can't analytically express it. 
<br />
You have to compute it and slice it to observe it.
<br />
<br />Enough for now!
<br />
<br />cheers

<br />
<br />*ABSTRACT*. Our chronically impoverished explanatory capacity in respect 
<br />
of P-consciousness is highly suggestive of a problem with science 
<br />
itself, rather than its lack of acquisition of some particular 
<br />
knowledge. The hidden assumption built into science is that science 
<br />
itself is a completed human behaviour. Removal of this assumption is 
<br />
achieved through a simple revision to our science model which is 
<br />
constructed, outlined and named ‘dual aspect science’ (DAS). It is 
<br />
constructed with reference to existing science being ‘single aspect 
<br />
science’. DAS is consistent with and predictive of the very explanatory 
<br />
poverty that generated it and is simultaneously a seamless upgrade; no 
<br />
existing law of nature is altered or lost. The framework is completely 
<br />
empirically self-consistent and is validated empirically. DAS  
<br />
eliminates the behavioural inconsistencies currently inhabiting a world 
<br />
in which single aspect science has been inherited rather than chosen and 
<br />
in which its presuppositions are implemented through habit rather than 
<br />
by scientific examination of options by the scientists actually carrying 
<br />
out science. The proposed DAS framework provides a working vantage point 
<br />
from which an explanation of P-consciousness becomes expected and 
<br />
meaningful. The framework requires that we rediscover what we scientists 
<br />
do and then discover something new about ourselves: that how we have 
<br />
been doing science is not the entire story. Dual aspect science shows us 
<br />
what we have not been doing.
