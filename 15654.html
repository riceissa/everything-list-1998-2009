Hi Kim,
<br />
<br />You have accepted the artificial digital brain. This means that  you  
<br />
say &quot;yes&quot; to the doctor who proposes to you an artificial digital  
<br />
brain. You are thus obviously open to the idea that the MEC hypothesis  
<br />
in the cognitive science could be correct. Indeed, perhaps you believe  
<br />
it *has* to be correct, but I will have opportunity to raise doubt  
<br />
about that certainty.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;From now on, we will always suppose MEC is correct. We will work in  
<br />
that theory. We are just searching the consequences. In case we arrive  
<br />
to a frank contradiction, we can say that we have refuted the MEC  
<br />
theory. If we arrive to weird conclusions only, we have to accept that  
<br />
MEC entails those weird conclusions (and we can begin to doubt MEC, or  
<br />
to look in Nature if that weirdness is confirmed or falsified, etc.).
<br />
<br />&quot;KIM 2&quot; is really the &quot;2)&quot; of the plan. See below(*)
<br />
<br />I propose to proceed by little steps, under the form of questions.
<br />
<br />MEC is correct (by assumption). This makes the following thought  
<br />
experiment possible. You get a new job, but the job is located on the  
<br />
planet Mars, and for personal reasons you want to continue your night  
<br />
life on Earth (say).
<br />
No problem, MEC makes possible to scan you, at the right level of  
<br />
description (or below), to annihilate you (let us say this is a legal  
<br />
obligation), to send the scanned information (containing the plan of  
<br />
your body, including the plan of your brain in its instantaneous  
<br />
state) to the planet mars (using some laser, radio waves) where there  
<br />
is a receptor and a reconstitution machine, which using the atoms in  
<br />
the martian neighborhood (re)build yourself in the relevant state,  
<br />
which, by construction, is really the state of your body 4m before on  
<br />
earth. (4m, because light takes four minutes to travel from Earth to  
<br />
Mars, as you surely know).
<br />
<br />I assume very short scanning-annihilation times and short receipting- 
<br />
reconstitution times. Hypotheses like that, or like the fact that your  
<br />
&quot;generalized&quot; brain is in your skull, will be eliminated explicitly  
<br />
later. The role of those hypotheses consists only in making the  
<br />
reasoning more easy.
<br />
<br />I assume all the usual default hypotheses: everything works fine. No  
<br />
bugs in the scanning and reconstitution processes, no asteroid hurting  
<br />
mars. The substitution level has been correctly bet, and it exists, by  
<br />
the MEC assumption. All right?
<br />
<br />The first question is: do you accept the job on mars, knowing that you  
<br />
will be obliged to use this teleportation machinery every morning and  
<br />
evening. I assume of course that you are interested in that job, ...
<br />
<br />Yes or no?   (or comments, questions, precisions, etc.)
<br />
<br />Put in another way, do you agree that if we assume MEC and the default  
<br />
hypotheses, teleportation like this is a safe mean for transporting  
<br />
oneself.
<br />
<br />Here are slight variants of the same question which will be useful  
<br />
later. I suppose you, Kim, are doing the teleportation, and that I,  
<br />
Bruno, remains on Earth during that time.
<br />
Both Kim and Bruno assumes MEC and the default assumptions. On Sunday,  
<br />
you are on Earth, Monday your job on Mars begins.
<br />
<br />Is is true that:
<br />
<br />-On Sunday, Kim believes he will find himself tomorrow on Mars. i.e.  
<br />
On Sunday, Kim believes &quot;Tomorrow, I will find myself on Mars&quot;
<br />
-On Sunday, Kim believes he will be, tomorrow, on Mars. i.e. On  
<br />
Sunday, Kim believes &quot;Tomorrow, I will be on Mars&quot;
<br />
-On Sunday , Bruno believes that tomorrow Kim will be on Mars.
<br />
-On Sunday, Bruno believes that tomorrow Kim will find himself on Mars.
<br />
-On Monday, Bruno and Kim believes that now Kim is on the planet Mars.
<br />
-On Monday, Kim feels himself to be now on planet Mars.
<br />
<br />What do you say?
<br />
<br />Bruno
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />(*) the plan was:
<br />
<br /><br />A) UDA  (Universal Dovetailer Argument)
<br />
<br />1) I explain that if you are a machine, you are already immaterial.
<br />
2) Mechanism entails the existence of a subjective or first person
<br />
indeterminacy or uncertainty.
<br />
3) The Universal Machine, the Universal Dovetailer and the reversal
<br />
physics/bio-psycho-theo-whatever-logy.
<br />
<br />B) AUDA (Arithmetical or Abstract Universal Dovetailer Argument).
<br />
<br />1) Ontology: Robinson Arithmetic
<br />
2) Epistemology: Peano Arithmetic
<br />
3) Arithmetical Interpretation of Plotinus (including Plotinus theory
<br />
of Matter).
