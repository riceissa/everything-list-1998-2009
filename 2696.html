<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     I thought the meaning to be obvious in this context.  The simplest

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; corresponding payoff.  That's how I always interpreted it.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     If the measure of him is the same for the 2nd round as for after both 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rounds, then it's the same as if each copy gets to influence its own payoff.
</em><br />
<br />In my original message I never talked about multiple copies in round 2. I
<br />
was assuming that there would be just one copy in each round, but the
<br />
measures of the copies would be different. You were the one who brought up
<br />
the idea of 1 copy in round 1, and 100 copies in round 2 (presumably the
<br />
measures of the copies are the same) as an analogy. I tried to work with
<br />
your analogy, but here it seems to break down. What would &quot;effectively
<br />
decide&quot; mean if there were just one copy in each round with different
<br />
measures? 
<br />
<br />A more important question is, what does it mean in general? Can
<br />
you define it precisely enough that it can be applied in any situation?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Suppose in round 2 he gets the $-9 payoff if any of the copies decide to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;push button 1. Intuitvely, each copy affects the fate of every other copy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Now you're changing the game.  And it is a game, since as you said 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; yourself, each guy affects the others.
</em><br />
<br />Again, I was trying to follow your analogy. But really what I have in mind
<br />
is that in round 2 there is just one copy, which just affects itself.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Who isn't? :)  I admit it's not a perfect model, though.
</em><br />
<br />Why have this model at all? What's the advantage?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Unlikely.  First, there may be no maximum of f.  For example, f could be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proportional to the depth of the thought (roughly, the age the guy seems to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be) as well as to a &quot;happiness&quot; factor.
</em><br />
<br />A genie comes to you and says he can grant you any wish, if you agree to
<br />
first being tortured for a year. Would you accept? What if there is only
<br />
10% probability that he will grant you the wishes? 1%? .1%?  If there is
<br />
no maximum of f for you, then you would agree no matter how small the
<br />
probability is or how long the torture lasts, since you would just wish
<br />
for a thought that has a sufficiently high utility that even after being
<br />
multiplied by that probability is still larger than the disutility of
<br />
being tortured. Do you think this is reasonable?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Second, it is unlikely that his resources would be such that doing so 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would maximize the utility.  Even if they are, it doesn't seem so strange 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that he would want to relive his happiest moment.
</em><br />
<br />But it is strange that he would value each re-simulation of his happiest
<br />
moment as much as the original moment. For example, a person who has a
<br />
utility function in the form you described would be indifferent between
<br />
running a re-simulation of a past sexual experience and having a new
<br />
sexual experience. Obviously genes that cause this kind of preferences are
<br />
not going to be evolutionarily successful, and we shouldn't expect that
<br />
most people have these kinds of utility functions or will have them in the
<br />
future.
