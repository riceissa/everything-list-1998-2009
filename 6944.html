<br />As I'm sure many on the list are familiar, David Brin's &quot;Kiln People&quot; is 
<br />
an interesting science fiction treatment of similar issues.
<br />
<br />In this story, a technology exists by which one may copy one's &quot;standing 
<br />
wave&quot; (forgive the cheesy pseudo-terminology) into a specially formed 
<br />
clay-based body.  These duplicates, or &quot;dittos&quot;, have a limited (24 
<br />
hour) lifespan before they self-destruct.  Different clay templates are 
<br />
manufactured to enhance different parts of the mind's functioning, so 
<br />
one can create dittos that are better at abstract thinking, or that have 
<br />
more tolerance to menial work, etc.
<br />
<br />In this society, people create a variety of dittos on a daily basis to 
<br />
conduct their business in the world while they themselves avoid risk or 
<br />
stick to the more pleasant things.  The dittos know exactly what to do 
<br />
as they are the exact personality and memories of the original up to the 
<br />
point of copying.  They have a compulsion to return home prior to their 
<br />
self-destruction so their memories can be reintegrated with their 
<br />
original. (It wasn't clear, to me anyway, whether this compulsion was 
<br />
forced or whether it was the consequence of the dittos understanding 
<br />
that they would &quot;die&quot; if they didn't make it back to reintegrate.)
<br />
<br />Brin's treatment of this scenario is well worth the read; it's like a 
<br />
novel-length thought experiment.  One scene follows the internal 
<br />
dialogue of the protagonist as he enters the copying machine, and then 
<br />
the individual internal dialogues of his copies.  There is initial 
<br />
continuity and then a divergence as each copy &quot;discovers&quot; which one he 
<br />
is and thus what he must do for the day.  And of course, each one feels 
<br />
like he became that particular copy at random.
<br />
<br />Some of the same issues about whether one should &quot;care&quot; about one's 
<br />
copies (and whether the copies should care about the original) are 
<br />
handled as well.  In this story, though, since the dittos reintegrate 
<br />
their memories, they know they will eventually have the memories of the 
<br />
other copies, as well as what has happened with the original in the interim.
<br />
<br />Neat stuff.  There is a lot more along these lines, wrapped in a 
<br />
suspense/murder/mystery storyline (the protagonist is a detective.)  The 
<br />
last third of the book gets a little dubious, though, but it is a good 
<br />
read overall nonetheless.
<br />
