<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I did mention the question of whether a given calculation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instantiated a given OM.  Maybe &quot;instantiate&quot; is not the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; right word there.  I meant to consider the question of whether
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the first calculation added to the measure of the information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure corresponding to the OM.
</em><br />
<br />I think that both the word and the meaning are clear.
<br />
<br />Consider the following &quot;gentle seduction&quot; approach. One
<br />
day instead of artificial hearts, people get---piece by
<br />
---piece, artificial brains; and let us, just for the
<br />
purpose of clarifying the above, suppose that this happens
<br />
without much protest (say in the year 2100). Of course,
<br />
*many* here do protest, but let's just imagine that it
<br />
becomes accepted anyway.
<br />
<br />Then a lot of &quot;people&quot; are walking around with very complicated
<br />
programs for minds. Since they act and talk just as we do, let's
<br />
inquire as to how they would report on the above discussion.
<br />
<br />While someone's body is undergoing repair, it may happen that
<br />
he or she can rent a replacement body. It may even happen that
<br />
for the duration of the operation, their program (i.e. what we
<br />
think of as their mind) is temporarily halted. This too would
<br />
seem unobjectionable given the original premise above that in
<br />
2100 people have artificial brains made of silicon.
<br />
<br />Finally, instead of just being unconscious, that is, absent,
<br />
during the operation, it might be that they could download
<br />
their program into some small device that furnished only
<br />
virtual reality. This too would be equally unobjectionable,
<br />
given the aforesaid premise.
<br />
<br />So while some very small machine somewhere was &quot;hosting&quot; them,
<br />
we could very well say that  that particular machine was
<br />
*instantiating* them, could we not? This is how I would use
<br />
the terms. One could even go further and say that a person
<br />
could be instantiated in more than one place at a time.
<br />
<br />After all, today we speak of your computer being able to
<br />
instantiate a program (give runtime to), while my computer
<br />
can do the same thing with a different instance of the
<br />
same program.
<br />
<br />So the big &quot;Everything&quot; claim, or Schmidhuber conjecture, (or
<br />
I don't know what to call it) is that you and I are *already*
<br />
being instantiated by abstract mathematical patterns (the
<br />
UDist, for Universal Distribution). This conjecture, of course,
<br />
is hotly debated, but I think that what is being claimed
<br />
is clear.  Does anyone disagree with the *clarity* of
<br />
what I have written, or can anyone have a problem with any
<br />
of the *words* I used?
<br />
<br />(We must before anything else make sure that we are communicating.)
<br />
<br />Lee
