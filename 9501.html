<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK.  I think I understand what you are saying, on a surface level.  Of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; course a surface level will never be able to expose any contradictions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I'm just riding this wave as long as I can before deciding to get off.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It seems that there are very deep concepts here.  We are standing on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the shoulders of computability giants.  I think it would take a Godel
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or a Church or Turing to find any problem with your whole argument, if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is any.  My feeling is that any &quot;problem&quot; is actually just lack
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of deep enough insight, either on the part of the attempting-refuter of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the argument, or on your part, or both.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; By the way, I am also cognizant that what you are covering here
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; actually is pretty standard stuff and actually has been pored over by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the giants of computability.  So like I said, I'm riding the wave.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; On a certain level, it bothers me that Church's Thesis is said to not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have any proof.  But maybe it is sort of like Newton's gravity.  It is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just a descriptive statement about what can be observed.  And yet... we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; still don't really understand gravity.  Here we are at the level where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all there is is falsifiability.
</em><br />
<br />OK. Note that Church thesis has a unique status in math. I will come 
<br />
back on this.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And, by the same diagonalization
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argument, you'd have to be God to falsify this &quot;stuff&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Ah... but here you are wrong. Church thesis, although not entirely 
<br />
mathematical, still less physical, is completely refutable in the sense 
<br />
of Popper (and thus &quot;scientific&quot; in the &quot;modern&quot; acceptation of the 
<br />
word). To refute Church thesis it is enough to find a function F such 
<br />
that you can show:
<br />
<br />1) F is computable, and
<br />
2) F is not Turing emulable.
<br />
Some people, like Kalmar, has thought they got such a function, but 
<br />
this has been rebuked.
<br />
<br />Eliot Mendelson has argued that CT is provable, and sometimes I share a 
<br />
little bit that feeling. I did believe that CT is provable in &quot;second 
<br />
order arithmetic&quot; for a time because it did seem to me that CT relies 
<br />
above all on the intuition of the finite/infinite distinction. But then 
<br />
it could still be subtler than that, and I am not sure at all CT could 
<br />
really be proved.
<br />
<br />Note that I talk only on the classical Church thesis, not about its 
<br />
intuitonistic variants, which I do believe are false for the first 
<br />
person associated to the machine (and this has been partially confirmed 
<br />
by a result due to Artemov which shows that some &quot;computabiliy version&quot; 
<br />
of constructive mathematics (like the so called Markov principle) is 
<br />
false in S4Grz (with quantifiers). But intuitionist CTs really asserts 
<br />
a different thing. The only roles intuitionistic CTs have in my work 
<br />
are for the explanation of why (first person) machine find so hard to 
<br />
say yes to the doctor and also to clarify the non-constuctivity feature 
<br />
of the &quot;OR&quot; in &quot;Washington OR Moscow&quot; self-duplication experiments.
<br />
<br />Godel did miss Church thesis, and he takes some years for him to 
<br />
eventually assess it and then to describe it as a &quot;sort of 
<br />
epistemological miracle&quot;. At the same time I would say Godel never got 
<br />
it completely because he will search for an equivalent miracle for the 
<br />
provability notion, but this can be shown being highly not plausible 
<br />
... from Church thesis.
<br />
<br />I have evidence that Charles Babbage (and perhaps its friend Ada 
<br />
Lovelace) got Church thesis, once century before the others. The 
<br />
evidence comes from a book by Jacques Lafitte(*) who said in 1911 that 
<br />
Babbage discovered that his notation system for describing its 
<br />
analytical machine was somehow cleverer than his machine. Now, the 
<br />
first who really discovered explictly &quot;Church thesis&quot; and its relation 
<br />
with both computability and provability, is Emil Post in 1922, 
<br />
according to my knowledge.
<br />
<br />Must go now. I intend to comment Tom and Stathis' post  later, perhaps 
<br />
Saturday because I have exams all the day tomorrow.
