<br />Hal Finney, John Mikes, and the others on the parts of this thread that I
<br />
have read have contributed some interesting ideas and questions.
<br />
<br />I have not read the *time* articles in Scientific American, but I would like
<br />
to put in a good word for at least the principle of inter-translating
<br />
between quantitative and verbal languages, including the question of what to
<br />
do about *rough* translations.  Many quantitative people are very hesitant
<br />
to publish in or contribute to the *popular* journals and literature
<br />
including books and public-directed internet because they seem to feel that
<br />
they would lose something important (*rigor*) in the translation and that
<br />
their audience won't amount to *research material* anyway.    I've taught
<br />
mathematics/statistics and done research in mathematical physics and
<br />
mathematical modeling at the college level (and occasionally Secondary
<br />
levels) since the 1970s (I'm 63 years old), and I'm of the opinion that
<br />
Creative Geniuses of the Leonardo Da Vinci and Pierre De Fermat level were
<br />
verbal-quantitative geniuses (they happened to also be several hundred years
<br />
ahead of their times, which is not quite true of many Nobel Prize winners).
<br />
I would also say that Kurt Godel, Paul Dirac, Steven Weinberg (well, until
<br />
recently anyway), Lord Francis Bacon, Shakespeare, Bach, Beethoven, Mozart,
<br />
Vivaldi, Cervantes, Erwin Schrodinger, Einstein, G. 't Hooft, and Socrates
<br />
especially reveal strong verbal-quantitative Creative Genius abilities and
<br />
skills.   In the process of translating back and forth between verbal and
<br />
quantitative modalities, one stimulates associations and memories and ideas
<br />
in both types of memory storage, and they seem to influence each other into
<br />
further combinations and ideas.   Largely because of this, I consider that
<br />
it is better to translate *roughly* than not at all, and that if the main
<br />
idea is conveyed, the details can wait to some extent for later if ever -
<br />
the main ideas may well contribute to someone's Creativity.  Scientific
<br />
American and also various internet forums and discussion groups have done
<br />
that mostly, and I like to point out that good side to them.
<br />
<br />I also think that the tendency to label *time* schools by individuals' names
<br />
would better be changed to describing time schools by brief labels as to
<br />
what they do.   For example, *computer-time* versus *no special
<br />
time-orientation* hardly seems a basis for categorizing time, although they
<br />
could well contribute to some other categorization of time or something
<br />
else.   For myself, I think discrete versus continuous time and spacelike vs
<br />
non-spacelike (in the sense of the 3+1 labellings vs the 4-dimensional ideas
<br />
which just regard time as another spacelike axis or dimension) are more
<br />
useful.   Of course, it is interesting to ask how computers relate to time -
<br />
and I think that we will eventually have to tackle the question of how
<br />
quantum computers and analog computers for example differ from digital
<br />
computers on this question.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; would it be too strenuous to briefly (and understandably???)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; summarize a position on time which is in the 'spirit' of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'spirited' members of this list?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It seems to me that there are two views of time which we have considered,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which I would classify as the Schmidhuber and the Tegmark approaches.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In the Schmidhuber view time is of fundamental importance, and in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Tegmark view it is basically unimportant.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Schmidhuber models the multiverse as the output of a computational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; process operating on all possible programs.  Since computation is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inherently sequential, it imposes a time ordering on the output.  It is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; natural to identify the time ordering of a computation with the time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ordering of events in our universe.  So the simplest interpretation of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Schmidhuber model as an explanation of our universe is to picture
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the computer as generating successive instants of time as it operates.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; An obvious problem with this is that time appears to have a more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; complex structure in our universe than in the classical Newtonian
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; block model.  Special relativity teaches us that simultaneity is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; well defined.  And general relativity even introduces the theoretical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possibility of time loops and other complex temporal topologies.  It
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is hard to see how a simple interpretation of Schmidhuber computation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could incoporate these details.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Stephen Wolfram considers some related issues in his book, A New Kind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of Science.  He is trying to come up with a simple computational model
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of our universe (not of the multiverse, but the same issues arise).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In order to deal with special relativity he shows how a certain kind of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computational network can have consistent causality even when some parts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the computation are run in advance of other parts.  In other words,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simultaneity is not well defined in these models and it is possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for different observers to have different ideas about simultaneity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But the causality is the same for everyone.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The other main model we have considered for the multiverse is that of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Tegmark, who identifies the universe with all possible mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structures.  In this model our universe is merely a complicated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical object.  The fact that we observe three dimensional space and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one dimensional time is due to the internal structure of the particular
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical object that we live in.  Since all possible mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structures exist, there would be other universes with one dimensional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; space and three dimensional time, for example, along with an infinite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; number of others.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In this model, then, time is unimportant; it is merely an incidental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; internal feature of certain mathematical constructs.  Then we can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; invoke the anthropic principle to say that mathematical objects which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have an internal time dimension can also lead to evolution, which can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lead to life like ours.  So we have an explanation of time as being a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constraint on those mathematical objects which can include what Tegmark
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; calls self-aware subsystems, i.e. observers like ourselves.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A final note, I think the Schmidhuber model can be approached in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a way more consistent with Tegmark by interpreting the output of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computation as a structured object independent of the time ordering
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; used by the computation that created it (Wolfram pursues this idea in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; his models as well).  Looking at this document, for example, you read
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it sequentially from top to bottom; but I didn't write it that way,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I rearranged some paragraphs and went back and did some edits here and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there before sending it.  The document's internal structure imposes or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reveals an ordering that is independent of the way it was created.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In the same way, Schmidhuber's programs can create universes, some of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which might then be interpreted to have an internal time dimension
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; similarly to how Tegmark's mathematical objects do.  We would then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; invoke the anthropic principle, as in the Tegmark case, to limit our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attention to Schmidhuber programs that produce output with an internal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time dimension that allows for conscious observers.
