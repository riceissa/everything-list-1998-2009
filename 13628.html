Hi John
<br />
<br />JM: You may ask about prejudice, shame (about goofed situations),  humor
<br />
(does a
<br />
computer laugh?)  boredom or preferential topics (you push for an
<br />
astronomical calculation and the computer says: I rather play some Bach
<br />
music now)
<br />
Sexual preference (even disinterestedness is slanted), or laziness.
<br />
If you add untruthfulness in risky situations, you really have a human
<br />
machine
<br />
with consciousness
<br />
<br />DN: All good, earthy, human questions.  I guess my (not very exhaustive)
<br />
examples were motivated by some general notion of a 'personal world' without
<br />
this necessarily being fully human.  A bit like 'Commander Data', perhaps.
<br />
<br />JM: Now that we arrived at the question I replied-added (sort of) to Colin's
<br />
question I -
<br />
let me ask it again: how would YOU know if you are conscious?
<br />
<br />DN: Since we agree to eliminate the 'obsolete noumenon', we can perhaps
<br />
re-phrase this as just: 'how do you know x?'  And then the answers are of
<br />
the type 'I just see x, hear x, feel x' and so forth.  IOW, 'knowing x' is
<br />
unmediated - 'objects' like x are just 'embedded' in the structure of the
<br />
'knower', and this is recursively related to more inclusive structures
<br />
within which the knower and its environment are in turn embedded.
<br />
<br />JM: Or rather: How would you know if you are NOT conscious? Well, you
<br />
wouldn't.
<br />
<br />DN: Agreed.  If we 'delete the noumenon' we get: &quot;How would you know if you
<br />
are NOT?&quot; or: &quot;How would you know if you did NOT (know)?&quot;.  To which we
<br />
might indeed respond: &quot;You would not know, if you were NOT&quot;, or: &quot;You would
<br />
not know, if you did NOT (know)&quot;.
<br />
<br />JM: If you can, you are conscious.
<br />
<br />DN: Yes, If you know, then you know.
<br />
<br />JM: Computers?????
<br />
<br />DN: I think we need to distinguish between 'computers' and 'machines'.  I
<br />
can see no reason in principle why an artefact could not 'know', and be
<br />
motivated by such knowing to interact with the human world: humans are of
<br />
course themselves 'natural artefacts'.  The question is whether a machine
<br />
can achieve this purely in virtue of instantiating a 'Universal Turing
<br />
Machine'. For me the key is 'interaction with the human world'.  It may be
<br />
possible to conceive that some machine is computing a 'world' with 'knowers'
<br />
embedded in an environment to which they respond appropriately based on what
<br />
they 'know'.  However such a world is 'orthogonal' to the 'world' in which
<br />
the machine that instantiates the program is itself embedded. IOW, no
<br />
'event' as conceived in the 'internal world' has any causal implication to
<br />
any 'event' in the 'external world', or vice versa.
<br />
<br />We can see this quite clearly in that an engineer could in principle give a
<br />
reductive account of the entire causal sequence of the machine's internal
<br />
function and interaction with the environment without making any reference
<br />
whatsoever to the programming, or 'world', of the UTM.
<br />
<br />Bruno's approach is to postulate the whole 'ball of wax' as computation, so
<br />
that any 'event' whether 'inside' or 'outside' the machine is 'computed'.
<br />
The drift of my recent posts has been that even in this account, 'worlds'
<br />
can emerge 'orthogonally' to each other, such that from their reciprocal
<br />
perspectives, 'events' in their respective worlds will be 'imaginary'.  ISTM
<br />
that this is the nub of the 'level of substitution' dilemma in the 'yes
<br />
doctor' proposition: you may well 'save your soul' but 'lose the whole
<br />
world'.  But of course Bruno knows all this (and much more) - he is at pains
<br />
to show how computationalism and any 'primitive' concept of 'matter' are
<br />
incompatible.  From my reading of 'Theory of Nothing' so does Russell, so I
<br />
suspect that our recent wrangling is down to my lousy way of expressing
<br />
myself.
<br />
<br />A good weekend to you too!
<br />
<br />David
<br />
<br />Dear David.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do not expect from me the theoretical level of technicality-talk er get
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from Bruno: I talk (and think) common sense (my own) and if the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theoretical technicalities sound strange, I return to my thinking.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That's what I got, that's what I use (plagiarized from the Hungarian commi
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; joke: what is the difference between the peoples' democracy and a wife?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Nothing: that's what we got that's what we love)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; When I read your &quot;questioning&quot; the computer, i realized that you are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the ballpark of the AI people (maybe also AL - sorry, Russell)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; who select machine-accessible aspects for comparing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You may ask about prejudice, shame (about goofed situations),  humor (does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with consciousness (whatever people say it is - I agree with your evading
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that unidentified obsolete noumenon as much as possible).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I found Bruno's post well fitting - if i have some hint what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;...inner personal or self-referential modality...&quot; may mean.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I could not 'practicalize' it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I still frown when &quot;abondoning (the meaning of) something but consider
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  items as pertaining to it&quot; - a rough paraphrasing, I admit.  To what?.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't feel comfortable to borrow math-methods for nonmath explanations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but that is my deficiency.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now that we arrived at thequestion I replied-added (sort of) to Colin's

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I agree with this, but I would prefer to stop using the term
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'consciousness' at all.  To make a decision (to whatever degree of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; certainty) about whether a machine possessed a 1-person pov analogous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to a human one, we would surely ask it the same sort of questions one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; would ask a human.  That is: questions about its personal 'world' -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; what it sees, hears, tastes (and perhaps extended non-human

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; modalitiies); what its intentions are, and how it carries them into

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; practice.  From the machine's point-of-view, we would expect it to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; report such features of its personal world as being immediately
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; present (as ours are), and that it be 'blind' to whatever 'rendering
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; mechanisms' may underlie this (as we are).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; If it passed these tests, it would be making similar claims on a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; personal world as we do, and deploying this to achieve similar ends.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Since in this case it could ask itself the same questions that we can,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; it would have the same grounds for reaching the same conclusion.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; However, I've argued in the other bit of this thread against the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; possibility of a computer in practice being able to instantiate such a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 1-person world merely in virtue of 'soft' behaviour (i.e.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; programming).  I suppose I would therefore have to conclude that no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; machine could actually pass the tests I describe above - whether self-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; administered or not - purely in virtue of running some AI program,

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; however complex.  This is an empirical prediction, and will have to

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; await an empirical outcome.

<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Part of what I wanted to get at in my thought experiment is the

<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bafflement and confusion an AI should feel when exposed to human
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ideas
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about consciousness.  Various people here have proffered their own

<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ideas, and we might assume that the AI would read these suggestions,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; along with many other ideas that contradict the ones offered here.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It seems hard to escape the conclusion that the only logical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; response
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is for the AI to figuratively throw up its hands and say that it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; impossible to know if it is conscious, because even humans cannot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; agree
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on what consciousness is.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Augustin said about (subjective) *time* that he knows perfectly what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; is, but that if you ask him to say what it is, then he admits being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; unable to say anything. I think that this applies to &quot;consciousness&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; We know what it is, although only in some personal and uncommunicable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Now this happens to be true also for many mathematical concept.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Strictly speaking we don't know how to define the natural numbers, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; we know today that indeed we cannot define them in a communicable way,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; that is without assuming the auditor knows already what they are.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; So what can we do. We can do what mathematicians do all the time. We
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; can abandon the very idea of *defining* what consciousness is, and try
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; instead to focus on principles or statements about which we can agree
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; that they apply to consciousness. Then we can search for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (mathematical)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; object obeying to such or similar principles. This can be made easier
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; by admitting some theory or realm for consciousness like the idea that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; consciousness could apply to *some* machine or to some *computational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; events&quot; etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; We could agree for example that:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) each one of us know what consciousness is, but nobody can prove
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; he/she/it is conscious.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) consciousness is related to inner personal or self-referential
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; modality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; This is how I proceed in &quot;Conscience et Mécanisme&quot;.  (&quot;conscience&quot; is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; the french for consciousness, &quot;conscience morale&quot; is the french for

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In particular I don't think an AI could be expected to claim that it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; knows that it is conscious, that consciousness is a deep and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; intrinsic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; part of itself, that whatever else it might be mistaken about it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not be mistaken about being conscious.  I don't see any logical way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could reach this conclusion by studying the corpus of writings on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; topic.  If anyone disagrees, I'd like to hear how it could happen.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; As far as a machine is correct, when she introspects herself, she
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; cannot not discover a gap between truth (p) and provability (Bp). The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; machine can discover correctly (but not necessarily in a completely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; communicable way) a gap between provability (which can potentially
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; leads to falsities, despite correctness) and the incorrigible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; knowability or knowledgeability (Bp &amp; p), and then the gap between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; those notions and observability (Bp &amp; Dp) and sensibility (Bp &amp; Dp &amp;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; p). Even without using the conventional name of &quot;consciousness&quot;,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; machines can discover semantical fixpoint playing the role of non
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; expressible but true statements.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; We can *already* talk with machine about those true unnameable things,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; as have done Tarski, Godel, Lob, Solovay, Boolos, Goldblatt, etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And the corollary to this is that perhaps humans also cannot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; legitimately

<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; make such claims, since logically their position is not so different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from that of the AI.  In that case the seemingly axiomatic question
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whether we are conscious may after all be something that we could be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mistaken about.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; This is an inference from &quot;I cannot express p&quot; to &quot;I can express not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; p&quot;. Or from ~Bp to B~p.  Many atheist reason like that about the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; concept of &quot;unameable&quot; reality, but it is a logical error.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Even for someone who is not willing to take the comp hyp into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; consideration, it is a third person communicable fact that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; self-observing machines can discover and talk about many non
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 3-provable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; and sometimes even non 3-definable true &quot;statements&quot; about them. Some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; true statements can only be interrogated.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Personally I don' think we can be *personally* mistaken about our own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; consciousness even if we can be mistaken about anything that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; consciousness could be about.
