<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree with the comments made by Jesse Mazer and Saibal Mitra, and

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would go further to suggest that there *necessarily* exists a continuous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; series of intermediates between any two minds, if you allow that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; essentially a mind is a mathematical structure - an algorithm or a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computer program. You are not then restricted to constructing only those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; minds which could in theory be implemented on a human brain, or by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; making sequential changes in one person's brain to arrive at another
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person's brain. Using your PC/ Mac example, this would be like saying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that although it might not be possible to convert one into the other by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; means of wirecutters and soldering iron, there are a large number of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible operating systems between OS X and Windows XP, all running on a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; general purpose computer, which would provide the required gradual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; transition.
</em><br />
<br />Thinking about mind mergers as similar to the genetic cross-over
<br />
operation is a possible point of departure (although we do not know
<br />
apriori whether minds work that way).
<br />
<br />However X-over tends to produce non-viable results, unless restricted
<br />
to module boundaries, which is AFAIK how sexual recombination works in
<br />
nature.
<br />
<br />And my point is that modular cross-over does not provide sufficient
<br />
continuity for Parfit's argument to work.
<br />
<br />Of course it is entirely possible that the analogy of mind to computer
<br />
program, or genetic code is not valid...
<br />
<br />One other analogy I thought might be interesting to explore is the game
<br />
of converting one English sentence to another by changing one letter
<br />
at each step, with the rule that the intervening sentences must be a
<br />
grammatically valid English sentence.
<br />
<br />This can usually be done, but in what sense are the intervening
<br />
sentences &quot;in-between&quot;? And is this a valid analogy for merging minds?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Having said that, I still think it misses the point. The fact that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Parfit's thought experiments sometimes seem to have a degree of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scientific plausibility is just a bonus that makes his writing more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entertaining. Parfit's ideas on personal identity are squarely in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tradition of John Locke, who wrote about transfer of &quot;consciousness&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from one person to another, suggesting that it is this consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (which importantly includes the donor's memories) which determines
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; identity rather than the physical body in which it happens to reside.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Clearly, this kind of mind transfer was a completely ridiculous notion
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the 17th century, and probably still is. But technical feasibility
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (or indeed physical possibility) was not part of Locke's argument, nor
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was it used as ammunition against him by his philosophical opponents.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; His argument was that IF it were possible to transfer memory etc. from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one person to another, THEN the recipient would feel himself to be the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; donor, even though he would notice that he had a completely different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; body. Opponents of this view argue that it is NOT the case that transfer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of memories etc. from one body to another - WERE it possible - would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; result in transfer of personal identity (see R. &amp; P. chap 10.82 for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bernard Williams' thought experiment, for example).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />My response to Locke's thought experiment is that the result would a new
<br />
person, as embodiment has a strong effect on one's psyche as well. I would
<br />
not even predict that the new person is in between those of the donor
<br />
and donee, although obviously there would be some elements on common
<br />
(memories of the donor for example).
