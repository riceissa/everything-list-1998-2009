'... the generation of
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; feelings which represent accurate tokens about motivational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; automatically leads to ethical behaviour.'
</em><br />
<br />I have my doubts about this.
<br />
I think it is safer to say that reflective intelligence and the 
<br />
ability to accurately perceive and identify with the emotions of 
<br />
others are prerequisites for ethical behaviour. Truly ethical 
<br />
behaviour requires a choice be made by the person making the 
<br />
decision and acting upon it. Ethical behaviour is never truly 
<br />
'automatic'. The inclination towards making ethical decisions 
<br />
rather than simply ignoring the potential for harm inherent in 
<br />
all our actions can become a habit; by dint of constantly 
<br />
considering whether what we do is right and wrong [which itself 
<br />
entails a decision each time], we condition ourselves to 
<br />
approach all situations from this angle. Making the decision has 
<br />
to be a conscious effort though. Anything else is automatism: 
<br />
correct but unconscious programmed responses which probably have 
<br />
good outcomes.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;From my [virtual] soap-box I like to point out that compassion, 
<br />
democracy, ethics and scientific method [which I hold to be 
<br />
prerequisites for the survival of civilisation] all require 
<br />
conscious decision making. You can't really do any of them 
<br />
automatically, but constant consideration and practice in each 
<br />
type of situation increases the likelihood of making the best 
<br />
decision and at the right time.
<br />
<br />With regard to psychopaths, my understanding is that the key 
<br />
problem is complete lack of empathy. This means they can know 
<br />
*about* the sufferings of others as an intellectual exercise but 
<br />
they can never experience the suffering of others; they cannot 
<br />
identify *with* that suffering. It seems to me this means that 
<br />
psychopaths can never experience solidarity or true rapport with 
<br />
others.

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; 'reflective intelligence'.  That is, any system successfully engaged

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; in reflective decision theory would automatically be conscious.

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Incidentally, such a system would also be 'friendly' (ethical)

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; precise definitions of consciousness and determine that the system was

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; indeed conforming to the aforementioned definitions.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; How do you derive (a) ethics and (b) human-friendly ethics from reflective

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; intelligence?  I don't see why an AI should decide to destroy the world,

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; save the world, or do anything at all to the world, unless it started off

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; with axioms and goals which pushed it in a particular direction.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; When reflective intelligence is applied to cognitive systems which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reason about teleological concepts (which include values, motivations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; etc) the result is conscious 'feelings'.  Reflective intelligence,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recall, is the ability to correctly reason about cognitive systems.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; When applied to cognitive systems reasoning about teleological
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concepts this means the ability to correctly determine the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; motivational 'states' of self and others - as mentioned - doing this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rapidly and accuracy generates 'feelings'.  Since, as has been known
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; since Hume, feelings are what ground ethics, the generation of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; feelings which represent accurate tokens about motivational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; automatically leads to ethical behaviour.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bad behaviour in humans is due to a deficit in reflective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intelligence.  It is known for instance, that psychopaths have great
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; difficulty perceiving fear and sadness and negative motivational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; states in general.  Correct representation of motivational states is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correlated with ethical behaviour.  Thus it appears that reflective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intelligence is automatically correlated with ethical behaviour.  Bear
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in mind, as I mentioned that: (1) There are in fact three kinds of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; general intelligence, and only one of them ('reflective intelligence')
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is correlated with ethics.    The other two are not.  A deficit in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reflective intelligence does not affect the other two types of general
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intelligence (which is why for instance psychopaths could still score
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; highly in IQ tests).  And (2) Reflective intelligence in human beings
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is quite weak.  This is the reason why intelligence does not appear to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be much correlated with ethics in humans.  But this fact in no way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; refutes the idea that a system with full and strong reflective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intelligence would automatically be ethical.
