</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I think there is another possibility. I tried to explain it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; in my exchanges with John. It relies on several speculations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; or conjectures:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; - Mathematical objects exist by themeslves (&quot;They were
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;    (or: are, intemporal) always there&quot;),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; - The multiverse is isomorphic to a mathematical object,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; - Perception of existence is an internal property of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;    multiverse (mind emerges from matter activity),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Given your commitment below, you also need to suppose
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that perception is an internal property of maths.
</em><br />
<br />This logically comes with, yes. If consciousness is reduced
<br />
(via biology and chemistry) to physics (monism 1) and physics
<br />
is reduced to mathematics (monism 2), indeed consciousness
<br />
is reduced to mathematics.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; - Mathematical existence and physical existence are the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;    same (&quot;there is no need that something special be inside
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;    particles&quot;, the contrary is an unnecessary and useless
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;    dualism, &quot;the fire *is* in the equations&quot;).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That can only be the case if the multiverse is isomporphic to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *every* mathematical object and not just one.
</em><br />
<br />Yes. The basic idea is that there is no difference between
<br />
mathematical existence and physical existence. And this is
<br />
indeed not specific to any particular mathematical object.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If it is only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; isomorphic to some mathematical objects, that *is* the difference
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between physical and mathematical existence.
</em><br />
<br />No. The idea is that *every* class of objects isomorph one
<br />
to each other also have physical existence. Some have
<br />
perception as an internal property and some have not (this
<br />
does not need to be binary nor even one-dimensional).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Some details and some (weak) arguments can be found in my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; recent posts to this group. Some papers from Max Tegmark
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; are also relevant:

<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - The multiverse is isomorphic to a mathematical object,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; What do you mean? I guess this: The multiverse is not a mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; object, but still  is describable by a mathematical object.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; No. I mean that there is a one to one correspondance between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the &quot;components&quot; of the multiverse and those of a particular
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; mathematical object and that this correspondance also maps the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;internal structures&quot; of the multiverse with those of this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; mathematical object. &quot;Components&quot; and &quot;internal structures&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; should not be understood here as atoms or people or the like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; but only &quot;at the most primitive level&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is the standard meaning of isomorphic.
</em><br />
<br />Yes. I explained it because this did not seem consistent
<br />
with what Bruno said.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And if A isomorphic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to B, that does not mean that A is the same thing as B or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even the same kind of thing.
</em><br />
<br />Yes and no. For instance, natural numbers as seen as a
<br />
subset of real numbers may be considered as different
<br />
to &quot;basic&quot; natural numbers (for instance, considering
<br />
the way real numbers are &quot;built&quot; from natural numbers).
<br />
But as long as only the properties of natural numbers
<br />
are considered they cannot be distinguished (and one
<br />
could even &quot;build&quot; a new set of real numbers from them
<br />
and that set would be the set of real numbers as long
<br />
as the properties of real numbers wil be considered).
<br />
<br />Many sets of natural numbers (and of real numbers) can
<br />
be thought of but what &quot;really are&quot; natural numbers
<br />
or (real numbers) has nothing to do with the details
<br />
that could make them appear different. These details
<br />
are completely irrelevant to (and have no effect at all
<br />
on) the way they &quot;behave&quot; as natural numbers. In order
<br />
to identify or exhibit any difference between the
<br />
elements of the class, we need to look at properties
<br />
that are not shared in the class. Now, if we consider
<br />
the universe/multiverse as a part of such a class, we
<br />
would also have to look at properties outside of the
<br />
class. But no such properties can be accessed from the
<br />
inside of the universe. All we can access to from the
<br />
inside of the universe is the shared properties of the
<br />
elements in the class. In other words: if there was
<br />
anything special inside the particle that would make
<br />
them &quot;real&quot;, not only we would not have any access to
<br />
it but whatever that might be and whatever there is
<br />
actually something or not will not make any difference
<br />
on the way we see these particle behave (including
<br />
their mass, charge, interaction rules, ...).
<br />
<br />Finally, what makes differences between the different
<br />
versions of the sets of natural numbers is not only
<br />
accidental and neutral from the point of view of the
<br />
structure (or the isomorphism) but the only thing that
<br />
is likely to have a &quot;platonic existence&quot; in all that is
<br />
not any of the instances of the class but rather what
<br />
defines the class as such, the structure that is shared
<br />
by all the instances. This is what is usually meant
<br />
by &quot;there is one and only on set of natural nummbers&quot;.
<br />
Distinguisshing instances and considering what might
<br />
make them different one from each other migth be
<br />
completely vaine and pointless. Indeed, that *might*
<br />
be the case for our universe/multivers.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Are you postulating a physical universe?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; This is an ill-formed question. The universe could be purely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; mathematical and still appear as physical from the inside.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Things are what they are, not what they appear to be.
</em><br />
<br />In this context, what they appear to be actually leaves
<br />
some indetermination. I would say that both the monist
<br />
and dualist views (and possibly still many others) seems
<br />
compatible with how things appear to me. What they might
<br />
&quot;really&quot; be is open for me (and this is the same for the
<br />
classical &quot;mind/matter&quot; dualism by the way).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Arithmetical truth already contains the full description of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; the deployment of a full quantum universal doevetailer, but it remains
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; to explain why such a quantum realm wins the &quot;white rabbit hunting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; battle&quot; (that is how it solve the measure problem).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Yes. Many things remain to be explained and we may still be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; far to discover which mathematical object we live in (if we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; do, indeed).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If we live inside any particular mathematical object as opposed to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; others,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (if one mathematical object is instantiated in reality) then we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't live in a purely mathematical world, since pure maths
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cannot explain why only one of its objects should be instantiated.
</em><br />
<br />None in particular is actually instanciated or all are
<br />
(in the context of the monist view). But rather it
<br />
makes no sense in this view to consider instanciation.
<br />
The class or the structure is all that exists.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; I tend to criticize all *fundamental* dualism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Okham's razor doesn't like them too, especially when they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; appear unable to help to explain anything more.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If mathematical &quot;objects&quot; do no exist at all there is no dualism.
</em><br />
<br />True. That also works with the mind/matter dualism.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; I agree with you that the fire is in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; equation (or more aptly in their solutions,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why some equations rather than others ?
</em><br />
<br />Anthropic principle: all possible sets of equations
<br />
exist and develops into universes/multiverses. Some
<br />
of them only will have conscioussness as in internal
<br />
property. Indeed, &quot;nobody&quot; is there to figure how
<br />
things might appear in the others.
<br />
<br />Finally, please note that I do not insist that monism
<br />
(in the sense I defined it here) must be true. I do
<br />
not even insist that anybody must find it have sense.
<br />
My point is that one should not say that it must be a
<br />
nonsense to everybody.
<br />
<br />Georges.
