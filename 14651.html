<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of herself confronted with the dilemma may make the same bad guess.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have also thought along these lines some time ago (to use a qubit to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ensure that all outcomes are chosen, because one should not rely on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one's mind decohering into all possible decisions).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The essential question is this: what worlds exist? All possible worlds.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But which worlds are possible? We have, on the one hand, physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possibility (this also includes other physical constants etc, but no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; totally unphysical scenarios).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have long adhered to this &quot;everything physically possible&quot;, but this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does break down under closer scrutiny: first of all, physical relations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are, when things come down to it, mathematical relations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So we could conclude with Max Tegmark: all possible mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structures exist; this is ill defined (but then, why should the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Everything be well defined?)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Alastair argues in his paper that everything logically possible exists
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (with his non arbitrariness principle) but, while initially appealing,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it leads to the question: what is logically possible? In what logic?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Classical/Intuitionist/Deviant logics etc etc...then we are back at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Max's all possible structures.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For all this, I am beginning very much to appreciate Bruno's position
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with the Sigma_1 sentences; but I still have to do more reading and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; catch up on some logic/recursion theory for a final verdict ;-))
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One objection comes to mind immediately (already written above): why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should the Everything be well defined?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To go back to your original question: to consider if both variants are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; chosen by the player of the game by herself (without qubit) seems to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; depend on which kind of Everything you choose. And that, I think, is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; crux of the matter.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Cheers,

</em><br />
<br />Thank you for your illuminating comments, Günther. And though
<br />
Tegmark's ensemble may be less than well-defined right now, there are
<br />
other ensembles that are. My understanding of the Universal Dovetailer
<br />
is that it will generate the output of every possible computer
<br />
program, which, assuming that our universe is computable, implies that
<br />
it contains ours and every other possible version of our universe. And
<br />
unless there are any mathematical entities or structures in Max
<br />
Tegmark's ensemble that are not computable, then Tegmark's enseble
<br />
should be a subset of Schmidhuber's. On this note I can't do any
<br />
better than Russell's discussion in section 3.2 of Theory of Nothing,
<br />
which says that Schmidhuber's plentitude should properly be considered
<br />
a subset of Tegmark's ensemble. Are there any &quot;Mathematical
<br />
Structures&quot; that are not computable? Surely any finite axiom system,
<br />
if consistent, would have a finite number of non-trivial theorems. It
<br />
is said that a program could be written to generate all theorems of
<br />
any consistent axiom system, so that would seem to imply
<br />
computability. (Although Goedel's theorem indicates that any system of
<br />
sufficient complexity cannot be both consistent and complete, so it
<br />
follows that consistent axiom systems of sufficient complexity will
<br />
allow for the existence of undecidable propositions. But what bearing
<br />
this has on the present discussion about the computability of these
<br />
systems is sort of unclear to me.) What would constitute an
<br />
uncomputable mathematical structure? I don't know, but I admit that my
<br />
ignorance on the subject doesn't demonstrate their non-existence.
<br />
<br />And yes, Günther, I agree with your wholeheartedly that &quot;physical
<br />
relations are mathematical relations&quot; at their core. However, simply
<br />
because a mathematical expression may model a given physical process
<br />
or relationship leaves us in the dark as to the reason why this
<br />
equation models this particular phenomenon. Feynman gives as example
<br />
in his book The Charater of Physical Law of an equation used in
<br />
electrolysis that relates the current, the time exposed, and the
<br />
concentration of the solution to the amount of a metal that is
<br />
deposited. But the relationship so expressed is clearly seen to be a
<br />
result of physical processes and not to be a consequence of more
<br />
general principles. Saying that X is physically possible must be
<br />
equivalent to saying that X necessarily stands in an allowable
<br />
relationship to the fundamental physical process of the world.
<br />
<br />For example: imagine a simplified physics, say like a cellular
<br />
automaton, that is able to support living things, yet that will never
<br />
allow for it to emerge spontaneously. Would Tegmark's ensemble include
<br />
configurations of it exhibiting living things? Schmidhuber's evidently
<br />
would. I realize that this example assumes a great deal, and therefore
<br />
may be worthless. But we know from Stephen Wolfram that there are even
<br />
one dimensional CAs that are universal in the sense that they may be
<br />
used to instantiate a universal turing machine. It's a short hop to
<br />
the assumption that perhaps some definite level of complexity is
<br />
required for life, though it may be less than that required to have it
<br />
develop on its own.
<br />
<br />So regarding the possibility of possible worlds: Could it be the case
<br />
that there exist worlds where John McCain has been President of the
<br />
USA since 2000, and yet no worlds where John Howard is still the Prime
<br />
Minister of Australia?
<br />
<br />It seems like a cop-out to point out that if our universe is infinite
<br />
and exhibits uniform distribution of matter that there exists all
<br />
configurations of matter somewhere in it. Definitely less meaningful
<br />
than saying exactly which branches are possible are which are not.
<br />
<br />I have more to say about this but I am afraid to ramble on any more
<br />
than I already have since I fear that what I have already written is
<br />
more confused than I am.  :)
<br />
<br />Steve
