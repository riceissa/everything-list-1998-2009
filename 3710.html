I am a licensed Professional Engineer.
<br />
BSEE The University of Illinois - Champaign/Urbana; 1966
<br />
MSEE Syracuse University; 1970
<br />
Tau Beta Pi, Eta Kappa Nu
<br />
A member of Mensa
<br />
<br />&nbsp;From 1966 to about 1987 I worked in the power semiconductor/power 
<br />
electronics industry.  I published some papers on the subject such as in 
<br />
the IEEE &quot;Transactions on Electron Devices.&quot;
<br />
<br />Since 1987 I have been chief engineer at a medium size aerospace 
<br />
company.  My most recent publication [coauthored with my brother] is in the 
<br />
Winter 1997 U. C. Davis Law Review and is an application of complex system 
<br />
ideas to illuminating the effects of the burgeoning of the law.
<br />
<br />My interest in material relevant to the list dates back a rather long 
<br />
time.  About 10 years ago this interest increased due to a general 
<br />
dissatisfaction with the statistical approach to the founding of 
<br />
thermodynamics during a dab at writing a social science fiction novel.  The 
<br />
intended moral is somewhat reflected in the title of Brian Czech's book: 
<br />
&quot;Shoveling Fuel for a Runaway Train&quot; though I propose a purposely cyclic 
<br />
economy/population since &quot;steady state&quot; seems an empty but dangerous quest 
<br />
for so many reasons.  [Growth is the derivative of size and when it comes 
<br />
to an economy entrepreneurs can find fertile ground when it is either 
<br />
positive or negative and the required rule set can have low complexity - 
<br />
the latter seemingly coinciding with an interpretation of Joseph Tainter's 
<br />
&quot;The collapse of Complex Societies&quot;.  Being in the aerospace business I see 
<br />
the negative marginal utility of new rules every day.]  The social science 
<br />
fiction approach to the moral seems a little bit like the possible 
<br />
background driver for the book &quot;The Mote in God's Eye&quot; by Larry Niven and 
<br />
Jerry Pournelle.
<br />
<br />About four or five years ago this line of thought lead me to the idea that 
<br />
our universe could be based on no net information.  I was then pointed to 
<br />
this list by participants on another list.
<br />
<br />My current approach the issue of origins is to try to find our universe in 
<br />
a zero information Everything type of ensemble.  I am not looking for why 
<br />
we are in our universe because I see any result - such as &quot;our universe and 
<br />
its close relations form some major fraction of the population&quot; - as net 
<br />
information in the Everything and therefore I reject such a search as a 
<br />
departure from and  incompatible with a zero information 
<br />
foundation.  Further I see machine based approaches such as a UD as also 
<br />
requiring the Everything to have non zero information and so currently 
<br />
reject them.
<br />
<br />My current interests are to further refine my model based on the idea of a 
<br />
zero information ensemble of counterfactuals, look for possible 
<br />
observational evidence to support it, and see if I can make any predictions 
<br />
with it.  For example my discrete point space grid idea would be just a 
<br />
ground condition - any number of excited conditions would be possible 
<br />
including something a little like a &quot;gas&quot; of points.  Thus I see no end to 
<br />
the &quot;particles&quot; we will observe with ever higher energy machines, but I 
<br />
currently see no place for an association of a &quot;particle&quot; and what we see 
<br />
as gravity.  I currently see no &quot;Free Will&quot; nor do I see a central [non 
<br />
passive] role for an &quot;observer&quot;.  The rules of evolution of a universe - 
<br />
which I see as a large lookup table applied locally to each of the discrete 
<br />
points rather like a cellular automaton - would be strictly followed unless 
<br />
a state to state transition corresponded with the injection of true noise 
<br />
from the dynamic of the ensemble.
<br />
<br />I see lookup tables [all alphabet and {if - then}'s] as below formal 
<br />
systems so I do not see formal system mathematics or any of its member 
<br />
systems as pointers to the correct base model whatever it may be.  However, 
<br />
the extension of the base model to particular universes can make good use 
<br />
of such systems to the extent that such systems of mathematics are large 
<br />
scale [spanning many rows of the table and many state to state iterations 
<br />
and many cells within the automaton] approximations to the lookup 
<br />
tables.  Further the arrival at such a lookup table base involves a &quot;logic&quot; 
<br />
in the sense that the components of the Everything must form a complete and 
<br />
thus zero information set of counterfactuals.
<br />
<br />My ultimate interest is in &quot;life&quot; and its nature and behavior especially 
<br />
its possible dependence on and response to true noise in its universe and 
<br />
how to build reasonably robust social systems that would attract all 
<br />
varieties of &quot;reasonable&quot; people.
<br />
<br />I feel this list has an excellent chance of eventually arriving at what 
<br />
seems to me to be the collective goal - a simple explanation for what I 
<br />
believe to be my environment.  I also think the list needs a FAQ like 
<br />
document of a sort that suits it.  I made an attempt to write one but ran 
<br />
out of time for awhile.
<br />
<br />As to my reading I own at least 150 books with relevant content that I have 
<br />
read or browsed.
<br />
As to weather any of these seem to be an identifiable near precursor to my 
<br />
current approach I do not believe so.
<br />
