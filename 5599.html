Dear Bruno,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does your thesis survive without the notion of duplicatability or copying? As I have pointed out, QM does not allow duplication and I am hard pressed to understand how duplication can be carried out in classical physics. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we merely consider the Platonia of mathematics we find only a single example of each and every number. If we assume digital substitutability there would be one and only one number for each and every physical object. Where does duplication obtain in Platonia? If duplicatability is an impossible notion, does your thesis survive?
<br />
<br />Stephen

<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a quantum physics enthusiast, but merely an amateur who finds the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;discussion threads of this group to be quite interesting.  I have never
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before commented because, to be honest, I am rather lost in regard to the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;discussion of first person and third person. 
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not the time to explain the use I have made of the 1/3 person
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;distinction in the approach I develop to tackle the mind body problem.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;It occurs with the comp hypothesis in the cognitive sciences, 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;that is the thesis that we are
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;machine (roughly speaking). Then we are, like amoeba, duplicable.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;We can imagine being &quot;cut&quot; at some place and &quot;pasted&quot; in some other place.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;But then we can duplicated and pasted in two place at once. It is there
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;that the 1 person views are qualitatively different from the 3 person views.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me quote
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;myself from <a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/CC&amp;Q.pdf">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/CC&amp;Q.pdf</a>
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Note that comp entails a form of comp-suicide, and quantum-suicide
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;could be a particular of it).
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&lt;The first person discourse is defined by the result of experience/experiment 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;which are written
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;in a diary which belongs to the experimenter. It is important that he keeps
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;his diary with him during the self-duplication experiment so that the diary
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;is duplicated too in the experiment. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;The third person discourse is the discourse made by an external observer.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Suppose a candidate goes through a
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;self-duplication experiment, and that he believes in computationalism. He
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;is scanned and annihilated at Brussels and reconstituted at both Washington
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;and Moscow. Let us ask him the following question: where will you
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;be after the experiment is done. He can answer: I will be in Washington
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;and Moscow. Right, with that question, he can indeed use a third person
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;discourse about himself. Let us ask him more cautiously the following question:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;where will you feel yourself, i.e. from your first person subjective point
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;of view, after the experiment? More precisely: what will you note in your
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;diary after the experiment is completed? In that case, if we assume both
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the computationalist hypothesis and if we assume that the experimenter has
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;some minimal introspection abilities it is easy to understand he must answer
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;'I will feel myself in Washington or Moscow'. The fact is that he will not
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;write in his diary something like 'I feel myself being both in Washington and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Moscow'. In particular he will have a personal knowledge of Moscow (resp.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Washington) and only an intellectual, 3-person knowledge, of the existence
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;of his doppelganger in Washington (resp. Moscow). And he can predict that
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;very fact-that he will feel himself at one place-although he is unable to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;predict which one, and this shows that computationalism entails a strong
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;first person indeterminacy, and this happens in the context of a strong third
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;person determinism.&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Hoping that helps. That distinction is akin to the distinction between subjective and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;objective in Everett's &quot;relative state/many-world&quot; papers. I will  probably say a little
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;more in my discussion with George asap (on the everything-list).
