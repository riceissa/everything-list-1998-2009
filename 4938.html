<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I am not 100% sure that I have the ASSA right, in that it doesn't seem

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;too different from the SSSA.  (BTW I have kept the definitions at the end

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of this email.)  (BTW, BTW means By The Way.)  But I am pretty sure about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the RSSA being in terms of the &quot;next&quot; moment, so I defined the ASSA the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;same way, to better illustrate its complementary relationship to the RSSA.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The real difference between these views was not addressed in my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;glossary, which is that the RSSA is supposed to justify the QTI, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;quantum theory of immortality, while the ASSA is supposed to refute it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;That is, if you only experience universes where your identity continues,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;as the RSSA implies, then it would seem that you will never die.  But if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;your life-moments are ruled by statistics based on physical law as the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ASSA says, then the chance that you will ever experience being extremely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;old is infinitesimal.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Personally I think the ASSA as I have it is somewhat incoherent, speaking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of a &quot;next&quot; observer moment in a framework where there really isn't any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;such notion.  But as I said it has been considered as the alternative
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to the RSSA.  I invite suggestions for improved wording.
</em><br />
<br />I think that proponents of the type of ASSA you’re talking about would say 
<br />
that the experience of consciousness passing through multiple 
<br />
observer-moments is simply an illusion, and that I am nothing more than my 
<br />
current observer-moment. Therefore they would not believe in quantum 
<br />
immortality, and they also would not define the ASSA in terms of the &quot;next&quot; 
<br />
observer-moment, only the current observer-moment. I think you’d be 
<br />
hard-pressed to find any supporters of the ASSA who would define it in the 
<br />
way you have.
<br />
<br />But as I say below, I think it is possible to have a different 
<br />
interpretation of the ASSA in which consciousness-over-time is not an 
<br />
illusion, and in which it can be compatible with the RSSA, not opposed to 
<br />
it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Wouldn't it be possible to have a version of the SSA where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; you consider your *current* observer moment to be randomly sampled from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; set of all observer-moments, but you use something like the RSSA to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;guess
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; what your next observer moment is likely to be like?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;That seems contradictory.  You have one distribution for the current
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observer-moment (sampled from all of them), and another distribution for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the next observer-moment (sampled from those that are continuous with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the same identity).  But the current observer-moment is also a &quot;next&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observer-moment (relative to the previous observer-moment).  So you can't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;use the ASSA for current OM's and the RSSA for next OM's, because every
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;next is a current, and vice versa.  (By OM I mean observer-moment.)
</em><br />
<br />Well, any theory involving splitting/merging consciousness is naturally 
<br />
going to privilege the current observer-moment, because it’s the only thing 
<br />
you can be really sure of a la &quot;I think therefore I am&quot;…when talking about 
<br />
the past or the future, there will be multiple pasts and multiple futures 
<br />
compatible with your present OM, so you can only talk about a sort of 
<br />
probabilistic spread.
<br />
<br />That said, although some might argue there’s a sort of philosophical 
<br />
contradiction there, I think it is possible to conceive of a mathematical 
<br />
theory of consciousness which incorporates both the ASSA and the RSSA 
<br />
without leading to any formal/mathematical contradictions. There could even 
<br />
be a sort of &quot;complementarity&quot; between the two aspects of the theory, so 
<br />
that OM’s with the highest absolute probability-of-being would also be the 
<br />
ones that have the most other high-absolute-probability OM’s that see them 
<br />
as a likely &quot;successor&quot; in terms of relative probability-of-becoming. In 
<br />
fact, an elegant solution for determining a given OM’s absolute 
<br />
probability-of-being might be to simply do a sum over the probability of 
<br />
becoming that OM relative to all the other OM’s in the multiverse, weighted 
<br />
by their own probability-of-being.
<br />
<br />Here’s a simple model for how this could work. Say you have some large set 
<br />
of all the OM’s in the multiverse, possibly finite if there is some upper 
<br />
limit on the complexity of an OM’s, but probably infinite. You have some 
<br />
theory of consciousness that quantifies the &quot;similarity&quot; S between any two 
<br />
given OM’s, which deals with how well they fit as the same mind at different 
<br />
moments, how many of the same memories they share in common, how similar are 
<br />
their causal patterns, and so on. You also have some absolute measure on all 
<br />
the OM’s, a &quot;probability-of-being&quot; B assigned to each one—this is basically 
<br />
just my idea that the self-sampling assumption could be weighted somehow, so 
<br />
that the ideal way to use the ASSA is to assume that your current OM is 
<br />
randomly sampled from the set of all possible observer-moments, weighted by 
<br />
their own probability-of-being B.
<br />
<br />Then, to determine the relative probability-of-becoming various possible 
<br />
OM’s, I could just multiply their similarity S to my own current OM by their 
<br />
absolute measure B representing each one’s probability-of-being. This would 
<br />
insure that even though a version of me observing a dragon popping out of my 
<br />
computer screen may be have just as much similarity S to my current mental 
<br />
state, in terms of memories and the like, as a version of me who’s watching 
<br />
the computer screen behaving normally, if one OM is objectively less 
<br />
probable (lower B) due to the laws of nature, I will have a higher relative 
<br />
probability of becoming the OM who sees business-as-usual. This would also 
<br />
insure that if I step into a teleportation machine and the machine 
<br />
reconstructs two people, one whose brain is close to identical to mine and 
<br />
one who has a very different personality and memories, then even if the OM’s 
<br />
of both these people have about the same absolute probability-of-being B, I 
<br />
am far more likely to become the one who’s more similar to me because his 
<br />
similarity S to my current OM would be much higher.
<br />
<br />And as I suggested earlier, it would be neat if the probability-of-being B 
<br />
could itself be derived by something like a sum over the S’s between me and 
<br />
all the other other OM’s, each one weighted by their own B-rating. This idea 
<br />
could be summed up by the slogan &quot;the most probable present experiences are 
<br />
the ones that are high-probability successors to other experiences that are 
<br />
themselves highly probable present experiences&quot;. In this way it might even 
<br />
be possible to bootstrap a unique B-rating for all OM’s, starting with only 
<br />
a knowledge of the similarity ratings between them. Consider the following 
<br />
simple universe with only three observers X, Y, and Z, and a known matrix of 
<br />
similarity ratings S between each pair:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X       Y        Z
<br />
X1.00    0.60    0.35
<br />
Y 0.60   1.00    0.25
<br />
Z 0.35    0.25   1.00
<br />
<br />In this case, if the B-ratings for each one were determined by a sum over 
<br />
the S-ratings for the others weighted by their own B-ratings, and you 
<br />
represent X’s B-rating by the variable x, Y’s B-rating by the variable y, 
<br />
etc., then you’d have some simultaneous equations that’d actually allow you 
<br />
to find a unique self-consistent solution for x, y, and z:
<br />
<br />x = (0.60)y + (0.35)z
<br />
y = (0.60)x + (0.25)z
<br />
z = (0.35)x + (0.25)y
<br />
<br />I haven’t actually planned these numbers out, so the solution probably leads 
<br />
to some variables being negative or greater than one, which doesn’t really 
<br />
make sense if the B’s are supposed to be probabilities, but the basic idea 
<br />
here is that you can bootstrap the B’s just by knowing the S’s.
<br />
<br />Now keep in mind, this is all a very cartoonish sketch, I don’t really think 
<br />
whatever theory of consciousness is used to determine relative probabilities 
<br />
would be as simple as multiplying a &quot;similarity rating&quot; by an absolute 
<br />
probability; among other things, &quot;similarity&quot; fails to capture the crucial 
<br />
issue of the directionality of subjective time, my current OM might be just 
<br />
as similar to an OM 2 seconds ago as it is to one 2 second from now, but I 
<br />
expect a higher probability I’ll become the one 2 seconds in the future. 
<br />
Also, I suggested earlier that the complexity of an OM’s consciousness might 
<br />
play a part in both the absolute probability (so my present experience is 
<br />
more likely to be that of a human than an insect) and relative probability 
<br />
(so I am more likely to experience becoming a copy with an intact brain than 
<br />
one with brain damage), but the model I presented doesn’t take that into 
<br />
account. Still, it’s sort of a pet theory of mine that the real TOE will 
<br />
turn out to be analogous to this model in the following ways:
<br />
<br />1. It will include a theory of consciousness that can take my present OM 
<br />
along with various possible future OM’s, and determine the relative 
<br />
probability of my experiencing each one in my future based on a combination 
<br />
of features that are inherent to each OM (analogous to the ‘similarity’ 
<br />
rating in my model) and an external measure which assigns each one an 
<br />
absolute probability. The relative probability on different future 
<br />
observer-moments would be used as weights in the RSSA, and the absolute 
<br />
probability of different present observer-moments would be used in a 
<br />
weighted ASSA.
<br />
<br />2. Even if you don’t know the correct absolute probability of any of the 
<br />
OM’s to start with, there will turn out to be a unique self-consistent 
<br />
solution to what this absolute measure on OM’s has to look like, given only 
<br />
the theory of consciousness and the assumption that all possible OM’s exist 
<br />
(the ‘everything’ part of the theory). This would be analogous to the unique 
<br />
solution to the simultaneous equations in the cartoon model above.
<br />
<br />This would be neat because the laws of physics we observe could hopefully be 
<br />
derived (in principle anyway) from the absolute and relative measures on all 
<br />
OM’s, so you’d basically be deriving all the laws of the universe from just 
<br />
a theory of consciousness and platonic assumption that every conscious 
<br />
pattern that can exist, does exist. The problem with any TOE that 
<br />
incorporates a &quot;theory of consciousness&quot; is that it runs the risk of being a 
<br />
dualist theory if any aspect of first-person probabilities derives from 
<br />
something other than that theory (like an objective measure on universes 
<br />
rather than OM’s to explain why I don’t experience Harry Potter worlds), but 
<br />
this idea is nicely monist and simple.
<br />
<br />It might seem that a theory centered on consciousness and observer-moments 
<br />
would suggest that any part of the universe that isn’t observed by a 
<br />
sentient being doesn’t really exist, but I imagine identifying distinct 
<br />
&quot;observer-moments&quot; with something like &quot;patterns of causal relationships&quot; 
<br />
(or finite computations, perhaps), so that all such patterns, even the 
<br />
random jostling of molecules in a cloud of gas, would qualify as 
<br />
observer-moments with very low-grade levels of consciousness. That way the 
<br />
absolute probability of each such pattern, along with the probabilistic 
<br />
relationships between different patterns, might be used to derive what we 
<br />
ordinarily think of as the laws of physics, especially if the laws of 
<br />
physics can ultimately be stated in terms of nothing but relationships 
<br />
between elementary events, as physicists like Lee Smolin have suggested. 
<br />
This is similar to the &quot;naturalistic panpsychism&quot; idea I found described on 
<br />
the same website that hosts the many-worlds FAQ (although I disagree with 
<br />
them on a few points):
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.hedweb.com/lockwood.htm">http://www.hedweb.com/lockwood.htm</a>
<br />
<br />Apologies for the long post, but I haven’t really outlined my own pet TOE on 
<br />
this list before, so I wanted to get all the major details in there.
