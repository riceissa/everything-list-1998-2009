Le 12-sept.-07, à 00:41, John Mikes a écrit :
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno, you ARE a teacher (a good and passionate one) but your 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; imagination is insufficient. You cannot imagine how much I don't 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; know.  pick up 'words' and 'phrases' and apply common sense to them 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with a certain authoritative flair, so  those who understand the topic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can think that I am talking sense. As I already confessed: I never 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; studied logics and cannot 'read' the signs (nor can I 'decipher' those 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; equational formats) you all apply in otherwise human sentences. They 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; look like math to me.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />They are math! It is the game I play. I like very much David Deutsch's 
<br />
idea that if we are scientist we are in principle willing to know that 
<br />
our theory is wrong, but to discover this we have to take them 
<br />
seriously enough.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And i still did not get an acceptable explanation why 'numbers' are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the basics of everything (and WHAT they may be). 
</em><br />
<br /><br />Nobody can KNOW that. The fact is that ONCE you take the comp hyp 
<br />
seriously enough into consideration, then you can, by work, be 
<br />
eventually convince that our own immateriality (which follows easily by 
<br />
comp) has to be &quot;contagious&quot; on our possible neighborhoods.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Those numbers applied in mathematical formal language are definitely 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; products of the human mind,
</em><br />
<br /><br />yes sure. But we are not talking about those numbers humans 
<br />
(re)invented, but on those which have to exist independently of us once 
<br />
we accept some minimal amount of computer science, without which we 
<br />
could infer nothing fron comp (our, well mine, working hypothesis).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; as David Bohm so clearly stated.
</em><br />
<br /><br />No problem, Bohm is a serious guy, he makes clear he does not accept 
<br />
the comp hyp at the start. Bohm is serious, and as far as I can jujudge 
<br />
by my reding, he is 100% correct. But he denies comp.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I know: you represent the opposite way: not numbers from thinking, but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence, ith all pertinent to it FROM numbers, which I reject just 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as the 'personalized creator'  in an any other form.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You could be right. The point we are addressing is the question of 
<br />
making our hypotheses clear enough so that we can refute them or make 
<br />
sense of how we could have them refuted at least in principle.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I also keep away from ANY thought experiences, they are products of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OUR state of the mind at the time they are 'invented'. 
</em><br />
<br /><br />All proof in math are particular case of thought experiments. In 
<br />
philosophy-of-mind, theology, theoretical physics and math, the only 
<br />
tools available are the thought experiments.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  In deducing some explanations from 'phenomena' we think we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experienced (depends upon the actual level of our observational and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explanatory cpacity)  I always put an uncertainty in it,
</em><br />
<br /><br />I totally agree with you here!
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; because the Flat Earth did not prove true later, either.
</em><br />
<br /><br />We have no proof that the earth is round, only solid evidence that the 
<br />
roundity of earth is a solid *local* truth.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Now geocentrism is true again, after Einstein, because it is quite 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arbitrary that we can decide as a (relative) center for all others, no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter how complicated the math would be...).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am in subconscious trouble with the machine, which is differently 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; identified by Robert Rosen and I find a lot acceptable in his ideas.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Imo, Rosen is wrong on Church thesis. But this could wait when I 
<br />
succeed to explain more about CT later ...
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  God and the angels are also hard: I do not go for assumption-based 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consequences (not true: everything is such), in fairytales of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non-logical hearsay.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Just keep track of the definitions. By angels and gods (note the 
<br />
plural) I mean things which are not turing-emulable, or if you prefer, 
<br />
any entities which are provably not machines.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I go with Colin's &quot;mini solipsism&quot; as I call it, the world is what we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; make of it for ourselves.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I am a realist. I guess there is something more than me. The rest, the, 
<br />
can be justified as first person points of view.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I use my own logic, it served me well for many decades, and my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'narrative' about the world and its installation is such (and only 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such) as it entertains me and my logic. Not the conventional sciences.
</em><br />
<br /><br />What is conventional sciences. If by this you mean that sometimes the 
<br />
academy gives grades and honours wrongly, then you are right but this 
<br />
is really &quot;human too much human&quot; as Nietzche said once. We have no 
<br />
choice to learn with this facts. I prefer to talk about science, and 
<br />
describe some science has being wrong from time to time (like when Bohr 
<br />
dismissed Everett, just because what Everett said contradicted his 
<br />
(Bohr) wishfull thinking. Science = doubt and modesty. When scientist 
<br />
pretend to know the truth, they are mad, that's all.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; After 5 decades of successful polymer chemistry (38 patents, 3 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; continent consulting) I do not accept the existence of atoms and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; molecules,
</em><br />
<br /><br />Nor do I believe in the primary nature of those notion. Plotinus (+300) 
<br />
did already understand that such notions were inconsistent with the 
<br />
more primitive platonic ideas. Now, I could accept that atoms (the 
<br />
modern one), like the spherical hypothesis about the earth are 
<br />
excellent local theories.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; they are 'math' based explanatory sweat-products of the past 2-300 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; years for observations mostly misunderstood.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I can agree. But still, without taking those ideas seriously enough, we 
<br />
will never know them wrong. Science is really the ability to be wrong 
<br />
in a way as clear as possible; so you can hope to know being wrong soon 
<br />
enough.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Natural law is a statistical mistake by counting matching 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observations(?) within a selected 'model' (cut-off domain) of vision.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Use a wider 'model' and different 'laws' will appear.
</em><br />
<br />Not necessarily, and it depends what you mean by &quot;model&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you have some empty Google time, I wrote a 'worldview'-like (now
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; obsolete) piece on the KARL JASPERS FORUM (TA-62MIK) on networks of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; networks in 2003.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I have read it, I think, quite a time ago. Please gives a link, so that 
<br />
I can reread it.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And one thing: I am an anti-teacher, I don't want to persuade anybody 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to accept MY views.
</em><br />
<br /><br />No serious scientist will ever try to convince others (except for the 
<br />
mundane purpose of getting some funds). As I said a scientist, not only 
<br />
does not want to convince others, he want others to show him wrong 
<br />
instead. You confuse scientists, and mediatico-pseudo-scientists, which 
<br />
can exist still today due to 1500 years of abandon of the fundamental 
<br />
question to political pseudo-religious authorities. Of course they have 
<br />
had no choice, because it is best to do pseudo-science than to burn 
<br />
alive ... (I don't judge them here).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I offer them for consideration - period.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sorry for the longwinded chit-chat.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Don't be sorry, I like to chat on those questions, as you know, and it 
<br />
gives us some opportunities to clarify (or not) ourselves. Key point 
<br />
here for me: science = doubt = modesty= acknowledgment of ignorance = 
<br />
lack of any communicable certainty = questions sharing (never 
<br />
&quot;definitive answers&quot; sharing).
<br />
<br />Bruno
