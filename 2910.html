This is a continuation of &quot;Consistency? + Programs for G, G*, ...+ White Rabbits&quot;

<br />Let's say you are dreaming of a nice little pussy cat. Suddenly the pussy cat morphs
<br />
(white rabbit?) into a hungry lion who goes straight for you with bared fangs and
<br />
drooling saliva.with anticipation of a good meal.
<br />
<br />The first consistency test is whether you believe in the morphin process or you
<br />
don't.
<br />
<br />If you do believe that the cat morphed into a lion, then your world is consistent
<br />
and you are having a bad nightmare.The lion will tear you to pieces and you'll die
<br />
in your dream. At that point you meet the second consistency test.
<br />
<br />Either you believe you are dead and then you must stop dreaming and therefore stop
<br />
believing you are dead... This is impossible. Your dream world therefore becomes
<br />
inconsistent and comes to an end. You either switch to a deep theta sleep state or
<br />
you wake up... unless you go to a dream heaven... but then you are not really
<br />
dead....and the whole pussycat/lion nightmare could arise again... Death in a dream
<br />
leads to infinite heavenly regression or to inconsistency.
<br />
<br />Now if you don't believe that the cat morphed into a lion, you realize that your
<br />
world is a dream world. You then have two choices. Either wake up (end of the dream
<br />
world) or continue to enjoy your dream with the full knowledge that it is only a
<br />
dream not the reality (end of real dream) and that no matter what the lion does to
<br />
you, it's only a dream and nothing bad could really happens. So you let the lion eat
<br />
you. In fact you are really enjoying the process. Finding yourself in the stomach of
<br />
the lion.... becoming the lion.... what fun!!! A dream that you know is a dream is
<br />
called a lucid dream. Lucid dream are fun! You can jump from a huge cliff and not
<br />
get hurt, stand in front of a speeding locomotive and see it go right through you.
<br />
In a lucid dream, you are immortal.
<br />
<br />Not let's take a step back and look at science in interpreting our world. The role
<br />
of science is to expose inconsistencies and reveal the old perception of the world
<br />
world for the dream it is....Our set of beliefs affects how we perceive the world.
<br />
Way back before Copernicus, we were living in a dream world where the earth was at
<br />
the center of the universe etc... But there were inconsistencies... Copernicus,
<br />
Galileo, Newton, Einstein etc.. resolved the inconsistencies. They showed us that
<br />
the old set of beliefs were just dreams, not reality.  Our horizon has been
<br />
expanding. We have been waking up, and waking up again, and again. We are now faced
<br />
with the ultimate expansion of our horizons: the plenitude. Quantum immortality is
<br />
like lucid dream immortality. Yes, our world is a dream. But what a magnificient
<br />
dream! Let's be like the lucid dreamer and enjoy it to the fullest!
<br />
