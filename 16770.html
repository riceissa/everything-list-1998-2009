Hi Kim,

<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK - I find this quite mind-blowing; probably because I now

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand it for the first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time in my life. So how did it get this rather ridiculous name of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;square root&quot;? What's it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; called in French?
</em><br />
<br />Racine carrée. Literally &quot;square root&quot;.
<br />
<br />It comes from the fact that in elementary geometry the surface or area  
<br />
of a square which sides have length x, is given by x*x, also written  
<br />
x^2, which is then called the  &quot;square of x&quot;. Taking the square root  
<br />
of a number, consists in doing the inverse of taking the square of a  
<br />
number. It consists in finding the length of a square knowing its area.
<br />
<br />Mathematician and especially logician *can* use arbitrary vocabulary.  
<br />
It is the essence of the axiomatic method in &quot;pure mathematics&quot; that  
<br />
what is conveying does not depend on the term which are used. Hilbert  
<br />
said once that he could have use the term &quot;glass of bear&quot; instead of  
<br />
&quot;line&quot; in his work in geometry.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; A = {x such that x is even and smaller than 100}  = {x ⎮ x is even  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &amp; x
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; special character, abbreviating &quot;such that&quot;, and I hope it goes  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; through the mail.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Just an upright line? It comes through as that. I can't seem to get  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this symbol happening so I will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; use &quot;such that&quot;
</em><br />
<br />Yes, &quot;such that&quot; is abbreviated by an upright line. Sometimes also by  
<br />
a half circle followed by a little line, but I don't find it on my  
<br />
palette!
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If not I will use &quot;such that&quot;, or s.t., or things like that.The  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; expression {x ⎮ x is even} is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; literally read as:  the set of objects x, (or number x if we are in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a context where we talk
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about numbers) such that x is even.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Exercise 1: Could you define in intension the following infinite  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; set C = {101, 103, 105,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ...}C = ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; C = {x such that x is odd and x &gt; 101}
</em><br />
<br /><br />Correct.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Exercise 2: I will say that a natural number is a multiple of 4 if  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; it can be written as 4*y,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for some y. For example 00 is a multiple of 4, (0 = 4*0), but also  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 28, 400, 404, ...  Could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you define in extension the following set D = {x ⎮ x &lt; 10 and x is  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a multiple of 4}?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; D = 4*x where x = 0 but also { 1, 2, 3, 4, 08 }
</em><br />
<br /><br />Hmm...
<br />
Marty made a similar error. D is a set. May be you wanted to say:
<br />
<br />D = {4*x where x = 0 but also { 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 }}. But this does not  
<br />
make much sense. Even if I try to imagine favorably some meaning, I  
<br />
would say that it would mean that D is the set of numbers having the  
<br />
shape 4*x (that is capable of being written as equal to 4*x for some  
<br />
x), and such that x belongs to {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8}.
<br />
A proper way to describe that set would be
<br />
<br />D = {y such that y = 4x and x belongs-to {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8}}.
<br />
<br />But that would makes D = {0, 4, 8, 12, 32}.
<br />
<br />The set D = {x ⎮ x &lt; 10 and x is a multiple of 4} is just, in  
<br />
english, the set of natural numbers which are little than 10 and which  
<br />
are a multiple of 4. The only numbers which are little than 10, and  
<br />
multiple of 4 are the numbers 0, 4, and 8.  D = {0, 4, 8}.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I now realise I am doomed for the next set of exercises because I  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cannot get to the special
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; symbols required (yet). As I am adding Internet Phone to my system,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am currently using an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ancient Mac without the correct symbol pallette while somebody  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; spends a few days to flip a single
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; switch...as soon as I can get back to my regular machine I will  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; complete the rest.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Take it easy. No problem.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In the meantime I am enjoying the N+1 disagreement - how refreshing  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it is to see that classical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematics remains somewhat controversial!
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />The term is a bit too strong. It is a bit like if I told you that &quot;I  
<br />
am Napoleon&quot;, and you conclude that the question of the death of  
<br />
Napoleon is still controversial. I exaggerate a little bit to make my  
<br />
point, but I know only two ultrafinitists *in math*, and I have never  
<br />
understood what they mean by &quot;number&quot;, nor did I ever met someone  
<br />
understanding them.
<br />
<br />What makes just a little bit more sense (and I guess that's what  
<br />
Torgny really is) is being ultrafinitist *in physics*, and being  
<br />
physicalist. You postulate there is a physical universe, made of a  
<br />
finite number of particles, occupying a finite volume in space-time,  
<br />
etc. Everything is finite, including the &quot;everything&quot;.
<br />
Then  by using the &quot;unintelligible identity thesis&quot; (and thus  
<br />
reintroducing the mind-body problem), you can prevent the comp white  
<br />
rabbits inflation. Like all form of materialism, this leads to  
<br />
eliminating the person soon or later (by the unsolvability of the mind- 
<br />
body problem by finite means). Ultrafinitist physicalism eliminates  
<br />
also mathematics and all immaterial notions, including all universal  
<br />
machines. Brrr...
<br />
<br />The real question is &quot;do *you* think that there is a biggest natural  
<br />
number&quot;? Just tell me at once, because if you really believe that  
<br />
there is a biggest natural number, I have no more clues at all how you  
<br />
could believe in any of computer science nor UDA.
<br />
<br />Remember that Thorgny pretends also to be a zombie. It has already  
<br />
eliminate its own consciousness.
<br />
<br />Note that after the step seven, you can still use ultrafinitist  
<br />
physicalism to eliminate the inflation of white rabbits *discourses*.  
<br />
After step 8, normally this move stop working unless you eliminate  
<br />
consciousness and persons. I think Thorgny is aware of that, and that  
<br />
is why he defends the idea that he is a zombie. From that point of  
<br />
view he is remarkably coherent with respect to the UD reasoning. But  
<br />
in front of person eliminators I can only say ... Brrr...
<br />
<br />Bruno
