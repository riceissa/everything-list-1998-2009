Below is a background for my model and a rewrite of the original post.
<br />
<br />My concerns with a TOE which I am trying to resolve are:
<br />
<br />I would like to see the theory have a zero information content.
<br />
<br />I would like an origin for what we perceive as a changing reality - a dynamic.
<br />
<br />Postulating the existence of entities like an &quot;Everything&quot; or a &quot;Plenitude&quot; 
<br />
etc. seemed to me to leave residual information in the system because the 
<br />
definitional structure surrounding these concepts was like a label with an 
<br />
unfulfilled potential to distinguish another entity not in the system i.e. 
<br />
a &quot;Nothing&quot;.
<br />
<br />This eventually lead to the idea that definition was actually a boundary 
<br />
separating what a thing being defined is from what it is not and the &quot;is 
<br />
not&quot; is another thing.  So definition simultaneously defines two entities - 
<br />
an [is, is not] pair.
<br />
<br />Another Idea I posted on awhile back was that a dynamic could be based on 
<br />
the incompleteness of the Nothing.  It could resolve no meaningful 
<br />
questions about itself.  Was there such a question?  I proposed that it 
<br />
must resolve the question of its own stability - will it 
<br />
persist.  Eventually the Nothing would have to spontaneously become 
<br />
something to try to resolve this question and this something would then 
<br />
evolve as it tried to complete itself and become an &quot;Everything&quot;.
<br />
<br />However if the &quot;Everything&quot; and the &quot;Nothing&quot; were a defintional [is, is 
<br />
not] pair which seemed reasonable what would give existence preference to 
<br />
one over the other and simultaneously put the system in a state of unused 
<br />
potential to divide i.e. contain information.
<br />
<br />The existence of at least one of the pair seemed assured so could the 
<br />
system work if both existed simultaneously?
<br />
<br />This eventually resulted in my post which is revised below.
<br />
<br />Definitions:
<br />
<br />1) Information: Information is the potential to establish a boundary.
<br />
<br />2) Kernel of information: The information required for the potential to 
<br />
establish a specific boundary.
<br />
<br />3) The All: The complete kernel ensemble.
<br />
<br />4) The Nothing: That which is empty of all kernels.
<br />
<br />5) The Everything: The boundary which contains the All and separates it 
<br />
from the Nothing.  Thus it also contains the Nothing.
<br />
<br />6) A Something: A division [by a boundary] of the All into two subparts.
<br />
<br />7) True noise: An inconsistency of the evolution of a Something reflected 
<br />
in the course of physical reality given to universes within it.
<br />
<br />Proposal: The Existence of our and other universes and their dynamics are 
<br />
the result of unavoidable definition and logical incompleteness.
<br />
<br />Justification:
<br />
<br />1) Given definitions 3, 4, and 5:
<br />
<br />2) These definitions are interdependent because you can not have one 
<br />
without the whole set.
<br />
<br />3) Notice that &quot;Defining&quot; is the same as establishing a boundary between 
<br />
what a thing is and what it is not.  This defines a second thing: the is 
<br />
not.  A thing can not be defined in isolation.
<br />
<br />4) These definitions are unavoidable because at least one of the [All, 
<br />
Nothing] pair must exist.  Since they form an [is, is not] pair they 
<br />
bootstrap each other into existence.
<br />
<br />5) The Nothing has a logical problem: since it is empty of kernels it can 
<br />
not answer any meaningful question about itself including the unavoidable 
<br />
one of its own stability [persistence].
<br />
<br />6) To answer this unavoidable question the Nothing must at some point 
<br />
&quot;penetrate&quot; the boundary between itself and the All [the only place 
<br />
information resides] in an attempt to complete itself.  This could be 
<br />
viewed as a spontaneous symmetry breaking.
<br />
<br />7) However, the boundary is permanent as required by the definitions and a 
<br />
Nothing must remain.
<br />
<br />8) Thus the &quot;penetration&quot; process repeats in an always was and always will 
<br />
be manner.
<br />
<br />9) The boundary &quot;penetration&quot; produces a shock wave [a boundary] that moves 
<br />
into the All as the old example of Nothing becomes a Something and tries to 
<br />
complete itself.  This divides the All into two evolving Somethings - 
<br />
evolving multiverses.  Notice that half the multiverses are &quot;contracting&quot; - 
<br />
losing kernels.
<br />
<br />10) Notice that the All also has a logical problem.  Looking at the same 
<br />
meaningful question of its own stability it contains all possible answers 
<br />
because just one would constitute a selection i.e. net internal information 
<br />
which is not an aspect of a complete kernel ensemble.   Thus the All is 
<br />
internally inconsistent.
<br />
<br />11) Therefore the motion of a shock wave boundary in the All must be echo 
<br />
this inconsistency.  That is each step in the motion as it encompasses 
<br />
kernel after kernel [the evolution of a Something] can not be completely 
<br />
dependent on any past motion.
<br />
<br />12) Some kernels are states of universes and when the boundary of an 
<br />
evolving Something passes about a kernel, the kernel can have a moment of 
<br />
physical reality.
<br />
<br />13)  From within any Something the future course of reality would be non 
<br />
deterministic i.e. suffer True Noise.
