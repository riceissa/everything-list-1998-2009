Hi Russell,
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;	I spent a while poring over Bruno's thesis, and borrowed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Boolos from a local university library to udnerstand more what it was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;about. I didn't go into too great a length into the results and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;structure of Modal logic, although I gained an appreciation, and an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;understanding of the symbology.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;However, my main problem with Bruno's work lay not in the technical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;details of Model logic, rather with the phrases of the ilk &quot;We
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;modelise knowledge by Bew(|p|)&quot;. I can appreciate its only a model,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;but why should I believe that model of knowing has any connection with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reality?  I'm afraid none of the Booloses, nor Bruno's posting helped
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;me with this.
</em><br />
<br />I am glad you borrowed Booloses from a library and that you spent a
<br />
while poring over my thesis. 
<br />
<br />I want just made precise that I have never try to modelise knowledge
<br />
by Bew(|p|).
<br />
<br />This is, actually, a rather sensible point. Most philosopher agree  
<br />
that S4 is a good *axiomatic* of knowledge. Precisely S4 is KT4 + MP,NEC
<br />
or, explicitely (added to the Hilbert Ackerman axioms) :
<br />
<br />AXIOMS      [](A -&gt; B) -&gt; ([]A -&gt;[]B)   K
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[]A -&gt; A                    T
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[]A -&gt; [][]B                4
<br />
<br />RULES       A/[]A    (A &amp; (A-&gt;B)) / B    NEC   MP.
<br />
<br />That is, most philosopher (since Plato, but I remember having seen a 
<br />
Buddhist
<br />
similar writing) agree that:
<br />
<br />-if A-&gt;B is knowable and if A is knowable, then B is knowable. (K)
<br />
- if A is knowable then A is true.  (T)
<br />
- if A is knowable than that very fact (that A is knowable) is knowable 
<br />
(4)
<br />
<br />Would you agree with that? 4 makes that knowledge somehow introspective.
<br />
<br />Now we will see that if []A represent the formal provability of A, or
<br />
(provability by a sound machine), i.e. Bew(|A|), although 4 and K are 
<br />
verified, we don't have T, that is, we don't have
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[]A -&gt; A
<br />
<br />provable for all sentence A. Bew(|A|) -&gt; A is not always provable. 
<br />
This entails that formal provability
<br />
cannot and should not be used for the formalisation of knowledge.
<br />
<br />You can guess the reason. Consider  []FALSE -&gt; FALSE, this is
<br />
equivalent to -[]FALSE which is the statement of (self-) consistency (by
<br />
the machine or the formal system), that is &lt;&gt;TRUE, which by Godel's second
<br />
theorem is NOT provable (by the sound machine).
<br />
<br /><br />But then, how to formalize knowledge ?
<br />
<br />When Socrate asked Thaetetus what is &quot;knowledge of p&quot;, Thaetetus replied
<br />
&quot;justification of p&quot;. But then Socrate argues that a justification 
<br />
of p can be wrong.
<br />
Thaetetus proposed then to define knowledge by 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;justification of p   *and*      truth of p,
<br />
<br />by definition !
<br />
We will see that it is impossible to define &quot;truth of p&quot; in the language
<br />
of the machine (Tarski theorem), but still we can define knowledge 
<br />
of p (for the machine) by
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bew(|p|)  *and*  p
<br />
<br />If we define KNOW(A) by []A &amp; A, then the modal &quot;KNOW&quot; obeys S4, that is
<br />
KNOW(A -&gt; B) -&gt;(KNOW A -&gt; KNOW B), (KNOW A) -&gt; A, etc. (see above).
<br />
<br /><br />To sum up:
<br />
<br />I never modelized knowledge of p by Bew(|p|), but I will indeed define 
<br />
knowledge of p (in the language of the machine) by Bew(|p|) &amp; p.
<br />
<br /><br />How come? Is not Bew(|p|), for the sound machine, trivially equivalent 
<br />
with Bew(|p|) &amp; p ?
<br />
Yes. 
<br />
But the point is that the sound machine neither can &quot;bew&quot; it, nor &quot;know&quot; 
<br />
it!
<br />
<br />We will see how precisely  the epistemological nuance between 
<br />
Bew(|p|) &amp; p and Bew(|p|) are made necessary by the incompleteness 
<br />
phenomenon.
<br />
<br /><br />All this will be made transparent with the modal logic G and G* and their
<br />
arithmetical interpretations. The atomic sentences are interpreted by
<br />
arithmetical sentences.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I can appreciate its only a model,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;but why should I believe that model of knowing has any connection with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reality?  I'm afraid none of the Booloses, nor Bruno's posting helped
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;me with this.
</em><br />
<br /><br />The connection with the reality, as you see, is done in the most platonist
<br />
superb manner, I just add it by definition. Nuancing Bew(|p|) by
<br />
Bew(|p|) &amp; &quot;truth&quot;(of p).
<br />
<br />Well, later I will propose another nuancing of Bew(|p|), more appropriate 
<br />
for &quot;measuring probability one&quot; on possible &quot;consistent extension&quot;).  
<br />
Bew(|p|)
<br />
is nuanced by
<br />
Bew(|p|) &amp; consistency of p. (a necessary step by UDA actually).
<br />
<br />The embedding in UD* will be &quot;translated&quot; in the language of the machine
<br />
by restricting the arithmetical interpretation of p.
<br />
<br />And to get George's prize I will still need to extract LASE (the little
<br />
abstract schroedinger equation) from that embedding. And of course i will 
<br />
need
<br />
to make clear the relationship between LASE and the quantum histories.
<br />
<br /><br />Bruno
