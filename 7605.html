Wei,
<br />
<br />I forwarded your post to a few of my colleagues, and one of them (Moshe
<br />
Looks) replied with basically the same solution as I already posted here,
<br />
but in different words...
<br />
<br />Here is his reply...
<br />
<br />-- Ben
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Correct me if wrong, but isn't the halting problem only

<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; undecidable when the length of the program is unbounded? Wouldn't the AI

assign non-zero
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; probability to a machine that solved the halting problem for

<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; programs up to size S? (S is the number of stars in the sky, grains of

<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; what was really going on if I were presented with such a box (and I'm not

that ;-&gt;...

<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Isn't the moral of this story that, to any finite mind with algorithmic
<br />
information I, &quot;uncomputable&quot; is effectively synonymous with &quot;uncomputable
<br />
within resources I&quot;?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, from the perspective of a finite mind M,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;A = P( X is uncomputable)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;should be equal to
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;B = P(X is uncomputable within resources I)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;since there is no evidence comprehensible by M that can distinguish A from
<br />
B.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Any formalization of induction that says A and B are unequal is not a
<br />
correct model of induction as experienced by a finite mind.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Induction is formalizable, but only using *experience-based semantics*, in
<br />
which one assigns probabilities to propositions based on actual experienced
<br />
pieces of evidence in favor of these propositions.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering induction outside of the context of a particular finite
<br />
system's experience leads to apparent paradoxes like the one you're
<br />
suggesting.  But if one construes induction experientially, one finds that
<br />
these paradoxes never occur in any finite system's experience.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;As an example of experience-based semantics, see Pei Wang's NARS theory of
<br />
AI.  I don't fully accept the NARS theory, I have my own related theory that
<br />
is probabilistically grounded, unlike NARS.  But NARS is an example of what
<br />
experience-based semantics means in concrete mathematical practice.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject: is induction unformalizable?
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day, Earth is contacted by a highly advanced alien civilization, and
<br />
they tell us that contrary to what most of us think is likely, not all of
<br />
the fundamental physical laws of our universe are computable. Furthermore,
<br />
they claim to be able to manufacture black boxes that work as oracles for
<br />
the Halting Problem of Turing machines (one query per hour). They give us
<br />
one free sample, and want to sell us more at a reasonable price. But of
<br />
course we won't be allowed to open up the boxes and look inside to find out
<br />
how they work.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So our best scientists test the sample black box in every way that they
<br />
can think of, but can't find any evidence that it isn't exactly what the
<br />
aliens claim it is. At this point many people are ready to believe the claim
<br />
and spend their hard earned money to buy these devices for their families.
<br />
Fortunately, the Artificial Intelligence in charge of protecting Earth from
<br />
interstellar fraud refuses to allow this. Having been programmed with
<br />
UD+ASSA (see Hal Finney's 7/10/2005 post for a good explanation of what this
<br />
means), it proclaims that there is zero probability that Halting Problem
<br />
oracles can exist, so it must be pure chance that the sample black box has
<br />
correctly answered all the queries submitted to it so far.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moral of this story is that our intuitive notion of induction is not
<br />
fully captured by the formalization of UD+ASSA. Contrary to UD+ASSA, we will
<br />
not actually refuse to believe in the non-existence of uncomputable
<br />
phenomena no matter what evidence we see.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can we do to repair this flaw? Using a variant of UD, based on a
<br />
more powerful type of computer (say an oracle TM instead of a plain TM),
<br />
won't help because that just moves the problem up to a higher level of the
<br />
computational hierarchy. No matter what type of computer (call it C) we base
<br />
UD' on, it will always assign zero probability to the existence of even more
<br />
power types of computer (e.g., ones that can solve the halting problem for
<br />
C). Intuitively, this doesn't seem like a good feature.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier on this mailing list, I had proposed that we skip pass the
<br />
entire computational hierarchy and jump to the top of the set theoretic
<br />
hierarchy, by using a measure that is based a set theoretic notion of
<br />
complexity instead of a computational one. In this notion, instead of
<br />
defining the complexity of an object by the length of its shortest
<br />
algorithmic description, we define its complexity by the length of its
<br />
shortest description in the language of a formal set theory. The measure
<br />
would be constructed in a manner analogous to UD, with each set theoretic
<br />
description of an object contributing n^-l to the measure of the object,
<br />
where n is the size of the alphabet of the set theory, and l is the length
<br />
of the description. Lets call this STUM for set theoretic universal measure.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STUM along with ASSA does a much better job of formalizing induction,
<br />
but I recently realized that it still isn't perfect. The problem is that it
<br />
still assigns zero probability to some objects that we intuitively think is
<br />
very unlikely, but not completely impossible. An example would be a device
<br />
that can decide the truth value of any set theoretic statement. A universe
<br />
that contains such a device would exist in the set theoretic hierarchy, but
<br />
would have no finite description in formal set theory, and would be assigned
<br />
a measure of 0 by STUM.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not sure where this line of thought leads. Is induction
<br />
unformalizable? Have we just not found the right formalism yet? Or is our
<br />
intuition on the subject flawed?
