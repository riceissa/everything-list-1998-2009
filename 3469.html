</em><br />
<br /><br />I don't think so. Abstract object comes to us through our sense organs 
<br />
or our imaginations, too. Note that I take our sense organ also as
<br />
something we imagine (see below).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Consider the alternative &quot;It is possible 'abstract' objects exist - 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;abstract objects we know about  -but which are not expressed in any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physical way&quot;. This seems to me to be absurd (because to know about an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;abstract object one must already have rendered it in the brain somewhere).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I stick with my 'necessary' criterion for now!
</em><br />
<br /><br />This is because you believe that a belief or a knowledge is something
<br />
which must be rendered by a brain. Locally you are right, I guess.
<br />
But to extrapolate this globally would eliminate possible explanation
<br />
of where the &quot;physical&quot; comes from (without mentionning the Mind/body p.).
<br />
The more concrete and simple things I can imagine are the natural numbers,
<br />
let us say, and all the true relations between them. 
<br />
Those true relations define all computational histories. I belong
<br />
myself to an infinity of those abstract histories, but I feel myself
<br />
in a unique concrete history. What you call a brain is a set of sharable
<br />
(its mass, shape) and unsharable (all what you feel when you look at
<br />
a brain) knowledge about an apparently stable patterns we can talk about.
<br />
The fact that mind supervene on number relations is not more magic than
<br />
to make it relying on dynamical processes. Actually with comp it is even
<br />
less magic.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;How do you have access to this abstract world if not through the physical?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Because I am abstract myself. (If you have read &quot;Reason and Persons&quot; by
<br />
Parfit, it will help you to know I disagree with him when he says that
<br />
we are token. Many types no token! (that follows from comp too imo).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;you say that the 'concrete' world doesn't exist, well then I think what we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are saying to each other is probably actually the same thing - the only 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;difference is a linguistic one. You just call your world an 'abstract' one 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;- I call mine the 'physical' one.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I'm afraid the difference is not only linguistic. I am willing to believe
<br />
that the &quot;ultimate&quot; reality are just the arithmetical truth, all the rest,
<br />
brains, galaxies, real numbers, etc. belongs to the imagination of 
<br />
immaterial machines. The physicalness is an inside view on some border
<br />
of that imagination.
<br />
Reality is a form of dream sharing by relative numbers.
<br />
Could you be sure that that is not the case? Are you ready to accept that
<br />
you are fallible on the hypothesis that there is a physical universe?
<br />
If it were only linguistic, I would not say that not only matter
<br />
emerges ontologically from the number's dream, but that epistemologically
<br />
the science of matter is derivable from the science of machine dreams.
<br />
Those dreams obeys very strict (computationalist) laws, so that this move
<br />
is not so easily shown unreasonnable.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The following comment is interesting &quot;We are in all universe at 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;once, but differentiations into stable magical Harry Potter like 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computations have measure zero in computerland&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Really? Identically zero? Do you mean that they are not represented in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;multiverse, or am I confused?
</em><br />
<br /><br />They are represented in the multiverse/many-dreams, but they are rare
<br />
terribly rare compared to our &quot;normal&quot; continuations. To expect finding
<br />
oneself in a Harry Potter like universe would be like to put water
<br />
in the fridge for making coffee each morning: that is not statistically
<br />
impossible, but statisticians say it is stochastically impossible. It is
<br />
like throwing a coin repetitively and getting always head. I would not
<br />
bet on it in normal situation. Near death the comp hyp make that
<br />
question less obvious.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Finally on this comment &quot;Is that not the reason why science or conscience 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;always 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;abstracts (for making simpler).&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Science has never 'abstracted' - not has 'mathematics'. They 'generalise' 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and there is a very important difference there. My triangle with sides 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;x,y,z which I draw on paper is a particular triangle (NOT an abstract one  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;-abstract triangles supposedly exist 'out there' in the Platonic realm 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;somewhere). Sure my particular triangle 'stands-for' all other triangles - 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;but it is not an 'abstract triangle'. An abstract triangle is supposedly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;'equailateral, isosceles and scalene' all at once. So I object to your 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;saying 'Science abstracts' - not 'Science generalises' and I distinguish 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;between the two.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I understand the nuance, but this is only coherent with your
<br />
physicalist postulate. I don't believe in any concrete triangle, nor
<br />
in any concrete superstring (at least under comp hyp).  Note that
<br />
an abstract triangle could also be just equilateral!
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I'm about to head off to work, so I won't go into what I believe &quot;we&quot; are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;- as you ask below. For now, I'll just note that I side with David Hume on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this. There is no 'soul' - no eternally existing 'mind'. All we are is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;nothing but a bunch of perceptions. We perceive the world and our own 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;thoughts. There is no underlying unifying structure to ourselves - other 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;than what we imagine there to be. When we fall unconscious we cease to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;exist as a person. This is what I believe, in brief. What do you think you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are? What is the human being, essentially?
</em><br />
<br /><br />The mindscape is the arithmetical truth, it exists out of space,
<br />
time. So I would say it is not even eternal, it is much more stable
<br />
than that!
<br />
<br />The soul of a machine is anything the machine can believe truly
<br />
or wrongly about herself. I would add that the soul is the person
<br />
as being incarnate in some machine history.
<br />
<br />We are a bunch of perception? I hope we are what remains
<br />
invariant for varying perceptions. So you understand I bet there
<br />
is some underlying unifying structure to ourselves. (Well, 
<br />
computer science prove the existence of such invariant patterns).
<br />
It could be also what we imagine there to be.
<br />
<br />When we fall unconscious we cease to exist as a person. Right, if
<br />
that can ever happen. We can only (consciously) talk of &quot;feeling 
<br />
having been unconscious&quot; (in sleep, after an accident, that is only
<br />
when we recover. Is that not necessarily a sort of speculation?
<br />
How could one remember having really been unconscious????
<br />
