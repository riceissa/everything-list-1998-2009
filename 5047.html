Erick,thanks for your comments on my exchange with GeorgeQ.
<br />
<br />Although I do not claim to have understood (digested?) all of your post,
<br />
I feel it may be in my line of thinking (pardon me the offense). I just use
<br />
less connotations to 'time' related phrases, as may be obvious from below.
<br />
<br />Over the years I tried in several attempts to voice on this (and other)
<br />
lists
<br />
that all our phys-math considerations are secondary, coming from (and by)
<br />
human understanding of something with/by human logic.
<br />
I see no evidence that the existence (nature? everything&quot;) would follow
<br />
our approval - 'our' as part/product of it. &quot;Physical law&quot; is a model of
<br />
our thinking (I may be crucified for this) and fetishizing our understanding
<br />
is IMO narrow. Even the 'elephant/rabbit' excursions start from some
<br />
'random' arrangement of &quot;photons&quot;, which are 'our' interpretation about
<br />
sthing which may be interpreted quite differently by different mindsets.
<br />
<br />This is the reason - I think - why GeorgeQ found my ideas mystical. In my
<br />
vocabulary mystical is what has not (yet?) been explained. I work with all
<br />
unknown/unknowables, trying to make sense of the so far 'undiscovered'
<br />
within the 'boundaries' of our mind. I call it my scientific agnosticism.
<br />
Time and space are our crutches (boundaries? see below).
<br />
Russell St. scolded me several times for my 'non-mathematical' stance as
<br />
improper, vague, undefinable etc. - he is right, I don't 'force' my (our)
<br />
understanding onto things beyond it. Equationally or not.
<br />
<br />I appreciate your remark:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as later will be mentioned, boviously perception play a big role in this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; value, is your definition of the univers from the perspective of a human
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being, being that self within it's self, as projected outwards from a
</em><br />
finite
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; continuum into a supposedly infinite continuum?&lt;
</em><br />
(whether 'boviously' is a typo for obviously, or a hint to the early style
<br />
on
<br />
this list calling adverse ideas &quot;bovine excrement&quot;).
<br />
<br />Somebody speculated on the way of 'thinking' on Venus where the clouds
<br />
prevent any info about the extravenereal world (cosmology, philosophy,
<br />
etc.). We are sitting closed in by a mental cloud of our &quot;understanding&quot;,
<br />
ie boundaries of our mindset (epistemically steadily widening, however).
<br />
<br />I believe 'computation' here goes beyond the 'binary calculations' as well
<br />
as (maybe) temporal considerations. &quot;Life&quot; I consider differently, IMO
<br />
it is some natural function we overappreciate because &quot;we do it&quot; (cf the
<br />
biology etc. in our reductionistic science system). 'Consciousness' I call
<br />
the acknowledgement (by anything) and response to (incl, storage) of
<br />
information - absolutely not restricted to functions we would deem 'life'.
<br />
So I have no problem with 'universes' (not?) containing 'live' products.
<br />
We muster a reductionistic way of our mindset: using limited models of
<br />
observables, cut into (select) boundaries in a world of (wholistically)
<br />
interconnected interaction of things way beyond our cognitive inventory.
<br />
<br />Regards
<br />
<br />John Mikes

Subject: Re: Is the universe computable?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to your series of questions I would like to add one as first:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;What do you call universe?&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; i think this question is most temporally cognitively perceptual in nature.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as explained:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; as long as we do not make this identification, it is futile to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; speculate about &quot;its&quot; computability/computed sate.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as later will be mentioned, boviously perception play a big role in this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; value, is your definition of the univers from the perspective of a human
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being, being that self within it's self, as projected outwards from a
</em><br />
finite
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; continuum into a supposedly infinite continuum?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or are you looking at the univers from the point of view of a rock which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; site blindly in time without temporant perceptual motion?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; obviously there are many different perceptual universes, and any of them
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could be philosphically percieved by the mind, therefor any of them would
</em><br />
be
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physically coorect on a perceptual model of a temporant cyclical universe.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we have to keep in mind, the time itself may only be a function of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; combined perceptual receptions of our own internally functioning senses
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; biologically simultaneously now.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I see not too much value in assuming infinite memories
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and infinite time of computation, that may lead to a game
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and i may i beg to ask is a computer supposed to under any assumption
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; compute a continuous value of infinite using binary logic as it's base
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computational rate?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;-calling &quot;computation&quot; the object to be computed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this is quite naturally the function of time works in the first place.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time is the measure of the systematic computational functions of an
</em><br />
internal
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; system as measured by the temporant singularity of the external structures
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of that internal system as an alternatively functional singular temporant
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; system of it's own. .: the nature of a coputationally temporant universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; involves the notion of a singular object, calculating it's own internal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reference states in order to functionally compute it's own new external
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appearance while maintaining it's own internal functions in time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Is 'Multiverse' part of your universe, or vice versa?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it occurs to me that while yes, absolutely the funcion of a multiverse is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perceptually accurate, that when a computer 'calculates' temporal
</em><br />
function,
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that it is calculating time from a computer's viewpoint, and not a human's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; percetual understanding. Therefor a true projection of an absolute univers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would be one without life in it, and therefor one which we as humans are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perceptually unviable to deal with. (except of course under the presence
</em><br />
of
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some form of philosophical existentialism by behavioural thought process)
