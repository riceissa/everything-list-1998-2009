</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Where I'm trying to get is that there is no explanation for our

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; conscious experience.  It just is.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Depends on what you want an explanation in terms of.
</em><br />
<br />I want an explanation that explains what's really real and how that
<br />
connects to my conscious experience.
<br />
<br />BUT, I see now that this apparently isn't possible, even in principle.
<br />
&nbsp;And even if physicalism or platonism were answers to what's &quot;really
<br />
real&quot;...those answers don't mean anything.
<br />
<br />So.  That's a bummer.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; So all that we have to work with are our observations, plus our innate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; reasoning processes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, these two things are not enough to determine what, if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; anything, really exists outside of our experience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; At best, we can take our observations and apply our innate reasoning
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; processes to produce theoretical models that are consistent with what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; we have observed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Right.  Forget the really real and I'll settle for a good model.
</em><br />
<br />Hmmm.  Well, apparently that's as good as it gets.  So I reckon you
<br />
have the right attitude.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; And third, even if true, the bottom line for all of them is,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;conscious experience just is what it is&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The problem with that is that is applies equally to everything.  So it's completely devoid
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of meaning.
</em><br />
<br />Yep.  I don't see it as a problem.  That's just the way it is.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; For instance:  Bits of matter in particular configurations &quot;cause&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; conscious experience.  Fine.  So what deeper meaning can we draw from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; this?  None.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maybe not meaning, but engineering.  That's why I think the &quot;hard problem&quot; will eventually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be considered a philosophical curiosity like how many angels can dance on the head of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pin.  If we learn to build machines, robots, artificial brains, that behave as if they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; were conscious we'll stop worrying about perceptual qualia and phenomenal self-reference
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and instead we'll talk about visual processing and memory access and other new concepts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that'll be invented.
</em><br />
<br />I'd say that when we actually have such robots will be when interest
<br />
in the &quot;hard problem&quot; will peak.  We're just in the early stages of
<br />
this process now.
<br />
<br />But, I think there is no answer to the hard problem, and at some point
<br />
you just have to get on with things.  So practical considerations will
<br />
ultimately rule the day.  If it's convenient to treat such robots as
<br />
conscious entities then we will, otherwise we won't.
<br />
<br />It seems unlikely that we would design a robot to feel much suffering,
<br />
and certainly not to display &quot;human-like&quot; signs of suffering...so can
<br />
you be cruel or abusive to something that doesn't suffer?  Seems
<br />
unlikely.
<br />
<br />So maybe there is no robot parallel to the animal-rights type ethics
<br />
to worry about.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;If you make yourself small enough you can avoid responsibility for everything.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;        --- Daniel Dennett, in Elbow Room
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Every word in your quote, except &quot;for&quot;, has to be considered in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; context of Dennett's special terminology.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Seems prefectly straightforward to me.  If you define yourself as something apart from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; physical processes that move your arms and legs then you avoid responsibility for what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; your arms and legs do.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Right.  &quot;If you define yourself as...&quot;.  Well sure.  That makes it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; easy, and that's what Dennett does.  Just makes up arbitrary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; definitions that suit his ends.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; On the contrary he was criticizing that way of defining yourself.  And of course
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definitions of words are arbitrary - we just chose the words.
</em><br />
<br />Right.  And Dennett is choosing his words carefully, so as to advance
<br />
his social re-engineering agenda.  He want's to keep the idea of
<br />
responsibility for utilitarian reasons..it's hard to keep a society
<br />
going without it, and so he redefines it's meaning to be compatible
<br />
with determinism.
<br />
<br />It's not &quot;responsiblity&quot; in the common usage, it's &quot;Dennettian
<br />
compatibilist responsibility&quot;.  He just shortens the latter to plain
<br />
&quot;responsibility&quot; in an attempt to mislead the unwary.
<br />
<br />The common usage of &quot;responsibility&quot; may not be logical, but it has a
<br />
definite meaning, and it's not the meaning that Dennett assigns to it
<br />
in that quote.  Dennett knows this, but he wants society to adopt his
<br />
terminology and view point, so he keeps throwing it out there in the
<br />
hopes that it'll stick.
<br />
<br />If determinism is true, then there is no responsibility (common
<br />
usage).  My acts are an inevitable result of the initial state of the
<br />
universe and the laws that govern its evolution...neither of which are
<br />
my doing.  I get neither credit nor blame for anything, as events
<br />
could not have transpired other than they did.
<br />
<br />You (and Dennett) can redefine responsiblity and then say, &quot;there, you
<br />
have that&quot;.  But this is a change from the common usage...and so
<br />
effectively a new word.
<br />
<br />As far as I know Dennett isn't contesting determinism.  He's just
<br />
trying to make it more palatable.
