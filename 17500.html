<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I'm questioning something more subtle here, I think.  First, one could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; simply decide to be eliminativist about experience, and hold that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; extrinsic PM account is both exhaustive and singular.  In this case,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'being' anything is simply an extrinsic notion.  But if we're not in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; this sort of denial, then the idea of 'being' the system subtly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; encourages the intuition that there's some way to be that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; simultaneously satisfies two criteria:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 1) Point-for-point isomorphism - in some suitable sense - with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; extrinsic description.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 2) An intrinsic nature that is incommunicable in terms of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; extrinsic description alone.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Even if there PM and functionalism is true, (1) and (2) are dubious.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Extrinsic descriptions are necessarily in terms of shared experiences
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and so may not be complete.
</em><br />
<br />You do realise I was arguing *against* any possibility of a monistic
<br />
conjunction of 1) and 2)?  I was heading step-by-step for the
<br />
conclusion that all our notions of being should supervene on the
<br />
intrinsic account, with the extrinsic part representing what is
<br />
shareable between contexts. Aside from this, I'm not sure what you
<br />
mean by &quot;even if PM and functionalism is true&quot;.  I'll assume that
<br />
you're not taking the eliminativist line, since then there would be
<br />
nothing further for you to claim vis-a-vis mind.  It's difficult for
<br />
me to follow arguments on the basis of PM+CTM, because I'm with Bruno
<br />
in believing them to be hollow.  So if we're to stay with PM, then for
<br />
me it would have to be on the basis of a theory of mind that was
<br />
reducible to physical causation in the *hierarchical* - rather than
<br />
functional - sense that 'life' is, in the typical example of a
<br />
higher-order organisational concept you've previously suggested to me.
<br />
<br />Your statement &quot;extrinsic descriptions are necessarily in terms of
<br />
shared experiences and so may not be complete&quot; is interesting to me,
<br />
not exclusively because I happen to agree with it!  Do you agree that
<br />
extrinsic descriptions are thereby *necessarily* incomplete, or merely
<br />
contingently so - i.e. that we are ignorant?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Incommunicable&quot; is ambiguous. It could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mean impossible in principle or it could mean we haven't developed the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; words or pictures for it.  Assuming there's something incommunicable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the later sense doesn't imply that PM or functionalism are false.
</em><br />
<br />I meant it in the former sense.  To be more precise, I mean that there
<br />
is information available in context that can't be directly
<br />
incorporated in what can be communicated out-of-context - hence
<br />
&quot;incommunicable&quot;.  But that's not the end of the story.  The
<br />
uninterpreted - and thus incomplete - data are re-instantiable in
<br />
another interpretative context, and hence there is the possibility of
<br />
re-completing the picture, at least to some tolerance.  Hence we can
<br />
refer to what's left out of the abstractable, and hence - crucially -
<br />
shareable, part *ostensively*.  In effect, we're saying to each other
<br />
&quot;take this contextless relational dataset and instantiate it in terms
<br />
of your local interpretation, take a look at the bit I appear to be
<br />
pointing at, and then let's compare notes&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The idea of 'being' somebody (or thing) else already assumes dualism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It assumes some 'I' that could move to be Stathis or a bat and yet
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; retain some identity.  But on a functionalist view 'I' already am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Stathis and a bat - in other words there is no 'I', it's the creation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of viewpoint by each functional entity.  In that case being someone
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; else in incommunicable in principle because the concept in incoherent.
</em><br />
<br />Well, I completely agree with all of that, but what made you think
<br />
that what I was saying was anything to do with being somebody else?  I
<br />
think I did a bad job of articulating my line of argument.  As I've
<br />
said, I can't make any sense of a functionalist view on the basis of
<br />
PM.  To be coherent, functionalism must treat physical entities as
<br />
mere relational placeholders, and hence the supplementary assumption
<br />
of PM or any other primitively non-functional ontology is either
<br />
simply redundant or weirdly dualistic AFAICS.  I thought this before
<br />
ever encountering Bruno's ideas, but his articulation of comp has
<br />
given me another angle of attack on this key intuition.  To be clear:
<br />
I'm not per se arguing against functionalist accounts, but like Bruno
<br />
I believe that their task is to explain the *appearance* of the
<br />
material, not their own spooky emergence from it.
<br />
<br />But beyond even that, what I was articulating was my own version of
<br />
strict eliminativism.  IOW if we sincerely want to be monists we must
<br />
be ready in principle to reduce *all* our various conceptual accounts
<br />
to one in terms of the differentiables of a single ontic context.  And
<br />
unless we're eliminativists about personal existence, that had better
<br />
be the one we already occupy.  There's a tendency to argue this
<br />
context away as merely epistemic and not ontic, but this distinction
<br />
can be shown to collapse with very little logical effort.  I know not
<br />
everyone accepts this view, especially in the 'hard' sciences, but
<br />
there are very notable exceptions, some of them amongst its most
<br />
distinguished practitioners.  Obviously, for this to have any chance
<br />
of success as a programme, all the other accounts must be in principle
<br />
paraphraseable as aspects or modalities of this single contextual
<br />
account, but again IMO the standard arguments against this seem to
<br />
miss the point.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; *we could interpret* in ways that made contextual sense *for us* -

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; standing in, as it were, for the alien?  If so, this is what I meant

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; when I said to Stathis that it really becomes equivalent to the

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; problem of other minds, in that if we can coax the data into making

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; This intuition has a lot of work to do to stay monistic - i.e. to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; claim to refer to a unique existent.  First it has to justify why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; there's still a gap between the 'extrinsic' system-as-described and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the 'intrinsic' system-as-instantiated - i.e. the description can no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; longer be considered exhaustive.  Then it has to explain the existence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of the former as some mode of the latter.   Finally, it has to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; dispense with any implied referent of the former, except in the guise
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of the latter - i.e. it has to dispense with any fundamental notion of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the extrinsic except as a metaphor or mode of the intrinsic.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Dispensing with the extrinsic in this way leaves us with 'being' as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; fundamentally intrinsic notion.  Not doing so is an implicit appeal to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; dualism.

<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ah, so the alien has photoreceptors and retinas?  That's an assumption

<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; worth knowing!  This is why I said &quot;a successful theory wouldn't be

<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; very distant from the belief that the alien was, in effect, human, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; alternatively that you were,  in effect, alien&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think what I have proposed is consistent with functionalism, which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; may or may not be true. A functionally identical system produces the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; same outputs for the same inputs, and functionalism says that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; therefore it will also have the same experiences, such as they may be.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But what those experiences are like cannot be known unless you are the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; system, or perhaps understand it so well that you can effectively run
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it in your head.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, it's precisely the conjunction of functionalism with a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; primitively material assumption that prompted this part of the thread.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  Peter asked me if I thought a brain scan at some putatively
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fundamental physical level would be an exhaustive account of all the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; information that was available experientially, and I was attempting to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; respond specifically to that.  Given what you say above, I would again
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; say - for all the reasons I've argued up to this point - that a purely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; functional account on the assumption of PM gives me no reason to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; attribute experience of any kind to the system in question.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The way you phrase it rightly emphasises the focus on invariance of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; inputs and outputs as definitive of invariance of experience, rather
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; than the variability of the actual PM process that performs the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; transformation.  As Brent has commented, this seems a somewhat
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; arbitrary assumption, with the implied rider of &quot;what else could it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be?&quot;  Well, whatever else could provide an account of experience, this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; particular conjecture happens to fly directly in the face of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; simultaneous assumption of primitively physical causation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't see that.  I conjectured that with sufficient knowledge of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; environment in which the alien functioned and input-outputs at the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; corresponding level, one could provide and account of the alien's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; experience.  I was my point that simply looking at the alien's brain,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; without the context of its function, would not suffice.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There's something trickier here, too.  When you say &quot;unless you are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the system&quot;, this masks an implicit - and dualistic - assumption in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; addition to PM monism.  It is axiomatic that any properly monistic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; materialist account must hold all properties of a system to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; extrinsic, and hence capable of *exhaustive* extrinsic formulation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; IOW if it's not extrinsically describable, it doesn't exist in terms
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of PM.  So what possible difference could it make, under this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; restriction, to 'be' the system?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; The question is whether PM is sufficient to describe the system.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Language is almost certainly inadequate to describing what it is like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; to 'be' the system - you cannot even fully describe what it is like to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; be you.  That's why I think the &quot;hard problem&quot; of consciouness will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; not be &quot;solved&quot; it will just wither away.  Eventually we will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; understand brains sufficiently to create AI with specifically designed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; memories, emotions, and cogitation, as evidenced by their behavior and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; the similarity of their processes to human ones.  We won't *know* that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; they are conscious, but we'll believe they are.

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If the reply is that it makes just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the somewhat epoch-making difference of conjuring up an otherwise
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; unknowable world of qualitative experience, can we still lay claim to
</em><br />

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Let's say the alien brain in its initial environment produced a

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; certain output when it was presented with a certain input, such as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; red light. The reconstructed brain is in a different environment and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is presented with a blue light instead of a red light. To deal with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this, you alter the brain's configuration so that it produces the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; output with the blue light that it would have produced with the red
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; light.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In terms of our discussion on the indispensability of an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; interpretative context for assigning meaning to 'raw data', I'm not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sure exactly how much you're presupposing when you say that &quot;you alter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the brain's configuration&quot;.  You have a bunch of relational data
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; purporting to correspond to the existing configuration of the alien's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; brain and its relation to its environment.  This is available to you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; solely in terms of your interpretation, on the basis of which you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; attempt to come up with a theory that correlates the observed 'inputs'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and 'outputs' (assuming these can be unambiguously isolated).  But how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would you know that you had arrived at a successful theory of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; alien's experience?  Even if you somehow succeeded in observing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; consistent correlations between inputs and outputs, how could you ever
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be sure what this 'means' for the alien brain?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; With the example of the light, you alter the photoreceptors in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; retina so that they respond the same way when to a blue light that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they would have when exposed to a red light. Photoreceptors are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; neurons and synapse with other neurons, further up the pathway of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; visual perception. The alien will compare his perception of the blue
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sky of Earth with his memory of the red sky of his home planet and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; declare it looks the same. Now it is possible that it doesn't look the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; same and he only thinks it looks the same, but the same could be said
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of ordinary life: perhaps yesterday the sky looked green, and today
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that it looks blue we only think it looks the same because we are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; deluded.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I would say that in effect what you have posed here is 'the problem of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; other minds', and that consequently a 'successful' theory wouldn't be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; very distant from the belief that the alien was, in effect, human, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; alternatively that you were,  in effect, alien.  And, mutatis
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mutandis, I guess this would apply to rocks too.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think what I have proposed is consistent with functionalism, which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; may or may not be true. A functionally identical system produces the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; same outputs for the same inputs, and functionalism says that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; therefore it will also have the same experiences, such as they may be.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But what those experiences are like cannot be known unless you are the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; system, or perhaps understand it so well that you can effectively run
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it in your head.
