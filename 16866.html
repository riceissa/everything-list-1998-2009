</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Hmm... let us say &quot;OK&quot; (but this could be ambiguous). This gives  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mainly the arithmetical hierarchy when you start from the oracle for  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the halting problem. There are relativized hierarchy based on any  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; oracle, and then starting from the halting problem in that oracle.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The degrees are structured in a very complex way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't know the meaning of the phrases &quot;arithmetical hierarchy&quot; or  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;relativized hierarchy&quot;, is there any simple way of explaining? In  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any case, the problem I am mainly concerned with is the set of all  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; propositions that would be considered well-formed-formulas (WFFs) in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the context of Peano arithmetic (so it would involve arithmetical  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; symbols like + and x as well as logical symbols from first-order  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logic, and they'd be ordered in such a way that the symbol-string  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would express a coherent statement about arithmetic that could be  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; either true or false). Is there some way to come up with a rule that  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would allow you to judge the true or falsity of *every* member of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this set of propositions using some kind of sufficiently powerful  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hypercomputer (presumably a fairly powerful one like the 'omega- 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; order oracle machine' or beyond), just by checking every possible  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; value for the numbers that could be substituted in for variable  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; symbols? That would allow us to make sense of the distinction  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between &quot;truths about arithmetic&quot; and &quot;statements about arithmetic  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; provable by some axiomatic system like the Peano axioms&quot; (the issue  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Brent Meeker was talking about in the post at <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/everything-list.domain.name.hidden/msg16562.html">http://www.mail-archive.com/everything-list.domain.name.hidden/msg16562.html</a> 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  ), without having to worry about the &quot;meaning&quot; that we assign to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arithmetical symbols like the number &quot;2&quot;, or about philosophical  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; questions about where our understanding of that meaning comes from.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I think you are asking something impossible. The notion of elementary  
<br />
aritmetical truth will always be simpler than the notion you need to  
<br />
define the hypercomputer. Just Gödel's incompleteness theorem  
<br />
justifies in an transparent way the separation between truth and  
<br />
provability in such or such formal theory. The arithmetical hierachy  
<br />
is the one I was describing with the sequence of alternation of  
<br />
quantifiers starting from decidable formula. That hierarchy does  
<br />
indeed described a sequence of &quot;hypermachine&quot; (because each level  
<br />
posses a Sigma_i or Pi_i completeness notion, which generalize the  
<br />
notion of universality for machine-with-oracle. I will have some  
<br />
opportunity to describe notion even more powerful. But only (with  
<br />
Church thesis) the Sigma_1 universality has an effective universal  
<br />
counterpart, represented by any computer, or universal language  
<br />
interpreter.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Instead we'd have a purely formal definition about how to judge the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; truth-value of WFFs beyond those the Peano axioms can judge,
</em><br />
<br /><br />Remember that  PA+&quot;consistent PA&quot; is uncomputably more powerful than  
<br />
PA. And ZF set theory is much much more powerful than PA, ...
<br />
<br />This is something I will have to explain, at least for AUDA, but in  
<br />
all those discussions we have to distinguih the notion of  
<br />
computability (which is universal and does not depend on the choice of  
<br />
formalism), with the notion of provability which is formalism dependent.
<br />
And then we can generalize the notion of computability, and even of  
<br />
provability.
<br />
<br />Humans provability is generally considered as much larger than PA  
<br />
arithmetic.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; albeit one that cannot actually be put into practice for arbitrary  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; propositions without actually having such a hypercomputer (but for  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some specific propositions like the Godel statement for the Peano  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; axioms, I think we can come up with an argument for why the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hypercomputer should judge this statement 'true' as long as we  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; believe the Peano axioms are consistent, so in this sense defining  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arithmetical truth in terms of such a hypercomputer is  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *conceptually* useful).
</em><br />
<br />The whole incompleteness phenomena bears on all notion of  
<br />
hypercomputations. I prefer to call &quot;hypercomputers&quot; Gods or angels,  
<br />
and both humans and machines can accelerate their work by invoking  
<br />
them. The notion of real numbers are based on such notions. It is an  
<br />
open problem if we really needs those God to do mathematics, but  
<br />
everyone agree they simplified life considerably, like infinities in  
<br />
analysis, etc. Eventually such existence question is related to the  
<br />
relation between first and third points of view.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You can go even past finite-order oracle machines into oracle  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machines for higher ordinals too...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;This leads to the hyperarithmetical hierarchy and/or analytical  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hierarchy, where you consider formula with variables for functions  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or sets. There are many non trivial theorems which relate those  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; notions (and open problems, but I have not follow the recent  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; developments). Imo, the best book on that subject is still the book  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by Rogers.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Again, I'm only interested here in the type of propositions that  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would be judged WFFs in the context of the Peano axioms, and I think  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in this case the variables only refer to particular numbers, right?  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Or is it possible to write a WFF in this context where the variables  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; refer to &quot;functions or sets&quot;?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes, that is second order logic. And the theories of set have been  
<br />
invented for doing higher order logic in a pure first order way. In  
<br />
recursion or computability theory this leads to the analytical  
<br />
hierarchy. Naïve math is of infinite or indeterminate order.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Like you I am an arithmetical realist but not necessarily a realist  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about arbitrary sets.
</em><br />
<br />I can be, but by distinguish levels.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think it may be problematic to talk about sets that are so big  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that most of their numbers have no finite description, as must be  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; true of any uncountable set. If there is no *rule* which maps  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; countable ordinals to real numbers and which can be described in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; finite terms by a humanlike being, for example, then is it really  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaningful to ask whether or not a completely incomprehensible  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mapping exists between these two sets? I'm not so sure, and thus I'm  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not sure whether I believe there is any &quot;real truth&quot; about the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Continuum Hypothesis.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK. It is a very difficult subject. I am a long way from having any  
<br />
definite opinion. Even assuming comp.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; which means we should also have a notion of an omega_1^CK-order  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; oracle machine.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;You are quick here! There are more than one way to make this precise.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; More than one non-equivalent way to make it precise, so that a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; number computable by one version of an &quot;omega_1^CK-order oracle  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine&quot; might not be computable by another version? Of course even  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with ordinary Turing machines, there are multiple ways to design the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; internal state-changing rules for the machine, such that different  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Turing machines might respond to the same input string  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; differently...still if a given output is computable by one universal  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Turing machine it should be computable by any other, so they are all  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;equivalent&quot; in that sense. If we define the &quot;order&quot; of oracle  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machines in the sense I discussed (so that the third-order oracle  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine can decide whether the first- or second-order oracle  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machines will halt given any input string of the type that could be  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; given to a Turing machine, and so forth), then even if there could  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be different input-output relations for an oracle machine of a given  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;order&quot;, would the set of outputs &quot;computable&quot; by differently- 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; designed oracle machines of that particular order not be  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;equivalent&quot; in a similar sense?
</em><br />
<br /><br />There are many hierarchies there, and many results which would be  
<br />
difficult to describe in any short way. I hope I can give later more  
<br />
information.
<br />
The important result is that the &quot;order defined by oracle for the  
<br />
halting problem, the totality problem, and similar can be associated  
<br />
with the Pi-i and Sigma_i hierarchy of alternation of quantifiers?  
<br />
Then all that -hierarchy can itself be relativized on any oracle. Like  
<br />
you can define the Phi_i^A, and their domain W_i^A. The Phi_i^A are  
<br />
the partial functions from N to N that you can compute with a  
<br />
universal machine &quot;in connection&quot; of the oracle A.
<br />
The whole of recursion theory can be lifted in such &quot;machines&quot;. But  
<br />
their rôle can only be &quot;technical&quot; for a computationalist. Of course  
<br />
they could be of interest fro some A-computationalist. But those have  
<br />
not yet appear, except in the sense of taking our data as an oracle.  
<br />
But this should be avoided, I would say by definition, in any  
<br />
scientific enterprise, it would leads to a confusion between necessary  
<br />
and contingent.
<br />
<br />You should study books on unsolvability, like those by Shoenfield, or  
<br />
Rogers, if those questions interest you.
