Juergen wrote (among things):
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;But how to answer an ill-posed question?  You promise that &quot;time and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;space will disappear at the end of the reasoning&quot;, but your question
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is about delays, and how can we speak about delays without defining
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;time? Simulation time? Real time? Both? How? There is no way to continue
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;without formal framework.
</em><br />
<br />We were doing a thought experiment. I haven't say that the delays were
<br />
virtual. This is done much later in the reasoning. Of course, as George
<br />
Levy says the permutation real/virtual makes no changes in the first
<br />
person point of view, and does not change the distribution either.
<br />
<br />IF we accept COMP we survive with
<br />
an artificial brain (Well: in case we were betting on a correct level
<br />
of substitution).
<br />
That means the doctor scan (at the right level) your brain, destroy
<br />
it, and then from the recollected information he builds a new one.
<br />
The state of the artificial brain mirrors the state of your brain.
<br />
You survive (with comp!).
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Now let us suppose the doctor keeps the information hidden in a drawer 
<br />
during one year. 
<br />
Real time delay, in the every day-type of life.
<br />
After that delay he makes the &quot;reconstitution&quot;.
<br />
I am just saying that, with comp, from the point of view of the 
<br />
one who survive, that delay cannot be perceived. It has not influence
<br />
the kept information of your brain.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From the first person point of view the delay introduced by the doctor
</em><br />
has not been and cannot been directly perceived.
<br />
(that's why I insist sometimes that reconstition booth has no windows!).
<br />
<br />Are you seeing my point ? It does also not change first person perception
<br />
in case of self-multiplication.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;There is no way to continue without formal framework.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I isolate a unique formalisation by an informal reasoning. To formalise
<br />
at this stage would automatically  put the mind-body problem 
<br />
under the rug. A TOE which doesn't address (at least) the mind-body
<br />
problem is a TOS (a theory of *some* thing).
<br />
<br />But as I show below, those self-multiplication are easily 
<br />
formalised (at least the third person description of those experiment
<br />
are easily formalised). You can easily write a program which multiplied
<br />
yourself (still betting on a correct level of course) relatively to 
<br />
virtual environments. 
<br />
<br />Are you among those who argues that talk on consciousness is a hoax ?
<br />
How do you manage consciousness in your TOE-approach?
<br />
How do you relate consciousness and computation.
<br />
I'm afraid you are making &quot;unspoken assumption&quot; about the 
<br />
mind/body/computation relation all along  your work.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;What exactly is this indeterminacy?
</em><br />
<br />Let us reiterate the self-duplications, applied on you, 16 times.
<br />
I ask to all (2^16) Schmidhubers if they can predict the W,M
<br />
sequences appearing on their T-shirt.
<br />
Some, like WWMWWMWWWWMMMMMM will pretend that the sequence is 
<br />
computable: it is indeed the beginning of the binary 
<br />
developpement of PI.  Most will accept it is just not computable.
<br />
<br />To make things a little more formal, you can program that
<br />
self-multiplication, including yourself as a subroutine, and
<br />
making Washington and Moscow virtual.
<br />
In particular the UD does that. But I am still anticipating.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Is the distribution computable?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;How does the distribution depend on your delays and other computable (?)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;things?
</em><br />
<br />The point is that the &quot;credibility-distribution&quot;, whatever form
<br />
it will take, cannot depend, with comp, on arbitrary delays for the
<br />
reconstitutions. Nor can it depend on space, nor on any subtance ...
<br />
(I anticipate, but you can read my CC&amp;Q paper, cf my URL below).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />In another post you say:
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Yes. My point is: as long as we are not forced by evidence, why assume
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the existence of something we cannot describe or analyze in principle?
</em><br />
<br /><br />If I fall from a flying plane, being a realist (though not a 
<br />
subtancialist) I believe I will fall somewhere, although I have
<br />
no means to describe or analyse where.
<br />
<br />Just to see how much constructive philosopher you are,
<br />
if you have the time, tell me if you accept the 
<br />
following proof ?  Perhaps you know it.
<br />
<br /><br />Proposition: There is a couple of irrational numbers (x,y) 
<br />
such that x^y is rational.
<br />
<br />Proof: we know (since Pythagore) that sqr(2) is irrational.
<br />
<br />Now, either (sqr(2)) ^ (sqr(2)) is rational, and the case is closed.
<br />
<br />or (sqr(2)) ^ (sqr(2)) is irrational, but then
<br />
<br />((sqr(2)) ^ (sqr(2))) ^ (sqr(2)) , which is equal to 2 (rational)
<br />
<br />provide the solution.
<br />
<br />So we know for sure that either (sqr(2)) ^ (sqr(2))
<br />
or ((sqr(2)) ^ (sqr(2))) ^ (sqr(2)) provide the solution, although
<br />
we don't know which one. Do you accept we have nevertheless
<br />
prove that there exists couple of irrational numbers (x,y) 
<br />
such that x^y is rational ?
<br />
<br />(The problem with constructive philosophy is that there are
<br />
quite a lot of them. I am trying to find which one).
