<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;are not considered.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But then what would be an undecidable proposition? This is how

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Russell's and Whitehead logicism has break down. There is a ladder

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of arithmetical propositions which ask for more and more

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ingenuity to be proved. Actually arithmetical truth extend far beyond
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the reach of any consistent machine (and consistent human with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comp). There is an infinity of surprise in there.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I guess you know that there is no natural number p and q such that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (p/q)(p/q) is equal to 2. If mathematical truth were conventionnal,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; why did the pythagoreans *hide* this fact for so long?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So those propositions are neither tautologies, nor conventions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; David Deutsch, following Johnson's criteria of reality, would say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that such propositions kick back.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You know, about arithmetic, and about machines btw, a lot of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; people defends idea which are just no more plausible since
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Godel has proved its incompleteness theorems.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Arithmetical proposition are just not tautologies.
</em><br />
<br />There are three classes of (arithmetical) propositions: those who
<br />
are tautologies (no matter how clever one has to be to figure
<br />
that, they say nothing which is not already in the axioms), those
<br />
whose negation are tautologies, and those whose neither themselves
<br />
nor their negation are tautologies. It might be that we don't
<br />
know which is which but it should be so in principle.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Giving that I hope getting some understanding of the complex human
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; from something simpler (number property) the approach of those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; people will never work, for me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;And certainly vice versa. Though it is difficult to have them saying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;it explicitely I have the feeling that the reason why they do not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;want the natural numbers to be out there and even as not possibly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;being considered as out there is that they do not accept that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;complex human be understood from something simpler (number property).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;They do not even accept the idea being considered, were it as a mere
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;conjecture or working hypothesis. Their more official argument is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;that such a view would prevent the foundation of human dignity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Damned!!!  If there is one thing which could prevent the foundation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of human dignity, it is certainly that totalitarian idea following which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some ideas can not even be considered as an hypothesis or conjecture.
</em><br />
<br />This is indeed a problem. There could be more than one conception
<br />
of human dignity.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But that happens all the time. There has been days you could be burned
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even just because you ask yourself if by chance it was not the sun but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the earth which was moving.
</em><br />
<br />Unfortunately (again), yes.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Are you defending those guys?
</em><br />
<br />No. I am just explaining (or trying to explain) their position.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Are you asking me how to reply to those guy?
</em><br />
<br />I am interested in anybody's opinion on that problem.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; My suggestion: if many people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thinks like that around you, just leave them. Like Valery said, those who are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not willing to use logic with you (that is to argument) are in war with you.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Run or kill them!
</em><br />
<br />This is a safe way to have soon everybody killing everybody.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is not enough they have good intention, if they do not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; want arguments, they are dangerous for all humans. I like to insist, in Valery
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; spirit, that logic is not a question of truth, but of politeness.
</em><br />
<br />I like the analogy. The fact is that there might be several
<br />
(and possibly incompatible) protocols of politeness.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;I have not met any of them physically but I had discussion with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;some of them via Internet. There might not be so many of them but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;there are. You will find, at least in the US, a lot of people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;considering the views of evolution and/or of the big-bang as evil.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then what? If they disagree with dialog and argumentation, *I* will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consider them as evil.
</em><br />
<br />Possibly making you not better than them. But this not that
<br />
simple. They do not disagree with dialog and argumentation.
<br />
Rather they argue in different ways and/or with different
<br />
premises.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;If they finally have to abandon these positions due to the amount
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;of evidence in favor of it, the last line of defence for their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;conception of a personal God and for a significant role for Him
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;could be at the level of artihmetical realism. Artihmetical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;realism by itself (not from a distinct personal God) is therefore
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;seen as evil by them. As I mentionned, they usually do not put it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;that way. Rather they argue that such a view would prevent the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;foundation of human dignity and the like.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; They make probably the same confusion of those who believe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that determinism is in contradiction with free will.
</em><br />
<br />I would say that one of the concern they have behind this is the
<br />
question of free will versus determinism (and/or randomness). You
<br />
and others might see this as making &quot;the same confusion of those
<br />
who believe that determinism is in contradiction with free will&quot;.
<br />
But there might also be more than one conception of free will
<br />
and we could also consider that what they are doing is trying to
<br />
defend another conception of free will that the one which is not
<br />
in contradiction with determinism (and/or randomness). Though we
<br />
may or may not share this conception, I don't think that we can
<br />
dismiss it. The only thing we can say is that they cannot convince
<br />
us of it or possibly even of its meaningfulness but in the same
<br />
way we have no ground to prove them they are wrong.
<br />
<br />Basically, they want to believe that we humans are not reducible
<br />
to numbers and I think that such a reductibility cannot be proved
<br />
either way. Also I understand that one could feel offended by the
<br />
idea that he could be reduced to mere numbers (not more but not
<br />
less he would feel offended by the idea it could be reduced to a
<br />
set of interacting molecules) even if these ideas are considered
<br />
as just hypotheses. They want to believe (and they want to be
<br />
generally believed) that there is (much) more than this in human
<br />
beings (and incidently in themselves).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Actually I tend to think that Godel's and other incompleteness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; result makes comp a sort of vaccine against reductionist view of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self and reality (and arithmetic).
</em><br />
<br />This is not obvious to me. Maybe what &quot;reductionist&quot; actually
<br />
means needs to be clarified.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You know &quot;reason&quot; works only through doubt, and through the ability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to listen to different opinions.
</em><br />
<br />I tend to agree but it does not seem enough just to say it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now with Godel we can say more,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which is that &quot;good faith&quot; never fears &quot;reason&quot; and rationality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sincere Faith can only extend Ratio, and is always open to dialog.
</em><br />
<br />It seems that there exists other conceptions of what &quot;good faith&quot;
<br />
and/or &quot;Sincere Faith&quot; should be. Idem for &quot;Ratio&quot;.
<br />
<br />Georges.
