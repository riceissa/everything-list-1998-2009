Hi,
<br />
<br />I take the opportunity that the list is calm to send a first 
<br />
approximation of a possibly extendable post which addresses the 
<br />
beginning of the background needed for the interview of the universal 
<br />
machine on the physical laws.
<br />
It also addresses some point relevant for discussing the link &quot;formal 
<br />
system&quot; &lt;======&gt; &quot;Computation&quot; as in Tegmark diagram page 18 of his 
<br />
paper &quot;the mathematical universe&quot; (cf a post by Mark Geddes).
<br />
<br />Although schematic, it could already help me if you can list the points 
<br />
for which you would like examples or more technical details, or just 
<br />
explanations. You can also ask for *less* technical details like an 
<br />
explanation in (pure) english, perhaps.
<br />
<br />I am building again from Robinson Arithmetic, but I could have use the 
<br />
combinators or any logical description of what a universal machine (a 
<br />
computer) can do. The adavantage of using Robinson Arithmetic (or its 
<br />
&quot;little&quot; variant) is that provability in Robinson Arithmetic 
<br />
corresponds to universal computability, but not of universal 
<br />
provability (which does not exist).
<br />
<br /><br />I am perhaps on the verge of not being able to explain the sequel in 
<br />
informal term, but I keep hope that non expert, but computer-open 
<br />
minded people, can learn and help me to be clearer or more pedagogical, 
<br />
without having us to study thoroughly mathematical logic.
<br />
Tell me perhaps if you don't understand what I call &quot;Searle's error&quot; in 
<br />
the comp setting below.
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***
<br />
<br /><br />0) historical background
<br />
<br />ARISTOTLE: reality = what you see
<br />
PLATO: what you see = shadows of shadows of shadows of shadows of  .... 
<br />
what perhaps could be.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And would that be? nobody can say, but everybody can get 
<br />
glimpses by looking inward, even  (universal) machines.
<br />
<br />Twentieth century: two creative bombs:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The Universal Machine (talks bits): UM (Babbage, Post, Turing, 
<br />
Church, Suze, von Neumann, ...)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The other universal machine (talks qubit):  QUM (Feynman, 
<br />
Deutsch, Kitaev, Freedman, ...)
<br />
<br />Comp = Milinda-Descartes Mechanism in a digital version. = (also) &quot;YES 
<br />
DOCTOR&quot; + CHURCH'S THESIS. (I suppress the arithmetical realism, 
<br />
because it is implicit in CHURCH'S THESIS).
<br />
<br /><br />UDA: a reasoning which shows that if comp is correct then the physical 
<br />
laws have to be derived by a measure on states (the measure being made 
<br />
up through their computational histories).
<br />
<br />Subgoal: extract QUM from UM's self-observation.
<br />
<br />Link with everything-list: search for the &quot;observer moments&quot; and the 
<br />
relevant structure operating on them (not yet solved).
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***
<br />
<br /><br />1) The ontic theory of everything: LRA (Little Robinson Arithmetic),
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLASSICAL LOGIC (first order predicate logic axioms and inference 
<br />
rules)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AXIOMS OF SUCCESSION
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AXIOMS OF ADDITION
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AXIOMS OF MULTIPLICATION
<br />
<br /><br />That's all. It is the &quot;Schroedinger&quot; equation of the comp-everything! 
<br />
The reason is that LRA is already as powerful as a universal machine.
<br />
LRA proves all verifiable sentences with the shape ExP(x), with P(x) 
<br />
decidable. It is equivalent with the universal dovetailer.
<br />
<br />Now we have to do with LRA  what Everett has done with QM. Embed the 
<br />
observer in the ontic reality.
<br />
For this we have to &quot;modelize&quot; the observer/knower/thinker.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***
<br />
<br /><br /><br />2) The epistemic theory, or the generic observer theory: PA (the lobian 
<br />
machine I will interview).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLASSICAL LOGIC (first order predicate logic axioms and inference 
<br />
rules)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AXIOMS OF SUCCESSION
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AXIOMS OF ADDITION
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AXIOMS OF MULTIPLICATION
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AXIOMS OF INDUCTION
<br />
<br />Note: the observer extends the ontic reality! It extends it by its 
<br />
beliefs in the induction axioms. They are as many as they are formula 
<br />
F(x), and they have the shape:
<br />
<br />[F(0) &amp; Ax(F(x) -&gt; F(x+1))]  -&gt; AxF(x)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />OBVIOUS IMPORTANT QUESTION: How to interview PA when we dispose 
<br />
ontologically only of LRA?
<br />
<br />NOT OBVIOUS SOLUTION: just try to obviate the fundamental SEARLE ERROR 
<br />
(cf Mind's I, Hofstadter -Dennett describe it well) in front of the LRA 
<br />
theorems.
<br />
<br /><br />I explain: Searle's goal consisted in arguing against mechanism, that 
<br />
is arguing we are not machine, and in particular that a simulator is 
<br />
not the real thing. He accepts the idea that in principle a program can 
<br />
simulate a chinese speaker. Knowing the program, Searles accepts he can 
<br />
simulate it, and this without understanding chinese. He concludes that 
<br />
we have to distinguish between speaking chinese and simulating speaking 
<br />
chinese.
<br />
<br />True! but with comp you have to distinguish between the simulated 
<br />
chinese speaker and the simulator of the chinese speaker! By being able 
<br />
to simulate the chinese speaker, Searle can have a conversation with 
<br />
the chinese speaker (well assuming that the chinese speaker can talk 
<br />
english, or that Searle knows chinese).
<br />
<br />This is particularly important in our setting. LRA has the power of a 
<br />
universal turing machine, so it has universal computability power, and 
<br />
can act as a universal simulator. In particular LRA can simulate PA, 
<br />
and any recursively enumerable theory/machine. But compute or simulate 
<br />
are not similar to believing or proving (or talking in some genuine 
<br />
personal way).
<br />
<br />LRA provides a view of computability as a very particular and quasi 
<br />
debilitating case of provability. LRA can prove almost only the true 
<br />
Sigma1 sentences (which is enough to run the UD). For example, LRA 
<br />
cannot prove (about its ontic reality or intended interpretation) that 
<br />
Ax (x + y = y + x). PA can. PA is already a sort of Ramananujan, a 
<br />
total genius compared to LRA, despite the fact that LRA is already 
<br />
universal for computation. For the notion of provability there is no 
<br />
universal notion. There are as many notion of provability than there 
<br />
are machines (human included).
<br />
<br />If you want,  LRA is gifted in proving the existence of number having 
<br />
verifiable property, and giving that PA can be defined, by Godel 
<br />
arithmetizability, in the language of LRA , although LRA has no opinion 
<br />
on the induction axioms (believed by PA), LRA can prove that PA proves 
<br />
this or that. And with strong-AI (that is Searle's weak Turing notion) 
<br />
LRA will prove &quot;and Bruno says this or that&quot;. In this setting, Searle 
<br />
would confused LRA and PA, or LRA and Bruno.
<br />
<br />Now, I will not interview the brunos, but the PAs, as they have much 
<br />
less prejudices, if only that. By the &quot;PAs&quot; I mean the many recurring 
<br />
proofs by LRA that PA proves something (you can see that as the many 
<br />
simulations of PA by LRA). Well, the main advantage of interviewing PA 
<br />
is that anyone just a bit reasonable, believes in PA's beliefs.
<br />
<br />The PAs, are Löbian. In a nutshell, if LRA is indeed universal, PA is 
<br />
not only universal, but knows, in some weak sense, that she is 
<br />
universal.
<br />
LRA has universal &quot;existential provability&quot; power about the verifiable 
<br />
propositions, but LRA has almost no universal &quot;universal provability&quot; 
<br />
power. LRA's talks go like this: oh a prime number! oh a proof by ZF 
<br />
that PA is consistent, oh ...&quot;, but LRA cannot prove the infinity of 
<br />
the primes, nor can LRA prove any reasonable result in number theory 
<br />
begining by a &quot;Ax&quot; (for all x) quantification. The induction axioms, in 
<br />
which PA believes, provide her with, not only a tremedous 
<br />
generalization power, but confers to PA the (modal-logically-viewed) 
<br />
maximal indepassable self-referential power (the one which are 
<br />
axiomatisable by the modal logics G, G*).
<br />
<br />Being universal LRA is under the joug of the incompleteness phenomenon. 
<br />
But this is not saying a lot given that we already know LRA's 
<br />
provability power are so weak. PA, being universal too, is obviously 
<br />
under that joug too, and that is more astonishing a priori, because, as 
<br />
I said, PA is already quite a genius with tremendous provability power. 
<br />
Now, by its powerful self-referential knowledge inherited by that 
<br />
provability power, knowing her universality, PA *knows* that she is 
<br />
under the joug of the incompleteness phenomenon.
<br />
<br />This makes PA, and all her correct (with respect to the usual model 
<br />
(N,+,x)) recursively enumerable extensions, incredibly modest!  (if not 
<br />
a bit naive). But it makes also PA &quot;aware&quot; of intensional distinctions, 
<br />
already described in the Theatetus, which provide then the arithmetical 
<br />
interpretations of Plotinus Hypostases. Including his &quot;Matter&quot; 
<br />
hypostases, making them comparable with quantum logic/quantum 
<br />
computations.
<br />
<br />OK, that last paragraph was quick. I have to explain more on logic 
<br />
(godelian, modal, but also the weak logics like intuitionistic logic or 
<br />
(mainly!) quantum logic, ...). Asap.
<br />
<br />Does this help a bit?
<br />
<br />Bruno
