<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is something of a copout. I really would like to have one &quot;scientific&quot;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory that at least potentially explains &quot;everything&quot;. As it is, even 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; finding a clear way of stating the dichotomy is proving elusive.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Some previous posts in the current thread have attacked this idea by, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for example, explaining ethics in terms of evolutionary theory or game 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory, but this is like explaining a statement about the properties 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of sodium chloride in terms of the evolutionary or game theoretic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; advantages of the study of chemistry. Yes, you can legitimately talk 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about ethics or chemistry in these terms, but in so doing you are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; talking meta-ethics or meta-chemistry, which I think is what Bruno 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; means by &quot;level shift&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
I really think that to get a good grasp on this kind of issue, one has 
<br />
to &quot;get over ones-self&quot;. Step outside for a moment and
<br />
consider whether you &quot;feeling conscious&quot; is as amazing or inexplicable 
<br />
as you think. Consciousness may very well just be
<br />
an epi-phenomenon of a self-reflection-capable world-modelling 
<br />
representer and reasoner such as our brains.
<br />
Minsky's society of mind idea isn't fully adequate as a consciousness 
<br />
explanation, but it makes inroads.
<br />
Some of the most exciting work in this area IMHO is being done by the 
<br />
neurologist Antonio Damasio. Here is a
<br />
review of his book on the topic of the feeling of consciousness:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/anthony.campbell1/bookreviews/r/damasio-2.html">http://homepage.ntlworld.com/anthony.campbell1/bookreviews/r/damasio-2.html</a>
<br />
<br />One of his key idea is that the lowest level of consciousness is just 
<br />
the brain's representation of the sensor data about
<br />
what our body is doing (how it is positioned and moving, if it aches 
<br />
anywhere, and what we're seeing, hearing in each instant
<br />
etc). He says this is the brain's representation for the purpose of 
<br />
&quot;homeostasis&quot; i.e. the instantaneous &quot;status&quot; of the body.
<br />
This homeostatis awareness (reflection of sensor data in the brain) he 
<br />
calls the proto-self.
<br />
<br />Then comes a level (he calls core consciousness) at which those 
<br />
low-level sense data are integrated into a conceptual
<br />
(or object-modelling) level to form a continuous &quot;stream of 
<br />
consciousness feeling&quot;. This is the &quot;watching a movie but
<br />
you are in the movie&quot; sense.
<br />
<br />Finally, at the high level, is added (or filled in) ideas from the 
<br />
memory and planning facilities of the higher brain.
<br />
So what we are doing here is adding in ideas about things which take 
<br />
time. We are adding in (to help explain
<br />
the &quot;stream of consciousness &quot;object-movie that we're in&quot;) a whole bunch 
<br />
of remembered specific episodes and
<br />
facts and generalized space-time-world-situation-model concepts that we 
<br />
produced by processing experience
<br />
after experience after experience. And we are adding in hypotheses about 
<br />
how things could go if (i.e.
<br />
object-movie-that-we're-in-explorations of counterfactuals and 
<br />
hypotheticals and desired future states and
<br />
plan run-throughs for getting there.) This is just using the same 
<br />
&quot;watching-object-movie-that-I'm-in&quot; capability
<br />
but to daydream (remember, or wish, or plan) alternative scenarios 
<br />
rather than the sense-data direct movie
<br />
of the core-self. This highest level self, he calls the 
<br />
&quot;autobiographical self&quot; because the highest level sense of
<br />
consciousness is in effect, us &quot;writing the story of ourselves (that 
<br />
we're in)&quot; as well as &quot;reading the story of ourself (that we're in)&quot;
<br />
at the same time. It is a story, and not just a stream-of-consciousness, 
<br />
because it has added in memories and
<br />
experiences from the past, to provide a meaningful causal narrative to 
<br />
ourself about what is going on now, and
<br />
what is going to happen next.
<br />
<br />So highest-level consciousness IS an autobiographical story of ourself 
<br />
and our doings and present-time but
<br />
past-experientially interpreted experiences.
<br />
<br />And that is just the back-and-forth-in-time (or sideways to 
<br />
hypotheticals/counterfactuals) extension of the
<br />
core-self &quot;movie that I'm both watching AND sensing that I'm in it&quot; 
<br />
sense, which itself is the
<br />
CONCEPTUAL-OBJECT-INTERPRETATION of the continuous stream of homeostasis 
<br />
raw sense-data
<br />
that the brain is continually  receiving and processing in real-time to 
<br />
know what the state of the body is
<br />
and what it senses to be around it.
<br />
<br />This makes PERFECT sense (and feels almost adequate, as an explanation 
<br />
of the &quot;feeling of consciousness&quot;) to me.
<br />
<br />Eric
<br />
<br />p.s. before someone jumps in about how off-topic this is, I think that's 
<br />
narrow minded because understanding
<br />
consciousness is integral to understanding observers and their role in 
<br />
physics.
