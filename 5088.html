<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; its name for the moment). Such attempt are known as &quot;ultrafinitism&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Of course a lot of people (especially during the week-end) *pretend*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; not doing that infinite act of faith, but do it all the time implicitly.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;This is not what I meant. I did not refer to people not willing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;to accept that natural numbers exist at all but to people not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;wlling to accept that natural numbers exist *by themselves*.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Rather, they want to see them either as only a production of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;human (or human-like) people or only a production of a God.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What I mean is that their arithmetical property are independent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of us.
</em><br />
<br />I don't think this is very different. I could argue that even if
<br />
natural numbers were not out there, as soon as anybody consider
<br />
them, their properties automatically come with and impose themselves.
<br />
Even this seemingly weaker statement can be contested and it is not
<br />
actually weaker but equivalent since there might be no other way than
<br />
this one for natural numbers to be out there.
<br />
<br />Some people do argue that there is no arithmetical property
<br />
independent of us because there is no thing on which they would
<br />
apply independentkly of us. What we would call their arithmetical
<br />
properties is simply a set of tautologies that do come with them
<br />
when they are considered but exist no more than them when they
<br />
are not considered.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Do you think those people believe that the proposition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;17 is prime&quot; is meaningless without a human in the neighborhood?
</em><br />
<br />&quot; &quot;17 is prime&quot; is meaningless without a human in the neighborhood&quot;
<br />
is exactly the kind of claim these people make (possibly generalizing
<br />
the concept of human to aliens and Gods). After discussing with some
<br />
of them I think they actually believe what they claim. I am not sure
<br />
however that we always fully understand each other and that you or I
<br />
would exactly understand such a claim in the same way as they do.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Giving that I hope getting some understanding of the complex human
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from something simpler (number property) the approach of those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; people will never work, for me.
</em><br />
<br />And certainly vice versa. Though it is difficult to have them saying
<br />
it explicitely I have the feeling that the reason why they do not
<br />
want the natural numbers to be out there and even as not possibly
<br />
being considered as out there is that they do not accept that the
<br />
complex human be understood from something simpler (number property).
<br />
They do not even accept the idea being considered, were it as a mere
<br />
conjecture or working hypothesis. Their more official argument is
<br />
that such a view would prevent the foundation of human dignity.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Also, I would take (without added explanations) an expression
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like &quot;numbers are a production of God&quot; as equivalent to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arithmetical realism.
</em><br />
<br />Yes and there are several ways to understand this.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;And I said &quot;unfortunately&quot; because some not only do not want to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;see natural numbers as existing by themselves but they do not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;want the idea to be simply presented as logically possible and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;even see/designate evil in people working at popularizing it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK, but then some want you being dead because of the color of the skin,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or the length of your nose, ... I am not sure it is not premature wanting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to enlighten everyone at once ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I guess you were only talking about those hard-aristotelians who
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like to dismiss Plato's questions as childish. Evil ? Perhaps could you be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more precise on those people. I have not met people seeing evil
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in arithmetical platonism, have you?
</em><br />
<br />I have not met any of them physically but I had discussion with
<br />
some of them via Internet. There might not be so many of them but
<br />
there are. You will find, at least in the US, a lot of people
<br />
considering the views of evolution and/or of the big-bang as evil.
<br />
If they finally have to abandon these positions due to the amount
<br />
of evidence in favor of it, the last line of defence for their
<br />
conception of a personal God and for a significant role for Him
<br />
could be at the level of artihmetical realism. Artihmetical
<br />
realism by itself (not from a distinct personal God) is therefore
<br />
seen as evil by them. As I mentionned, they usually do not put it
<br />
that way. Rather they argue that such a view would prevent the
<br />
foundation of human dignity and the like.
