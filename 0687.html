As I've mentioned, I've been reading the archives, and it seems as
<br />
though everyone's been beating up on Jacques since at least January
<br />
about the QTI.  From reading some of this thread, it seems that
<br />
little has changed.  May I enter the fray on the side of the
<br />
Immortal ones?

<br /><br />In reading the archives, I got the distinct impression that you
<br />
think that because the &quot;measure&quot; of a person decreases with time,
<br />
that that person could expect to die at some time in the future.
<br />
Is that correct?
<br />
<br />I think some of the problem may be in inadequate notation and 
<br />
terminology.  In Tegmark's paper, he labels all observer moments 
<br />
by three indeces:  one for the mathematical structure, one for
<br />
which SAS, and one for subjective time.  I think this is inadequate;
<br />
let me propose a similar one, but better (IMO).  First of all, let
<br />
me simplify by only considering MWI, and assuming that we are all
<br />
in just one &quot;mathematical structure&quot;.  I don't think that affects
<br />
the argument for QTI.  Second, let me just consider myself, not
<br />
any other conscious being.  
<br />
<br />Let C refer to Chris Maloney, any SAS with my exact genetic makeup,
<br />
born 7/13/1962, at 11:36PM EDT in Providence Hospital in Washington
<br />
D.C., whose parents are ....   I.e., let C be me.  Note that C does
<br />
not refer to &quot;me-here-now&quot;, but to all &quot;me's&quot; in the branching
<br />
twisting web of MWI.  &quot;My&quot; observer-moments can be denoted C(t, B),
<br />
labelled with two indeces.  t is the subjective (proper) time, and
<br />
B is an abstract thing that denotes which branch the observer-
<br />
moment is on.  Here's some ASCII art (view w/ fixed width font):
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C(0,{})
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/    \
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/      \
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C(1,{1})   C(1,{2})
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/            |   \____
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/             |        \
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C(2,{1,1})     C(2,{2,1})  C(2,{2,2})
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/    |    \____         (etc.)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/     |         \
<br />
&nbsp;C(3,{1,1,1}) C(3,{1,1,2}) C(3,{1,1,3})
<br />
<br />Now, for any C(t,B), there exist an infinite number of
<br />
C(t+delta, {B,n}) observer-moments, which are valid &quot;continuations&quot;
<br />
of the observer moment C(t,B).  This is true because in MWI, 
<br />
anything with a non-zero probability must be realized.  There
<br />
are an infinite number of ways that anyone could survive any
<br />
catastrophe, including discovering all of a sudden that he's 
<br />
a disembodied brain floating in a tank.
<br />
<br />Now, what am &quot;I&quot;, and what am I &quot;going to experience&quot;.  I am a
<br />
thread through this tree (as George points out, and I agree with,
<br />
it's really a net, but why complicate?).  As far as what I'm 
<br />
going to experience in the future, at time, say, t+s, all I can
<br />
do is predict probabilities, since I don't know a priori which
<br />
branches I'll traverse.
<br />
<br />When you say &quot;measure decreases with time&quot;, I would translate that
<br />
to say that at any moment, I have a non-zero probability of dying.
<br />
Is that right?  I think that would have the affect, in the above
<br />
scheme, of decreasing the &quot;measure&quot; of the index n in
<br />
C(t+delta, {B,n})  (I'm not sure that's the correct use of the
<br />
word measure).  But why should that matter?  All that matters is
<br />
that there is _at least one_ observer moment which is a 
<br />
continuation of my present one, at each moment, so that my
<br />
&quot;thread&quot; has some place to go.  I argue for this in a recent
<br />
thing I wrote about transporter booths and copy booths at
<br />
<a href="http://www.chrismaloney.com/seed/seed2.html#indeterminacy">http://www.chrismaloney.com/seed/seed2.html#indeterminacy</a>.
<br />
<br />I contend that I'll survive any moment as long as there is at
<br />
least one moment which qualifies as a continuation.  And every
<br />
moment has an infinite number, therefore, by induction, I'll
<br />
survive every moment.  Quod erat demonstrandum.
