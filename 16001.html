<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Russell, I expected there might be some discussion of my latest eprint on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this list.  That's why I'm here now - to see if there are any clarifications
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I should make in it.  I intend to make it better - and perhaps I'll have you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; guys to thank!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Don't expect me to stick around.  I see the list hasn't changed much -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno is still pushing his crackpot UDA.  I could tell you what's wrong with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; his MGA, but I'm here to deal with the QS paper first.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />Well I'm following this list from a long time now (even when you were still
<br />
here) and I didn't see any proof from you of the crackpoting of UDA, if you
<br />
don't mind to stay a little, I'd like to here your debunking of it.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; <a href="http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/0902/0902.0187.pdf">http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/0902/0902.0187.pdf</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I mentioned the interesting comment on how we should expect to find
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ourselves a Boltzmann brain shortly after the big bang, but there was no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; follow up to this. I have no idea how he came up with that notion.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I wrote
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;If one denies that the amount of &quot;a person's&quot; consciousness can change as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a function of time after it begins to exist and as long as there is at least
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some of it left, then in the quantum MWI, since there deterministically is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some slight amplitude that any given particle configuration (such as that of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a person's brain) exists even shortly after the Big Bang, there would again
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be no reason to expect that a typical person would be the result of normal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evolutionary processes – you would have been 'born' way back then.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Seems pretty straightforward to me:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1. Initially, before evolution occurred, a typical Boltzmann brain (BB) had
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about the same measure as a brain which was like what we consider a normal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person's (an atypical BB).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2. The typical BB's all together vastly outnumbered the atypical ones, so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they had much more total measure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3. We are assuming here that a person's measure can't change as a function
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4. Therefore the initial measure advantage of the typical BB's would hold
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for all time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />You are here explicitely assuming ASSA, meaning that there exists an
<br />
absolute measure over all OM... which seems to me dubious. Your argument
<br />
here is not valid for relative continuation (RSSA).
<br />
<br />Your argument is true for ASSA, but the thinking that there exists an
<br />
absolute measure is non-sense for me.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps I should spell out the steps like that in the paper, but I thought
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it was self-explanatory already.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; His discussion of the Born rule is incorrect. The probability given by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the Born rule is not the square of the state vector
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Russell, Jesse Mazer has already pointed out that it is your discussion of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my discussion of it that is incorrect.  It's true that people use various
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; terminology (maybe I should have said squared norm instead of squared
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; amplitude) and I was trying to keep technicalities to a minimum.  See
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_amplitude">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_amplitude</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; After observation, the state vector describing the new will be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; proportional to the eigenvector corresponding the measured eigenvalue,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; but nothing in QM says anything about its amplitude. Indeed it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; conventional to normalise the resulting state vector
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That only makes sense in a collapse interpretation (or for practical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; convenience).  My guess is you looked up the Born Rule in some textbook and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; naturally it did not have an MWI perspective.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; What I think he is trying to discuss, somewhat clumsily, in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; section on measure, is the ASSA notion of a unique well-defined
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; measure for all observer moments.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The charge of 'clumsiness' is too vague for me to do anything about, so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perhaps you could be more specific.  As for self-sampling, I didn't want to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; use that term because it can create the confusion that something random is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; really going on.  Instead I covered the Bayesian issues in my sections on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Reflection Argument and Theory Confirmation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />What measure then are you talking about ? Bayesian probabilities are
<br />
relative, it is non-sense to talk about absolute measure.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; He goes on to mention rather briefly in passing his doomsday style
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; argument against QI, but not in detail.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think the argument is presented in full.  What part is missing?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />What happen to your &quot;you&quot; ?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Which is just as well, as that argument predicts that we should be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; neonatal infants!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I remembered that odd confusion of yours has been discussed on the list
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; before, so I Googled it.  I found a 2003 post by Saibal Mitra that covers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it.  I think I must have posted about it too, in the old days.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/everything-list.domain.name.hidden/msg04697.html">http://www.mail-archive.com/everything-list.domain.name.hidden/msg04697.html</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />Well if absolute measure was true at the beginning I should live in a hyper
<br />
galactical empire with billions and billions human being... it's not the
<br />
case. Or even better I should not even age and live forever in a crowded
<br />
place.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;... once you take into account the possibility of dying then you will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; see a decrease. But ignoring that, the measure should be conserved. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure for being in a particular state at age 30 should be much smaller
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than the measure for being in a particular state at age 4, but after
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; summation over all possible states you can be in, you should find that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; total measure is conserved.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Suppose you differentiate into N states, then on average each has 1/N of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your original measure.  I guess that's why you think the measure decreases.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  But the sum of the measures is N/N of the original.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is trivially obvious so I saw no reason to mention it explicitly in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the paper.  If there are people other than Russell with the same confusion,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then I may add it in.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; He also mentions Tegmark's amoeba croaks argument, which is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; actually an argument against QI, but rather a discussion of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; what QI might actually mean.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I quoted Tegmark verbatim.  He says &quot;my brain cells will gradually give out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (indeed, that's already started happening...) so that I keep feeling
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-aware, but less and less so, the final &quot;death&quot; being quite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anti-climactic, sort of like when an amoeba croaks.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'Final death' - those are his words, not mine.  You may not agree with him,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but I don't see how you can deny that he is arguing against QI.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The discussion on amnesia and personal identity is very relevant, as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perhaps people will realize that personal idenity is not well defined and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the whole QS/QI thing doesn't make any sense.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
I agree with you here. As long as I don't have any convincing argument that
<br />
I could be me without my memories, I equate personnal identity with
<br />
memories.
<br />
<br /><br />Regards,
<br />
Quentin
