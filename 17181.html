2009/8/7 Bruno Marchal &lt;marchal.domain.name.hidden&gt;:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If it isn;t RITSIAR, it cannot be generating me. Mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; proofs only prove mathematical &quot;existence&quot;, not onltolgical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; existence. For a non-Platonist , 23 &quot;exists&quot; mathematically,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but is not RITSIAR. The same goes for the UD
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Is an atom RITSIAR? Is a quark RITSIAR?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; If current physics is correct.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then it is not &quot;RITSIAR&quot; in the sense of the discussion with David.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Real in the sense that &quot;I&quot; am real. is ambiguous.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Either the &quot;I&quot; refers to my first person, and then I have ontological
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certainty.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As I said on FOR, I can conceive that I wake up and realize that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quark, planet, galaxies and even my body were not real. I cannot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conceive that I wake up and realize that my consciousness is not real.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ontological first person does not need an &quot;IF this or that theory is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correct&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You are reifying theoretical constructions.
</em><br />
<br />I think need to take a hard line on RITSIAR.  I feel that the key lies
<br />
in what Bruno terms the certainty of the ontological first person
<br />
(OFP): i.e. the sine qua non of reality as it is uniquely available to
<br />
us.  Since this is inescapably the foundation of any and all
<br />
judgements whatsoever, it is simultaneously both the both point of
<br />
departure and the 'what-is-to-be-explained' of RITSIAR.  In this light
<br />
it becomes self-evident that any and all explanatory entities -
<br />
physical, computational, or whatever - are severely restricted to the
<br />
domain of epistemology.  IOW - as Bruno says above - they are
<br />
theoretical constructions.
<br />
<br />So far so obvious.  But - as has again been recognised immemorially -
<br />
solipsism is a dead-end and hence we seek a theory to capture the
<br />
relation between the OFP and its environment.  But immediately we are
<br />
faced with the notorious 'explanatory gap', and it seems to me that
<br />
its most precise expression is in the gap between ontology and
<br />
epistemology.  Indeed, what conceivable strategy could raise these
<br />
theoretical constructions - to which the OFP uniquely lends existence
<br />
- to the ontological certainty of their host?  Is there a coherent way
<br />
to conceive what it could mean to *be* a theoretical entity (as
<br />
opposed to postulating or observing one)?  There is something
<br />
quintessential that stubbornly eludes capture, because epistemological
<br />
access never tells us what an entity *is* - only what can be
<br />
ascertained of its 'externalised' properties.  And lest we be tempted
<br />
to accept the sum of these properties as exhausting 'existence', we
<br />
need only turn to the self-evident corrective of the OFP.
<br />
<br />So the gap must remain, and I think that now I see why Bruno appeals
<br />
simply to the 'ordinary' mathematical sense of existence - because
<br />
COMP, under this analysis, is an epistemological schema, and its
<br />
entities are theoretical constructions.  Hence the question of jumping
<br />
the ontological gap is in abeyance, perhaps permanently, but in any
<br />
case in the realm of faith.  And if this is true for COMP, then
<br />
mutatis mutandis it is true for physics.  It's no use appealing to
<br />
notions of 'what it's like to be a brain' - nor what it's like to be a
<br />
COMP-quale - because we can never say that it is 'like anything to be'
<br />
the stuff of epistemology. Hence we must see our theorising and
<br />
observing - in physical, computational, or whatever terms - *in
<br />
relation* to ontological certainty, not as constitutive of it.  This
<br />
necessarily weakens what can be ascertained by theory or by
<br />
observation, but at least keeps us honest.
<br />
<br />The unavoidable consequence of the foregoing is that atoms, quarks and
<br />
numbers cannot be RITSIAR.  Rather, they stand in some theoretical
<br />
relation to RITSIAR, but strictly on the epistemological side of the
<br />
explanatory gap.  They are 'real as far as theory takes us', or if
<br />
further jargon is unavoidable: RAFATTU.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; The point is just that IF you survive &quot;in the RITSIAR&quot; sense, with a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; digital (even material, if you want) brain, then materiality has to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; retrieved by coherence or gluing property of immaterial computation,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; or there is an error in the UD Argument.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It is not clear what you mean by that. If I am transferred from a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; phsycial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; brain into a physcial computer, physicalism is unscathed. Your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; argument
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; against physcialism is that is  unnecessary because something else
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is doing the work --
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My argument is not that. From what you say, I infer that you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand the seven first steps of the UD-Argument.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You seem to have a problem with the 8th step, which is the step
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; showing that no &quot;work&quot; is needed at all. The usual number relations do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the work, and this without any need to reify them.
</em><br />
<br />See above.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But you have to assume Platonism to get your UDA, so you have to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; assume Platonism to refute physicalism. Without that assumption, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; rest doesn't follow.. It is step 0.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Do I need platonism to believe in the existence of prime numbers? I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; need only the amount of arithmetical realism for saying that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (mathematical) machine x stop or doesn't stop on input y. This is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; enough for the computational supervenience. And physical supervenience
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does not work, as the step 08 of UDA shows.
</em><br />
<br />And again.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is a relief for me to see that you did look at the papers, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; realise I do not postulate platonism, only realism. So now you have to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attribute this assumption as an implicit assumption. I'm afraid that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such an implicit assumption exists only in your imagination.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You reify a physical primitive reality to instantiate consciousness,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and you attribute me a reification of the numbers to get the same, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the point of step 8 is to show that such a reification, be it with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter or number, cannot work.
</em><br />
<br />My argument against the *physical* instantiation of a computational
<br />
mind (i.e. in any non-eliminative sense) rests on the claim that the
<br />
very arbitrariness of possible physical instantiations of a given
<br />
computation (cf Hofstadter) violates the criterion of direct
<br />
supervention on *specific* physical entities and relations from which
<br />
a class of emergent phenomena inherits physical - as opposed to merely
<br />
mental (and hence egregiously question-begging) - stability.
<br />
Naturally, all this is per physics as ordinarily understood.
<br />
Tolerating such a violation is tantamount to accepting (and this is
<br />
notoriously claimed by Hofstadter et al) that *any* arbitrarily
<br />
assembled set of physical entities deemed to be in the required
<br />
'functional' relation (e.g. - famously - in an anthill) necessarily
<br />
stabilises exactly the same 'mental state'.  AFAICS this is by itself
<br />
quite sufficient to reveal such a 'mind' as intrinsically unphysical -
<br />
and a fortiori un-RITSIAR.
<br />
<br />My argument assumes, however, that - per physicalism - a running
<br />
computation (as opposed to its specification) necessarily requires
<br />
*some* physical activity to transform inputs to outputs (e.g. in terms
<br />
of logic gates).  Step 8, however, seems to take a step beyond this by
<br />
proposing that a running computation can take the form of (as opposed
<br />
to merely being described by) a machine *state*: i.e. without the
<br />
requirement of activity.  But in precisely what sense can such a
<br />
'stopped' state (i.e. still within purely physical terms of reference)
<br />
be regarded as a 'running' computation, and hence - per computational
<br />
theory of mind - as evocative of temporal experience?  And in any
<br />
case, in what way is step 8 intended to extend intuition beyond my own
<br />
argument, which - as I have tried to show - also elicits the insight
<br />
that the direct supervention of 'functional' relations on functions
<br />
themselves - not on their arbitrarily-defined physical tokens - is
<br />
central to the recovery of 'mind' from computation.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You talk like if we knew that a primitive physical ontology exists,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but we don't know that, and the seven first step are neutral on that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You are the one insisting that for consciousness to exist, we need a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical ontology. But the step 8 shows that with comp such a physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ontology, or any special ontology is spurious.
</em><br />
<br />And again, the onto-epistemological gap.
