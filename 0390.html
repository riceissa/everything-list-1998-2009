<br />The fact that different people have wildly different intuitions about this
<br />
is a good reason not to rely too heavily on your own intuition. My own
<br />
decision to draw the line at binary strings is based on the fact that
<br />
there is good reason why nothing simpler can give rise to consciousness
<br />
(nothing simpler can contain information), while there doesn't seem to be
<br />
any reason why binary strings can't give rise to consciousness. If you
<br />
know such a reason, you should explain it. If you don't then you should
<br />
consider the possibility that your intuition is flawed. (BTW there is
<br />
reason to expect that one's intuition about this is likely to be flawed. 
<br />
After all having a good intuition about what abstract objects can be
<br />
conscious and what can't is not a significant evolutionary advantage in
<br />
the environment our ancestors faced.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	There are very likely telltale signs that a neuron has recently
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; been firing, which is just as good in your proposal.  But suppose it's an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; AI with non-volatile memory.  It would still have experiences when turned
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; off, or just stored on a CD, in your proposal.
</em><br />
<br />I agree in the AI case, the CD containing the AI's state will contribute
<br />
to its measure. However I do not see this as more counterintuitive than
<br />
your own proposal, where something similar happens if you program a
<br />
computer to repeatly load the AI's state from the CD and then run the AI
<br />
algorithm for a few clock cycles.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	You obviously don't need to replace proteins and DNA, just the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; neural net.
</em><br />
<br />I meant what are you going to use as the evolutionary mechanism?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	So where are we going to get that authoritative estimate?  I don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; really know any computer scientists, though NYU has them of course.  It
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would have to be someone interested, but not so interested as to take sides.
</em><br />
<br />It's going to be difficult to find an appropriate authority. This person
<br />
would have to be an expert in computer science, physics, chemistry,
<br />
biology, and neurology.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	Again, I'm not seeing it the same way as you.  You still have not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; answered my question: are you proposing that the program must print out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the conscious part of the string at the beginning of the tape, then erase 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the rest of the program?  Otherwise it is still a substring.  
</em><br />
<br />No I'm adopting the standard definition of a prefix machine (see Li and
<br />
Vitanyi) which has seperate input and output tapes. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the fact that it is surrounded by other bits in the orthogonal direction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from the other Turing machines?
</em><br />
<br />But the concept of surround doesn't make sense if the spacial dimension in
<br />
the orthorgonal direction is continuous. You can't even give a
<br />
definition for the values of the neighboring bits of a given bit. It's
<br />
like asking what are the two real numbers surrounding PI.
