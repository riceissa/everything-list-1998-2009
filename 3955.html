</em><br />
<br />OK, let us assume for the sake of argument that we should be 
<br />
overwhelmingly likely to be living in one of these &quot;time-reversed 
<br />
cycles&quot; (which I distinguish from &quot;bounces&quot; back to a Big Bang state, 
<br />
the more common view of cycles).
<br />
<br />By the same Bayesian reasoning, it is overwhelmingly likely that any 
<br />
observer would find himself in a TRC in which other parts of the 
<br />
universe eventually visible to him (with telescopes) are &quot;incompletely 
<br />
reversed.&quot; Let me give a scenario to make the point clearer.
<br />
<br />It is 1860. Telescopes exist, but are still crude. The Milky Way is only 
<br />
known to be a nebula, a swirl of stars. The existence of galaxies other 
<br />
than our own is unknown.
<br />
<br />Professor Ludwig calls together several of us friends (perhaps on the 
<br />
Vienna version of the Everything List) and outlines his theory.
<br />
<br />&quot;We are very probably in a recurrence phase of the Universe, where a 
<br />
worn-out, gaseous phase of the Universe has randomly arranged us into 
<br />
this low-entropy, highly-ordered state we find ourselves in today. It 
<br />
took a very long time for this to happen, perhaps 1,000,000,000,000,000 
<br />
million years, but here we are.&quot;
<br />
<br />(Reactions of his audience not presented here...maybe in the novel some 
<br />
distant version of me will write.)
<br />
<br />&quot;All that we see around us, our Sun, the planets, even the gas balls we 
<br />
call stars, were formed thusly out of a random rearrangement of gas 
<br />
molecules. My young mathematician friend in Paris, Msr. Poincare, says 
<br />
this sort of recurrence is inevitable in any sufficiently rich phase 
<br />
space.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Now, if this is correct, it is overwhelmingly likely that of all of the 
<br />
time-reversed cycles, or TRCs, the TRC we find ourselves in will have 
<br />
only reversed time (or created low entropy structures) in our particular 
<br />
region of the Universe. In a hugely greater amount of time, even more 
<br />
regions of the Universe we will be soon be able to observe would be 
<br />
subject to this reversal, but the times involved are even more hideously 
<br />
enormous than the very long times needed to create our own TRC pocket in 
<br />
which we find ourselves.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;So, overwhelmingly, observers who draw the conclusions I have reached 
<br />
will find themselves in a Universe where only a region sufficient to 
<br />
have &quot;built&quot; them and their supporting civilization will have the low 
<br />
entropy order of a TRC.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Thus, gentlemen, by a principle I call &quot;falsifiability,&quot; I predict that 
<br />
when the new telescopes being built now in Paris and London become 
<br />
operational, we will see nothing around our region of the Universe 
<br />
except gas and disorder.&quot;
<br />
<br />And, of course, within his remaining lifetime Professor Ludwig was 
<br />
astonished to learn that distant galaxies looking very much like nearby 
<br />
galaxies existed, that if a Poincare recurrence had in fact happened, it 
<br />
must have happened encompassing truly vast swathes of the Universe...in 
<br />
fact, the entire visible Universe, reaching out ten billion light years 
<br />
in all directions. The unlikelihood that an observer (affected causally 
<br />
only by events within a few light years of his home planet) would find 
<br />
himself in one of the comparatively-rare TRCs which affected such a big 
<br />
chunk of the Universe convinced Professor Ludwig that his theory was 
<br />
wrong, that the new ideas just being proposed of an initial singularity, 
<br />
weird as that might be, better explained the visible Universe.
<br />
<br />--Tim May (who also thinks the difficulty of time-reversing things like 
<br />
ripples in a pond, radiation in general, and all sorts of other things 
<br />
makes the Poincare recurrence a useful topological dynamics idea, but 
<br />
one of utterly no cosmological significance)
