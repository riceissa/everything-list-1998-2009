<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Lee,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It’s perhaps unfortunate that we are arguing about this because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think we basically agree on what Derek Parfit has called a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reductionist theory of personal identity (in his 1984 book
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Reasons and Persons&quot;;
</em><br />
<br />Yes, I was very relieved to have read portions of that book.
<br />
Very few people I knew---and they, only because I had talked
<br />
them into it---accepted the theory that you and I are espousing.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; apparently &quot;reductionist&quot; was not in wide use as a term of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; abuse back then).
</em><br />
<br />Oh yes it was; I think that it got even worse before it got better.
<br />
But even today, it may be that you have to come to an &quot;Everything&quot;
<br />
list, or other forum where the skeptical and well-read hang out.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I like to emphasize the instantaneous or granular nature of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; personhood not because we literally die and are resurrected every
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moment, as those words are commonly understood, but because it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would make no significant difference to our stream of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness or sense of self if in fact this were the case.
</em><br />
<br />Why are you so sure that there is a fact of the matter?
<br />
<br />Insofar as facts are concerned, there is a lot of agreement that
<br />
you are the same person you were yesterday. I'm not sure why we
<br />
need to redefine what is normally meant.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; How, where and when the mental states are implemented is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; irrelevant and unknowable from a first person perspective,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unless it actually affects the content of the mental states.
</em><br />
<br />Oh, well if you mean to be talking about mental states, then
<br />
I cannot disagree with anything you've said. But if we are
<br />
trying to talk about &quot;people&quot; or personhood, it's evident
<br />
that many mental states correspond to one person.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hal Finney in his recent thread on teleportation thought
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiments disagrees with the above view. He suggests
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that it is possible for  a subject to apparently undergo
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; successful teleportation, in that the individual walking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; out of the receiving station has all the appropriate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mental and physical attributes in common with the individual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entering the transmitting station, but in reality not survive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the procedure. I have difficulty understanding this, as it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seems to me that the subject has survived by definition.
</em><br />
<br />Well, if you've characterized his views correctly, then he's
<br />
not in agreement with you, me, and Derek Parfit. What might
<br />
be fun to explore is how desperate some people would have to
<br />
be in order to teleport (or perhaps how lucrative the
<br />
opportunity?).  Also, I suppose that if you confided to them
<br />
that this was happening to them all the time thousands of
<br />
times per second, they'd still have some unfathomable reason
<br />
not to go near a teleporter.
<br />
<br />Finally, if we had such devices, soon only the real old fogeys
<br />
and a few peculiar philosophers wouldn't make steady use of them.
<br />
<br />Lee
