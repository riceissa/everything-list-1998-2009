I once read an article in, I believe, Time Magazine, about the relatively
<br />
new field of &quot;neurotheology&quot; which investigates what goes on in the brain
<br />
during ecstatic states, etc.  One suggestion that intrigued me was that it
<br />
may be possible that in such a state, and I believe that schizophrenics were
<br />
also mentioned, that the brain is malfunctioning in such a way as to allow
<br />
it to perceive states of reality other than that which the normal brain
<br />
would perceive.  In other words, the &quot;antenna&quot; (brain) is picking-up signals
<br />
that are usually beyond the scope of the normal brain.  I wondered if anyone
<br />
could comment on this, and if there was any reason to even entertain the
<br />
thought that perhaps some people have passed through a crack in the division
<br />
between our universe or dimension, into perhaps another?  I read this
<br />
several years ago and wish that I could recall the details of the article,
<br />
but I don't have it anymore.

<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Russell,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To be fair, I should elaborate on my earlier post about amnesics and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; psychotics. If I consider the actual cases I have seen, arguably they do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have *some* sense of the passage of time. Taking the first example, people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with severe Korsakoff Syndrome (due to chronic alcohol abuse) appear to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; completely incapable of laying down new memories. If you enter their room
</em><br />
to
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perform some uncomfortable medical procedure and they become annoyed with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you, all you have to do is step outside for a moment, then step back
</em><br />
inside,
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and they are all smiles again, so you can have another go at the
</em><br />
procedure,
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and repeat this as many times as you want. While you are actually in their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sight, however, they do recognise that you are the same person from moment
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to moment, and they do make the connection between the needle you are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sticking into them and the subsequent pain, causing them to become annoyed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at you. So they do have a sense of time, even if only for a few seconds.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The second example, the disorganised schizophrenic, is somewhat more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; complex. There is a continuum from mild to extreme disorganisation, and at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the extreme end, it can be very difficult to get any sense of what the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person is thinking, although it is quite easy to get a sense of what they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are feeling and it would be very difficult to maintain a belief that they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are not actually conscious (you really have to see this for yourself to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand it). Usually, even the most unwell of these patients give some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indirect indication that they maintain some sense of time. For example, if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you hold out a glass of water, they will reach for it and drink from it,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which suggests that they may have a theory about the future, and how they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; might influence it to their advantage. Occasionally, however - and I have
</em><br />
to
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; confess I have not actually tried the experiment - there are patients who
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seem incapable of even as simple (one could say near-reflexive) a task as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; grabbing a glass of water. With treatment, almost all these people
</em><br />
improve,
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and it is interesting to ask them what was happening during these periods.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Firstly, it is interesting that they actually have any recollection. It is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as if the CPU was defective, but the data was still written to the hard
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; drive, to be analysed later. They might explain that everything seemed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fragmented, so that although they could see and hear things, the visual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stimuli did not form recognisable objects and the auditory stimuli did not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; form recognisable words or other sounds. Furthermore, the various
</em><br />
perceptual
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; data seemed to run into each other spatially, so that it was not possible
</em><br />
to
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distinguish background from foreground, significant from insignificant.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Catatonic patients, on the other hand, may (later, when better) describe a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; state of total inertia, being stuck in the present moment, unable to move
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; either physically or mentally, unable to even imagine a possibility of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; change from the present state, aware of everything going on around them as
</em><br />
a
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; kind of extended simultaneity.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; I think you missed my point about the amnesic and psychotic patients,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; is not that they are clear thinkers, but that they are conscious
</em><br />
despite
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; disability which impairs their perception of time. Your post raises an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;As I said before, I think this is a valuable contribution, but not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;something I know how to deal with at this point in time. Presently,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;these psychotic patients account for only a fraction of conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;observers (assuming they are conscious as you say they are). Quantum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Mechanics only requires that most observers have their own time like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;domain, not that all of them do. I'm still not convinced that TIME
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;isn't a necessary property of observerhood, as opposed to a likely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;contingent one, but there the debate stagnates, as I'm not an expert
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;in psychiatry.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;I did want to throw one more po thought. Even though standard QM is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;based on continuous time, nowhere does TIME require time to be
</em><br />
experienced
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;continuously. It could just as easily be the Cantor set, say. Might not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;the time experienced by these psychotic people be a fractal set like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;that, or are you saying they have absolutely no sense of time at all?
