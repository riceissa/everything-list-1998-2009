<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bruno has made similar statements and I do not understand how this is

true. I have it from multiple sources that this is not true. Do you recall

the famous statement by Richard Feynman regarding the &quot;exponential slowdown&quot;

of classical system attempting to simulate QM systems?  Let me quote from a
<br />
paper by Karl Svozil et al:  <a href="http://tph.tuwien.ac.at/~svozil/publ/embed.htm">http://tph.tuwien.ac.at/~svozil/publ/embed.htm</a>

4  Summary
<br />
We have reviewed several options for a classical ``understanding'' of
<br />
quantum mechanics. Particular emphasis has been given to techniques for
<br />
embedding quantum universes into classical ones. The term ``embedding'' is
<br />
formalized here as usual. That is, an embedding is a mapping of the entire
<br />
set of quantum observables into a (bigger) set of classical observables such
<br />
that different quantum observables correspond to different classical ones
<br />
(injectivity).
<br />
The term ``observables'' here is used for quantum propositions, some of
<br />
which (the complementary ones) might not be co-measurable, see Gudder [14].
<br />
It might therefore be more appropriate to conceive these ``observables'' as
<br />
``potential observables.'' After a particular measurement has been chosen,
<br />
some of these observables are actually determined and others (the
<br />
complementary ones) become ``counterfactuals'' by quantum mechanical means;
<br />
cf. Schrödinger's catalogue of expectation values [42]. For classical
<br />
observables, there is no distinction between ``observables'' and
<br />
``counterfactuals,'' because everything can be measured precisely, at least
<br />
in principle.
<br />
<br />We should mention also a caveat. The relationship between the states of a
<br />
quantum universe and the states of a classical universe into which the
<br />
former one is embedded is beyond the scope of this paper.
<br />
<br />As might have been suspected, it turns out that, in order to be able to
<br />
perform the mapping from the quantum universe into the classical one
<br />
consistently, important structural elements of the quantum universe have to
<br />
be sacrificed:
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;·
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Since per definition, the quantum propositional calculus is
<br />
nondistributive (nonboolean), a straightforward embedding which preserves
<br />
all the logical operations among observables, irrespective of whether or not
<br />
they are co-measurable, is impossible. This is due to the quantum mechanical
<br />
feature of complementarity.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;·
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;One may restrict the preservation of the logical operations to be valid
<br />
only among mutually orthogonal propositions. In this case it turns out that
<br />
again a consistent embedding is impossible, since no consistent meaning can
<br />
be given to the classical existence of ``counterfactuals.'' This is due to
<br />
the quantum mechanical feature of contextuality. That is, quantum
<br />
observables may appear different, depending on the way by which they were
<br />
measured (and inferred).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;·
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;In a further step, one may abandon preservation of lattice operations such
<br />
as not and the binary and and or operations altogether. One may merely
<br />
require the preservation of the implicational structure (order relation). It
<br />
turns out that, with these provisos, it is indeed possible to map quantum
<br />
universes into classical ones. Stated differently, definite values can be
<br />
associated with elements of physical reality, irrespective of whether they
<br />
have been measured or not. In this sense, that is, in terms of more
<br />
``comprehensive'' classical universes (the hidden parameter models), quantum
<br />
mechanics can be ``understood.''
<br />
***
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What this paper points out is that it is impossible to completely embed
<br />
a &quot;QM universe&quot; in a classical one. If, as you say, it is possible to
<br />
simulate quantum computer or physical system by a classical computer, then
<br />
we find outselves in an odd predicament.
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me quote from some other papers to reinforce my argument.

1. INTRODUCTION
<br />
<br />For over fifty years the Turing machine model of computation has defined
<br />
<br />what it means to ''compute'' something; the foundations of the modern
<br />
<br />theory of computing are based on it. Computers are reading text, recognizing
<br />
<br />speech, and robots are driving themselves across Mars. Yet this
<br />
<br />exponential race will not produce solutions to many intractable and
<br />
undecidable
<br />
<br />problems. Is there any alternative? Indeed, quantum computing
<br />
<br />offers one such alternative (see Ref. 7, 10, 11, 23, 35). To date, quantum
<br />
<br />computing has been very successful in ''beating'' Turing machines in the
<br />
<br />race of solving intractable problems, with Shor and Grover algorithms
<br />
<br />achieving the most impressive successes; the progress in quantum hardware
<br />
<br />is also impressive. Is there any hope for quantum computing to challenge the
<br />
<br />Turing barrier, i.e., to solve an undecidable problem, to compute an
<br />
<br />uncomputable function? According to Feynman's argument (see Ref. 20, a
<br />
<br />paper reproduced also in Ref. 25, regarding the possibility of simulating a
<br />
<br />quantum system on a (probabilistic) Turing machine4) the answer is negative.
<br />

<br />We also have:

<br />A stronger no-cloning theorem
<br />
Authors: Richard Jozsa (University of Bristol UK)
<br />
Comments: 4 pages. An error in version 1 corrected. Further interpretational
<br />
comments added
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;It is well known that (non-orthogonal) pure states cannot be cloned so one
<br />
may ask: how much or what kind of additional (quantum) information is needed
<br />
to supplement one copy of a quantum state in order to be able to produce two
<br />
copies of that state by a physical operation? For classical information, no
<br />
supplementary information is required. However for pure quantum
<br />
(non-orthogonal) states, we show that the supplementary information must
<br />
always be as large as it can possibly be i.e. the clone must be able to be
<br />
generated from the additional information alone, independently of the first
<br />
(given) copy.
<br />
***
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could go on and on.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So in theory, even if human minds are quanum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mechanical, we can simulate a complete human being from conception to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; adulthood in a classical computer, and then copy him to another classical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computer, so the no-cloning theorem doesn't prevent copying of minds.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Besides, the no-cloning theorem only says that there's no method for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; duplicating arbitrary quantum systems in such a way that no statistical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; test can tell the difference between the original and the copy. There is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no evidence that the information that can't be copied are crucial to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; workings of a human mind. I think current theories of how the brain works
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have its information stored in macroscopic states such as neuron
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; connections and neurotransmitter concentrations, which can be copied.
</em><br />
<br /><br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There do exist strong arguments that the &quot;macroscopic state&quot; of neurons
<br />
is not completely classical and thus some degree of QM entanglement is
<br />
involved. But hand waving arguments aside, I would really like to understand
<br />
how you and Bruno (and others), given the proof and explanations contained
<br />
in these above mentioned papers and others, maintain the idea that &quot;any
<br />
quantum computer or physical system can be simulated by a classical
<br />
computer.&quot;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Kindest regards,
<br />
<br />Stephen
