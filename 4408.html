<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you will get an apple whether the coin falls heads or tails.  This is

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very obvious even without being expressed in the mathematical form that

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; decision theory uses.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Wei suggested that in the context of a many-worlds universe (not just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the quantum MWI but even for a broader set of possibilities), you might
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not make this same decision.  You know that when the coin flips, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe is going to effectively branch and both possibilities are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; going
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to be actualized.  Let us suppose that in addition to slightly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; preferring
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; apples to oranges, you have a strong value preference for diversity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You like variety and you dislike having everything the same everywhere.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In that case, you might rationally choose to receive an apple on heads
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but an orange on tails.  While this slightly reduces your average
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pleasure level in terms of tasting the fruit, this could be more than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; compensated by your increased pleasure at knowing that you are enjoying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; diverse experiences in the two worlds.
</em><br />
<br />Accepting that I believe in the MWI (_really_ believe, not just believe 
<br />
in the formalism), I already know that all possible decisions, all 
<br />
diverse forks, are already unfolding in the multitude of forking paths. 
<br />
Even if I &quot;decide&quot; not to alter my rational choice for the fruit, there 
<br />
are countless other mes making every other possible choice, including 
<br />
10^50 or more mes who wire up the coin toss to explode an H-bomb &quot;just 
<br />
to make things interesting in that sheaf of branches.&quot;
<br />
<br />(The awkward word &quot;mes&quot; is the plural of &quot;me.&quot; )
<br />
<br />But in this, the only universe I will ever, ever have contact with, I 
<br />
optimize as best I can. And I assume all the myriad mes are doing the 
<br />
same in their universes, forever disconnected from mine.
<br />
<br />Someone here on this list asked me in private mail if I didn't take 
<br />
some amount of comfort from the MWI, knowing that versions of me were 
<br />
surviving and thriving in other branches regardless of what happened to 
<br />
me in this branch.
<br />
<br />No, I told him, while there may &quot;be&quot; other such paths (and I can argue 
<br />
there already are, via modal logic, without any quantum mechanics 
<br />
involved), these other paths are unreachable to me and may as well not 
<br />
exist at all.
<br />
<br />Nor do I find despair in the notion that there may be (_are_, if MWI is 
<br />
right) other universes in which I am a mass murder, in which I killed 
<br />
myself 12 years ago, in which the Earth was hit by a comet two 
<br />
centuries ago, in which a plague will be released next year and will 
<br />
wipe out all humans.
<br />
<br />Until some evidence of cross-path communication or travel or 
<br />
interaction is found, the MWI gives the expected result, that I am in 
<br />
this world and no others, for all intents and purposes.
<br />
<br />By the way, I don't dispute at all that having a belief in MWI might 
<br />
very well cause behavior changes, even the change you and Wei have 
<br />
given as an example. Besides this change, of picking a less desirable 
<br />
fruit in your example so as to &quot;increase diversity,&quot; I can imagine that 
<br />
some people who strongly believe in MWI may take _fewer_ risks (to 
<br />
maximize the number of their surviving dopplegangers in other 
<br />
branches), may take _more_ risks, may do things of various kinds which 
<br />
they think will somehow influence or be influenced by the reality of 
<br />
MWI.
<br />
<br />But the same may be said of beliefs of all sorts, including beliefs in 
<br />
an afterlife (fewer risks, more risks, fatalism, etc.), beliefs in 
<br />
cryonics, beliefs in the I Ching or magic, and so on. Most religious 
<br />
people behave quite a bit differently than I do. The Muslims who 
<br />
believe their martyrdom will bring them infinite reward in an afterlife 
<br />
are but the most obvious examples of how belief alters behavior.
<br />
<br />A strong belief in the MWI, at a basic level, would probably be 
<br />
sufficiently strong to alter psychological states in various ways. The 
<br />
hard part is finding any real rational argument for what those 
<br />
alterations might be.
<br />
<br />As it now stands, I will not be standing in front of any machine guns 
<br />
to test the MWI, nor will I be choosing different stocks to invest in 
<br />
so as to support &quot;multidiversity.&quot; For all intents and purposes, this 
<br />
is the world I am in.
<br />
<br />I'll be interested to see if any more compelling examples can be 
<br />
produced.
<br />
<br />A brief comment:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So here is an example where belief in multiple worlds could lead a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rational person to behave differently than belief in a single world.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For this effect to occur, I think our preferences in the many-worlds
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; case have to depend on relations between the worlds, rather than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; independently on conditions in each world.  We're not just acting to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; maximize the expected outcome in each world averaged across all of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we're acting to maximize the utility of the &quot;big picture&quot;, the entire
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; set of worlds affected by our acts, considered as a whole.
</em><br />
<br />Why would there be any reason to try to maximize the utility of this 
<br />
&quot;big picture&quot;?
<br />
<br />For those of us who don't even strive for &quot;the greatest good for the 
<br />
greatest number&quot; in a single-branch universe, why would striving for 
<br />
more good (whatever &quot;good&quot; is) in 10^300+ branches be interesting or 
<br />
important?
<br />
<br />In any case, if MWI is correct, then there is every type of universe 
<br />
imaginable, consistent only with the laws of physics and math, and 
<br />
every decision for the good or the bad or whatever has been made 
<br />
countless times in countless ways. By any calculus of the multiverse, 
<br />
the sheaf of universes in which Tim May or Hal Finney even exist is of 
<br />
measure approaching zero.
<br />
<br />Meanwhile, I'm _here_.
