Hal,
<br />
<br />I didn't see the whole post. So here is a sequel.
<br />
<br /><br />At 11:01 28/07/04 -0700, Hal Finney wrote:

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You are right. It is powerful, but rather fair also.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; let us define a machine to be stable if that is the case. When the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; machine believes Bx the machine believes x.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;HAL: So in my terms, I can add two axioms:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;0a. x implies Bx
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;0b. Bx implies x
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The first is the axiom of normality, and the second is the axiom of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;stability.
</em><br />
<br /><br />No, I stop you right here. You redo the error. No problem,
<br />
I still do it 1 or 2 times a day. And, would have I not made it
<br />
persistently in my youth, I would be much farther.
<br />
You must be very careful reading a proposition in english,
<br />
and then translating in the machine language.
<br />
<br />Your axiom 0a says that the truth of x implies the truth of Bx.
<br />
It is really the usual implication:
<br />
<br />x implies Bx
<br />
1     1       1
<br />
1     0       0
<br />
0     1       1
<br />
0     1       0
<br />
<br />Would it be true. Then would x be true, Bx would be true too.
<br />
&quot;x implies Bx&quot; means either x is false or Bx is true. It really means that
<br />
the machine is truth complete, that is omniscient, that is ...
<br />
the contrary of the consequence of Godel theorem.
<br />
It is also the reason why i use generally &quot;-&gt;&quot; instead of &quot;implies&quot;.
<br />
Ah, perhaps that is the root of the confusion.
<br />
<br />Same remark for your axiom 0b. Bx implies x, or better, Bx -&gt; x,
<br />
means that the machine is accurate. It is built in such a way that
<br />
if Bx is true (that is if the machine believe x, then x is true).
<br />
<br />We can sum up:
<br />
0a = the machine believes all the truth.
<br />
0b = the machine believes only the truth.
<br />
<br />(And so new exercise: what happens with complete and /or
<br />
accurate machine of type 1 when they meet the Knight saying
<br />
the usual proposition?)
<br />
<br />Normality and stability are much weaker notion:
<br />
A machine is normal means: if the machine ever believe p then
<br />
sooner or later the machine will believe Bp.
<br />
Now, please, just translate *carefully* this in the language of the machine.
<br />
Let us do it by stage:
<br />
the machine believe p          is       Bp
<br />
the machine believe Bp        is       BBp
<br />
if the machine believes p then the machine believes Bp
<br />
becomes
<br />
Bp implies BBp, or perhaps better:  Bp -&gt; BBp
<br />
<br />The same for stability, it will gives BBp -&gt; Bp.
<br />
<br />Summing up:
<br />
<br />Stability is:  BBp -&gt; Bp
<br />
Normality is: Bp -&gt; BBp
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I don't find these words to be particularly appropriate,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;by the way, but I suppose they are traditional.
</em><br />
<br /><br />More or less traditionnal. Normality is very traditionnal, although
<br />
in slightly strict or broader sense. Stability is less tarditionnal,
<br />
but Smullyan uses that term. Anyway, it is not logically relevant ...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;It also seems to me that these axioms, which define the behavior of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the letter B, don't particularly well represent the concept of belief.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The problem is that beliefs can be uncertain and don't follow the law
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the excluded middle.  If p is that there is life on Mars, then (p or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;~p) is true.  Either there's life there or there isn't.  But it's not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;true that (Bp or B~p).
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Be reassured. Our reasoner believes in the excluded middle:
<br />
<br />that is they believe in (x v -x).  In machine Lang.: B(x v -x),
<br />
but this will not imply (Bp or B~p)
<br />
<br />Unless your axiom 0a is true, but that will be impossible,
<br />
by Godel. No machine can be complete (except inconsistent one).
<br />
<br />I will read the rest at ease, but I think it follows from your
<br />
axioms 0a, and 0b, but 0a does not apply for any reasoner
<br />
who believes in arithmetic ...
<br />
The rest of your post is correct deduction, but with wrong
<br />
premise.
<br />
<br />When you said:
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Suppose for some proposition q the machine deduces it on step 117:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;117. q
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Does this mean that q is true?  No, it means that that the machine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;believes q.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Yes but the machine believes q is true, or assert q is true. The machine
<br />
is not asserting it believes true.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Does it mean that Bq is true?  Yes.  Bq is true, because Bq
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is a shorthand for saying that the machine believes q, and by definition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the machine believes something when it writes it down in its numbered
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;list.  We can see it right there, number 117.  So the machine believes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;q and Bq is true.  But q is not (necessarily) true.  The machine writing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;something down does not &quot;mean&quot; it is true.  By definition, it means the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;machine believes it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Consider a different example:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;191. Bp
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;What does this mean?  Does it mean that Bp is true?  No, it means that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;machine believes Bp, because by definition, what the machine writes down
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in its numbered list is what it believes.  Is BBp true?  Yes, it is true,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;because that says that the machine believes Bp, and that means that Bp
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is in the machine's numbered list, which it is, right there.  The machine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;believes Bp, but Bp is not (necessarily) true.  BBp is necessarily true.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Another example
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;207. p implies q
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;By the same reasoning, this does not mean that if p is true, then q
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is true.  It means that if the machine ever believes p (i.e. it writes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it down in its list of theorems), then it will believe q (i.e. it will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;eventually write down q in its list of theorems). The true statment is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that Bp implies Bq.  You can also (trivially) conclude B(p implies q).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But &quot;p implies q&quot; is not (necessarily) true.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Here you are incorrect again, ok, I diagnose that it is the
<br />
&quot;implies&quot; you have a problem of translation.
<br />
If at stage 207 the machine print &quot;p implies q&quot; it means the
<br />
machine believes (p-&gt;q), that is: that if p is true then q is true. The
<br />
machine does not mention any explicit believe in the sentence.
<br />
<br />Actually we never said that the machine believes something
<br />
like B(p implies q) implies (Bp implies Bq), which is what you say.
<br />
You are anticipating on the type 2 reasoner.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now we are ready for:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;8. t implies Bt
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It is not mean that &quot;t implies Bt&quot; is true, any more than &quot;207. p implies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;q&quot; was true.  What it means is that if the machine ever believes t, it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;will believe Bt.  Given that t means the native is a knight, it means
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that, as I wrote before, &quot;if I ever deduce he is a knight, I believe it&quot;,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;where I am the machine.  The true meaning is that Bt implies BBt.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So I don't see why you said that this was wrong, and that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Here you are mistaken. It is funny because you clearly see
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the mistake, given that you say 'attention  (t implies Bt) does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; not mean &quot;if he is a knight the I believe it&quot;. But of course (t implies Bt)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; *does* mean &quot;if he is a knight the I believe it&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;While it is true that, by itself, (t implies Bt) does mean &quot;if he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is a knight then I believe it&quot;, in the context of the machine, &quot;8. t
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;implies Bt&quot; doesn't mean that.  It means that the machine believes the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;implication, not that the implication is true.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Yes, but that's equivalent to B(p-&gt;q), meaning that for the machine
<br />
p-&gt;q has been proved. The machine is close for the modus ponens,
<br />
but is (not yet) supposed to know that.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You add it means only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (and here I add a slight correction) &quot;if I ever deduce he is a knight I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; will deduce I believe he is a knight&quot; which really is, in the machine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; language: (Bt implies BBt) instead of (t implies Bt).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Right, or as in my simpler example, when I wrote &quot;207. p implies q&quot; that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;truly means Bp implies Bq.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Not at all: it &quot;means&quot; B(p implies q).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; To be sure: a machine is normal if for any proposition p, if the machine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; believes p, it will believe Bp. But this is equivalent with saying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that for any proposition p, the proposition (Bp implies BBp) is true
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; *about* the machine.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Same remark for stability: you can say a machine is stable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; if all the propositions (BBp implies Bp) are true about the machine.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This does not mean the stable or normal machine will ever believe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; being stable or normal. You have (momentarily) confuse a proposition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; being true on a machine, and being believe by a machine.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I agree with everything here except the last sentence.  I don't see what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I have confused, or what is wrong with my derivation.  If you assume
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;both 0a. and 0b., meaning that I am both normal and stable, then the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;proof is correct, right?  If not, which step fails?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Oa means complete, and 0b means accurate.
<br />
Stable is (BBp -&gt; Bp)
<br />
and normal is (Bp -&gt; BBp)
<br />
<br />Hal, I think the confusion comes from the use of &quot;imply&quot; instead
<br />
of &quot;-&gt;&quot;. Sorry if I have not been clear. If you (or anyone else) has still
<br />
a problem, please ask. If possible by short post. We will have plenty
<br />
of occasion to be familiarized with that matter.
<br />
