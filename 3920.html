Hi Juergen,
<br />
<br />I don't know very well Solomonoff's work unfortunately.
<br />
But I know rather well the work by Putnam, Case and Smith, Royer,
<br />
Blum etc. in limiting inference identification theories, which are
<br />
part of colt too. (colt = computational learning theory = theoretical
<br />
artificial intelligence). A nice and rare book exists on the subject:
<br />
<br />S.Jain, D.Osherson, J.S.Royer, A.Sharma, 1999, Systems that Learn,
<br />
MIT Press.
<br />
<br /><br />Those works rely heavily on Kleene second recursion theorem.
<br />
In the long version of my thesis, I have used such colt-results to
<br />
motivate the  &quot;consciousness theory&quot; on which the reversal psycho/physics
<br />
is based. (Consciousness is seen as the result of instinctive anticipation
<br />
of  self-consistency). Unfortunately or fortunately (I don't know), the
<br />
general use of the second recursion theorem by Solovay in its proof of
<br />
the arithmetical completeness of the logic G and G* allowed me to
<br />
bypasse explicit use of both Kleene's theorem and colt results.
<br />
<br />But I agree with you of the general importance of theoretical
<br />
approaches in Inductive Inference theories.
<br />
<br />For the sake of others let me just define here what is, in Blum
<br />
Case and Smith approaches, an inductive inference machine (IIM). (Some
<br />
people tend to think it is impossible to define such a concept!).
<br />
<br />First let us define what it means to say a machine identifies
<br />
a phenomena. Let us (with comp) define a phenomenon by a total
<br />
(everywhere defined) computable function.
<br />
We will say that a machine identify a phenomenon f, if when
<br />
we present, one at a time but in *any* order, the f input-output, to
<br />
the machine M, M output (godel number code of) programs, and eventually
<br />
converges on a program for f. (That is the machines eventually
<br />
always output the same program).
<br />
<br />Apparently this is a rather stupid definition. Indeed *all* total
<br />
computable function are identifiable by a machine. For example, take
<br />
the factorial. The IIM which *always* output a code for factorial
<br />
identify trivially the factorial!
<br />
The interesting notion is the identification of a *class* of programs
<br />
or functions. What we have just seen is that any singleton class, like
<br />
{factorial}, {fibonacci}, etc. are identifiable.
<br />
Is the set {factorial, fibonacci} identifiable? Of course: by dovetailing!
<br />
The machine outputs programs for factorial and fibonacci, computes
<br />
them both by dovetailing, and stop to output one of them after the
<br />
first discrepancy.
<br />
For that reason, as Blum showed, any Recursively Enumerable (RE) class
<br />
of total function is easily identifiable. The class being RE, you can
<br />
build a dovetailer running their executions and tested the member
<br />
of the class. This is really a (non practical) dovetailing on the
<br />
search space.
<br />
Now any reader of [Diagonalisation 1: 
<br />
<a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m3079.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m3079.html</a>
<br />
Diagonalisation 1 (answers) <a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m3344.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m3344.html</a> ]
<br />
know that the set R of all code of total computable functions is not
<br />
RE. So the natural question is: does it exist a machine capable of
<br />
identifying any total computable function? Putnam Showed that such a
<br />
universal learning machine does not exist.
<br />
Case and Smith have then looked if a weakening of the identification
<br />
criterion can help. Suppose we make it possible to the machine to output
<br />
a program computing the code of the phenomenon f, but allowing that program
<br />
to make 0 or 1 mistake. Well if the &quot;or&quot; is non constructive, this works.
<br />
&quot;EX&quot; is the name of the collection of set of functions identifiable by a
<br />
machine, and EX1 is the corresponding name for the weakened criterion.
<br />
EXi: the same, where we allow 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or i errors (non-constructive
<br />
or: with constructive &quot;or&quot; the errors can always be recovered!) in the output
<br />
of the IIM.
<br />
EX*: the same but we allow a finite but undeterminate, number of errors.
<br />
Case and Smith showed that EX is strictly include in EX1, which is strictly
<br />
include in EX2, etc. The union of all EXi is itself strictly include in EX*.
<br />
Alas! R is still not in EX*.
<br />
But look! Let us allow the IIM to produce an infinite numbers (still one at
<br />
a time) of programs, and let us weakening the identification criterion by
<br />
just saying the IIM identify f, if, after some time it produces programs
<br />
(different one) computing f. (This is not the same as producing always
<br />
the same programs). Let BC be the collection of set of functions
<br />
identifiable by a machine in this new way. The crazy result is that
<br />
EX* is included in BC. And, with obvious notation, Case and Smith have
<br />
shown that BC is strictly include in BC1, itself st. incl. in BC2, etc.
<br />
Here also the union of all BCi is st. include in BC*.
<br />
And (the cake's cherry): R is included in BC*. In principle, there is
<br />
a universal learning machine. But this result is highly theoretical, full
<br />
of necessary non constructive existence ....
<br />
Still very enlightening for showing how cleverness (defined by the
<br />
bigness of identifiable classes of set of functions) is subtle.
<br />
There is also the NON-UNION theorem of BLUM and BLUM. In a nutshell,
<br />
the theorem say that there is something is *very* more (even non
<br />
computably more) clever than a anticipating machine! What? Answer:
<br />
two machines! And then 3 machines, 4 machines, etc...
<br />
The reason why I do not need to elaborate on this learning machine
<br />
theory, is that I need only the fact that G* is anticipable by the G
<br />
machine, and this follows trivially from the decidability of G*, which
<br />
follows from Solovay's work.
<br />
But I agree with Juergen. There is plenty of beautiful and
<br />
entertaining results in colt. There are a lot of identification
<br />
criteria the EX, BC like above, but also PEX (Popperian id), OCCAM sort
<br />
of identification, etc.

<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Physics is an inductive science. You try to find a law that matches

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Solomonoff's optimal but noncomputable method for inductive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;inference assumes that observation sequences x are drawn from an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;recursive prior distribution mu(x). Instead of using the unknown
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mu(x) he predicts using the celebrated universal enumerable prior
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;M(x) which for all x exceeds any recursive mu(x), save for a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;constant factor independent of x. The simplicity measure M(x)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;naturally implements &quot;Occam's razor&quot; and is closely related to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Kolmogorov complexity of x. However, M assigns high probability to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;certain data x that are extremely hard to compute. This does not match
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;our intuitive notion of simplicity. Here we suggest a more plausible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;measure derived from the fastest way of computing data.  In absence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of contrarian evidence, we assume that the physical world is generated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;by a computational process, and that any possibly infinite sequence of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observations is therefore computable in the limit (this assumption is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;more radical and stronger than Solomonoff's). Then we replace M by the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;novel Speed Prior S, under which the cumulative a priori probability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of all data whose computation through an optimal algorithm requires
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;more than O(n) resources is 1/n.  We show that the Speed Prior allows
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;for deriving a computable strategy for optimal prediction of future
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;y, given past x.  Then we consider the case that the data actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;stem from a nonoptimal, unknown computational process, and use
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Hutter's recent results to derive excellent expected loss bounds for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;S-based inductive inference.  Assuming our own universe is sampled
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;from S, we predict: it won't get many times older than it is now;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;large scale quantum computation won't work well; beta decay is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;random but due to some fast pseudo-random generator which we should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;try to discover.
