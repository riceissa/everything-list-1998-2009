Jacques may have a point that there may be cases where all branches terminate 
<br />
EVEN IF THE MW IS INFINITE. As an example, we could consider in the domain of 
<br />
mathematics Fermat's problem: There is no integer solution to the problem 
<br />
X**n + Y**n = Z**n for all n &gt; 2. This results holds for the infinite set of 
<br />
integers X, Y Z and n. Similarly, this may implies that there exists in the 
<br />
MW some worlds which are closed to us.  However as long as the REMAINING 
<br />
number of worlds is infinite we are still immortal. If the number of worlds 
<br />
that we have access to is finite then we end up in an universe that 
<br />
terminates or in an infinitely recurring universe which is as boring as a 
<br />
universe that terminates. My hope is that our number of options is infinite. 
<br />
I do not know the answer to this question.
<br />
<br />I haven't heard of any QS yet. There are several possibility for this 
<br />
situation:
<br />
1) Either no one is 100% convinced of QM immortality
<br />
2) Or those of us who are 100% convinced of QM immortality possess some form 
<br />
of ethics that prevents them from QS. (even though no one has yet formulated 
<br />
an explicit &quot;morality&quot; or &quot;ethic&quot; for a MW world)
<br />
3) Or those who are 100 convinced of QM immortality are happy to live a 
<br />
schizophrenic existence actually believing several contradictory things 
<br />
simultaneously, like Lewis Carrol said.
<br />
<br />My favorite possibility is #2. I think it is possible to formulate an ethic 
<br />
in the MW. I would like to counter the argument that says that since the MW 
<br />
is complete chaos, contains all the possibility and why bother with ethics 
<br />
since everything will happen anyway. My argument is that at a meta level, the 
<br />
MW does give rise to life and consciousness which are emergent properties of 
<br />
the MW and therefore we should have an ethic. Sometimes, after a close call 
<br />
on the road that did not result in any accident, I catch myself worrying 
<br />
about my wife and children in the other universes where I did not make it 
<br />
alive. How can I tell them that over here everything is fine and not to worry?

<br />Jacques, we had a good argument, and I bought Gilles' explanation. However, I 
<br />
am not sure if I am ready to give up my point of view yet. I think that it is 
<br />
possible to bridge the gap between the two points of views and explain one in 
<br />
terms of the other. Jacques there is no animosity on my part and I really 
<br />
enjoyed exchanging posts with you. I think the devil's advocate role that you 
<br />
play is invaluable.
