New Scientist has an article on parallel universes:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; David Deutsch at the University of Oxford and colleagues have shown
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that key equations of quantum mechanics arise from the mathematics of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; parallel universes. &quot;This work will go down as one of the most important
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; developments in the history of science,&quot; says Andy Albrecht, a physicist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at the University of California at Davis. In one parallel universe,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at least, it will - whether it does in our one remains to be seen.
</em><br />
<br />It is behind a paywall at
<br />

<br />
but I found a copy on Google Groups:
<br />
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.kq.p/browse_thread/thread/9631b2e37ba5e7a2/fb3202c9c5b71228?lnk=st&amp;q=%22new+scientist%22+deutsch+albrecht&amp;rnum=1#fb3202c9c5b71228">http://groups.google.com/group/alt.kq.p/browse_thread/thread/9631b2e37ba5e7a2/fb3202c9c5b71228?lnk=st&amp;q=%22new+scientist%22+deutsch+albrecht&amp;rnum=1#fb3202c9c5b71228</a>
<br />
<br />It has a great quote from Tegmark: &quot;The critique of many worlds is
<br />
shifting from 'it makes no sense and I hate it' to simply 'I hate it'.&quot;
<br />
<br />The thrust of the article is about recent work to fix the two perceived
<br />
problems in the MWI: non-uniqueness of basis (the universe splits in all
<br />
different ways) and recovering the Born rule. The basis problem is now
<br />
considered (by supporters) to be resolved via improved understanding
<br />
of decoherence. This work (which was not particularly focused on the
<br />
MWI) generally seems to lead to a unique basis for measurement-like
<br />
interactions, hence there is no ambiguity in terms of which way the
<br />
universe splits.
<br />
<br />As for the Born rule, the article points to the effort begun by Deutsch in
<br />
1999 to base things on decision theory. The idea is that we fundamentally
<br />
care about probability insofar as it influences the decisions and choices
<br />
we make, so if we can recover a sensible decision theory in the MWI, we
<br />
have basically explained probability. I've seen a number of critiques of
<br />
Deutsch's paper but according to this article, subsequent work by David
<br />
Wallace and Simon Saunders has extended it to the point where things
<br />
are pretty solid.
<br />
<br />Hence the two traditional objections to the MWI are now at least arguably
<br />
dealt with, and given its advantage in terms of formal simplicity (fewer
<br />
axioms), supporters argue that it should be considered the leading
<br />
model for QM. This is where we get claims about it being among the most
<br />
important discoveries in the history of mankind, etc.
<br />
<br />It's interesting to see the resistance of the physics community to
<br />
multiverse concepts. It all comes back to the tradition of experimental
<br />
verification I suppose, which is still pretty much impossible. Really
<br />
it is more a question of philosophy than of physics as we currently
<br />
understand these disciplines.
<br />
<br />We see the same thing happening all over again in string theory. I
<br />
don't know if you guys are following this at all. String theory is
<br />
going through a crisis as it has turned out in the past few years that
<br />
it does not predict a single universe, rather a multiverse where there
<br />
is a &quot;landscape&quot; of possible sets of parameters, each of which would
<br />
correspond to a universe. The big problem is that there is no natural
<br />
or accepted measure (unlike with QM where everyone knew all along that
<br />
the measure had to be the Born rule and it was just a matter of how
<br />
many hoops you had to jump through to pull it out of your model).  As a
<br />
result it looks like it might be impossible to get even probabilistic
<br />
predictions out of the string theory landscape.
<br />
<br />AFAIK no one within the community has followed our path and looked
<br />
at algorithmic complexity as a source of measure (i.e. the Universal
<br />
Distribution, which says that the simplest theories have higher measure).
<br />
Granted, even if that direction were pursued it would probably be
<br />
computationally intractable so they still would not be able to pull much
<br />
out in the way of predictions. Neverthless physicists are skilled at the
<br />
use of approximation and assumptions to get plausible predictions out of
<br />
even rather opaque mathematics so it's possible they might get somewhere.
<br />
<br />But at this point it looks like the resistance is too strong. Rather
<br />
than string theory making the multiverse respectable as we might hope,
<br />
it seems likely that the multiverse will kill string theory.
