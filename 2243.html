I wrote that it was
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;   not possible in my version of the many-minds interpretation 
</em><br />
<br />to
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  define ``birth rank as [ ] position in the class of all [ ]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  observer-branch-moments''.  The best we can do is to look at an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  observer's own personal current evidence as to his birth rank. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  This can be quite ambiguous and, in general, will be a matter for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  interpretation rather than mathematical definition.
</em><br />
<br />Nick Bostrom &lt;nick.domain.name.hidden&gt; replied
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Are you saying that it is not possible in your model to define the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  class of all points in time on all branches of the universal wave
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  function which are  at a temporal distance of, say, 10 years from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  the start of the world  (assuming there was a point when the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  world (i.e. the whole tree of  branching possibilities) started?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  (This is not a rhetorical question but a  clarificationary one. And
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I'm not asking whether we could identify those  points, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  whether the class of such points is defined.)
</em><br />
<br />Yes, I am saying that.
<br />
<br />First of all, I would be unhappy with the requirement to specify a
<br />
unique hyperplane of simultaneity.  
<br />
<br />More generally, many problems arise when we try to understand the
<br />
nature of time in modern physical theories.  Prior to relativity
<br />
theory, it seemed that there was a natual succession of
<br />
universally-valid ``nows'' apparent simultaneously to everyone alive
<br />
at the time.  Times other than the present now had happened or
<br />
would happen but were not currently in existence.   Special
<br />
relativity, however, taught us that simultaneity is
<br />
frame-dependent and introduced the idea of reality as a
<br />
four-dimensional spacetime.  According to general relativity, time
<br />
is path-dependent.  In the quasi-classical cosmology of the world
<br />
we seem to live in, time appears on all inextendible paths to have
<br />
begun with a big bang, but on some of those paths it may come to an
<br />
end in a black hole, while on others it may continue for ever. 
<br />
<br />What will the right picture be if we ever manage to quantize
<br />
general relativity?  I suspect that we should allow for the
<br />
possibility of black holes being formed as a result of uncertain
<br />
``quantum events'' -- it may be harder to choose to construct a black
<br />
hole than to kill a cat but it is not unimaginable.  This suggests that
<br />
time is not just frame dependent and path dependent, but even
<br />
observer dependent.
<br />
<br />Now, partly in order to deal with the problem of time in special
<br />
relativity, I have developed a many-minds interpretation of
<br />
quantum theory which involves information being definite only
<br />
separately for each individual observer.  The information observed
<br />
by an observer is specified by sequences of local quantum
<br />
states associated with the life history of that observer.
<br />
<br />Applied to the EPR-Bell situation, for example, this means that
<br />
when Alice measures a spin, her current state expresses
<br />
a possible observed spin direction.  (This is a local process.)  
<br />
When Bob measures a spin, his current state expresses a possible
<br />
observed spin direction.  (And this too is a local process.)  Finally,
<br />
another local process occurs when Alice and Bob compare their
<br />
observations (or rather, when each separately observes the
<br />
appearance of the other).  The observed correlations which
<br />
result are determined by the initial singlet state which was
<br />
effectively previously observed separately by both.
<br />
<br />I believe that, in many ways, this provides a very satisfactory and
<br />
explicit solution to the problem of what it might mean for time to
<br />
be observer-dependent.  
<br />
<br />But if time is observer-dependent, then it is hard in general to
<br />
compare times between different observers.
<br />
<br />This means that I do not view the ``birth rank'' problem as being
<br />
well-posed for my theory.  Nevertheless, the broader problem of the
<br />
extent to which we should expect to see ourselves as being
<br />
``typical'' observers is one which I think is both absolutely crucial
<br />
and very hard to deal with.  I appreciate Bostrom's work because I
<br />
think that he is helping to clarify some of the issues involved in
<br />
that problem.
<br />
<br />I also think that whether we are typical observers and whether
<br />
time is observer-dependent are questions which are relevant for
<br />
any ``theory of everything''.
<br />
<br />I wrote saying that
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I believe that there is no conceivable algorithm which could take
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  elements of the set of observers as I define it (well-defined and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  countable although that is) and attach unambiguous birth ranks to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  each one of them.
</em><br />
<br />Bostrom replied
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Do you mean effectively computable algorithm?
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I don't see why it would make a difference if the reference could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  not be  exactly computed in a finite time.
</em><br />
<br />No.  I just referred to an algorithm to stress that I really am
<br />
serious when I use words like ``unambiguous'' and ``well-defined''.
<br />
<br />I wrote
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  As I see it, *the question* is ``Given what I have learned
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  from my life up to now, how should I predict my future?''
</em><br />
<br />Bostrom replied
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I'm not sure whether we are really disagreeing on this point,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  although I  would insist that one sort of question we may
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  meaningfully ask is not just  what my own future will be but also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  what the world is like (and was like in  the past) in general.
</em><br />
<br />I am afraid that we are disagreeing here, because I do not agree that
<br />
``the world'' exists in anything like the way that Bostrom implies.
