<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; computation (they are all implemented non-physically in Platonia), or the idea that a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; computation can be conscious in the first place.

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; You haven't made it clear why you don't accept that every physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; system
</em><br />

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; conscious computation or not. I don't see what

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; contradicts it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Every physical system does implement every computation, in a trivial sense, as every rock
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is a hammer and a doorstop and contains a bust of Albert Einstein inside it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The rock-hammer and the bust of Einstein are mere possibilities. You
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have an argument to the effect that every physical sytem is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implements every computation. Every physical systesm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could implelement any computation under suitable re-interpretation,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but that is a mere possibility unless someone does the re-interpreting,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; --
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in which case it is in fact the system+interpreter combination that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the  re-intrepreting.
</em><br />
<br />OK, but then you have the situation whereby a very complex, and to our mind disorganised, conscious 
<br />
computer might be designed and built by aliens, then discovered by us after the aliens have become 
<br />
extinct and their design blueprints, programming manuals and so on have all been lost. We plug in the 
<br />
computer (all we can figure out about it is the voltage and current it needs to run) and it starts whirring 
<br />
and flashing.  Although we have no idea what it's up to when it does this, had we been the aliens, we 
<br />
would have been able to determine from observation that it was doing philosophy or proving mathematical 
<br />
theorems. The point is, would we now say that it is *not* doing philosophy or proving mathematical theorems 
<br />
because there are no aliens to observe it and interpret it? 
<br />
<br />You might say, the interpretation has still occurred in the initial design, even though the designers are no 
<br />
more. But what if exactly the same physical computer had come about by incredible accident, as a result of 
<br />
a storm bringing together the appropriate metal, semiconductors, insulators etc.: if the purposely built computer 
<br />
were conscious, wouldn't its accidental twin also be conscious?
<br />
<br />Finally, reverse the last step: a &quot;computer&quot; is as a matter of fact thrown together randomly from various 
<br />
components, but it is like no computer ever designed, and just seems to whir and flash randomly. Given that there 
<br />
are no universal laws of computer design that everyone has to follow, isn't it possible that some bizarre alien 
<br />
engineer *could* have put this strange machine together, so that its seemingly random activity to that alien 
<br />
engineer would have been purposely designed to implement conscious computation? And if so, is it any more 
<br />
reasonable to deny that this computer is conscious because its designer has not yet been born than it is to deny 
<br />
that the first computer was conscious because its designer has died, or because it was made accidentally rather 
<br />
than purposely built in a factory?
