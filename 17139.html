Hi Mirek,
<br />
<br />Long and perhaps key post.
<br />

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Come on Mirek: &quot;Theaetetical&quot; is an adjective I have forged from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;Theatetus&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;Theatetus&quot; gives 195.000 results on Google.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;Theatetus&quot; wiki 4310.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course, after all you reference the dialogue Theaetetus in your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; papers thus one can easily match the word Theaetetical agains it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let me quickly summarize the experience I had with &quot;theatetical notion
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of knowledge&quot; while reading one of your papers for the first time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maybe I am an ignorant, then shame on me, but I have not read the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Theaetetus.
</em><br />
<br />There is no shame in being ignorant. Only in staying ignorant :)
<br />
I feel a bit sorry with my last post. I hate to look like patronizing,  
<br />
but it is a professional deformation. Apology.
<br />
<br />Note that all the Theaetetus' stuff is really needed just to motivate  
<br />
the &quot;arithmetical&quot; definition of the knower, alias the first person,  
<br />
alias the &quot;universal soul&quot;, and this concerns AUDA (the &quot;arithmetical  
<br />
UDA), which should be done normally after getting straight the UDA's  
<br />
point, ... unless you are mathematical logician, who are the only one  
<br />
who can find AUDA more &quot;easy&quot; than UDA.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So I took a look at the Wikipedia and read
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;In this dialogue, Socrates and Theaetetus discuss three definitions  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; knowledge: knowledge as nothing but perception, knowledge as true
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; judgment, and, finally, knowledge as a true judgment with an account.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Each of these definitions are shown to be unsatisfactory.&quot;
</em><br />
<br />Socrates asks Theaetetus to define &quot;knowledge&quot;. That is a very  
<br />
difficult question.
<br />
Then Socrates shows that all attempts made by Theaetetus lead to  
<br />
difficulties. He literally concludes that the problem is open, and  
<br />
this is debated in the philosophical literature since then.
<br />
<br />The remarkable thing is that if you accept to modelize &quot;account&quot; by  
<br />
&quot;sound machine provability&quot;, which can be done for the not too complex  
<br />
machine, like Peano Arithmetic provers, or Zermelo Fraenkel Set Theory  
<br />
prover, the definitions of Theaetetus make sense, and can be use to  
<br />
show, at least, that many philosopher are deductively invalid in   
<br />
their critics. Actually, even the critics by Socrates have to be  
<br />
weakened.
<br />
<br />All the arithmetical hypostases (in the Plotinus paper) are variant of  
<br />
Theaetetus definition.
<br />
<br />The main one (corresponding to Plotinus &quot;primary hypostases) are the  
<br />
following one:
<br />
<br />p (the truth of p)
<br />
Bp (the provability of p, the account of p)
<br />
Bp &amp; p (the provability of p when p is true)
<br />
<br />The amazing thing is that the incompleteness theorem can be used to  
<br />
show that, about sound machine, we have
<br />
<br />Bp &lt;-&gt; Bp &amp; p.
<br />
<br />But this equivalence is true but not provable by the machine, making  
<br />
the ideal knower already obeying a different logic than the ideal  
<br />
prover. This introduces a non trivial notion of first person for the  
<br />
machines.
<br />
If you remember G and G*, the equivalence between proof and knowledge  
<br />
belongs to G* minus G. The corona of the true but unprovable (by the  
<br />
machine) statements. Yet they prove (know) the same arithmetical &quot;p&quot;,  
<br />
yet, from those points of view, it appears very different.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hmm that really helps .., I told to myself and continued with reading.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; With an uneasy feeling of stepping into the water I eventually settled
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; down to conclusion that you likely mean something as &quot;true justified
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; belief&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />I have found dozen of different translations, in french and in  
<br />
english, of the greek expressions.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I really wished you wrote it more straightforwardly without turning  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; readers quite unnecessarily down to the Theaetetus and inventing new
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; words such as &quot;Theaetetical&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />In french students are burned alive if they dare to create new  
<br />
adjective, and I thought that in English we have more freedom, but I  
<br />
may be wrong. Sorry.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Anyway, I'd like to stop discussing this issue :-) since my only point
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was to give you a hint why I said that it is not easy to read your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; papers/letters.
</em><br />
<br />There are other reasons, if only the difficulty of the subject.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Feel free to ask for any clarification, position
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; adjustments, question, at any level ...Do you understand what is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; comp hypothesis?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let us see if I get it right. Your comp hypothesis is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) I'm a machine,
</em><br />
<br />OK. This of course could be interpreted in many ways, and that is why  
<br />
I have introduce the quasi-operational &quot;yes doctor&quot;. It makes clear  
<br />
hat the &quot;I&quot; is the conscious first person I, not the third person body.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) Each possible computation is Turing-computable,
</em><br />
<br />OK. That is Church thesis. Very few people doubt it, but it is a  
<br />
refutable statement. If a human find a well defined function with an  
<br />
account of how human can compute it, but no machine can, then CT will  
<br />
be refuted. Only Kalmar did pretend to have such a function, but  
<br />
eventually his &quot;function&quot; was not well defined.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3) Natural numbers and their relations do exist.
</em><br />
<br />This is arithmetical realism. Just a way to prevent infinite  
<br />
discussion about intutionism and ultrafinitism.  It is no more than  
<br />
the belief of all mathematician that the excuded middle principle is  
<br />
freely used on arithmetical proposition. Except for some philsopher,  
<br />
or mathematicians, but only at the pause cafe, or during the week-end,  
<br />
this is a widespread belief. But given that the result could be  
<br />
considered as a bit weird, I usually prefer to make it explicit. It  
<br />
can be retrieved from the (classical) Church thesis. Church thesis  
<br />
does not make sense without arithmetical realism. This is something I  
<br />
intend to show precisely in the UDA-7 thread.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This should not be confused with other quite common comp hypothesis  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the universe is a big computer.
</em><br />
<br />Yes. It is different in principle. It is different unless I am the  
<br />
physical universe, which I doubt. Comp is really indexical mechanism:  
<br />
&quot;I am a machine&quot;, or &quot;I see no change after the functional  
<br />
substitution at the right level&quot;, or &quot;I survive classical  
<br />
teleportation&quot;, etc.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This hypothesis entails the existence of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a physical computer.
</em><br />
<br />Not necessarily. It could depend by what you mean by &quot;physical&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ad 1) I take the position that &quot;I&quot; is only a convenient temporary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pointer to a part of universe. The pointer &quot;Socrates' thoughts&quot; is of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the same quality.
</em><br />
<br />This I do not understand. &quot;I&quot;, used by Mirek, is a person, subject of  
<br />
consciousness. I think you confuse that first person &quot;I&quot;, and its  
<br />
(current) body.
<br />
At that stage it is better to be reasonably agnostic about a universe.  
<br />
&quot;I&quot; is the person who survives teleportation, with a new body. With  
<br />
mechanism, &quot;I&quot; can be said the owner of the body.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ad 2) Breath taking. While 1) and 3) are assumptions of the kind &quot;OK,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; let's think for a while that ...&quot;,
</em><br />
<br />Hmm... Most scientist believes implicitly or explicitly in &quot;1)&quot; and  
<br />
&quot;3)&quot;. Only Penrose happens to be explicitly arguing that &quot;1)&quot; is  
<br />
false, but note that he defends &quot;3)&quot; eloquently. John Searles, a  
<br />
philosopher, pretends that he believes that &quot;1)&quot; is false, in case of  
<br />
digital machine, but then he reasons in most place like if it was  
<br />
implicitly believing it, or being very fuzzy about what is non  
<br />
mechanical in biology. Only &quot;fairy tales&quot; kind of religious person  
<br />
have (fairy tales) theory of the soul, in which case they would say  
<br />
&quot;no to the doctor&quot; (even in principle: I add this because I would, in  
<br />
most cases,  say &quot;no&quot; to the doctor for technical reasons probably).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) has the status of a thesis. I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't have any firm position on what could an objective reality be  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; without a justification I tend to think it is inaccessible to us), but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if there is any objective reality, 2) could be a statement about it.
</em><br />
<br />You don't need to have a firm position on what could an objective  
<br />
reality be.
<br />
You need only to believe that you can be objective on a part of that  
<br />
reality. In particular you need to be objective with sentences like:
<br />
<br />x divides y if and only if it exists a number z such that y = x*z.
<br />
<br />if 4 divides 08 then 02 divides 8
<br />
<br />For any natural number x, if 4 divides x then 2 divides x.
<br />
<br />Goldbach conjecture is false or true.
<br />
<br />Etc.
<br />
<br />I think it is reasonable to bet on the objectivity of those  
<br />
statements. And besides, they are used in the practice of all other  
<br />
exact sciences all the times. You don't have to believe more than that  
<br />
for being an arithmetical realist.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ad 3) If natural numbers and their relations are the only entities  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do exist then me, you, everything is a recipe of a Turing-computable  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; number.
</em><br />
<br />No. Not at all. Sorry. Gosh, you will be very surprised if you follow  
<br />
the UDA-7. On the contrary. Arithmetical truth VASTLY extends the  
<br />
computable domain. Most relations between numbers are not Turing  
<br />
emulable.
<br />
<br />And then, why do you introduce suddenly the idea that numbers and  
<br />
their relations would be the only entities existing for me?
<br />
This is not part of the assumption. The assumption are not more than;
<br />
<br />A - There is a level of substitution such that I can survive a digital  
<br />
functional substitution made at that level.
<br />
B - Church thesis  (classical Church thesis, not the intuitionist one,  
<br />
thus I use classical realism, classical logic, mathematical logic)
<br />
<br />What you say is in the conclusion of the UDA reasoning (although in a  
<br />
rough and simplified form(*)).
<br />
<br />If only number exists, then it would be like I am proposing a new  
<br />
theory. I could have done that, but this is not what I have done. What  
<br />
I give is a constructive proof that if I am machine, and CT is  
<br />
correct, then the laws of physics have to be reduced and derived from  
<br />
the laws of number (or any recursively isomorphic structure). The  
<br />
movie graph argument is what makes this obligatory. The notion of  
<br />
fundamental matter loose its meaning. Matter becomes a Moiré effect  
<br />
lived by the number when they infer relations from their point of  
<br />
views. You can still believe in matter if you want too, but you cannot  
<br />
use it to explain even the physical observation, which have to emerge  
<br />
from special number's points of view.
<br />
<br />That is what UDA shows.
<br />
<br />Now AUDA is only used to illustrate that incompleteness in computer  
<br />
science and logic provide consistency to such a view. But as I said,  
<br />
Theaetetus all what the multiple explanations of what could be  
<br />
knowledge are directly translatable in arithmetic thanks again to  
<br />
incompleteness. For this you need Solovay theorem, and you need to  
<br />
read Boolos or Smorynski, or Smullyan's book in logic, or study  
<br />
sane04. I am surfing on the shoulds of giants here: like Post, Gödel,  
<br />
Kleene, Löb, and Solovay.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK, that is it. This is how I understand to your starting assumptions.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You may have to revised or I may have ben unclear, or the result is  
<br />
too much counter-intuitive, and things take time. People are not  
<br />
accustomed to see a proof in philosophy or theology, but I show, or  
<br />
try to show, that the very common comp belief is much strangest, and  
<br />
far less reductionist than what most materialists believe.
<br />
The intended result, in a nutshell, is the incompatibility of very  
<br />
weak forms of materialism with digital mechanism.
<br />
By a weak form of materialism I mean any doctrine which posits a  
<br />
primitive or substantial matter and reduces the mind to it  
<br />
(computationally or not computationally). Materialism and mechanism,  
<br />
which are always thought as ally are really just epistemologically  
<br />
incompatible.
<br />
<br />OK? I mean do you see that such a result is far from trivial? UDA1-7  
<br />
conveys already the basic understanding of what happens. The Movie  
<br />
graph captures the mind-body problem in the comp frame, and is  
<br />
responsible for the inadequacy of not just physics, but of any  
<br />
particular universal machine.  What you see is not the product of a  
<br />
universal machine (be it physical or mathematical), but of an infinity  
<br />
of them. At first sight the mystery is now: why does the physical  
<br />
world looks so computable. That is the unavoidable white rabbit  
<br />
problem.  Who knows, it could one day lead to the refutation of comp.  
<br />
But AUDA, computer science and self-reference logics suggest that comp  
<br />
could provide a coherent picture after all, capable of explaining  
<br />
where the laws of physics come from, without eliminating the person.   
<br />
AUDA lead to identify physics with one of the Theaetetus-like  
<br />
definition of a form of knowledge, and this is enough to extract a  
<br />
logic of what is observable, and this makes comp testable. I give a  
<br />
tool capable of measuring the degree of computability of nature. But  
<br />
alas, it does not really distinguish comp and many weakening of comp.  
<br />
Most of the &quot;gods&quot; still pay taxes (&quot;gods&quot; are defined by NON Turing  
<br />
emulable self-referential entities ...). Up to now the comp logic is  
<br />
not contradicted by quantum logic.
<br />
<br />I have to go. This is an important post. Other people, like Jones  
<br />
recently, get me wrong on the starting assumption. It is really just  
<br />
&quot;I am a machine&quot; made precise. Then computer science makes it possible  
<br />
to reason and prove things with that assumption. I have no original  
<br />
theory. I propose just a proof, a reasoning or an argument.
