<em class="quotelev1">&gt; eternally self-recreating universe with no outside explanation necessary?
</em><br />
<br />I think there are some problems with this, which I'll get to in a
<br />
moment.  But first it is good to keep in mind that current cosmological
<br />
observations contradict Tipler's predictions.  There is strong evidence
<br />
that the universal expansion is increasing and that there will be no
<br />
collapse and no Omega Point.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Specifically, the question is whether the Omega point computer could 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simulate the birth of a new, fully intact multiverse and run it through 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the creation of a new virtual omega point computer, that would then 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; continue the process in an endless cycle (or chain)?  Does one computer 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with infinite computing power (and only a millisecond to exist from an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; objective viewpoint) allow for this infinite layer of creation?  Does it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter whether the multiverse itself is infinite or just very large?
</em><br />
<br />I see a few problems with this.  First, the OP computer could in
<br />
fact simulate many universes, including those different from itself.
<br />
Perhaps it could even simulate all possible universes.  So its actions
<br />
don't go too far in explaining why it, itself, exists.
<br />
<br />Second, if you study the details of the OP you learn that it is a
<br />
difficult time to live.  It is not a stable situation.  Life will grow
<br />
exponentially more difficult as the collapse intensifies.  At the same
<br />
time, life grows perhaps exponentially more powerful, so there would
<br />
be reason to hope that it could manage to survive forever.  However,
<br />
this is not assured.
<br />
<br />In particular, there is no guarantee that the OP computation project
<br />
will be maintained forever.  The beings in charge of the computer might
<br />
change their minds and start using it to play video games.  Or survival
<br />
may become so challenging that they can't waste their time simulating all
<br />
possible universes, or even their own.
<br />
<br />Keep in mind that even though it only takes a finite amount of time from
<br />
the outside, the appropriate time scale is the internal one, and that
<br />
one lasts forever.  The OP is the product of life and intelligence, and
<br />
for this model to work, these entities must live forever and run their
<br />
computer forever.  Literally, forever and ever and ever.  That's the only
<br />
way the philosophical model works.  Such stability seems inconsistent
<br />
with the nature of life and intelligence as we know it.
<br />
<br />Third, it's not clear how exactly this explanation works.  If the
<br />
universe is real, it doesn't need to simulate itself in order to exist.
<br />
If it isn't real, the fact that it simulates itself doesn't seem like
<br />
enough to bring it into existence.  I can imagine no end of universes
<br />
that simulate themselves, in fact most of them would have a much easier
<br />
time of it than the OP beings struggling with their chaotic collapse.
<br />
Does that mean they are all just as real as our universe would be, if
<br />
the OP's simulations were what made us real?
<br />
<br />In fact among the simplest of such self-simulating universes is Bruno's
<br />
Universal Dovetailer, a trivial program which runs all programs
<br />
(including, by definition, itself).  If the OP brings itself into
<br />
existence, so does the UD, which is much simpler.  And the UD then makes
<br />
us exist along with all other universes, whether the OP turns out to be
<br />
cosmologically plausible or not.
