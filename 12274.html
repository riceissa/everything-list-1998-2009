<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; If slavery could be scientifically shown to promote the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; well-being of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; the species as a whole does that mean we should have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; slavery? Does it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; mean that slavery is good?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Teaching that slavery is &quot;bad&quot; is similar to teaching
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that lying is &quot;bad&quot;.  In each case it's a narrow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; over-simplification of a more general principle of what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; works. Children are taught simplified modes of moral
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; reasoning to match their smaller context of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; understanding. At one end of a moral scale are the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; moral instincts (experienced as pride, disgust, etc.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that are an even more condensed form of &quot;knowledge&quot; of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; what worked in the environment of evolutionary adaptation. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Further up the scale are cultural--including religious--laws
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and even the patterns of our language that further codify
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and reinforce patterns of interaction that worked well
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; enough and broadly enough to be taken as principles 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of &quot;right&quot; action.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Relatively few of us take the leap beyond the morality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that was inherited or given to us, to grasp the broader
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and more extensible understanding of morality as patterns
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of behavior assessed as promoting increasingly shared values
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; over increasing scope. Society discourages individual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; thinking about what is and what is not moral; indeed, it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; a defining characteristic that moral principles subsume 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; both narrow self interest and narrow situational awareness. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; For this reason, one can not assess the absolute morality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of an action in isolation, but we can legitimately speak of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the relative morality of a class of behavior within context.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Just as lying can clearly be the right action within a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; specific context (imagine having one's home invaded and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; being unable, on moral grounds, to lie to the invaders about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; where the children are hiding!), the moral issue of slavery
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; can be effectively understood only within a larger context.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The practice of slavery (within a specific context) can be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; beneficial to society; numerous examples exist of slavery
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; contributing to the economic good of a locale, and on a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; grander scale, the development of western philosophy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (including democracy!) as a result of freeing some from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the drudgery of manual labor and creating an environment 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; conducive to deeper thought.  And as we seek to elucidate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; a general principle regarding slavery, we come face-to-face
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; with other instances of this class of problem, including
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; rights of women to vote, the moral standing of sentient
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; beings of various degrees of awareness (farm animals, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; great apes, artificial intelligences), and even the idea 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that all &quot;men&quot;, of disparate mental and emotional capability,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; are &quot;created equal&quot;?  Could there be a principle constituting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; a coherent positive-sum stance toward issues of moral
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; interaction between agents of inherently different awareness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and capabilities?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Are we as a society yet ready to adopt a higher level of social 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; decision-making, &quot;moral&quot; to the extent that it effectively
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; promotes increasingly shared values over increasing scope, one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that provides an increasingly clear vision of effective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; interaction between agents of diverse and varying capabilities,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; or are going to hold tightly to the previous best model, one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that comfortingly but childishly insists on the fiction of some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; form of strict equality between agents?  Are we  mature enough
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to see that just at the point in human progress where 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; technological development (biotech, nanotech, AI) threatens to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; drastically disrupt that which we value, we are gaining the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; necessary tools to organize at a higher level--effectively a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; higher level of wisdom?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, I think slavery is bad, even if it does help society - 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unless we were actually in danger of extiction without it or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something. So yes, the moral rules must bend in the face of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; changing circumstances, but the point at which they bend will 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be different for each individual, and there is no objective 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way to define what this point would or should be.
</em><br />
<br />I thought you and I had already clearly agreed that there can be no
<br />
absolute or objective morality, since moral judgments are based on
<br />
subjective values.  And I thought we had already moved on to discussion
<br />
of how agents do in fact hold a good portion of their subjective values
<br />
in common, due to common environment, culture and  evolutionary
<br />
heritage.  In my opinion, the discussion begins to get interesting from
<br />
this point, because the population tends to converge on agreement as to
<br />
general principles of effective interaction, while tending to diverge on
<br />
matters of individual interests and preferences.
<br />
<br />Please notice that I don't say that slavery *is* immoral, because as you
<br />
well know there's no objective basis for that claim. But I do say that
<br />
people will increasingly agree in their assessment that it is highly
<br />
immoral.  Their *statements* are objective facts, and measurements of
<br />
the degree of agreement are objective facts, and on this basis I claim
<br />
that we can implement an improved form of social decision-making as
<br />
described earlier.
<br />
<br />People will increasingly agree that slavery is immoral because IT
<br />
DOESN'T WORK TO PROMOTE INCREASINGLY SHARED VALUES OVER INCREASING
<br />
SCOPE.  It's nowhere near being a positive-sum game within any
<br />
reasonable context.  In terms of first-order consequences it's a
<br />
terribly wasteful, terribly inefficient use of human intelligence and
<br />
ability within the structure of a modern society.  In terms of
<br />
second-order consequences it perpetuates patterns of fear, hate,
<br />
ignorance and conflict, all of which have objective, measurable
<br />
consequences of their own.
<br />
<br />But it's not for the childishly simplistic fictional reason which most
<br />
people have been taught, that all &quot;men&quot; are somehow perfectly equal in
<br />
some moral aspect.  People are beginning to struggle with this
<br />
simplistic rule, adding women to the equation, and more recently trying
<br />
to reckon where non-human agents can fit into this scheme, without
<br />
realizing yet that it's the scheme itself that's been broken, never
<br />
possessing the kind of generality that it claimed. The idea that &quot;all
<br />
men are created equal&quot; was a great improvement from the widespread
<br />
imbalances of the feudal system, given that the structure of society was
<br />
changing so as to decentralize the means of production with all its
<br />
attendant implications, but this shining principle was still only a
<br />
rough approximation of a general principle of effective interaction of
<br />
social agents.
<br />
<br />Please note that we actually do have many real-world examples of
<br />
combined subjective assessments determining objective decision points.
<br />
The stock market may be the most apt analogy at this point in our
<br />
discussion.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Slightly off topic, I don't see why we would design AI's to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience emotions such as resentment, anger, fear, pain 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; etc. 
</em><br />
<br />I agree.  Such add-ons would tend to interfere with their primary value
<br />
system.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In fact, if we could reprogram our own minds at will, it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would be a very different world. Suppose you were upset 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because you lost your job. You might decide to stay upset to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the degree that it remains a motivating factor to look for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other work, but not affect your sleep, ability to experience 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pleasure, etc. If you can't find work you might decide to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; downgrade your expectations, so that you are just as content 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; having less money or a menial job, or just as content for the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; next six months but then have the motivation to look for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interesting work kick in again, but without the confidence- 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and enthusiasm-sapping disappointment that comes from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; repeated failure to find work. Or any variation on the above 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you can imagine. 
</em><br />
<br />I agree that would seem to be a rational improvement.
<br />
<br />Merry Newtonmas to all.
