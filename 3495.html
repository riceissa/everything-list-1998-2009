Here's my proposed alternative to our current &quot;standard model&quot;, which says
<br />
all possible universes exist and some objectively true measure exists on
<br />
the set of universes.
<br />
<br />Instead, let's just say that all possible universes exist, period. There
<br />
is no objective measure. Instead, measure enters into the utility function
<br />
as a way of specifying how much one cares about each universe. The measure
<br />
is therefore an arbitrary and subjective choice. 
<br />
<br />The goal of the theory of everything then, is to tell us if how we should
<br />
behave given the utility function (and measure) that we do adopt. For
<br />
example one thing it might tell us is that if we adopted the Speed prior
<br />
for our utility function, then we should act as if we expect large
<br />
scale quantum computation to be impossible.

<br />I'm not saying that it can't be the best course of action for *anyone*,
<br />
I'm saying that it can't be the best course of action for *everyone*.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm not sure why it is inadequate to say that you care because you live
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the universe and its reality affects you.  You can't just choose
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whatever reality you like.
</em><br />
<br />Suppose I live in the FAST multiverse. Why should its reality affect me in
<br />
this particular way, so that I care about each universe in proportion to
<br />
its Speed prior?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is true; in the multiverse, people in high-measure worlds will come
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to expect and predict high-measure (high-likelihood) events, while those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in low-measure worlds may come to predict low-measure events.  So there is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some symmetry here.  However again I would break the symmetry by saying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that each of us is more likely to encounter the high-measure worlds and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; people, because that is what measure means.  We are effectively unable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to observe the low-measure worlds.  So the universe that we are able to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perceive and predict will have the same properties as if there were only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a single world.
</em><br />
<br />Just because you won't observe something, doesn't mean you shouldn't care
<br />
about it. For example some people put significant effort into writing
<br />
wills and setting up foundations which they will never see the effects of. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Imagine that we create computer simulations of two worlds with conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inhabitants.  We can't just add a measure parameter and set it arbitarily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to say that the first world has measure .9 and the second .1.  When we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tweak our measure parameter it will not affect the subjective lives
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the people in the simulation.  Measure does not work that way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Somehow it does relate to subjective probabilities.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You can get this in one way by relating it to duplicate instantiations,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such that worlds of measure .9 have 9 times as many duplicates as worlds
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of measure .1.  I don't personally find this to be helpful because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it requires assumptions which to my mind are equally as arbitrary as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; directly requiring measure to have the required properties of subjective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probability.  But in the simple case where we are running simulations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on a computer that would probably work.  Run one 9 times as often and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you could plausibly suppose that the inhabitants will be more likely to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience that world.
</em><br />
<br />When you run it 9 times as often, it still doesn't change the subjective
<br />
lives of the people in the simulations. They won't notice any difference.
<br />
And it's still not obvious why the people in the simulations should care
<br />
about one world 9 times more just because it has been run 9 times as
<br />
often.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; However you get to it, you have to think of measure as more than a label
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attached to a universe, devoid of other meaning.  That is the only way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to get predictions from the multiverse model.
</em><br />
<br />The thing is, we need a decision theory, otherwise it's not clear what
<br />
predictions mean. To be cute about it, I could say that without a decision
<br />
theory, a prediction is no more than a number (probability) attached to a
<br />
statement, devoid of other meaning. Once you think in terms of decision
<br />
theory, it seems that measure only has meaning if you give it meaning by
<br />
making it part of your utility function.
