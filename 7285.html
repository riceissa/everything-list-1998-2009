Hi Quentin
<br />
<br />In my opinion you are right in suspecting that there is something wrong 
<br />
with increasing or decreasing measure. Since a conscious observer cannot 
<br />
subjectively distinguish between a large (infinite) number of observer 
<br />
moment, he occupies or &quot;surfs&quot; over all of them. Taking a quantum branch 
<br />
does not reduce the number of observer moments because they are still an 
<br />
infinite number of them,  and merging branches does not increase the 
<br />
number of observer moment because their sum is also infinite.
<br />
<br />For this reason I am a firm believer that one can only talk about 
<br />
relative measure (and the RSSA) and not about absolute measure (and the 
<br />
ASSA). Relative measure is the ratio of the number of observer moments 
<br />
before an event and the number after the event. Thus in discussing 
<br />
measure you must define two points: before and after. And you must 
<br />
define an observer and the person or object being observed. If the 
<br />
number of OMs goes to infinity, we can still take a ratio &quot;in the limit&quot;.
<br />
<br />Since the actual number of OMs is infinite, we can normalize measure by 
<br />
defining relative measure for an observer observing himself  as equal to 
<br />
1: that is the number of OMs for an observer divided by the number of 
<br />
OMs for the observer).  A given observer can then calculate the relative 
<br />
measure for someone else going between two states as the ratio of the 
<br />
number of OM's between those two states.
<br />
Thus if an observer carried with him a relative measure measuring 
<br />
instrument (that measures the number of OM's and divides them by 
<br />
themselves) he would find that no matter how risky his behavior is, his 
<br />
own measure remains invariant and fixed at 1. From my own point of view, 
<br />
my relative measure today is not greater or smaller than my relative 
<br />
measure yersterday. The measure of an old and sick man is not greater or 
<br />
smaller than that of a healthy baby that he observes.
<br />
<br />Some of the other threads in this list (i.e., another puzzle described 
<br />
by Stathis) discuss experiments in which observers are copied and 
<br />
destroyed. Answers to these questions depend on which two points are 
<br />
selected to define relative measure.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another puzzle: You find yourself in a locked room with no
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;windows, and no memory of how you got there. The room is
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sparsely furnished: a chair, a desk, pen and paper, and in one
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;corner a light. The light is currently red, but in the time you
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have been in the room you have observed that it alternates
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;between red and green every 10 minutes. Other than the coloured
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;light, nothing in the room seems to change. Opening one of the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;desk drawers, you find a piece of paper with incredibly neat
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;handwriting. It turns out to be a letter from God, revealing
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that you have been placed in the room as part of a philosophical
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;experiment. Every 10 minutes, the system alternates between two
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;states. One state consists of you alone in your room. The other
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;state consists of 10100 exact copies of you, their minds
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perfectly synchronised with your mind, each copy isolated from
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all the others in a room just like yours. Whenever the light
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;changes colour, it means that God is either instantaneously
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;creating (10100 - 1) copies, or instantaneously destroying all
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but one randomly chosen copy.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your task is to guess which colour of the light corresponds with
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which state and write it down. Then God will send you home.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having absorbed this information, you reason as follows. Suppose
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that right now you are one of the copies sampled randomly from
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all the copies that you could possibly be. If you guess that you
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are one of the 10100 group, you will be right with probability
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10100)/(10100+1) (which your calculator tells you equals one).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you guess that you are the sole copy, you will be right with
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;probability 1/(10100+1) (which your calculator tells you equals
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zero). Therefore, you would be foolish indeed if you don't guess
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that you in the 10100 group. And since the light right now is
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;red, red must correspond with the 10100 copy state and green
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the single copy state.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But just as you are about to write down your conclusion, the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;light changes to green...
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's wrong with the reasoning here?
