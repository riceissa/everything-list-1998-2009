<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;    Sorry, that doesn't help.  What do you mean by a &quot;real actual&quot; one?  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;What other kind is there, a fake one?  Either it exists, or not.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;OK. In that sense we agree that the DU exist. I am glad to see that you are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a classical platonist. An intuitionist would'nt accept the idea that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;something exist ... or not.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm a quantum platonist :)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Of course, in your macintosh example, the UD was itself implemented by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;some other mathematical structure - your &quot;local decor&quot;.  Does that matter?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;A big part of my reasoning is that it *doesn't matter* indeed. For most 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;people this is a difficulty.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You're the one who tried to distinguish it as &quot;a concrete UD&quot;.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take it, from your above statement, that you do not object to my use 
<br />
of the term &quot;implemented&quot;.  It seems that, in fact, your claim that while I 
<br />
have a problem because I need a precise definition of &quot;implementation&quot;, you 
<br />
supposedly don't, was totally groundless.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Actually, I would say that any mathematical structure that has real 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;existance (in the strong sense) should be called &quot;physical&quot;.  I do not know 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of any better definition for &quot;physical existance&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;What is that strong sense of existence?
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's hard to define &quot;existance&quot;, isn't it?  Certainly, I would say that 
<br />
whatever structure is responsible for my own thoughts must exist in this 
<br />
sense.  I only distinguish a &quot;strong sense&quot; from the weaker sense used in 
<br />
mathematics, which basically just means self-consistent.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;And why do you want to classify as physical any mathematical structures.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's the &quot;everything&quot; idea, that all math exists, and that the physics 
<br />
we see is just a subset of that TOE.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;If you do that (a little like Tegmark) you are obliged to explain how we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;feel a difference between physicalness and mathematicalness
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We use &quot;physical&quot; to refer to the structure that we guess exists in the 
<br />
strong sense.  If you believe in the AUH, then the distinction disappears.  
<br />
Most people don't.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, we can also use it to refer to things directly related to 
<br />
what we are seeing.  This leads to statements like &quot;the branch of the 
<br />
wavefunction that I see is physically real, while the rest aren't&quot;.  I don't 
<br />
like that kind of statement.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Tegmark, like Everett, *do* distinguish the first and third person, which 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;helps to make sense of that idea.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave Everett alone, he is dead and can't defend himself against your 
<br />
abuse of his name.  I'm sure that, otherwise, he would find my approach to 
<br />
be the logical next step for the MWI.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The physical would be some mathematical structures sufficiently rich for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;having &quot;inside point of views&quot; (through SAS point of views for exemple).  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The physical point of view (pov) would correspond to these internal pov.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It sounds more like you want to say that the &quot;view&quot; seen by a conscious 
<br />
observer-moment is his &quot;physical world view&quot;.  If so, this has absolutely 
<br />
nothing to do with your terms &quot;first person vs. 3rd person views&quot; as it has 
<br />
nothing to do with time evolution or measure.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't like to call a thought's view his physical world view, but I 
<br />
might call it &quot;his effective physical world view&quot;.  (Ever notice how the 
<br />
main change that is needed in using the English language, to make it 
<br />
correct, is to preface almost every word with &quot;effective&quot;?)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;So, your objection is irrelevant.  You do believe a UD implements other 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Sure. Yes. UD implements all computations, and even all implementations 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of all computations.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great.  So you need a precise definition of &quot;implementation&quot; in order to 
<br />
find the measure distribution.  So much for your claim not to need it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Actuality is a first person concept.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;   I have no clue as to what you mean.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; In Newtonian Physics one could imagine some third person time (objective 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;time), but since relativity I guess most believe that time is either a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;parameter or do refer to some relative measurement done by an observer.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time as a &quot;parameter&quot; is exactly the same idea as Newtonian time.  Even 
<br />
those who refer to measurements done by observers do so in objective or &quot;3rd 
<br />
person&quot; terms.  (If an observer does measurement X, he sees Y.  That's a 
<br />
perfectly objective statement.)  Since, after all, there can never be any 
<br />
other kind of terms!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;Actuality&quot;, &quot;modern&quot;, &quot;here&quot;, &quot;now&quot;, &quot;there&quot;, &quot;elsewhere&quot;, are words 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with meaning dependent of the locutor. Indexicals, as the philosophers call 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;them.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would agree for the other terms, but &quot;actuality&quot; has the opposite 
<br />
meaning.  It refers to the reality that exists.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Most are true or false only from a first person point of view.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are words, not statements, so they are neither true nor false.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth of the statement &quot;Bob is here&quot; depends on the location of the 
<br />
speaker.  If I said it, it would _mean_ &quot;Bob is where Jack is&quot; and would be 
<br />
objectively false.  If you are with Bob, you will not say &quot;Yes, you are 
<br />
right.  Bob is here&quot;.  Instead you should say &quot;That's a lie.  I know because 
<br />
Bob is here.&quot;  Everyone (if honest) will agree that it was a lie.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, we see once again that the fabled &quot;first person point of 
<br />
view&quot; has absolutely nothing to do with the subject under discussion.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You need to realize that.  Thoughts exist.  Thoughts have 
<br />
characteristics such as the set of things seen by a thought.  Indexical 
<br />
information is important (and guessing it is how I bring effective 
<br />
probabilities into QM).  &quot;1st person point of view&quot;, as used on this list to 
<br />
mean something to do with QTI, is nonsense and does not mean anything.  
<br />
Anything real can be stated in objective terms.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;    If the person has some set of beliefs, they can be described as part 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the true description of the situation.  (Which you is what I thought you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;call the &quot;3rd person view&quot;.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Concerning *believes* the case is arguable. For *knowledge* I don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;think you will ever succeed in describing them in some provable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(objectively, 3-person) way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This can be proved with very reasonable definition.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;See ref by Benacerraf, or Kaplan and Montague in my thesis.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why don't you explain it here?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Someone who would have only first person insight is a solipsist.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A solipsist believes that only he exists.  He believes that to be an 
<br />
objectively true fact.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Someone who would have only third person insight is a zombie.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A zombie is a hypothetical creature that is mathematically identical to 
<br />
a human, but does not have consciousness.  They don't exist, according to 
<br />
computationalism.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just because I realize that some reality has objective existance, 
<br />
doesn't mean I don't have conscious experiences (with, indeed, particular 
<br />
characteristics).  It's just that I know better than to confuse &quot;what I see&quot; 
<br />
with &quot;what I should believe in&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;If I duplicate myself succesfully in Washington and Moscow, both Bruno1 and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Bruno2 can communicates the success of the experience from a third person 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;point of view, but none can explain you that he feels to be the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Washingtonian (resp Moscovian) one.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why not?  Of course, the important point is that neither one is &quot;the 
<br />
original Bruno&quot; (unless they both are, that depends on the definition).  If 
<br />
one says &quot;I'm the real one, and the other guy isn't&quot;, that's an objectively 
<br />
false statement.  If you say, prior to the duplication &quot;I will either end up 
<br />
in Washington xor in Moscow&quot;, that's an objectively false statement.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The difference between the first person and the third person is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; basically the same as the difference between having an headache and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; having a friend having an headhache.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above statement makes no sense, unless it is the same as the 
<br />
difference between having a headache, and having had a headache.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But again, dispensing with the &quot;n-person&quot; notation would help clear that 
<br />
up a lot.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Some time ago &quot;merde&quot; was considered as very vulgar, but since then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it has been overthrown by &quot;shit&quot;, or worse ... &quot;Merde&quot; seems almost
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;polite in comparison.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So does it mean feces?
