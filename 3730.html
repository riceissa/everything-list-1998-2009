Dear Bruno and Stephen:
<br />
<br />Since I think I have just about finished explaining my model to myself 
<br />
perhaps I can now do a better job of explaining it to others.  So here goes.
<br />
<br />1) The first thing I consider in need of basis is: There is a dynamic 
<br />
within the system [The machine(s) change state].
<br />
<br /><br />I start my basis for this with my own concepts for factuals and 
<br />
counterfactuals.
<br />
<br />A factual in my model is a piece of information.  An example would be: All 
<br />
numbers exist.
<br />
A counterfactual in my model is a piece of information that is the &quot;not&quot; or 
<br />
negation of part or all of a factual.  An example would be: All numbers do 
<br />
not exist.
<br />
<br />A factual that is completely negated by a collection of counterfactuals is 
<br />
itself a counterfactual.  Together these counterfactuals form a set.
<br />
<br />The first level of the model is the ensemble of all counterfactuals.  It 
<br />
contains no information.  Call that the Everything.  Now we may have forged 
<br />
a problem.  To say: The Everything exists is a factual.  This by itself is 
<br />
not in keeping with the objective of working with a zero information 
<br />
system.  Does it have a counterfactual.  Yes: The Nothing defined as the 
<br />
absence of factuals of any sort.  So we allow that the Nothing also exists.
<br />
<br />Now note that since both the Everything and the Nothing are counterfactuals 
<br />
they are both in the Everything.  The Everything is a member of itself - 
<br />
over and over.  This association is thus infinitely nested as is the 
<br />
boundary between the Everything and the Nothing.
<br />
<br />Now switch to the idea of selection.  The Everything can contain no 
<br />
selection since any selection would constitute a factual that is absent a 
<br />
counterfactual which is not allowed.
<br />
<br />Thus the Everything/Nothing boundary must not have a selected configuration 
<br />
or a selected evolution - it must randomly shift.  The shifting boundary 
<br />
exposes some of the counterfactuals in the Everything to the 
<br />
Nothing.  During this exposure such counterfactuals approach an incomplete 
<br />
negation - their negation becomes fuzzy.  What we consider our reality [our 
<br />
universe] is one of an infinite number of similar realities that are 
<br />
emergent as isomorphisms to this randomly shifting fuzz [a seething foamy 
<br />
fractal].
<br />
<br />2) The next thing I see in need of discussion is whether any members of 
<br />
this ensemble of universes are in some way subject to input from the 
<br />
underlying random dynamic.  This input would be as input from a random 
<br />
external oracle - true noise.
<br />
<br />The primary tool I use is the need to avoid a selection.  The conclusion is 
<br />
that either none of them are subject to this input or they all are.  To 
<br />
have some subject to this input is not allowed if selection is to be avoided.
<br />
<br />Is there any reason that a universe might be subject to this noise?  A 
<br />
universe in this model that has an evolutionary history must have found a 
<br />
series of successive isomorphic matches to the random dynamic of the 
<br />
Everything/Nothing boundary.  While noise free universes might have short 
<br />
histories, those with long histories would tend to be those subject to 
<br />
noise.  It would be a bit like natural selection for such a trait but is 
<br />
really an initial feature.  I take this to be sufficient basis given the 
<br />
need to avoid selection to hold in the model that all evolving universes 
<br />
are subject to true noise.
<br />
<br />3) The next thing to explore is the nature of the rules in each universe 
<br />
that guide its range of next possible isomorphisms [states].  Each current 
<br />
state has its own such range.
<br />
<br />More later.
<br />
<br />Hal
