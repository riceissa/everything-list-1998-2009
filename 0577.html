&nbsp;May be but how do you justify to take a geometrical average? And what if
<br />
&nbsp;you assume  m and m^2 in the boxes instead of m and 2m?
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;I think the problem is that m is not restricted and can take any value from
<br />
&nbsp;zero to infinity (even with discrete values). So actually the probability
<br />
&nbsp;of finding any particular value of m is strictly zero, which does not make
<br />
&nbsp;sense from the beginning. &gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />and Jacques Mallah wrote
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;	If you want to assume that m was initially drawn from a
<br />
distribution that is uniform for log m on (-00,00), so far so good.  But
<br />
that's completely different from what you did above with the geometric
<br />
average.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suppose you make that assumption.  Then the value of m will most
<br />
likely be either extremely small or extremely large.  That's the source of
<br />
the apparent paradox: 1.25 x = x is OK if x = 0 or x=00. &gt;&gt;
<br />
<br /><br />Gilles and Jacques, we are going in opposite direction in our reasoning and 
<br />
this is the reason we don't meet. You are using conventional logic, and I am 
<br />
using anthropic logic. 
<br />
<br />Assumption 1) 
<br />
I start out by assuming that m is what it is, however improbable it is  From 
<br />
an outside observer, the probability that m is what it is approaches zero. In 
<br />
fact the range of choice for m is the whole set of real numbers.However,  
<br />
this is the m that we observe. (ANTHROPY) and, given this m,  the probability 
<br />
of me seeing this particular m is one. 
<br />
<br />Assumption 2)
<br />
It is common sense that it does not make any sense to switch. (I am willing 
<br />
to play some money gambling games with you if you disagree on this one). The 
<br />
expected value of the money in the other box is m. Because of the PERFECT 
<br />
SYMMETRY of the situation, there is NO REASON for the expected value in the 
<br />
other box to be other than m. Lack of causes for the boxes to be different 
<br />
translates into perfect symmetry and the equivalence in the expected value 
<br />
between the two boxes. The laws of physics are the same in all reference 
<br />
systems (after choosing box A or after choosing box B)
<br />
<br />Conclusion: The distribution of m depends on the problem and must be such 
<br />
that  the expected value for the other box is equal to m. For the problem 
<br />
0.5m and 2m the distribution MAY BE logarithmic (sufficient condition) but 
<br />
there may be other distributions. For the problem sqrt(m) and m**2, the 
<br />
distribution is such that 
<br />
fn( sqrt(m)) + fn( m**2) = m. I am too lazy to work out all the possible 
<br />
functions that fn could be. 
<br />
In other words the problem itself defines the distribution.   
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt; In any case it is easily proved that it's false, since if you were
<br />
immortal you would expect to be very old.&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />It all depends how you measure my age. In fact, my lifeline extends 
<br />
uninterrupted probably four billions years (or possibly more), since it first 
<br />
appeared on earth, and we may even be cousins. And by the way, your lifeline 
<br />
also extends that much. Joyeux Anniversaire! Happy Birthday!  :-)
