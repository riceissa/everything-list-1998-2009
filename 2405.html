</em><br />
<br />It depends what you mean by &quot;good implementation.&quot;  The context of my 
<br />
comment above was, *if* you believe there is a single true set of 
<br />
psychophysical laws, are the laws likely to be defined in terms of 
<br />
&quot;computation&quot; or not?  If you don't believe in these sorts of laws, then the 
<br />
question of what's a &quot;good&quot;
<br />
implementation is somewhat academic--it's really just a question of what's 
<br />
the neatest way to define our terms.  If, on the other hand, there's a 
<br />
single set of psychophysical laws that reality uses to determine some kind 
<br />
of global measure on the set of all possible experiences (making some types 
<br />
of experiences more probable and others less probable), then we can ask 
<br />
about  what those laws might look like, based on our belief that they should 
<br />
be &quot;elegant&quot; in some way (so we can rule out laws that say only blue-eyed 
<br />
people are conscious, for example).
<br />
<br />My question for you is, does your Platonic view of things rule out the idea 
<br />
of a single global theory of consciousness?  I'm not talking about different 
<br />
Platonic worlds having their own unique definitions of consciousness...if 
<br />
that was true we'd still have the problem of why I'm any less likely to 
<br />
experience the laws of physics suddenly breaking down than I am to 
<br />
experience the world continuing as normal.  We need a truly global, 
<br />
&quot;objective&quot; theory of consciousness to deal with this problem, I think (and 
<br />
possibly a global measure on the space of all possible laws of physics, 
<br />
although not necessarily).
<br />
<br />This shouldn't be so hard to swallow, even for a strict Platonist--after 
<br />
all, we expect the laws of arithmetic to be the same in all possible 
<br />
universes, and I don't really see how something like information theory 
<br />
could change either.  If there's really a theory of consciousness out there, 
<br />
my hope is that it would be similar to information theory, deducible from a 
<br />
few basic first principles which perhaps could be justified on philosophical 
<br />
grounds.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It's true that under the right mapping, the ticks of a clock can be seen 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; doing any &quot;computation&quot; you please, including a simulation of an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;intelligent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; A.I.  But if you wanted to actually implement this mapping in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; world so you could interact with the A.I., you'd end up reproducing the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; causal structure of the A.I. on the computer (or brain) responsible for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; mapping.  That's my intuition anyway--since I don't have a precise
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; definition of &quot;causal structure&quot; I can't be sure.
</em><br />
<br />[snip comments about whether a clock is a good implementation or not]
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;But if the interaction is maintained, why fret about the internal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;implementation?
</em><br />
<br />This position seems pretty close to behaviorism...I believe that there is 
<br />
more to me than my outward actions.  A lookup table that could only simulate 
<br />
10 seconds of interaction with me would almost certainly not experience what 
<br />
I experience over the course of 10 seconds, because there's plenty of things 
<br />
going on in my mind that can't be expressed in a 10-second soundbite, but 
<br />
are part of my conscious experience nevertheless.
<br />
<br />That should be a private matter between an entity and
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;its maker (including its code optimizer, which might take a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;straightforward, Chalmers-blessed causal AI formulation and turn it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;into a humongous lookup table purely for the sake of efficiency.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Chalmers might say that level 20 optimization (partial tables) leaves
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the system conscious, but level 21 (full table) turns it into a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;zombie. I say he's blowing smoke: there's no justificiation for such a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;distinction.).
</em><br />
<br />Well, I'll tell you why  *I* think a reasonable theory of consciousness 
<br />
would distinguish between an A.I. and a lookup table with identical output, 
<br />
and you can tell me what you think.
<br />
<br />My argument against lookup tables is based on the fact that the only way to 
<br />
build a lookup table is to actually run a regular simulation through all 
<br />
possible inputs, and then record its outputs.  In terms of the intuition I 
<br />
outlined before, the simulation would have the right &quot;causal structure&quot;, 
<br />
while the lookup table is basically just a huge searchable archive of 
<br />
recordings of the simulation in different circumstances.  There's no more 
<br />
reason to think a lookup table is conscious then there is to think a 
<br />
videotape of me talking is conscious.
<br />
<br />Once again, I'm making the assumption that there's *some* set of objective 
<br />
psychophysical laws, and that these laws would tell you a lookup table 
<br />
doesn't give rise to the same experiences as a detailed simulation.  Another 
<br />
way of saying this is that I think multiple physical instantiations of a 
<br />
simulation add to the global probability of the associated conscious 
<br />
experience, but viewing a recording multiple times does not. (The reason to 
<br />
believe that multiple physical instantiations raise the probability is that 
<br />
if certain types of physical systems are more common in the multiverse, that 
<br />
will make certain types of experiences more probable, explaining why 'laws 
<br />
of physics going crazy'-type experiences are unlikely.)
<br />
<br />what they mean by the term
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;literary goodness&quot; is completely different from the quantity in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; axioms.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Of course I assume the goodness axiom operates on the universes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;primitives in conjunction with the other axioms, producing its own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;unique theorems, which would affect experiments, evolution and brain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;operation.
</em><br />
<br />Even if that were possible, if we were to read one of the &quot;great&quot; novels 
<br />
from such a universe we might still think it was garbage...we might say that 
<br />
the laws of such a universe were systematically biasing the aesthetic 
<br />
judgements of the inhabitants of that universe.
<br />
<br />Anyway, remember that my original comment was that it doesn't make sense to 
<br />
have two universes that are *identical* in terms of both physical events and 
<br />
conscious experiences, but which differ in terms of the &quot;real&quot; literary 
<br />
goodness of various books.  OTOH, it does seem to make sense to imagine a 
<br />
universe physically like ours but in which all the inhabitants are 
<br />
&quot;zombies&quot;, even if that turns out to be impossible under whatever theory of 
<br />
consciousness we eventually adopt.  If this intuition is correct, it tells 
<br />
us that consciousness is not the same sort of thing as literary goodness or 
<br />
cuteness.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;mind fire&quot; (one of my favorite parts of the book, incidentally)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Thanks very much for the comment.  Some of the reviewers thought
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I'd simply gone loony there.
</em><br />
<br />Yeah, whenever you take A.I. seriously and extrapolate the consequences, you 
<br />
tend to come up with loony-sounding scenarios...but the &quot;mind fire&quot; idea 
<br />
really made a lot of sense to me when I started thinking about it (although 
<br />
it's possible future posthuman intelligences could get more computational 
<br />
power by travelling through a wormhole into a designer 'baby universe' or 
<br />
something similar).  I also enjoyed the whole discussion on &quot;Exes&quot; in 
<br />
general, like the section about the diffences in the societies of those on 
<br />
the moving frontier of inhabited space and those in the crowded center.
