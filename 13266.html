</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hi Folks,
</em><br />
<br />Hi Max, Nice you remember us.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; After a decade of procrastination, I've finally finished writing up a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sequel to that paper that I wrote back in 1996 (Is &quot;the theory of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everything'' merely the ultimate ensemble theory?) that's been the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subject of so much interesting discussion in this group.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Are you aware of the critics I have made about it, and about  
<br />
Schmidhuber approach? I am not sure you have taken those critics into  
<br />
account in your new paper, although on some point it is indeed clearer.  
<br />
Oh, I see you are mistaken about Godel's theorem (hope you don't mind  
<br />
the typical frankness in our discussion, mainly for reason of being  
<br />
short). Perhaps this will be an opportunity to have a straight  
<br />
discussion, and to help the go beyond the usual gap between logicians,  
<br />
which in my opinion have developed the right tools, and the physicists,  
<br />
which in general have kept the right (scientific realist) motivations.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's entitled &quot;The Mathematical Universe&quot;, and you'll find it at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0646">http://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0646</a> and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/toe.html">http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/toe.html</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - I'd very much appreciate any comments that you may have.
</em><br />
<br />I will.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The purpose of this paper is both to clarify what I mean by the Level
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; IV Multiverse and to further explore various implications, so it has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lots of discussion of stuff like the simulation argument, the relation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to Schmidhuber's ideas, Gödel incompleteness and Church-Turing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; incomputability.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Schmidhuber leaves the list more than 5 years ago without answering  
<br />
questions adressed to him. I hope you will be more serious. Apparently  
<br />
you are not aware of my works, which I have explained more than once in  
<br />
this list, and has been the subject of my PhD thesis in France a long  
<br />
time ago (and this 20 years after having published the results). It is  
<br />
not entirely your fault because I have not yet send my papers to the  
<br />
arXiv.org or international journal. I don't submit more than one paper  
<br />
every 500 years (g), and you are lucky because I have just do this  
<br />
recently and my paper has been accepted for the cie 2007:
<br />
<a href="http://www.amsta.leeds.ac.uk/~pmt6sbc/cie07.html">http://www.amsta.leeds.ac.uk/~pmt6sbc/cie07.html</a>   (nice if you could  
<br />
come, but it is high level logic).
<br />
All my other papers was ordered by kind people with serious motivation  
<br />
in my results or my approach (similar to ideas discussed in this list,  
<br />
and indeed close (but quite different) of yours. You can find most of  
<br />
those papers in my url below. Alas it does not contain my last two  
<br />
papers (for copyright reason). One of the main result is that &quot;if I am  
<br />
a machine&quot; then the observable universe cannot be described by a  
<br />
machine: the laws of physics have to emerge from the math of cognition  
<br />
(not of human cognition but of universal machine introspection). The  
<br />
other result is a &quot;direct&quot; partial extraction of the physical laws by  
<br />
the interview of an ideally self-referentially correct universal  
<br />
machine, and evidences adds up that indeed there is a quantum computer  
<br />
exploitable in &quot;real time&quot; in the neighborhood of almost all classical  
<br />
universal machines. This shows there is plausibly a mathematical  
<br />
justification of the qubits from the bits. So the  
<br />
Everett-Graham-Deutsch-Zurek qubit from bit transformation admits a  
<br />
reciprocal. This is going in your direction (classical platonist  
<br />
mathematicalism), but like with Penrose, the reasons differ.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Please let me apologize in advance for the fact that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sections III, IV and the appendix of this paper are quite technical,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so if you're among the 99.99% who don't have a Ph.D. in theoretical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics, perhaps skip those sections. I've added links to more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; accessible papers touching on some of these issues at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/toe.html">http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/toe.html</a>, and I'll try to write
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something less obtuse soon.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Finally, if you discover a good time stretching device, please let me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; know! Although I'm embarrassed that I haven't found the time to follow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and participate in the fascinating discussions in this group, the fact
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that there's such interest has inspired and motivated me to continue
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pursuing these ideas despite the discouragement from mainstream
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; academia. So thanks for the encouragement!
</em><br />
<br />Thanks to you, Max. I appreciate very much your effort to explain  
<br />
Everett. I really love your paper with Wheeler. And I appreciate you  
<br />
have the courage you show in tackling very difficult questions which  
<br />
are indeed a little bit out of the mainstream fashion. I have myself  
<br />
got trouble after publishing the quantum suicide in 1988, like I got  
<br />
problem in the seventies with the more general &quot;computationist  
<br />
suicide&quot;. You can consider my work as a generalisation of Everett's  
<br />
(but see also Otto Rossler's endophysics) embedding of the subject (the  
<br />
physicist) in the physical world (quantum mechanics), indeed I embed  
<br />
the mathematician in arithmetic; or you can see it as a detailed  
<br />
reconstruction of Penrose's argument, with similar conclusions  
<br />
(although Penrose is deadly wrong on Godel). In my Siena paper, I show  
<br />
that the interview of the self-referentially correct machine (I call  
<br />
them Lobian in my thesis, papers and in this list) provides a cute,  
<br />
transparent, purely arithmetical (but empirically testable),  
<br />
interpretation of Plotinus's theology (including is Plato-Aristotelian  
<br />
theory of matter: it is this one which makes the theory testable). This  
<br />
shows also that once we assume the computationalist hypothesis (in the  
<br />
form &quot;I am a machine&quot;, not in the form the physical universe is a  
<br />
machine), the theory of everything, whatever it is, splits into a  
<br />
scientifically communicable part, and a scientifically not communicable  
<br />
part, and this shows Plotinus is right in his critics of Aristotelian  
<br />
theology. To be sure the machine does address some similar critics to  
<br />
Plotinus.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately I don't have find a way for stretching time, and I am  
<br />
myself a bit busy. I will read your sequel at ease, and let you know my  
<br />
comments. Hope you will be able to stretch time a bit by yourself so  
<br />
that we will be able to discuss and clarify possible misunderstandings.
<br />
In the meantime you can read both the Universal Dovetailer Argument,  
<br />
and an introduction to the Lobian interview in my paper:
