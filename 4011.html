<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the impetus for increased acceptance of MWI models comes from the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cosmologists.
</em><br />
<br />It was in DeWitt's article, &quot;Quantum mechanics and reality,&quot; Physics  
<br />
Today, September 1970, reprinted in the collection &quot;The Many-Worlds  
<br />
Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics,&quot; edited by Bryc DeWitt and Neill  
<br />
Graham, 1973.
<br />
<br />&quot;Moreover a decision between the two interpretations may ultimately be  
<br />
made on grounds other than direct laboratory experimentation. For  
<br />
example, in the very early moments of the universe, during the  
<br />
cosmological &quot;Big Bang,&quot; the universal wave function may have possessed  
<br />
an overall coherence as yet unimpaired by condensation into  
<br />
non-interfering branches. Such initial coherence may have testable  
<br />
implications for cosmology.&quot; (p. 165 of the reprint volume).
<br />
<br />(Glad to see my memory hasn't failed me. DeWitt's article made a big  
<br />
splash when it first got wide notice with that 1970 article. Around  
<br />
that time, &quot;Physics Today&quot; was where we found many wild things. A  
<br />
beautiful cover painting of a black hole, the first such graphic I'd  
<br />
seen...perhaps it's scanned and on the Web someplace, as it was a  
<br />
seminal image, from January 1970, if I remember correctly. And another  
<br />
cover from around that era was of O'Neill's proposal for L-5 colonies  
<br />
and powersats.)
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; What's the problem here? I find it utterly plausible that we would be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; in a universe where matter exists, where stars exist, where entropy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; gradients exist, etc., and NOT in a universe where the physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; constants or structure of the universe makes life more difficult or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; impossible (or where the densities and entropy gradients mean that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; evolution of complex structures might take 100 billion years, or more,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; instead of the billion or so years it apparently took).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The problem is more formal, that if we abandon measurement as a special
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; feature of the physics, there is no longer an axiom that says that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probability is proportional to amplitude squared.
</em><br />
<br />I'm not an expert on this. Jeffrey Bub, in &quot;Interpreting the Quantum  
<br />
World,&quot; 1997, cites several classes of resolutions of the &quot;measurement  
<br />
problem.&quot; He calls them the &quot;For all practical purposes&quot; (FAPP) model,  
<br />
after Bell, the &quot;change the linear dynamics&quot; model, and the &quot;modify the  
<br />
orthodox Dirac-von Neumann interpretation principle.&quot; From what I can  
<br />
tell, the Copenhagen interpretation is already a mixed state, so to  
<br />
speak, of bits and pieces of Bohr's and Heisenberg's interpretations.
<br />
<br />By the way, issues of observers and measurements are obviously fraught  
<br />
with &quot;Chinese boxes&quot; types of problems. In the Schrodinger's Cat  
<br />
pedantic example, if the &quot;cat alive or cat dead&quot; measurement is made at  
<br />
the end of one hour by opening the sealed box, what if a video camera  
<br />
had been also sealed inside the box, and had seen the cat breathe in  
<br />
the cyanide gas at 10 minutes into the experiment? Does this imply the  
<br />
&quot;wave function collapsed&quot; at the time of the measurement by the human  
<br />
observers, at the one hour point, or at the time the video camera  
<br />
unambiguously recorded the cat's death?
<br />
<br />One could arrange a thought experiment involving literally a series of  
<br />
boxes within boxes, each being opened at, say, one minute intervals  
<br />
after the cyanide was released or not released. One set of observers  
<br />
sees the cat either alive or dead at the end of the canonical one hour  
<br />
period. But they are sealed inside a box. After one minute, their box  
<br />
is opened, and the observers in the next-larger box then see the  
<br />
&quot;collapse of the wave function at the 61-minute point.&quot; After another  
<br />
minute, their box is opened and a new set of observer sees &quot;the  
<br />
collapse of the wave function at the 62-minute point.&quot;
<br />
<br />And so on. (I don't know if I'm just reinventing a thought experiment  
<br />
someone developed many decades ago...it seems like a natural idea.)
<br />
<br />Seen this way, the &quot;collapse of the wave function&quot; in the Schrodinger's  
<br />
Cat thought experiment is seen as a problem of knowledge, not something  
<br />
quasi-mystical about an instantaneous collapse of some psi-squared  
<br />
function.
<br />
<br />(More interesting are the delayed choice experiments.)
<br />
<br />My hunch is that the answer will lie in some of the work Chris Isham is  
<br />
doing (I've cited this in some past messages). What is characteristic  
<br />
of quantum events is that &quot;honest observers will never disagree on what  
<br />
happened&quot; (to paraphrase what Lee Smolin cites in his book, &quot;Three  
<br />
Roads...&quot;)
<br />
<br />To an outside observer, the humans watching the box, the outcome is  
<br />
unknowable until they open the box. Once they open the box, they and  
<br />
everyone else observing will agree unambiguously as to the outcome. And  
<br />
they will agree with what the video camera recorded.
<br />
<br />The measurement or observation process is just acting as a subobject  
<br />
classifier, with one of the key properties of such topos-theoretic  
<br />
structures being that once a subobject classification has been made,  
<br />
there's no going back. Heyting --&gt; Boolean, where there is never a  
<br />
situation where some observers report &quot;alive&quot; and others report &quot;dead.&quot;
<br />
<br />(Smolin makes this point about cosmology, but it also applies to  
<br />
quantum cosmology, and perhaps to many other areas. John Baez has been  
<br />
writing recently about &quot;q-logic&quot; being a superset of &quot;logic.&quot; He may be  
<br />
on to something, or he may just be giving a new name to some topos  
<br />
theory notions...I need to spend more time thinking and learning.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The conventional formulation, as described for example at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/">http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/</a> 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mathematical_formulation_of_quantum_mechanics,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has special axioms related to measurement.  Systems evolve according to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Schrodinger equation except when they are being measured, when we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; get wave function collapse.  MWI rejects the axioms related to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observables
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and collapse.  In the page above we can eliminate axiom 3 and probably
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; axiom 2 as well.  You are left with nothing but Hilbert space and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Schrodinger equation.  It's a simpler set of axioms.
</em><br />
<br />The Tegmark and Wheeler paper (in Sci Am, IIRC) talks about this issue.
<br />
<br />I'm not very convinced that MWI is simpler in any meaningful way. But  
<br />
I'll be thinking about it more.
<br />
<br />Deutsch is pretty convincing in his argument that the double slit  
<br />
experiment, a century old now, is compelling evidence that single  
<br />
photons going through one or the other of two slits &quot;must be&quot;  
<br />
interfering with the myriad of photons in all the nearby universes  
<br />
where similar experiments are happening.
<br />
<br />(Of course, the alternate interpretation is just the familar  
<br />
wave-particle duality, with photons sometimes exhibiting particle-like  
<br />
properties (as in the photoelectric effect) and other times exhibiting  
<br />
wave-like properties (double slits). I have no particular problem  
<br />
believing this is &quot;just as simple&quot; as postulating nearby universes. I  
<br />
have a thought experiment on this which I'll put into a separate post,  
<br />
after I sleep on it tonight.)
<br />
<br />More convincing to me has always been the quantum computer situation.  
<br />
if someone builds a QC which can factor a 1000-digit number, I'll be  
<br />
convinced other nearby universes exist.
<br />
<br />(Though even here there is a &quot;wave-like&quot; interpretation favored by  
<br />
some, that &quot;qubits&quot; are handling the parallelism.)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; effects, etc.) are only known to, say, 20 decimal places (if that, of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; course). Because the &quot;actual&quot; positions, masses, sphericities, static
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; charges, etc.  are perhaps defined by 40-digit or even 200-digit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; numbers, the Laplacian dream of a suffiicently powerful mind being  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; able
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to know the future is dashed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is true in practice, but I think there is still a significant
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; difference between deterministic systems like classical physics or the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MWI, and inherently non-deterministic systems like the conventional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Copenhagen interpretation of QM.  In the latter you have the difficult
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; philosophical problem of explaining where all the information comes  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from.
</em><br />
<br />I'll ponder this.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is what led Schmidhuber to suggest that quantum randomness is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generated by a pseudo random number generator; otherwise you can't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simulate the universe on a computer because computers can't create
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; true random bits.  The Copenhagen interpretation is fundamentally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non-computable.
</em><br />
<br />Maybe too much is made of randomness vs. pseudorandomness.
<br />
<br />Here's an example where even in a universe with &quot;no local randomness&quot;  
<br />
(no spontaneous decay, nothing not locally deterministic) unpredictable  
<br />
bits can be generated. The example is impractical, slow, etc., but it  
<br />
makes the point.
<br />
<br />Imagine powerful telescopes aimed at two distant and very, very fuzzy  
<br />
galaxies approximately at opposite ends of the observable universe. If  
<br />
Galaxy A produces a supernova before Galaxy B does, call it a &quot;1.&quot;  
<br />
Otherwise, a &quot;0.&quot;
<br />
<br />This Galactic Random Number Generator, or GNRG, cannot be predicted or  
<br />
influenced (outcome altered) by any being subject to the laws of  
<br />
relativity. The two galaxies are &quot;spacelike to the max,&quot; being  
<br />
separated by perhaps 15 billion light years, yadda yadda. We on Earth  
<br />
can see the supernovae if and when they occur, but neither galaxy can  
<br />
see the other.
<br />
<br />I can imagine many variants of this example, all cases where finite  
<br />
beings or computers in the universe are limited in what they can know  
<br />
by physics and cosmology constraints.
<br />
<br />Now I am not saying that this has anything to do with quantum  
<br />
randomness, just making the point that we know of no omniscient,  
<br />
omnipresent, omnipotent beings which could see all galaxies and know  
<br />
whether a &quot;1&quot; or a &quot;0&quot; would be recorded in this experiment.
<br />
<br />Are folks here familiar with the &quot;holographic&quot; picture of information  
<br />
flow near event horizons?
