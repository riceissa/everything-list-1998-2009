<br /><br />I have often explain UDA on this list. There is a very older version  
<br />
in 15 steps, and a more recent in 08 steps.
<br />
You could search in the archive of this list.
<br />
Or look at my Sane04 paper:
<br />
<a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/SANE2004MARCHALAbstract.html">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/SANE2004MARCHALAbstract.html</a>
<br />
You can print the slides. I refer now often to UDA-i with i from 00 to  
<br />
8, which are the main step of the reasoning.     PDF slide
<br />
<br />UDA is for Universal Dovetailer Argument. The UD provides a concrete  
<br />
base for a reasoning in line with the &quot;everything&quot; &quot;or many worlder&quot;  
<br />
open minded philosophy common on this list, especially for the  
<br />
&quot;relativist&quot; one (where proba are always conditional).
<br />
UDA is provably available to Universal (in the theoretical computer  
<br />
science sense of Post, Turing, Kleene, Church, ... &quot; machine, which  
<br />
leads to a machine version of UDA: AUDA (Arithmetical UDA).
<br />
<br />UDA is mainly an argument showing that, assuming comp, the mind body  
<br />
problem reduce to the body problem.
<br />
And AUDA shows a natural path to extract the solution of the body  
<br />
problem by that &quot;interview&quot; of the universal machine.
<br />
<br />Much older versions are in French (my PhD actually, and more older  
<br />
paper). See my URL.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I try to be as close to facts as possible, and the most plausible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explanation for me, trough natural selection, is that consciousness is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a processing device made by natural selection as an adaptation to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical environment, social environment included.
</em><br />
<br /><br />This is plausible for most of the human and animal part of  
<br />
consciousness. It is a reasonable local description. But globally a  
<br />
dual version of this has the advantage of explaining how nature itself  
<br />
evolves, from sort of &quot;competition and selection&quot; of pieces of machine  
<br />
dreams, which are &quot;easy&quot; to define in arithmetic (assuming comp ...).
<br />
It is normal that comp depends on the many non trivial results in  
<br />
computer science. A universal machine is itself a rather non obvious  
<br />
notion.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So I support
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter-&gt; consciousness.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I could explain why it has to look locally that way, but it can not  
<br />
work in the big picture, unless you make both matter and mind, not  
<br />
just infinite, but very highly infinite ... (just read UDA, I think I  
<br />
have make progress through those explanation on the list).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dualism is the result of my subjective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience,
</em><br />
<br />I doubt this can be. I would say it is a result of your experience  
<br />
together with a bet (instinctive or/and rational) in a independent  
<br />
reality.
<br />
you cannot experience the independent reality. You can experience only  
<br />
the dependent reality, but not as a dependent one, for this you need  
<br />
to bet on the independent one. What makes this diificult is that we  
<br />
make that bet instinctively since birth and beyond.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and my subjective experience is  the most objective fact
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that I can reach.
</em><br />
<br />I see what you mean, but the subjective experience, although real and  
<br />
true, and undoubtable, is subjective. It exists as far as you cannot  
<br />
prove to an other that it exists.  To communicate you have to bet on  
<br />
tools and on others, and other many doubtable (yet plausible) mind  
<br />
constructions.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I cannot support this Kantian notion consciousness -&gt; matter.
</em><br />
<br /><br />The problem is that if you are ready to attribute consciousness to a  
<br />
device, by its virtue of simulating digitally a conscious brain at  
<br />
some correct level of description, you will be forced to attribute  
<br />
that consciousness to an infinity of computations already defined by  
<br />
the additive and multiplicative structure of the numbers (by UDA). A  
<br />
quasi direct consequence is that if a machine look at herself below  
<br />
its substitution level, it will build indirect evidences of a flux of  
<br />
many (a continuum) of computational histories (a typical quantum  
<br />
feature, I mean for QM without wave collapse). But comp forces the  
<br />
structure of those many realities (or dreams) to be determined by  
<br />
specifiable number theoretical relations.  Those relations are either  
<br />
extensional relations (like in number theory), or intensional  
<br />
relations (like in computer science, where number can also points  
<br />
toward other numbers, and effective set of numbers). It makes  
<br />
computationalism testable. The genral shape of QM confirm it, but  
<br />
cosmogenesis remains troubling ...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The final words that I can say about the &quot;hard problem&quot; of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness is that any conversation with a robot, with the self-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; module that  I described in the previous post, will give answers about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; qualia indistinguisable from the answers of any of you. He would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indeed doubt about if you are indeed robots and he is the only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious being on earth.  Just as any of you may think.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Its self module would not say &quot;I perceive the green as green&quot; because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; he has this as an standard answer, like a fake Turing test program,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but because it can zoom in the details of every leaf, grass etc and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; verify that the range of ligh frecuencies are in the range of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; frequencias that  a computer programmer assigned  to green and a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; trainer later told him to call it &quot;green&quot;.  He even can have its own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; philosophical theories about qualia, the self etc. He even may ask
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; himself about the origins of moral  and self determination, and even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all of this may force him to believe in God.  So we must conclude that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; he have its own qualia and all the attributes of consciousness. in no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; less degree  than I could believe in yours.
</em><br />
<br /><br />A priori I have no problem, although I could pretend you have solved  
<br />
only the easy problem.
<br />
The hard problem is: why do *we* (and not just a robot)  have those  
<br />
qualia, if robot can have the same talk and behavior? You have still  
<br />
to explain the nature of the qualia, and why we have to experience  
<br />
them, given that a mechanical explanation seems to make them  
<br />
unnecessary, especially if you invoke Darwinian natural selection. And  
<br />
then, by UDA you have to (re)explain what is matter and how to relate  
<br />
them with the qualia. Eventually matter will appear to be a sort of  
<br />
sharable qualia (or comp is false).
<br />
I do appreciate your willingness of not treating a self-referentially  
<br />
correct machine as a zombie, but providing a machine with the correct  
<br />
behavior and the relevant discourse does not yet explain the *meaning*  
<br />
of those discourses. Some could argue that on the contrary it makes  
<br />
those meaning illusory.  Theories remains to be done, and if something  
<br />
is true and unexplainable, this has to be justified too. Amazingly   
<br />
you can extract both the communicable and incommunicable part of that  
<br />
discourse from an interview of the machine , and this has  already be  
<br />
done (thanks to Gödel Post Turing ... and computer science/logic). It  
<br />
is the AUDA part: the (admittedly rough, concerning only ideally  
<br />
correct machines) translation of UDA in the language of a universal  
<br />
machine, like (Peano) Arithmetic.
<br />
And given that physics is testable, this makes comp testable (well in  
<br />
AUDA the definition of the internal points of view are debatable, and  
<br />
better solution could be imaginable, I have used the old definition  
<br />
you can find in the Theaetetus of Plato. They work very well thanks to  
<br />
the subtleties of the Gödel-Löb self-reference logic.
<br />
<br />UDA is easy (except the step 07 and 8 which asks for more work).
<br />
AUDA is difficult because you have to study Mathematical Logic to get  
<br />
the point, and Quantum Mechanics to believe it.
<br />
<br />UDA+AUDA leads to McGuin Mysterianism, as explained and justified by  
<br />
the &quot;betting, praying&quot; machine. There is a gap of explanation, which  
<br />
can be justified almost completely from the first person point of  
<br />
view.  From the third person point of view there is no gap at all.  
<br />
Machines can already see this, and this should please you, if I  
<br />
understand you well.
<br />
<br />Matter then play a special role in the dreams, especially those  
<br />
&quot;collective dreams&quot;, but it is part of the dreams. We are in the  
<br />
number matrix, if you want a short description. My point is not that  
<br />
this is true, but that this is Popper-refutable. It is not a question  
<br />
of liking it or not, but of making the math and the experiments. All  
<br />
in all,  it makes many fundamental question less obvious that many  
<br />
think.
