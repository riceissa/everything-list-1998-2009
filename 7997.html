<em class="quotelev1">  &gt;I do think so. See Deutsch book which make clear that the MWI is 
</em><br />
based on comp. But it is explicit in Everett and in Wheeler 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;assessment. From a strict logical point of view, ad hoc non comp 
</em><br />
theory of MWI can be built but it is really out of topic.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; That may be Deutsch's opinion (though, again, I doubt he says 
</em><br />
anything like that in his book) but I have read both
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; Everett's thesis and both Wheeler's and DeWitt's defenses of it and 
</em><br />
in no way shape or form does anything like YD
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;even figure in them!!!
</em><br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Literally, of course. YD is just a tools for explaining what it is &quot;to 
<br />
be like an Everett memory machine&quot;. It is implicit in reducing the 
<br />
quantum uncertainty to the ignorance of which branch we are in a 
<br />
superposition. Mathematically it can be justified by Gleason theorem or 
<br />
by Graham Hartle type of infinite &quot;frequency&quot; operator. See the 
<br />
Preskill's course on quantum computation which makes a nice summary.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't quite know what you mean by an &quot;Everett memory machine&quot; 
<br />
neither could I find a definition (or a mention of it) in Preskill's 
<br />
lectures. If by this you mean something like a machine whose memory 
<br />
would track the successive branchings such
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;thing is innimical to the Everett notion that all information 
<br />
contained in the universal wave function is relative and all 
<br />
probabilities
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;are conditional. Otherwise all &quot;memory machines&quot; are either (1) 
<br />
classical and thus relativised to one branch or (2) quantal and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;permanently standing in a superposition of branches so that their 
<br />
memories would be as &quot;un situated&quot; as that of any other
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;subject. As for your &quot;justification&quot; I will just quote Preskill on a 
<br />
piece of credo which is characteristic of Many-Worlders:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;My own view is that the Everett Interpretation of quantum theory 
<br />
provides a satisfying explanation of measurement and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;of the origin of randomness, but does not yet fully explain the 
<br />
quantum mechanical rules for computing probabilities. A full
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;explanation should go beyond the frequency interpretation of 
<br />
probability --- ideally it would place the Bayesian view of
<br />
&nbsp;probability on a secure objective foundation.&quot;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Though this is highly disputable in itself I think it shows quite well 
<br />
where your statement above is mistaken.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt;[GK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; Let me understand this: your aim is to derive QM from an hypothesis 
</em><br />
which, you know, is contradicted by QM ?!!!? Wow!
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt;I have already answered.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;That is a Yes, than.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;The current aim is to derive SWE (by which I mean the correct 
<br />
geometrical-gravity extension of Schroedinger Wave Equation) from comp. 
<br />
I don't expect to derive anything like SWE + collapse (although this is 
<br />
not entirely excluded!).
<br />
&nbsp;What I have already proved is that
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;1) if you make the move from &quot;SWE + collapse&quot; to &quot;SWE + comp&quot;, then 
<br />
&nbsp;from purely arithmetical reasons you are forced to go the the quite 
<br />
simpler theory &quot;comp&quot;. This is the result of the UDA reasoning and you 
<br />
are invited to criticize it: it presuppose some &quot;folk-psychology&quot; and 
<br />
some passive understanding of Church thesis. See the slide of my 2004 
<br />
SANE paper for a presentation is eight steps.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;2) I translate that reasoning into the language of a large class of 
<br />
universal machine and got more constructive description of the physics 
<br />
you need (by &quot;1)&quot;) to derive from comp. This is technically more 
<br />
involved. It suppresses the need of the folk psychology.
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;Bruno
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I decrypt the above as a statement that you are NOT trying to derive 
<br />
QM but a more general TOE, so that assuming YD is no
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;different than say, assuming subplankian determinism like 't Hooft or 
<br />
Hiley do. I guess you need a lot more good luck than I first wished 
<br />
you!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Because you referred me to Deutsch's book I too a look at his own 
<br />
defense of the Everett interpretation and was reminded also
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;of his not so passive understanding of the CT. As it turns out his 
<br />
whole masterplan hinges on his belief that *CT is a result of
<br />
&nbsp;Physics* so he is really no great help to you.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Best regards,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Godfrey
