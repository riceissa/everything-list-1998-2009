<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Have you read Francis Schaeffer's trilogy of books: The God Who Is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; There, Escape From Reason, and He Is There And He Is Not Silent.  He
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; talks about the consequences of the belief in the uniformity of natural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; causes in a closed system.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is no way that I can give a little summary, but I'll try anyway.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think this will also go towards addressing Stathis' allusion to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; faith.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One thing Schaeffer did was remind us that the assumptions of nature
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and cause were foundational to modern science.  We have to assume that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is a nature to reality in order to study it and use our reason to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; make sense of it.  Reality has to &quot;make sense&quot; inherently, i.e. it has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to have an order to it, in order for us to &quot;make sense&quot; of it.  Our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reason (rationality) makes use of antithesis, to induce cause and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; effect.  Perhaps nature and cause do not appear as formal assumptions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in comp, but do you not make use of a belief in them in the process of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thinking and talking about comp, and surely in the process of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; empirically verifying/falsifying it?

</em><br />
Who said nature has to make sense? We make sense of it to the extent that it 
<br />
is ordered, but it goes:

<br />
we can make sense of nature, therefore it must be ordered,

<br />
not,

<br />
nature must be ordered, therefore we should be able to make sense of it.

<br />
You didn't exactly say the latter, I know, but my assumption is that the universe 
<br />
doesn't care in the slightest what I think or what happens to me, which is not 
<br />
something theists are generally comfortable with.

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Schaeffer maintained that the basis for antithesis is not that it was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an invention of Aristotle or anyone, but that the basis for antithesis
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is reality itself, based on the God who is there (as opposed to not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being there).  The existence of the personal God answers the questions:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) Why is there something rather than nothing?  i.e. the question of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the origin of the form of the universe, why does it &quot;make sense&quot;?  What
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is the basis for the nature of reality and beauty?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) Why is man the way he/she is?  Why is man able to have language and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do science, and make sense of the world?  Why is man able to love and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; figure out what is right?  What is the basis for meaning?  What is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; basis for mind?  How can persons know one another?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3) Why is man able to know anything, and know that he knows what he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; knows?  What is the basis for truth?  What is truth?

</em><br />
The first two questions are difficult, but they apply to God as much as the universe, 
<br />
despite ontological argument trickery whereby God is just defined as existing necessarily 
<br />
(Gaunilo's answer to Anselm was that you can also just define a &quot;perfect island&quot; as an 
<br />
island which exists necessarily, and therefore cannot not exist).

<br />
The other questions are easy: blind evolution made us this way.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, from the birth of modern science, we have taken a journey to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dispense with any kind of faith and try to be exhaustive in our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; automony and control.  Ironically we have abandoned rationality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (including antithesis), and we have abandoned ourselves to ourselves.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We are lost in a silent sea of meaningless 0's and 1's, and man is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is why I said that when we put ourselves at the center of our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; worldview, it is a prison.

</em><br />
Er, science is usually taken as more concerned with rationality than religion and 
<br />
less anthropocentric than religion. Turning it around seems more a rhetorical ploy 
<br />
than a defensible position.
