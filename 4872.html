----- Original Message ----- 
<br />
From: &quot;Jesse Mazer&quot; &lt;lasermazer.domain.name.hidden&gt;
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  I agree that a moment from now there will be a number of exactly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;equal copies. Nevertheless, I am sure I will only experience being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;one of them, so this is what I mean by ' me ' - the actual experiences
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;I will have. Maybe some copy of me will win the lottery every time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;I play, but that does not give me reason to spend my money on it. I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;still believe that the probability that 'I' win is 1/10^6, even if on a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  multiverse sense, the probability that at least one copy of me wins is
</em><br />
1.
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;The same should be the case with death if we assume a materialistic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;position.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But you should no more expect to end up in a branch where you died than in
</em><br />
a
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; branch where you were never born in the first place. Consider, instead of
</em><br />
a
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; branching multiverse, a Star-Trek-style transporter/duplicator in a single
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe, which can deconstruct you and reconstruct exact copies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; atom-by-atom in distant locations (assuming the error introduced by the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; uncertainty principle is too small to make a difference--if you don't want
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to grant that, you could also assume this is all happening within a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deterministic computer simulation and that you are really an A.I.). To use
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno Marchal's example, suppose this duplicator recreates two identical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; copies of you, one in Washington and one in Moscow. As you step into the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; chamber, if you believe continuity of consciousness is &quot;real&quot; in some
</em><br />
sense
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and that it's meaningful to talk about the probabilities of different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible next experiences, it would probably make sense to predict from a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; first-person-point of view that you have about a 50% chance of finding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; yourself in Moscow and a 50% chance of finding yourself in Washington.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; On the other hand, suppose only a single reconstruction will be performed
</em><br />
in
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Washington--then by the same logic, you would probably predict the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probability of finding yourself in Washington is close to 100%, barring a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; freak accident. OK, so now go back to the scenario where you're supposed
</em><br />
to
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be recreated in both Washington and Moscow, except assume that at the last
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moment there's a power failure in Moscow and the recreator machine fails
</em><br />
to
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; activate. Surely this is no different from the scenario where you were
</em><br />
only
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; supposed to be recreated in Washington--the fact that they *intended* to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; duplicate you in Moscow shouldn't make any difference, all that matters is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that they didn't. But now look at another variation on the scenario, where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Moscow machine malfunctions and recreates your body missing the head.
</em><br />
I
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't think it makes sense to say you have a 50% chance of being &quot;killed&quot;
</em><br />
in
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this scenario--your brain is where your consciousness comes from, and
</em><br />
since
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it wasn't duplicated this is really no different from the scenario where
</em><br />
the
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Moscow machine failed to activate entirely. In fact, any malfunction in
</em><br />
the
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Moscow machine which leads to a duplicate that permanently lacks
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness should be treated the same way as a scenario where I was
</em><br />
only
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; supposed to be recreated in Washington, in terms of the subjective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probabilities. Extending this to the idea of natural duplication due to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different branches of a splitting multiverse, the probability should
</em><br />
always
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be 100% that my next experience is one of a universe where I have not been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; killed.
</em><br />
<br />I don't quite agree with that argument, even though I was intrigued in the
<br />
first
<br />
read. The reason is similar to those exposed by Hal finney in his reply to
<br />
this
<br />
post. These copies are not copies made by the branching of MWI.
<br />
<br />In fact, I believe that I will never experience being one of those copies.
<br />
Let me
<br />
see if I can support that:
<br />
Suppose you don't destroy the original, but merely make the copies (and this
<br />
also answers the later post from someone with the address
<br />
logical.domain.name.hidden). If a copy of me is made *in my own universe*, I
<br />
don't
<br />
expect to have the experiences of the copies. Suppose I sit on this copy
<br />
machine
<br />
in New York, and the information of the position and velocities (within
<br />
quantum uncertainty) of all particles in my body is copied. Suppose, for the
<br />
sake of the
<br />
argument, that the mere retrieval of this information should pose no problem
<br />
to
<br />
me. It should me harmless.
<br />
This information then travels by wire from the reader to the reproducer. An
<br />
almost
<br />
perfect copy of me is made in Paris. Should I, in that moment, expect to
<br />
have
<br />
the first-person 50% probability of suddenly seeing the eiffel tower? I
<br />
don't think
<br />
anyone would support that. And in that case, you shouldn't support the
<br />
notion that
<br />
you could ever be a copy of yourself, since you could always NOT destroy the
<br />
original in your example. Whenever you did, the original would have the
<br />
first-person experience of dying, i.e., it would never be conscious again.
<br />
<br />This example is similar to that of the Schwarzenegger movie where he had a
<br />
clone of himself made. Of course the making of the clone has no implication
<br />
in the original person's experiences whatsoever. For instance, if the bad
<br />
guy in the movie
<br />
offered you the opportunity of being cloned and win 1 million dollars, but
<br />
killing the original (you), would you accept it? Why or why not? The answer
<br />
to this question is the only thing that matters to us when talking about
<br />
Immortality.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The big assumption here, as I said earlier, is that there is some sort of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;objective&quot; truth about continuity of consciousness and subjective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probabilities, that it's not just a bunch of isolated observer-moments who
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just have an illusion of a consciousness which changes over time due to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; memories and expectations. See my thread on &quot;3 possible views of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'consciousness'&quot; here:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m2358.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m2358.html</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;If non-observing states are prohibited, then we should never expect to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;be in a coma, or anesthesized, for instance. Whenever you would be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;submitted to a surgery, you would see that the doctor somehow failed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;to apply the anesthesy correctly, and you would have a *very* conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;experience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't see any justification for that. Why can't your &quot;next&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer-moment after the anesthesia begins to take effect be of waking up
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hours later? That's a lot what waking up from dreamless unconsciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; feels like, subjectively.
</em><br />
<br />What I was saying was that the usual QI argument seems to imply that there
<br />
is
<br />
an external consciousness which cannot be definitely unconscious. But if
<br />
unconsciousness was prohibited somehow, the most probable thing was that you
<br />
would never be unconscious, since there are always universes where you never
<br />
are. But this is a very loose argument, and does not matter to the main
<br />
discussion.
<br />
<br />-Eric.
