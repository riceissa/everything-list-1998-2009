<em class="quotelev1">&gt; familiar

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with intuitionistic logic and category theory, is it really worth the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; trouble to learn them?
</em><br />
<br />I don't know. One learns a field for various reasons. Clearly a lot of 
<br />
people think &quot;classical logic with the right exceptions and terminology&quot; 
<br />
serves them well. A lot of others, though not as many, think program 
<br />
semantics and possible worlds semantics are best understood in the 
<br />
&quot;natural&quot; logic of time-varying sets and topos theory.  I'm in the 
<br />
latter category (no pun intended).
<br />
<br />I also don't know what your goals are, despite reading many of your 
<br />
posts. If, for example, you are looking for tools to understand a 
<br />
possible multiverse, or how multiverses in general might be constructed, 
<br />
I'm not at all sure any such tools have ever existed or _will_ ever 
<br />
exist, except insofar as tools for understanding toposes, lattices, etc. 
<br />
exist.
<br />
<br />This is quite different from understanding, say, general relativity, 
<br />
where the tools of differential geometry and exterior calculus are 
<br />
immediately useful for understanding and for calculations.
<br />
<br />The MWI/Tegmark/Egan stuff is very far out on the fringes, as we know, 
<br />
and there is unlikely to be anything one can do calculations of. Still, 
<br />
it seems likely that a _lot_ of mathematics is needed...a lot more math 
<br />
than physics, almost certainly.
<br />
<br />Modal logic seems to me to be _exactly_ the right logic for talking 
<br />
about possible states of existence, for talking about possible worlds, 
<br />
for talking about branching universes. So the issue is not &quot;But can't I 
<br />
find a way to do everything in ordinary logic?&quot; but is, rather, to think 
<br />
in terms of modal logic offering a more efficient &quot;basis&quot; (in the 
<br />
conceptual vector space), a basis with a smaller semantic gap between 
<br />
the formalism and the hypothesized world.
<br />
<br />(You might also want to take a look at the paper by Guts, a Russian, on 
<br />
a &quot;Topos-Theoretic Model of the Deutsch Multiverse.&quot; Available at the 
<br />
usual xxx.lanl.gov site.)
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For example, posets can certainly be studied and understood using
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; classical logic. How much does intuitionistic logic buy you here?
</em><br />
<br />Posets can certainly be studied with classical logic. However, posets 
<br />
fail the law of trichotomy, that two things when compared by some 
<br />
ordering result in one of three outcomes: A is less than B, A is greater 
<br />
than B, or A is equal to B. This is the &quot;common sense&quot; comparison of 
<br />
objects, one with a &quot;linear&quot; or &quot;total&quot; order. However, posets are 
<br />
partially-ordered precisely because they don't follow the law of 
<br />
trichotomy.
<br />
<br />Is one more natural than the other? More common? More useful?
<br />
<br />I have my own beliefs at this point.
<br />
<br />A book I strongly recommend, though it is difficult, is Paul Taylor's 
<br />
&quot;Practical Foundations of Mathematics.&quot; 1999. (I buy many books not to 
<br />
read straight through, but to consult, to draw insights and inspirations 
<br />
from, and to let me know what I need to learn more of. This is one of 
<br />
those books. The first 175 pages, which I've been reading from, is 
<br />
making more and more sense....the terms become familiar, I see 
<br />
connections with other areas, and by a process akin to &quot;analytic 
<br />
continuation&quot; the ensemble of ideas becomes more and more natural. 
<br />
Beyond these pages, though, it's mostly incomprehensible.)
<br />
<br />I recommend this book for the broad insights I am gaining from it, but 
<br />
not as any kind of manual for tinkering with multiverses! (insert silly 
<br />
smiley as one sees fit)
<br />
<br />My conclusion from  Tegmark's paper, which dovetailed with Egan's 
<br />
treatment of &quot;all topologies models&quot; in &quot;Distress,&quot; was that to make 
<br />
progress a lot of math needs to be learned. Which is my current approach.
<br />
<br />These are not my only inspirations. Indeed, I came to join this list 
<br />
after becoming fascinated (again, after a nearly 28-year absence) in 
<br />
topology, algebra, and the physics of time and cosmology.
<br />
<br />Seen this way, category and topos theory are worth studying for their 
<br />
own sake. I don't think it is likely that &quot;every conceivable universe 
<br />
with consistent laws of mathematics has actual existence&quot; (to nutshell 
<br />
my understanding of Tegmark's theory) is actually true (whatever that 
<br />
means). Nor do I take Schmidhuber's &quot;all running programs&quot; notion very 
<br />
seriously. Interesting ideas to play with, and to use some tools on.
<br />
<br />Strangely, then, I view these notions as places to apply the math I'm 
<br />
learning to. And I'm thinking small, in terms of simple systems. A paper 
<br />
I have mentioned a couple of times is directly in line with this 
<br />
approach: Fotini Markopoulou's &quot;The internal description of a causal 
<br />
set: What the universe looks like from the inside.&quot;
<br />
<br />Here's the paper number and abstract:

<br />The internal description of a causal set: What the universe looks like

from the inside
<br />
<br />Authors: Fotini Markopoulou

Comments: Version to appear in Comm.Math.Phys. (minor modifications). 37 
<br />
pages, several eps figures

<br />
<br />We describe an algebraic way to code the causal information of a 
<br />
discrete spacetime. The causal set C is transformed to a description in 
<br />
terms of the causal pasts of the events in C. This is done by an 
<br />
evolving set, a functor which to each event of C assigns its causal 
<br />
past. Evolving sets obey a Heyting algebra which is characterised by a 
<br />
non-standard notion of complement. Conclusions about the causal 
<br />
structure of the causal set can be drawn by calculating the complement 
<br />
of the evolving set. A causal quantum theory can be based on the quantum 
<br />
version of evolving sets, which we briefly discuss.
<br />
--end of excerpt--
<br />
<br />Take a look at these papers (hers, the Guts paper, the various Baez, 
<br />
Smolin, Crane, etc. papers). All free. Some are introductions. All have 
<br />
a fair amount to say about the nature of reality. The stuff on causal 
<br />
sets (lattices and posets) is of direct relevance to several areas of 
<br />
modern physics. The relevance to MWI and Tegmark-style meta-branchings 
<br />
seems clear to me.
<br />
<br />As far as the math of nonstandard logic goes, I think the most 
<br />
interesting application within our lifetimes will come with AI.
