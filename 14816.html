Marc,
<br />
your (long) post gave me a feeling of having returned into my childhood.
<br />
Back to the reductionist figments of the model view 'physical world' and
<br />
'conventional sciences'.
<br />
I should interjet a lot into your long text, in view of a 'totality-view'
<br />
(not yet adaquately formulated) - I choose to pick some details (as Stathis
<br />
did commendably) for some brief reflection. Kim picked 1 item: aesthetics.
<br />
*
<br />
Entropy is not a 'state', it is a math expression within thermodynamics, a
<br />
figment of a developmental stage in primitive, inadequate explanations of
<br />
inadequate observations over the millennia.
<br />
Big Bang cosmology is an erroneous fairytale based on an idea of Hubble (not
<br />
scrutinized for alternates) and a linear retrogradation in a nonlinear
<br />
development from an arbitrary state - incomparable with our today's
<br />
observable physical world system - applying the laws and concepts of the
<br />
latter. Hence all the marvels it contains wishfully.
<br />
Evolution of the universe handles the implied topic of the (physicists')
<br />
20th c. figment in the spirit of 18th c. Darwinism.
<br />
To escape from that I constructed a 'narrative' - (no claims for any
<br />
scientific acceptabilitiy) in which the timeless 'universe' - flash
<br />
undergoes, as looked from the inside &lt;organized into space and time&gt;, a
<br />
'history' from occurrence to re-dissipation,  called evolution. That may be
<br />
(sort of) teleological, since it has a final point to attain: the
<br />
re-distribution into the unspecified plenitude, invented for the narrative
<br />
only for 'living with our ignorance about the *origins*'.
<br />
*
<br />
The 'totality-view' represents an unlimited complexity beyond our present
<br />
capabilities to comprehend, or inspect in toto. This is why we think in cut
<br />
(limited) topical/functional/ideational models (including the sciences).
<br />
Occam's razor is a '2nd step' reduction (even simpler modeling) in the
<br />
already formed models - omitting the rest of the connections. Making it EVEN
<br />
simpler to handle, even further away of the 'total complexity'.
<br />
*
<br />
&quot;objective terminal values&quot;? all we have is subjective, even virtual,
<br />
explained by mentality to the level of our capabilities. Values are culture
<br />
oriented and defined, especially morality, a social compromise for survival
<br />
within the appropriate culture. Eating the young flesh of the sacrificed
<br />
girl was very moral for the high priests. Taking interest on loans is
<br />
immoral for Islam. - Physical law depends on the extent of the complexity we
<br />
use for our observation restricted to the 'level' of measuring instruments
<br />
and to the timely '(era) math' applied for the explanation within the given
<br />
level of the then epistemic cognitive inventory. (Give or take 1000 years?).
<br />
<br />*
<br />
Intelligence IMO is the capability of 'reading between the words' (as in
<br />
inter lego) with ELASTICITY of the thinking (not plasticity) allowing to
<br />
accept an idea, pondering about it, altering it, or rejecting it. (My main
<br />
objection vs. the computer-based Ai as such, working in fixed words).
<br />
*
<br />
Marc, I wrote these remarks in view of a 'new' way of thinking, enjoying
<br />
your historically sound and interesting post.
<br />
<br />John Mikes

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Point (1) there is a clear evolution to the universe. It started from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a low-entropy-density state, and is moving towards a higher-entropy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; density, which, remarkably, just happens to coincide with an increase
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in physical complexity with time. In the beginning the universe was in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a state with *the lowest possible* entropy. This is expressed in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; laws of thermodynamics and big bang cosmology. So it simply isn't true
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that there is no teleology (purpose) built into the universe. The laws
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of thermodynamics and modern cosmology (big bang theory) clearly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; express the fact that there is.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You'll have to explain what you mean by teleogy/purpose. If you claim
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that rocks roll downhill because it is their purpose to do so, that's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not using the term in a conventional way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Here is the point that most haven't quite grasped - Occam's razor is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; *a set of aesthetic principles* - the notion of 'simplicity' is *a set
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of aesthetic principles*; Why? Because it is simply another way of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; saying that some representations are more *elegant* than others, which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is the very notion of aesthetics! I repeat: the whole of science only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; works because of a set of *aesthetic principles* - a *set of values*.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; If all values are only subjective preferences, it would follow that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the whole of science relies on subjective preferences. But subjective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; preferences have only existed as long as sentiments – therefore how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; could physical laws have functioned before sentiments? The idea that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; all values are subjective leads to a direct and blatant logical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; contradiction.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not necessarily. It may be that some mindless, valueless objective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quality coincidentally produces aesthetic feelings. For example, we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; may find the human form beautiful, and some human forms more beautiful
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than others. But that doesn't mean that there is some absolute,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; objective sense in which humans are beautiful; it's just that our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; minds have evolved to think this way. Similarly, if we find that some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other aspect of physical reality corresponds with what we recognise as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an aesthetic principle, this is just a contingent fact about the way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our minds work. There are plenty of things in nature which are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; complicated and ugly, and they don't try to reform themselves on our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; account.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Both these points are related and simply inexplicable without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; appealing to objective terminal values. At the beginning of time the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; universe was in the simplest possible state (minimal entropy density).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Why? Occam's razor is wide-ranging and pervades the whole of science.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The simple is favored over the complex – that is– Occam's razor is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; set of aesthetic value judgments without which not a single Bayesian
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; result could be obtained.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; *Every single Bayesian result rests on these implicit value judgments*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to set priors. It must be repeated that *not one single scientific
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; result could be obtained* without these secret (implicit) value
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; judgments which set priors, that our defenders of the Bayesian faith
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; on these forums are trying to pretend are not part of science!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The secret to intelligence is aesthetics, not Bayesian math.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Initially, this statement seems preposterous, but the argument in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; next paragraph is my whole point, so it merits careful reading (the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; paragraph is marked with a * to show this is the crux of this post):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; *As regards the optimization of science, the leverage obtained from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; setting the priors (Occam's razor – aesthetics – art) is far greater
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that that obtained from logical manipulations to update probabilities
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; based on additional empirical data (math). Remember, the aesthetic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; principles used to set the priors (Occam's razor) reduce a potentially
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; infinite set of possible theories to a manageable (finite) number,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; whereas laborious mathematical probability updates based on incoming
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; empirical data (standard Bayesian theory) is only guaranteed to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; converge on the correct theory after an infinite time, and even then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the reason for the convergence is entirely inexplicable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The * paragraph suggests that aesthetics is the real basis of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; intelligence, not Bayesian math, and further that aesthetic terminal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; values are objectively real.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I've long been puzzled by the phenomenon of delusion in intelligent,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rational people who develop psychotic illness. For example, out of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; blue, someone starts to believe that their family have been replaced
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by impostors. Their facility with deductive logic remains intact, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it is tempting to try to argue with them to show that their belief is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; false, but it doesn't work. The Bayes equation is:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Pr(A|B) = Pr(B|A).Pr(A)/Pr(B)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A = they are impostors
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; B = they're acting weird
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The problem is that they overestimate Pr(A), the prior probability,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and underestimate Pr(B). A very dull, but sane, person can see this,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but they can't. Intelligence doesn't seem to help at all.
