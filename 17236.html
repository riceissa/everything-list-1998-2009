<br />
Colin's recent interesting (not to say impassioned!) posts have - yet
<br />
again - made me realise the fundamental weakness of my grasp of some
<br />
of the discussions that involve Turing emulation - or emulability - on
<br />
the list.  So I offer myself once more as lead ignoramus in
<br />
stimulating some feedback on this issue .  Anyway, here's what I think
<br />
I know already (and I beg you patience in advance for the
<br />
inaccuracies):
<br />
<br />1) A Turing machine is an idealised digital computer, based on a tape
<br />
(memory device) of potentially infinite length, that has been shown to
<br />
be capable of emulating any type of digital computer, and hence any
<br />
other TM.  The meaning of 'emulation' here entails transforming
<br />
precisely the same inputs into the precisely same outputs, given
<br />
sufficient time.  In effect, digitally 'emulating' a computation is
<br />
conceptually indistinguishable from the computation itself; or to put
<br />
it another way, computation is deemed to be invariant under emulation.
<br />
<br />2) Insofar as the causal processes of physics are specifiable in the
<br />
form of decidable (i.e. definitely stopping) functions, they are
<br />
capable of finite computation on a TM - i.e. they are TM emulable.
<br />
What this amounts to is that we can in principle use a TM to compute
<br />
the evolution of any physical process given the appropriate
<br />
transformation algorithm.  Since we're dealing with QM this must
<br />
entail various probabilistic aspects and I don't know what else: help
<br />
here please.  But the general sense is that the mathematics of physics
<br />
could in principle be fully Turing-emulable.
<br />
<br />3)  Now we get into more controversial territory.  Bruno has shown (at
<br />
least I agree with him on this) that for the mind to be regarded as a
<br />
computation, essentially everything else must also be regarded in the
<br />
same light: IOW our ontology is to be understood entirely from the
<br />
perspective of numbers and their relations.  This is not universally
<br />
accepted, but more on this in the next section.  Suffice it to say
<br />
that on this basis we would appear to have a situation where the
<br />
appropriate set of computations could be regarded not as mere
<br />
'emulation', but in fact *as real as it gets*.  But this of course
<br />
also renders 'stuffy matter' irrelevant to the case: it's got to be
<br />
numbers all the way down.
<br />
<br />4) If we don't accept 3) then we can keep stuffy matter, but at the
<br />
cost of losing the digital computational model of both mind and body.
<br />
Not everyone agrees with that radical assessment, I know; but even
<br />
those who don't concur presumably do hold that everything that happens
<br />
finally supervenes on something stuffy as its ontological and causal
<br />
basis, and that numbers and their relations serve merely to model
<br />
this.  The stuffiness doesn't of course mean that the evolution of
<br />
physical systems can't in principle be specified algorithmically, and
<br />
'emulated' on a TM if that is possible; we still have mathematics as a
<br />
model of stuff and its relations.  But it does entail that no digital
<br />
emulation of a physical system can - as a mere structure of numbers -
<br />
be considered the 'real thing': it's got to be stuffy all the way
<br />
down.
<br />
<br />5) We might call 03 the numerical (necessary) model, and 04 the stuffy
<br />
(contingent) model of reality - but of course I don't insist on this.
<br />
Rather, it seems to me that in our various discussions on the
<br />
emulability or otherwise of physics, we may sometimes lose sight of
<br />
whether we are interpreting in terms of numerical or stuffy
<br />
ontologies.  And I think this has something to do with what Colin is
<br />
getting at: if your model is stuffy, then no amount of
<br />
digital-numerical emulation is ever going to get you anything stuffy
<br />
that you didn't have before.  A physical-stuffy TM doing any amount of
<br />
whatever kind of computation-emulation remains just a physical-stuffy
<br />
TM, and a fortiori *not* transmogrified into the stuff whose causal
<br />
structure it happens to be computing.
<br />
<br />Now of course this stricture wouldn't necessarily apply to model 3).
<br />
But the 'comp' that Colin claims to refute is, I suspect, not this but
<br />
stuffy-comp - i.e. the comp based on stuff rather than numbers, that
<br />
Olympia, in her lazy but decisive way, dismisses as ephemeral.  This
<br />
is also the comp that I have argued against, but I don't intend this
<br />
merely to be a re-statement of my prejudices.  I know that Colin isn't
<br />
precisely a proponent of model 3) nor model 4), arguing strenuously
<br />
for a distinctive alternative; so it would be interesting (certainly
<br />
for me) if he'd care to characterise precisely how it diverges from or
<br />
extends the foregoing stuffy-numerical dichotomy.
<br />
<br />Be that as it may, the punchline is: do we find this analysis of the
<br />
distinction between numerical 3) and stuffy 4) to be cogent with
<br />
*specific* respect to the significance and possible application of the
<br />
concept of 'emulation' in each case?
