<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think that the statements that cannot be proved are disproved

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'there exists' universal quantifiers in logic, with variables  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; representing specific numbers or groups of numbers). So to believe  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; these statements are objectively true basically means there would be  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a unique way to &quot;extend&quot; our judgment of the truth-values of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; propositions from the judgments already given by the Peano axioms,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in such a way that if we could flip through all the infinite  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; propositions judged true by the Peano axioms, we would *not* find an  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; example of a proposition like &quot;for this specific number N with  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; property X, Y is false&quot; (which would disprove the 'for all'  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proposition above), and likewise we would not find that for every  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible number (or group of numbers) N, the Peano axioms proved a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proposition like &quot;number N does not have property X&quot; (which would  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; disprove the 'there exists' proposition above).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We can't actual flip through an infinite number of propositions in a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; finite time of course, but if we had a &quot;hypercomputer&quot; that could do  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so (which is equivalent to the notion of a hypercomputer that can  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; decide in finite time if any given Turing program halts or not),
</em><br />
<br />Such an hypercomputer is just what Turing called an &quot;oracle&quot;. And the  
<br />
haslting oracle is very low in the hierarchy of possible oracles.
<br />
And Turing results is that even a transfinite ladder of more and more  
<br />
powerful oracles that you can add on Peano Arithmetic,  will not give  
<br />
you a complete theory. Hypercomputing by constructive extension of PA,  
<br />
with more and more powerful oracles does not help to overcome  
<br />
incompleteness, unless you add non constructive ordinal extension of  
<br />
&quot;hypercomputation&quot;.
<br />
This is the obeject of the study of the degrees of unsolvability,  
<br />
originated by Emil Post.
<br />
Arithmetical truth is big. No notion of hypercomputing can really  
<br />
help. Yet, the notion of arithmetical truth is well understood by  
<br />
everybody, and is easily definable (as opposed to effectively  
<br />
decidable or computable) in usual set theory. That is why logician  
<br />
have no problem with the notion of standrd model of Peano Arithmetic,  
<br />
for example.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; then I think we'd have a well-defined notion of how to program it to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; decide the truth of every &quot;for all&quot; or &quot;there exists&quot; proposition in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a way that's compatible with the propositions already proved by the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Peano axioms.
</em><br />
<br />Hypercomputation will not help. Unless you go to the higher non  
<br />
constructive transfinite. But of course, in that case you are using a  
<br />
theory much more powerful than peano Arithmetic and its extension by  
<br />
constructive ordinal. You have to already believe in the notion of  
<br />
truth on numbers to do that.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If I'm right about that, it would lead naturally to the idea of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something like a &quot;unique consistent extension&quot; of the Peano axioms  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (not a real technical term, I just made up this phrase, but unless  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there's an error in my reasoning I imagine mathematicians have some  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; analogous notion...maybe Bruno knows?)
</em><br />
<br /><br />Just go to set theory. Arithmetical truth, or standard model of PA,  
<br />
can play that role. It is not effective (constructive) but it is well  
<br />
defined. Mathematicians used such notions everyday. If you belive in  
<br />
the excluded middle principle on closed arithmetical sentences, you  
<br />
are using implictly such notions.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; which assigns truth values to all the well-formed propositions that  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are undecidable by the Peano axioms themselves.
</em><br />
<br />You can do that in set theory. Of course, this is not an effective way  
<br />
to do it, but we know, by Godel, that completeness can never be given  
<br />
in any effective way. Set theory can define the standard model (your  
<br />
&quot;unique extension&quot;) of PA, but it is not a constructive object. In set  
<br />
theory, few object are constructive.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So this would be a natural way of understanding the idea of truths  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;about the natural numbers&quot; that are not decidable by the Peano  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; axioms.
</em><br />
<br />After Godel, truth, even on numbers can be well defined, in richer  
<br />
theory, but have to be non effective, non mechanical. It is not a  
<br />
reason to doubt about the truth of the arithmetical propositions. On  
<br />
the contrary it shows that such truth kicks back and refiute all  
<br />
effective definition we could belive in about that whole truth.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course even if the notion of a &quot;unique consistent extension&quot; of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certain types of axiomatic systems is well-defined, it would only  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; make sense for axiomatic systems that are consistent in the first  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; place. I guess in judging the question of the consistency of the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Peano axioms, we must rely on some sort of ill-defined notion of our  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;understanding&quot; of how the axioms should represent true statements  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about things like counting discrete objects.
</em><br />
<br /><br />We have to rely on our intuition of numbers and sets. It is ill- 
<br />
defined, but today we know there is nothing better, and there there  
<br />
will never anything better. That is why it is difficult to refute an  
<br />
ultra-intuitionist, or why it is difficult to refute a zombie. Notion  
<br />
like &quot;natural numbers&quot; or &quot;consciousness&quot; just cannot be defined so as  
<br />
to be comprehensible by someone who does not already grasp those  
<br />
notions. That is the main reason of the failure of logicism.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; For example, we understand that the order you count a group of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discrete objects doesn't affect the total number, which is a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; convincing argument for believing that A + B = B + A regardless of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what numbers you choose for A and B.
</em><br />
<br />A + B = B + A, for all A and B, is already not provable in the  
<br />
Robinson arithmetic, but you can prove in Peano Arithmetic. You need  
<br />
the schema of axioms of induction.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Likewise, we understand that multiplying A * B can be thought of in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; terms of a square array of discrete objects with the horizontal side  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; having A objects and the vertical side having B objects, and we can  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; see that just by rotating this you get a square array with B on the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; horizontal side and A on the vertical side, so if we believe that  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just mentally rotating an array of discrete objects won't change the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; number in the array that's a good argument for believing A * B = B *  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A. So thinking along these lines, as long as we don't believe that  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; true statements about counting collections of discrete objects could  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ever lead to logical contradictions, we should believe the same for  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Peano axioms.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I would say it is a complete mystery why we believe in those axioms,  
<br />
but I have never meet someone who does not believe in it. Even Torgny  
<br />
is forced to believe in it so as to be able to assert that he does not  
<br />
believe in it. A real ultrafinitist cannot assert that he is  
<br />
ultrafinitist. A real ulrafinitist should just ask, what do you mean  
<br />
by natural numbers. And the only answer we can give him is &quot;sorry pal,  
<br />
but this is stidied in primary school, and if you have not understand  
<br />
it (as opposed to some building of a sophisticated philosophical  
<br />
argument against them), there is nothing we can do for you. Of course  
<br />
Torgny know very well what we are talking about, like he knows very  
<br />
well what consciousness is.
<br />
<br />You can see the UDA+AUDA as a reduction of the mind-body appearance to  
<br />
the mystery of numbers. The beauty of numbers, is that we can explain  
<br />
today in detail why, IF someone believe in numbers, then by work alone  
<br />
he can understand why the numbers are impossible to define.
<br />
But it is a fact that they are very easy to grasp.
