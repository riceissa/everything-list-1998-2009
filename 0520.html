<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Jacques M Mallah wrote (about self-multiplication):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;	The situation you described is completely deterministic, much like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;the MWI of QM.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;BM:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;OK, I completely agree with that. At least if the description of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the situation is conceived as a third person type of description.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;	For all practical purposes, a person who is copied should expect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;their future selves to be effectively randomly chosen.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I am glad you agree with that. This is really the first person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;indeterminism which appears naturally with comp. (And with MWI).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;You note that there is no inconsistency between first person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;indeterminism and third person determinism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Suppose now some person, X0, is copied in (exactly) 1O instances. She
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;expect their future selves to be effectively randomly chosen, as you say,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;among the 10 instances: X1, ... X10. (or 11 if the original is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;destroyed).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Do you agree that, whatever the means used to quantify the indeterminism,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the immediate expectation of X will not depend:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     a) neither of the &quot;real&quot;/virtual nature of the reconstitution,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     b) nor of the absence or presence of finite delay of reconstitution?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Thanks for answering so far.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Bruno
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;PS You say also:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;	If you want to talk about what is actually going on though, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;don't even accept that 'individual identity' carries over from one time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;step of a computation to the next.  It's just that the future self or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;selves are sufficiently similar to the current self to motivate an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;interest in his (or their) well being.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I agree too, but I am not trying to know what is actually going on.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I am interested in the practical first person expectations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I use the notion of &quot;survival&quot; in the thought experiment for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;escaping the need to define precisely &quot;individual identity&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />the question is important because Bruno's theory relies entirely on the
<br />
question whether you survive a teletransport, i.e. if your copy is really
<br />
&quot;you&quot;. I think you cannot escape to precise what is the &quot;individual
<br />
identity&quot; by a semantic artefact.
<br />
<br /><br />In my sense, as I already explained it is partly a subjective question,
<br />
because there is no objective definition of identity. However we would try
<br />
to agree on a definition that is both paradox-free and that allow to
<br />
recover the &quot;normal&quot; identity that seems to exist in a classical world.
<br />
Bruno's hypothesis is that we are perfectly (FAPP) reproducible at some
<br />
finite level and that any copy at this level has the same right to be
<br />
called &quot;us&quot;(COMP). It is only because we have currently no way to make such
<br />
copy that we are unique.
<br />
<br />I have two criticms to this point of view :
<br />
<br />1)COMP is probably false. we are made in such a way that I don't believe we
<br />
can be &quot;reproduced&quot; by another physical structure. Our behaviour seems
<br />
superficially close to that of a computer, but in many aspects it is not,
<br />
because we included our brain) are also (and first) a chemical system that
<br />
reacts &quot;continuously&quot; and &quot;analogically&quot; to our environment, for example by
<br />
taking alcool and other drugs, by suffering from diseases from toxins
<br />
secreted by microorganisms, and more generally reacting to our own hormons
<br />
that govern our emotions (all things that ARE important in our life). If
<br />
you want to incorporate these things, you have to simulate a human down to
<br />
its molecular structure, but as I argued it is exactly the opposite what a
<br />
computer is. A computer has a number of physical degrees of freedom
<br />
(physical entropy) enormously greater than the number of its computational
<br />
degrees of freedom (memory and processor size); that allows to reproduce
<br />
the same computational complexity with many different material structures.
<br />
So it is clear that if you want to simulate a physical system (down to
<br />
detailed molecular structure) with a computer, you will need a computer
<br />
huger than this system. But then this computer cannot behave PHYSICALLY
<br />
like this system. The only possibility is to built a &quot;molecular&quot; computer
<br />
that has exactly the same PHYSICAL behaviour than your system, that is in
<br />
fact an exact PHYSICAL copy of you (usually what SF authors assume!). What
<br />
I argue is that in fact we don't know how built a physical copy (down to
<br />
quantum level) of any MACROSCOPIC system (larger than one photon!) , and it
<br />
is very probably fundamentally impossible. So you can at most hope to built
<br />
a reasonably &quot;fake&quot; copy of yourself, but that would sooner or later
<br />
separate from your own behaviour even if it is in the same environment. I
<br />
would find it difficult to consider this copy as myself...
<br />
<br />2) Even if COMP were true the fact that identity is entirely determined by
<br />
the &quot;functionality&quot; is discutable. In most cases, it is determined by the
<br />
physical spatio-temporal continuity. Here are several examples:
<br />
&nbsp;- if you built two &quot;identical&quot; computers, they won't be considered as
<br />
&quot;really&quot; identical even if they do exactly the same thing. For instance if
<br />
you happen to break your computer accidentally, you will not be allowed to
<br />
exchange it with that of your neighboor. In case of a dispute with him,
<br />
people will try to look at some detail (for example the serial number),
<br />
which have nothing to do with the functionality, but which will decide
<br />
which computer has been &quot;physically&quot; (continuously) yours before the crash.
<br />
Same with any usual object (car, etc...)
<br />
- inversely the broken computer is always your computer, even if it has no
<br />
more functionality.
<br />
- same with human beings. If a twin die for example just after a birth,
<br />
his(her) corpse is associated to his identity. He will not be considered as
<br />
surviving in the other living twin (in our culture at least...), although
<br />
the latter is much closer &quot;functionnaly&quot; to his former living state.
<br />
- more generally we can associate an identity to temporally continuous
<br />
structures even if they suffer profound changes. We can say &quot;scientists
<br />
have found the skeleton of a dinosaur&quot; even if it has no dinosaur-like
<br />
behaviour!
<br />
So there is no reason to consider that &quot;you&quot; survive in a copy. Of course
<br />
you can assume it is true, just as you MAY believe you are the
<br />
reincarnation of an ancient Egyptian prostitute (yes, some famous people do
<br />
believe that!). But this kind of belief cannot learn anything on the real
<br />
nature of the world!
<br />
<br />Some of you treat exactly the potential duplication in our real world like
<br />
the MWI. But it is quite different. The &quot;many worlds&quot; in MWI are defined by
<br />
the fact that they are almost not interacting. We &quot;duplicate&quot; in the MWI
<br />
sense exactly when and because our &quot;copies&quot; cease to interact. This insure
<br />
the unicity of each copy in each &quot;macroscopic world&quot;. MWI does not allow
<br />
several copies to know each other. Classical probability does not apply
<br />
(like in any form of QM) because in fact you are here AND elsewhere.
<br />
Conversely the indiduality is conserved in MWI because some worlds are
<br />
connected by the appearance of a temporal evolution, which DEFINE who is
<br />
connected to whom. Each copy of each world is connected by &quot;classical
<br />
histories&quot; to its past(s) and future(s), which insure the spatio-temporal
<br />
continuity  which would not exist in a hypothetical teleportation (which
<br />
remains up to now a dream!)
