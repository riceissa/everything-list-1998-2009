<br />
<br /><br />Be careful to draw a distinction between 'substances' and
<br />
'properties'.  I accept that the underlying *substance* is likely
<br />
physical, but *properties* are what are super-imposed on the top of
<br />
the underlying substance.  The physical *substance* may be the base
<br />
level, but the physical *properties* aren't.  From the mere fact that
<br />
aesthetic properties are *composed of* physical substances, it does
<br />
not follow that aesthetic properties themselves are physical.  Nor
<br />
does it follow from the fact that physical substances are *neccessery*
<br />
for aesthetic properties,  that they are *sufficient* to fully specify
<br />
aesthetic properties.
<br />
<br />Here's why:  Complete knowledge of the physical properties of your
<br />
brain cannot in fact enable you to deduce your aesthetic preferences
<br />
without additional *non-physical* assumptions.  That is because,as I
<br />
agreed with Bruno (see my previous post), all the explanatory power of
<br />
reason is *mathematical* in nature.  In short, in order for you to
<br />
know how a complete specification of your brain state was correlated
<br />
with your aesthetic preferences, you would have to use your own
<br />
*subjective experiences* as a calibrator in order to make the
<br />
correlation (ie When brain state X, I feel/experience Y).  And these
<br />
subjective experiences are not themsleves physical, but, as I have
<br />
explained again and again, *Mathematical* properties.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; They have to be in there somewhere, since it appears that a particular
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain state is necessary and sufficient for a particular aesthetic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; preference. In the same way, cardiovascular system activity is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessary and sufficient for the circulation of the blood. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; difference between the two cases is that with circulation it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; obviously so but with mind it is not obviously so: we can imagine the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appropriate brain activity without mind but not the appropriate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cardiovascular activity without circulation. But maybe this is just a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem with our imagination!
</em><br />
<br />Ah, but there is a difference!  In the example you gave, circulation
<br />
is *defined* by the specific physical characteristics of
<br />
cardiovascular activity.  But the mind is *not* defined by specific
<br />
physical characteristics of the brain (this is the error that
<br />
philosopher John Searle keep making).  In the example of circulation
<br />
you gave, you can take direct objective measurements of the physical
<br />
characteristics of cardiovascular activity.  But as Ray Kurzweil
<br />
pointed out in his book 'The Singularity Is Near', you cannot take
<br />
direct objective measurements of a mind.  That's because the workings
<br />
of a mind are not defined by any specific physical characteristics of
<br />
the system, but are *mathematical* properties ('patterns') as
<br />
explained by 'Functionalism'.  Further, these mathematical properties
<br />
are not just fictions (words we use to explain things better) but
<br />
appear to be dispensable to our explanations of reality.  These points
<br />
indicate a big and real difference between your example (circulation)
<br />
and mind/brain.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have to think about this further, but I have questions. As well as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the initial point I made about what deserves to be called fundamental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (perhaps a definition is called for?), I don't see why certain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; categories are irreducible. For example, chemistry (physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; transformations) could be seen as a special case of what you call
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mechanics (laws of the actions of forces), chiefly the electrostatic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; force. Also, it would be helpful if you could describe the underlying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; motivation and history of the model, or refer me to previous posts if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I've missed them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; --
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Stathis Papaioannou
</em><br />
<br />Refer my model again:
<br />
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/everything-list/web/mcrt-domain-model-eternity">http://groups.google.com/group/everything-list/web/mcrt-domain-model-eternity</a>
<br />
<br />The reason I don't think that categories in my model are reducible
<br />
across the *horizontal* axis is because of property dualism, as I have
<br />
explained.  The reason I don't that that the categories in my model
<br />
are reducible across the *vertical* axis is because of the difference
<br />
in levels of abstraction (this may indeed have something to do with
<br />
Russell's emergence).
<br />
<br />For instance, for your question over the example you gave, the laws of
<br />
mechanics are wholly abstract,  Chemistry is at a lower level of
<br />
abstraction - additional information about physical processes (initial
<br />
boundary conditions) has to be plugged into the equations to get
<br />
useful predictions out.  You need Equations + Initial Conditions =
<br />
Useful Science.  The initial conditions are not deriable from the
<br />
equations themselves but are something external to it.  This shows
<br />
that when you switch between levels of abstraction there are extra
<br />
assumptions (ie Russell's emergence) and hence there is irreducibility
<br />
in categories of science.
<br />
<br />As to me the providing an explanation of  'the underlying motivation
<br />
and history of my model', good idea, but be patient.  All will be
<br />
explained in time ;)
