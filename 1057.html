Christopher Maloney &lt;chris.domain.name.hidden&gt;:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the problem, which makes such a point of view [finding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interpretations that contain self-aware observers in non-traditional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; objects] useless, was pointed out by Hal.  Fictional scenarios are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lawless.  In our world, we invariably see that some sort of order
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and persistence manifests itself.  But in fiction, I, or any author,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is free to make up whatever he or she wants, almost without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constraint.
</em><br />
<br />Universes without constraint are know as chaos.  They're interesting
<br />
in their own right, but fiction stories don't fall among them.
<br />
<br />To be enjoyable, or even readable, fiction has to have overwhelming
<br />
structure and self-consistency, enough to be recognizable as physical
<br />
life in this, or some nearby, universe.  Many authors complain they
<br />
lose their freedom to the demands of recurring characters they
<br />
created: facts and character traits introduced in past stories begin
<br />
to narrow the possible behavior of the character in subsequent
<br />
stories.  The character becomes more and more clearly its own person.
<br />
Created universes more and more define their own possibilities.  The
<br />
young Isaac Asimov said he couldn't do a fourth Foundation book
<br />
because the work of keeping track of everything had become too
<br />
large.  (i.e. the complexity of the Foundation galaxy had outgrown
<br />
his capacity to simulate it!   Many decades later, the old Isaac
<br />
Asimov did write a couple of additional books connected to Foundation
<br />
in a semi-detached sort of way, but anyone could see they weren't
<br />
really about the same universe.)
<br />
<br />If you refuse to interpret (say) detective stories as containing
<br />
self-aware characters, then there is no point to reading them.
<br />
Outside of a certain interpretation they are indeed just strings
<br />
of meaningless ink blobs on paper.  A useful point of view for a
<br />
paper recycler. 
<br />
<br />By the same token, if I don't interpret you as a self-aware
<br />
being, then there is no point listening to you.  Without the
<br />
proper interpretation of your sputterings you are just an noisy
<br />
bag of meat.  A useful point of view for a hungry tiger.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I also believe that it must be possible to establish some kind of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure over the universes, that gives rise to the physical laws we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; witness.  So, in some sense, they are &quot;real&quot;.  If you disagree with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this, kindly define what you mean by &quot;abstractions&quot;
</em><br />
<br />A universe I see depicted on the screen of a simulator in front of me
<br />
has enormous measure of existence (1.0) for me.  As do a universes
<br />
recorded in books that issued from the wet simulator we called
<br />
Asimov's brain.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; my own existence is the only thing I can be really sure of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ... trapped inside some sort of universe that I never made, and that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; obeys physical laws.  How do you explain that?
</em><br />
<br />You interpret the universe as real. The universe returns the favor.
<br />
<br />Sherlock Holmes interprets his fictional London as real.  His London
<br />
treats him as existing in it.
<br />
<br />Same deal.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you work with simulators, you must know that the lower the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fidelity of the simulation, the less useful it is
</em><br />
<br />Leaving out inessential details is how mathematics generalizes.  It is
<br />
often immensely useful, because with details gone, your results apply
<br />
to a larger universe of examples.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; As I said in my earlier post, I could cut open a persons head, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; see all kinds of gunk in there that I could use to explain that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person's behavior.  But how would I explain the behavior of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fictional character?
</em><br />
<br />By cutting open his head in the story and finding all sorts of gunk
<br />
that explains his behavior.  I know lots of stories where that
<br />
happens.  I guess you could group them under the term &quot;neurosurgery
<br />
fiction&quot;.  (Of course, most stories don't involve cutting open
<br />
characters' heads.  I hope the same holds for most of your physical
<br />
world relationships.)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [The Sherlock story in an AI VR implementation]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then, and only then, does he become an implementation of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious structure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [interpreting a human being, predictively, in purely mechanical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; terms]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And I would say that they are wrong.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [Mapping psychological traits onto non-traditional things]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then they become useless. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Many additional tediously predictable pronouncements)
</em><br />
<br />Says you.  You're entitled to your opinion, but I wouldn't give you
<br />
two cents for it.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Are you saying I'm wrong, and my self- interpretation is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; questionable?
</em><br />
<br />You self-interpretation is fine, but it's not unique.  It is one of an
<br />
astronomical number of possible alternatives, and some of the others
<br />
(like the mechanical one, for biologists) are useful to us even now.
<br />
Others may be significant to other observers of whom we are not
<br />
presently aware, because they are interpretively too distant from us.
<br />
But as our computing power grows, each time we build a new simulator,
<br />
or a gadget that looks at our surroundings in a new way, our
<br />
interpretive horizon expands.
