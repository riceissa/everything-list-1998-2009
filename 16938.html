<br />
Hi all,
<br />
<br />I suddenly feel sorry putting too much burden on just one  
<br />
correspondent in the list, and I would appreciate if someone else  
<br />
could propose answers or any remarks to the exercises.
<br />
<br />I am also a bit anxious about Kim, who is the one who suggested me the  
<br />
initial explanations, but who seems to have disappear right now.
<br />
<br />There is also some sort of burden onto me, because it is hard to  
<br />
explain &quot;the real thing&quot; concerning the seventh step, without  
<br />
explaining or just illustrating at least some relevant portion of the  
<br />
mathematical reality: mainly the unexpected mathematical discovery of  
<br />
the universal functions, sets, numbers, systems, language, machine ...  
<br />
I don't mention the absence of drawing ability which does not help.
<br />
<br />Given that the list raised from a critical approach toward Tegmark and  
<br />
Schmidhuber, I was usually assuming some knowledge in math and  
<br />
physics. What was harder for me in the beginning was to motivate the  
<br />
use of &quot;philosophy of mind&quot; notions, notably the key distinction  
<br />
between the first and third person point of view. Then UDA should make  
<br />
you realize how non obvious the relation between the first person and  
<br />
the third person can be once we assume comp (= work in the theory  
<br />
comp). My original goal was to illustrate that once we assume digital  
<br />
mechanism, we can build a &quot;scientific formulation&quot; of the mind-body  
<br />
problem or the consciousness-reality problem. We probably depart from  
<br />
Tegmark and Schmidhuber, or Wolfram, by taking into account that  
<br />
making comp explicit entails a delocalisation of the 1-person  
<br />
relatively to the third person computations, and makes the identity  
<br />
thesis, a most complex equivalence relations.
<br />
<br />The knowledge of most people participating to the discussion is very  
<br />
varied, due to the extreme transdiciplinarity of the subject, and the  
<br />
interest it can evidently have for the layman (and indeed, for any  
<br />
universal machine).
<br />
Marty asked me to make an attempt toward a &quot;journalistic&quot; description  
<br />
of &quot;how physics has to become  part of number theory&quot;.  This is very  
<br />
difficult, and risky due to inevitable misunderstanding.
<br />
And I feel like I have to explain in what deep sense the mathematical  
<br />
discovery of the &quot;universal machine&quot;, made by Post, Turing, ... is  
<br />
already a quite utterly astonishing, yet subtle, discovery. Gödel  
<br />
himself took time to swallow it and he described Church thesis as an  
<br />
epistemological miracle.
<br />
My intention was to derive properly Cantor theorem, and then Kleene  
<br />
theorem, which was the object of my old &quot;diagonalization posts&quot;.
<br />
I feel important that people understand how unbelievable Church thesis  
<br />
is, and why most startling propositions, including incompleteness, are  
<br />
easy consequences of it.
<br />
<br />Typically I am happy to share my enthusiasm about all theorems in  
<br />
computer science which leads to the reversal, but knowing myself I  
<br />
know that I could accelerate too much and makes too much burden for  
<br />
the correspondent especially if he is alone.
<br />
So before becoming an harasser myself I invite Marty to let other  
<br />
people trying to answer the exercises.
<br />
Marty has fully agreed to this proposal and is happy the pressure is  
<br />
off him to represent all those who are following anonymously.
<br />
Eventually I can show the solution and proceed in addressing the post  
<br />
to everyone.
<br />
Note that this is what I have done with the combinators, feedback were  
<br />
made out-of-line, then. But this lead to difficulties too. I cannot  
<br />
solve all the exercise out-of-line.  By experience this ends up with  
<br />
finding myself writing too many posts with almost the same info to  
<br />
different people.
<br />
Yet I can imagine how much it is to be the only public target of what  
<br />
could look like an perpetual exam, and I really want to proceed in a  
<br />
cooler way.
<br />
<br />Some people have encouraged me, out-of-line, to proceed, but now I  
<br />
think they should participate a little bit, if only to witness they  
<br />
are following the thread. I will probably stop to propose &quot;easy&quot; (a  
<br />
quite relative notion) exercise, but then it is important to stop me  
<br />
once anything is unclear. This is a problem with math, if you miss a  
<br />
piece, everything becomes senseless.
<br />
<br />Understanding implies some self-implication in the reasoning. So,  
<br />
either someone else try to participate, or I continue impersonally and  
<br />
eventually I will try some &quot;non technical summary&quot;. I recall that one  
<br />
of the goal consists in explaining the difference between a  
<br />
computation and a description of a computation (beyond just doing the  
<br />
step 7).
<br />
<br />Any remark to improve the communication or to design a better  
<br />
methodology is welcome,
<br />
<br />Best regards to all of you, and thanks for letting me know your  
<br />
interests,
<br />
<br />Bruno
