<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; perhaps not be *directly* deducible (i.e. by 'boiling down' their seeming laws of

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; physics until they got to '23/3', the Life rules), or at least much less likely than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; discovering Life first and building up a larger and larger library of larger and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; larger Life objects (as we are currently doing) until a correspondence is noted
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; between the larger members of this library and the smaller members of their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; physicists' library of fundamental 'particles'. At this point I'd say that the Life
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; rules had been discovered but perhaps not deduced.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I guess that such a thing might be possible.  But then, if the life game
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can emulate a TM in any portion of it, mightn't it be possible that any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computable laws of physics are emulable by it, if you allow larger and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; larger members to be built up?  Later in this post you distinguish
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between those members that are the result of a TM inside a life field,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and those that &quot;you get 'for free' by running Life sim on a large
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; enough random field.&quot;  But perhaps its not so simple to draw the line.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Anyway, though I say that, I suspect that to the simplist, and most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probable (if those are the same set) of SAS's that develop &quot;for free&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on a random field, the rules of life would be discernable.  Some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; general characteristics of their universe probably would be -- that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they are in two dimensions, for example.
</em><br />
<br />Actually I doubt if they would quickly arrive at that conclusion or even that
<br />
they would easily arrive at a concept of dimension (perhaps their most abstract-
<br />
minded mathematicians would): *Our* universe is very quickly perceivable as
<br />
3 dimensional because of strong geometric properties approximated in our
<br />
physics. There is a sorry lack of such geometric symmetry available in the
<br />
Life world. In fact, the Life universe *isn't* two dimensional really (being countably
<br />
infinite, it is necessarily 0 dimensional).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So if we further assume that our universe is *not* a game of life,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and if the AUH is true, then by the SSA I would conclude that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; probability of any SAS finding itself to be in a game of life is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; probably zero.  That is, the set of SAS's inside a game of life is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of measure zero relative to the set of SAS's inside universes like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ours.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; How do you deduce that the prob of being in a game of Life is 0? I under-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; stand all the stuff about measure (I'm a mathematician) but where do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; you get the Life-like universes vanishing?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I said probably zero - I didn't claim to deduce anything.  I'm just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; speculating.  See below.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; And here I make a desperate, arm-waving leap, from the idea that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; I am a random sample, to the conclusion that SAS's &quot;like me&quot; are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; the most numerous.  Whatever &quot;like me&quot; might mean, I think it's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; fair to guess that it wouldn't include SAS's inside a game of life,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; unless you're talking about the ones generated within the UD.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; No I mean the one's you get 'for free' by running Life sim on a large
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; enough random field. (Take digits of pi if you don't like 'random').
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I agree: your leap is a desparate, arm-waving leap. My SAS within a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Life simulation could be justified in making the same leap, surely. Even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; though he/she/it would be by your argument totally wrong.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, that's a very interesting point, and I believe it shows that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we can only, each of us, deduce things from the SSA from a first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person perspective.  We can't take anyone's word for what they've
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deduced from the SSA.  So we shouldn't, for example, take the word
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of a scientist who's just performed the QS experiment and survived
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; despite thousand-to-one odds, that QS really works.  *He* would have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a strong reason for believing it, but I would have no additional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; incentive to believe it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />But if deductions from the SSA can only be made from a first person perspective
<br />
then that makes all deductions from the SSA completely bankrupt because all the
<br />
deductions I've seen made from the SSA are very *general* statements (e.g.
<br />
your one about Life universes not subjectively existing). You can't say that deductions
<br />
are
<br />
subjective unless what they are *about* is also subjective. Or do you believe that
<br />
there is no fact of the matter about whether the probability of finding oneself in
<br />
a Life universe is 0? Is there one probability as far as Chris Maloney is concerned
<br />
and another as far as, say, Al Gore is concerned? Hmmm.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So, I think, yes, if my argument is correct, it doesn't matter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that a life-SAS would deduce the same thing.  I would be correct
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and (s)he would be wrong.  That is, I still do believe that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different sorts of SAS's have different measure.  Taking Hal's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; approach and doing away with infinite sets, spoze that there are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a total of one billion SAS's in all the universes everywhere, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that ten of them are green, but the rest are blue.  Any one of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them would be justified in assuming that most SAS's are of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; same color, but the green ones who made that assumption would be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wrong.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />But you are not putting forward an argument, just speculating that there
<br />
might *be* an argument, as far as I can tell. There may be
<br />
an argument for saying that 'one' is less likely to be an SAS in a Life
<br />
universe but I don't think that one can simply say that *I* am not in a
<br />
Life universe therefore it is unlikely. On the same grounds I could
<br />
argue that is extremely unlikely that one is an American citizen.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So if the set of life-SAS's is not isomorphic to the set of (3+1
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dim. pseudo-Riemannian manifold quantum field)-SAS's, then we'd
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have no a priori reason to assume that the measures of these sets
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are the same.   If the measures are different, then one is larger
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than the other.  My money will be on our set having the larger
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure.  If the measures
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are transfinite but of different orders, then I conclude that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probability of finding oneself to be a life-SAS is zero.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />I don't personally believe that our universe *is* a 3+1 dim. pseudo-Riem.
<br />
manifold quantum field, but that's another story.
<br />
<br />Where your argument falls down is betting on our set having the larger measure,
<br />
based (I'm presuming) on the evidence that *you* are in the latter sort of world.
<br />
If you wanted to construct a Bayesian proof of your statement you would end up
<br />
showing that you are *minutely* more likely to be in this world.
<br />
<br />Once you start talking about transfinite measures I give up. The Bayesian arguments
<br />
that underpin all these anthropic arguments are based on *probability* and
<br />
therefore on *natural* numbers, counting etc.
