<br />
In the words of Tegmark, let's assume that the physical world is
<br />
completely mathematical; and everything that exists mathematically
<br />
exists physically.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I have been thinking along these lines since my days at university -
<br />
where it occurred to me that any alternative is mystical.  However,  the
<br />
problem remains to explain induction - ie the predictability of the
<br />
universe.   Why is it that the laws of physics can be depended on when
<br />
looking into the future, if we are merely a &quot;mathematical construction&quot;
<br />
- like a simulation running on a computer.  It seems to me that in the
<br />
ensemble of all possible computer simulations (with no limits on the
<br />
complexity of the &quot;laws&quot;) the ones that remain well behaved after any
<br />
given time step in the simulation have measure zero.  
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Given the &quot;source code&quot; for the simulation of our universe, it would
<br />
seem to be possible to add some extra instructions that test for a
<br />
certain condition to be met in order to tamper with the simulation.   It
<br />
would seem likely that there will exist simulations that match our own
<br />
up to a certain point in time, but then diverge.  Eg it is possible for
<br />
a simulation to have a rule that an object will suddenly manifest itself
<br />
at a particular time and place.   The simulated conscious beings in such
<br />
a universe would be surprised to find that induction fails at the moment
<br />
the simulation diverges.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
In other words, at each time step in a simulation the state vector can
<br />
take different paths according to slightly different software programs
<br />
with special cases that only trigger at that moment in time.  It seems
<br />
that a universe will continually split into vast numbers of child
<br />
universes, in a manner reminiscent of the MWI.  However there is a
<br />
crucial difference - most of these spin off universes will have bizarre
<br />
things happen.  It is difficult to see how a computable system can be
<br />
tamper proof.  How can a past which has been well behaved prevent
<br />
strange things from happening in the future?
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
In the thread &quot;a possible paradox&quot;, there was talk about a vanishingly
<br />
small number of &quot;magical&quot; universes where strange things happen.
<br />
However, it seems to me that the bigger risk is that a &quot;normal&quot; universe
<br />
like ours will be the atypical in the ensemble!
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
A possible argument is to invoke the anthropic principle - and suggest
<br />
that our universe is predictable in order for SAS's to evolve and
<br />
perceive that predictability.  However,  that predictability only needs
<br />
to be a trick - played on the inhabitants for long enough to develop
<br />
intelligence.  There is no reason why the trick needs to continue to be
<br />
played.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I suggest that the requirement of a tamper-proof physics is an extremely
<br />
powerful principle.   For example, we deduce that SAS's only exist in
<br />
mathematical systems that aren't computable.   In particular our
<br />
Universe is not computable.  
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
- which is what Penrose has been saying.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I have assumed that non-computability coincides with being tamper-proof
<br />
but this is far from clear.  For example, it is conceivable that the
<br />
Universe is a Turing machine running an infinite computation (cf
<br />
Tipler's Omega point), and &quot;awareness&quot; only emerges in the totality of
<br />
this infinite computation.  Perhaps our awareness is a manifestation of
<br />
advanced waves sent backwards in time from the Omega Point!
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I think it's important to distinguish between an underlying mathematical
<br />
system, and the formal system that tries to describe it.   I think this
<br />
is a crucial distinction.   For example, the real number system can be
<br />
defined uniquely by a finite set of axioms.   Uniqueness is (formally)
<br />
provable - in the sense that it can be shown that an isomorphism exists
<br />
between all systems that satisfy the axioms.    However the real numbers
<br />
are uncountably infinite - and therefore are very poorly understood
<br />
using formal mathematics - which is limited to only a countably infinite
<br />
set of statements about them.   So formal mathematics should be regarded
<br />
as an imperfect and coarse tool which only gives us limited
<br />
understanding of a complicated beast!  This is after all what Godel's
<br />
incompleteness theorem tells us.  
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
It is not surprising that a computer will never exhibit awareness -
<br />
because it is merely using the techniques of formal mathematics, and not
<br />
tapping into the &quot;good stuff&quot;.
<br />
