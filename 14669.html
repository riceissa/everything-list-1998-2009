Hi Youness/Russell:
<br />
<br />I am very interested in this thread.
<br />
<br />Russell:
<br />
<br />In our last conversation you got me to look at my completeness resolution
<br />
driven transitions in the evolution of my Somethings [universes] as
<br />
information processing. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From that point, if I alter the transition slightly and make it an influx of
</em><br />
information from the rest of the Everything that enables resolution of some
<br />
of the incompleteness rather than directly resolving it then a selection
<br />
process on this new information is required to complete the resolution
<br />
process. While many selection processes may be possible an anthropic one
<br />
seems to fit some of the circumstances of our universe. 
<br />
<br />I now seem to have covered the basic outputted aspects of your approach [I
<br />
think], but with just one [as far as I can tell] postulate:
<br />
<br />&quot;There is an ALL [the complete ensemble of divisors [information] and its
<br />
own divisions [collections of information]] that contains as two of its
<br />
divisions the Everything and the Nothing.&quot;
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From this using the inherent &quot;incompleteness&quot;- [the duration meaningful
</em><br />
question] - and &quot;no selection - [no net information in the ALL] properties
<br />
of these structures I extract the components: time, variation, selection
<br />
[anthropic included], heritability, prediction, communication, evolution,
<br />
filters. 
<br />
<br />My approach seems to get to a similar place by a simpler path.
<br />
<br />So I hope the derivation of quantum mechanics is also there, unfortunately I
<br />
do not have the background to aid the construction of the derivation in much
<br />
of a mathematical way.
<br />
<br />Youness:
<br />
<br />Regarding your comments on page 4 of your analysis:
<br />
<br />I appear to have been able to derive the necessity for a selection process
<br />
within an evolving universe.  By the global &quot;no selection&quot; rule for the ALL
<br />
the type of process is not restricted. Therefore from this derivation
<br />
consciousness is not a requirement in order to have a process but may be
<br />
present. Also from this derivation, the process is an inseparable part of
<br />
the system.    
<br />

<br /><br />Hi Youness,
<br />
<br />Thanks for this, it is very impressive. You have gone into this in far
<br />
more depth than the referees of the &quot;Why Occams Razor&quot; paper. I will
<br />
respond to this soon, but rather than shoot from the hip, I'll take
<br />
some time to respond thoughtfully.
<br />
<br />As for not proclaiming scientific revolutions, I sort of do that in
<br />
<a href="http://www.hpcoders.com.au/docs/revolution.pdf">http://www.hpcoders.com.au/docs/revolution.pdf</a> , which I wrote for the
<br />
centenary of Planck's revolutionary paper ushering in quantum
<br />
mechanics. It is basically an op ed where I noticed the similarities
<br />
between my approach, Bruno's and Roy Frieden's approaches, and
<br />
concluded that a scientific revolution was indeed in the
<br />
offing. Unfortunately, that article didn't get much airtime, which I
<br />
suspect says more about inherent media biases than anything else.
<br />
<br />Nevertheless, if the argument I presented stands up, it is very
<br />
important, so it requires rigorous scrutiny. Extraordinary claims
<br />
requires extraordinary evidence, as the late AC Clarke would
<br />
say. Thank you for getting the ball rolling on this.
