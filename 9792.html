Bringing this thread back to the original subject, I am currently reading
<br />
&quot;Lonely Planets&quot; by David Grinspoon which covers all aspects of astrobiology
<br />
including Fermi's Paradox.  I recommend it. 
<br />
<br />Bruno, you mentioned a few days ago that encryption or compression was an
<br />
interesting thought, but you weren't sure if all aliens would try to avoid
<br />
having us detect them.  I think any advanced society would use a highly
<br />
efficient encryption and/or compression system in their communications
<br />
regardless of whether they thought the communication would be detected by
<br />
someone else. Most data uploaded and downloaded over the internet is
<br />
compressed, and it only stands to reason more advanced technology would
<br />
allow far more data transmission through advanced compression techniques. 
<br />
<br />Therefore, I don't suspect we will intercept alien radio signals anytime
<br />
soon unless the aliens are intentionally trying to signal us.  Also, I
<br />
highly doubt that radio telescopes are the ultimate form of communication in
<br />
the universe.  It seems almost impossible to imagine that we would go from
<br />
deliver information via a man on a horse to the final ultimate communication
<br />
method in less than one century.  Aliens may use laser pulses, or more
<br />
likely, something we can not even imagine to communicate.
<br />
<br />As a final thought on this, I wanted to mention a theory of evolution that I
<br />
read about a few years ago that invokes QM and the MWI to explain how the
<br />
first self-replicator came to be against unimaginable odds. The idea was
<br />
presented in &quot;Quantum Evolution&quot;, written by Johnjoe McFadden, and (very
<br />
generally summarizing here) basically argued that even given all the time
<br />
that passed and all the opportunities that would have been provided on a
<br />
global scale, the odds against a self-replicator forming are so staggeringly
<br />
large that it is still difficult to explain through standard theory.
<br />
<br />He argues something along the lines that peptides formed in carbon
<br />
microtubes that would have been sufficient to cut off the peptides from the
<br />
outside world, prevent decoherence, and allow a superposition of the
<br />
peptide.  Then, when the peptide experienced decoherence, one in 20^32
<br />
universes would have a self-replicating peptide.  Of course, invoking the
<br />
anthropic principle, we are in one of those very rare universes.
<br />
<br />A consequence of this is that alien life would be pretty much nonexistent in
<br />
OUR universe.  Other planets suitable for life would have life in other
<br />
branches of the multiverse, but the quantum selection effects would make the
<br />
separate evolution of life in the same brach of the multiverse highly
<br />
unlikely.

<br /><br /><br />Brent,
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Faith usually refers to some belief independent of evidence.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I guess we have a serious problem of terminology. Faith without 
<br />
evidence is bad faith or perhaps better blind faith.
<br />
<br />I was meaning faith in truth. (Although faith in your 1-self works also 
<br />
in my setting). I cannot define &quot;truth&quot;,(nor your 1-self)  but I can 
<br />
argue that &quot;faith in truth&quot; leads to modesty, even in &quot;religious&quot; 
<br />
affair.
<br />
I would say Fundamentalism  is even a typical symptom of blind faith. 
<br />
It appears when, sometimes driven by despairing events, some people 
<br />
(collectively or privately) loose faith in truth, or in themselves,  
<br />
and then jumps on any populist herzats concocted by mad, ignorant, or 
<br />
dishonest entity.
