Here is a collection of paragraphs, coming from last 
<br />
posts, and bearing around the first and third person perspectives.
<br />
I will comment them briefly, and then, I will present you
<br />
some of my *formal friends* and I will ask their opinions and
<br />
explain you briefly why their *opinions* are relevant.

<br />I'm afraid you push the &quot;free-will&quot; problem under the rug. BTW if 
<br />
you don't distinguish the first and third person point of view I 
<br />
understand why you stop in the middle of the UDA.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I ended up in. This is why it is a 1st person effect, and is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;unprovable.
</em><br />
<br />If that is true I guess the computationnalist level of substitution
<br />
is *very* low. Either we would be sharing some personal quantum
<br />
computation or you are really, as Niclas Thisell explained so clearly, 
<br />
becoming a zombie (which I doubt) and this would still not explain our 
<br />
witnessing of your &quot;psychokinetic power&quot;. And you *do* have a nice family
<br />
indeed Russell, but that's hardly a proof of a mediumnic abilities ...

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Since we know that we can die in the 3rd person picture, it is clear
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;we do not live in an &quot;ideal&quot; model. Why then is it natural to abstract
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;away the terminal worlds?
</em><br />
<br />I recall that an ideal frame is a frame (collection of worlds
<br />
with an accessibility relation) where there are no terminal worlds.
<br />
<br />First we don't *know* that we can die in the 3rd person picture. 
<br />
It is still an inference made by a first person. 
<br />
It is natural to abstract the
<br />
terminal worlds for the same reason Niclas Thisell propose to transform
<br />
yourself into a zombie for diminishing the 3rd mesure. It is the basic
<br />
idea of the quantum suicide, or the comp suicide: you (relatively)
<br />
quantify only the quantum (comp) indeterminacy on the worlds where you
<br />
survive. (in comp: &quot;world&quot; = maximal consistent continuation).
<br />
It is also equivalent to the &quot;Arithmetical Darwinism&quot; in my thesis.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Niclas Thisell
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now, unless the mathematical model explicitly introduces splits and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mergers, there is no reason to assume that we need to either. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;scientist may experience first-person splits or wave-function collapses
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;during the experiment, but that is, of course, exactly what Everett
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;wanted to explain.
</em><br />
<br />I agree. The expression &quot;to experience first-person splits&quot; is 
<br />
misleading though. Remember the &quot;copernician&quot; proudness of the
<br />
quantum many-worlder to explain why we don't feel ourself splitting.
<br />
The scientist makes only 3-person statements (even when he invents
<br />
or discovers a theory of the first person).

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Precisely. This is why 3rd person predictions (which are based on well
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;defined probabilities) are of little help in predicting what you will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;actually experience in the 1st person.
</em><br />
<br />I half-agree. Take the self-duplication experiment. You are encoded,
<br />
annihilated and reconstituted in both Washington and Moscow. The third
<br />
person description is indeed of little help in predicting if your 
<br />
futur personal feeling will be the Moscow-experience or the 
<br />
Washington-experience, but it helps in predicting that the experience
<br />
will be among {Washington-experience, Moscow-experience}. OK ?

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;On this analysis, the distinction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;between the 1. and 3. person perspectives is purely epistemic:  The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;panscient spectator would have no use for it.
</em><br />
<br />Gosh !
<br />
I must say here that I have almost the feeling of hearing my 
<br />
*formal friends* themselves!
<br />
<br />I say &quot;almost&quot; because &quot;purely epistemic&quot; is sometimes used for
<br />
&quot;uninteresting&quot;, and to say that  &quot;the panscient spectator would have 
<br />
no use for it&quot;   could mean   &quot;I don't care&quot;.
<br />
So it is still open if Gisle Tangenes doesn't confuse her/himself
<br />
abusively with the panscient spectator itself.
<br />
(like Jacques Mallah, I think, a little more below)
<br />
<br />Now the distinction between the 1. and 3. person perspective is 
<br />
indeed purely epistemic, but this does not mean it is not a
<br />
fundamental and very interesting distinction. (And this should be 
<br />
clear for those who have
<br />
follow the entire UDA, for they know that the problem of the origin
<br />
of the physical laws is a purely epistemic problem, with comp).
<br />
<br />Also, I don't know if the panscient spectator has any use of anything, 
<br />
but I know he knows the distinction is epistemic. From the ontic (= not
<br />
epistemic) point of view he knows that the 1 and 3 person are the
<br />
same person.
<br />
<br />But how do I know that ? It looks like I have some personal 
<br />
acquaintance with the panscient spectator, isn't it?
<br />
<br />Well, believe it or not (at this stage), but, as far as we are
<br />
talking about self-referentially correct universal machine, I do: 
<br />
the panscient spectator (Gisle Tangenes' term) is indeed itself among 
<br />
my &quot;formal friends&quot;.
<br />
<br />So I guess it is time I make the presentation.
<br />
<br />Alas I have not the time to say a lot ...
<br />
<br />I refer you to the archive where I did I first presentation for 
<br />
Russell. Of course Tangenes'panscient spectator is my &quot;guardian
<br />
angel&quot; G*.     Look at
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m1417.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m1417.html</a>
<br />
<br />G is the modal logical system which proves all the machine is
<br />
able to proof about itself in the third person way. So G doesn't
<br />
distinguish between a machine and one of its double.
<br />
<br />G* is the panscient spectator alias guardian angel, it proves
<br />
everything which is true about the machine, including the true
<br />
but unprovable, by the machine, propositions.
<br />
<br />Exemple: G does not prove -B-T (The machine does not prove its
<br />
own consistency). G* proves -B-T (the Guardian Angel proves that
<br />
the machine is consistent).
<br />
<br />G and G* have a long history : Goedel 1931, Loeb 1955, Solovay 1976.
<br />
<br />The first person is obtained by defining a new box C by Cp = p &amp; Bp.
<br />
This gives a new logic known as S4Grz. Grz is for Grzegorczyk
<br />
(if you can prononce his name you are a first class logician!)
<br />
Grzegorczyk is a big polish logician.
<br />
<br />Now Cp is provably, by the guardian angel G*, equivalent to Bp, but
<br />
not by the machine itself. This makes right Tangenes' remark
<br />
that the distinction first/third is epistemic, and don't exist from
<br />
the panscient spectator point of view. But it exists for the 
<br />
machine in both the 1 and 3 point of view.
<br />
<br />Note that it can be shown that S4Grz = S4Grz*. That is: from
<br />
the first person point of view, provability = truth. This I think
<br />
explain Jacques Mallah-like confusion ...
<br />
<br />More on that later ...
<br />
<br />Have a nice week-end,
<br />
<br />Bruno
