John, It's not a scientific question, it's a philosophical question. Early Christian thinkers such as Augustine considered preservation of personal identity when you died and went to heaven. The fact that there is no heaven does not invalidate the *philosophical* point any more than the scientific impossibility of teleportation would invalidate conclusions drawn from such thought experiments. So, suppose God destroyed your body at A and then created a perfect copy at B: would you survive the procedure? If not, then in what sense have you survived the last few years given that all the atoms in your body have been replaced by natural processes?Stathis PapaioannouFrom: jamikes.domain.name.hidden: everything-list.domain.name.hidden: Re: ASSA and Many-WorldsDate: Sat, 27 Jan 2007 17:00:11 -0500
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Stathis,
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
maybe it is a postulate that (in my mind) what you write 
<br />
does not make sense? 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
A Cc generated/operated by tissue - partially transferred 
<br />
to parts unknown  without (the?) tissue and still 
<br />
functions? I am a simpleminded primitive peasant, cannot condone that you, a 
<br />
'thinking' person (no insult meant) accept the drawing of final conclusions upon 
<br />
our present insufficient knowledge base. 50 years ago everything was explained 
<br />
as a telephone switchboard, 150 years ago as a steam-engine.
<br />
Always by metaphors we did not (yet) quite know and 
<br />
science was happy. Even things like phlogiston or vitality survived for some 
<br />
time. Today it is comp on equipment and process exceeding the present technique 
<br />
and things borrowed from sci-fi. And people take it SSOOO seriously! 
<br />
<br />E.g. your calculation of the speed of thought upon the 
<br />
physical registrations of visual measurements. It is the inertia of the tool we 
<br />
use. Thought,  by all metaphors, is timeless/spaceless, you can 
<br />
experimentally proove it to yourself by 'thinking' of Dzhingis Kahn, Cleopatra 
<br />
and Hitler around a table in South america. Or: on the  Moon. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
You wrote:(I added the asterisks)
<br />
&quot;... *if I found myself* 
<br />
continuing to have similar experiences despite teleportation, ...&quot; -- what 
<br />
I would read as  corrected into::
<br />
&quot;... *if I think about myself as*....&quot;  making a 
<br />
difference for me in drawing conclusions. And you emphasized this in your 
<br />
subsequent sentence in
<br />
&quot;IF... THEN&quot; -  by the capitalization. So: if 
<br />
not, not.  A typical 'sowhat'. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I was hoping that you refer a bit to my ideas, not just repeat yours. 
<br />
<br />But, alas, so are the lists....
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Have a good weekend
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
John

&nbsp;&nbsp;John, I guess my brain is generating my consciousness, 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;but I regard this as a contingent fact. My conciousness is that which I 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;experience, and if I found myself continuing to have similar experiences 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;despite teleportation, brain transplant, resurrection in Heaven or whatever, 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;then I would have survived as me. Note that I am not saying these things are 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;possible (perhaps this is where you are scornful of the fantastic scenarios), 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;just that IF in these situations I continued to think I was me, THEN ipso 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;facto, I would still be me, despite losing the original body and 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;brain.Stathis Papaioannou

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brain&quot; to make decisions upon you? (maybe you mean only that the mechanism

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of your brain, the main tool &quot;YOU&quot;  use in mental activity, is not 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;predesigned for such action?) So: is there a pre-design (ha ha)?&gt; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly: who is that &quot;me&quot; in conflict with 'your'  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brain?&gt; How do you 'want' to 'think' something (which involves your 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brain) when 'your brain' won't let it happen?&gt; OK, let's introduce 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;you&quot;, the homunculus, who wants to think some way and your 'brain' did 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not reach the sophistication of the design (yet?) to comply - as a reason 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for &quot;won't let me&quot;.&gt; With what 'tool' did &quot;you&quot; WANT to &quot;think this 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;way&quot;? How many people are you indeed?&gt; *&gt; I am asking these 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stupid qiestions in the line of my search for SELF (&quot;I&quot;), vs. the total 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;interconnectedness of our personal existence with 'the rest of the world'. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I expect that you may provide useful hooks for me in such respect.&gt; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John&quot;I&quot; am the product of a consciousness-generating mechanism, my 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brain, in the same way as &quot;walking&quot; is the product of a 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;locomotion-generating mechanism, my legs. &quot;I&quot; am not identical to my brain 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just as &quot;walking&quot; is not identical to my legs. Now, of course &quot;I can only 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;think what my brain will let me think&quot;, and of course &quot;I can only walk 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where my legs will let me walk&quot;, but these statements are not tautologies 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the way that saying &quot;I can only think what I can think&quot; or &quot;I can only 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;walk where I can walk&quot; are. Stathis Papaioannou-----------------------------------
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JM:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so you consider the biologic tissue-grown (stem-cell 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;initiated) BRAIN the origin of a thinking person? Life growing out from 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'matter' - which is the figment of our explanatory effort to poorly and 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;incompletely observed impact received from parts unknown? Funny: you 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;invested so many posts into the (partial) teleportation and copying into 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other universes - did you really MEAN
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the transfer of tissues (like in StarTrek?) How 'bout 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the multiple  'copying' of matter?  How can you duplicate the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;atoms for copying? StarTrek had only 1 copy and that, too, by 'physical' 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transfer.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save the wrong conclusion: I am not defending this line, 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it unreal and just mention the position of yours and others on this 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;list for argument's sake. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it 'interesting, but amazing' that different 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brains (see: the multiplicity of humans and other animals among 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;themselves) behave like mental clones in accepting very similar &quot;3rd 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;person views&quot; into their 1st person ideas, to form images of the 'material 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;world' etc. Mental images, that is, which, however you would make 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into their own origination? Are we all (and the world, the existnce 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;etc.) only fiction of ourselves? 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again I feel that the 'consciousness' you generate 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by the brain may be very close to personality, self, the &quot;I&quot; we are 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;talking about. Which would close the loop:  &quot;there must be the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'primitive matter' forming the brain and out of that comes the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'not-so-primitive' matter, the mental complexity and all&quot;??? 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree withBruno to disagree in the absolute primitive 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;matter concept. IMO 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is only an explanatory imaging in this 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;universe's consciousness activity to order the part of the system we so 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;far detected. Together with space-time and OUR pet-causality - the 'within 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;model' ordering.
