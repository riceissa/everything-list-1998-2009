Jesse writes
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It's *not* aesthetic whether, say, George Bush is you or not. He's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; definitely not! He doesn't have your memories, for the first thing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It's simply objectively true that some programs---or some clumps
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of biological matter---are Jesse Mazur and others are not. (Even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; though the boundary will not be exact, but fuzzy.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I disagree--George Bush certainly has a lot sensory memories (say,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what certain foods taste like) in common with me, and plenty of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; life-event-memories which vaguely resemble mine. And I think if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you scanned the entire multiverse it would be possible to find a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; continuum of minds with memories and lives intermediate between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; me and George Bush.
</em><br />
<br />Of course. And that's true of anything you care to name (outside
<br />
mathematics and perhaps some atomic physics, I suppose).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; There's not going to be a rigorous, totally well-defined procedure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you can use to distinguish minds which belong to the set &quot;Jesse-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mazer-kinda-guys&quot; from minds which don't belong.
</em><br />
<br />I never said that there was. The allure of mathematically
<br />
precise, absolutely decisive categories must be resisted
<br />
for most things. Don't throw out what is important: namely
<br />
that there are such things as *stars* which are different
<br />
from *planets*, even though (of course, like everything)
<br />
there is a continuum.
<br />
<br />We have tests which today can pick out Jesse Mazer from all
<br />
other humans, six billion or so, that live on the planet.
<br />
Even before we knew about DNA, it was possible for it do be
<br />
determined on Earth in the year 1860 who was and who was not
<br />
Abraham Lincoln.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, of course *I* would want to dissolve the chamber,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [where an exact re-enactment was taking place]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because I think that dissolving this chamber will decrease
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the subjective first-person probability of having that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience of being tortured by the Nazis.
</em><br />
<br />Me too.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm just saying it's not clear what difference dissolving
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it would make from the POV of a &quot;zombie&quot; like yourself. ;)
</em><br />
<br />Your meaning is unclear. But you may wish to just elide all this.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The love of a mother who understood all the facts would not mislead
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; her into making the correct decision: all other things being equal,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (say that her daughter was to live happily in any case after 2007),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; she would judge that it is better for her daughter to suffer only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; one computation---here, say---than two, (say here and on Mars).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Each time that the girl's suffering is independently and causally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; calculated is a terrible thing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't see why it's terrible, if you reject the notion of first-person 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probabilities. You've really only given an appeal to emotion rather than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an argument here, and I would say the emotions are mostly grounded in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; first-person intuitions, even if you don't consciously think of them that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way.
</em><br />
<br />It's true that all my beliefs are &quot;analytically-continued&quot; from
<br />
my intuitions. I think that everyone's are. I've tried to find
<br />
an entirely consistent objective description of my values. It
<br />
seems to me that I have an almost entirely consistent version
<br />
of the values that a lot of people share (but then, I'm biased).
<br />
<br />It started like this: I know what it's like for me to have a
<br />
bad experience, and when I then look at the physics I understand
<br />
that there is a certain organism that is causally going through
<br />
a number of states, and that it results in a process I don't 
<br />
like.  Conveniently, my instincts also suggest that I shouldn't
<br />
like it when other people suffer too. Dropping the error-prone
<br />
first person account, I then generalize on what is intrinsically
<br />
bad about people suffering to a wider view that includes programs
<br />
and processes. It wasn't rocket science, and many others have done
<br />
so just as I have.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; but if you want to only think in terms of a universal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; objective third-person POV, then you must define &quot;better&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; in terms of some universal objective moral system, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; there doesn't seem to be any &quot;objective&quot; way to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; decide questions like whether multiple copies of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; same happy A.I. are better than single copies.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You're right, and here's how I go about it. We must be able to decide
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (or have an AI decide) whether or not an entity (person or program)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is being benefited by a particular execution.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But that's ignoring the main issue, because you haven't addressed the more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; primary question of *why* we should think that if a single execution of a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simulation benefits the entity being simulated, then multiple executions of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the same simulation benefit it even more.
</em><br />
<br />I have given some reasons, namely, it's a smooth extension of
<br />
our values from the cases of how we'd feel on seeing repeated
<br />
suffering. But it's understandable and correct for you to be
<br />
asking for more.
<br />
<br />Let's suppose that we want an evaluation function, that is, a
<br />
way of pronouncing judgment on the issues of the day, or of
<br />
philosophic choices, or of other things that ask us our values.
<br />
A main purpose of philosophy, in my opinion, is prescriptive:
<br />
It should tell us how to choose in various situations.
<br />
<br />One other thing I value about such a function would be that it would
<br />
be able to take a process or a situation as input, and tell me
<br />
whether I would approve of that activity or action or processing.
<br />
For example, if given a slave suffering under his master's lashes,
<br />
I want the function to tell me that it's bad, but to do so in the
<br />
most consistent manner possible.  (Now where I get my values is
<br />
another story, but it so happens that my values are very typical
<br />
of human beings on issues like this.)
<br />
<br />The function should be *local*;  the answer it gives (whether a
<br />
certain process is good or bad) should NOT depend on what happened
<br />
billions of light years ago in a far, far, far away galaxy causally
<br />
disjoint from here (i.e. outside the current situation's light cone).
<br />
Or what will happen eons from now.  Ideally, it should apply to any
<br />
spatially and temporally closed system, and also to many that are not.
<br />
<br />So if there is a program running on hardware in a certain cubic
<br />
meter of space, and that program is suffering inordinately, then
<br />
what I want with regard to that cubic meter ought to be independent
<br />
of whether or not someone ran the same program twelve billion years
<br />
ago. Surely that other incident is irrelevant! Am I clear?  Am I
<br />
being consistent? Does this &quot;locality&quot; not add yet another
<br />
reason to the one I gave before to respect repeated experience?
<br />
