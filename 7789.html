<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Theology concerns itself with the &quot;mechanism&quot; of belief.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What is the mechanism of belief?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It acts like a filter, or a pair of tinted glasses if you will.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Belief is that way of looking at reality that reinforces that way of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; looking at reality. Is that scientific?
</em><br />
<br /><br />No. But then your definition of theology is perhaps a little bit to 
<br />
much a contingent matter.
<br />
Perhaps the word &quot;theology&quot; has too many connotations. I explain below 
<br />
why I do think that, despite its heavy historical background, it could 
<br />
still be the less misleading word.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Any assessment of supposed objective rigour in ANY form of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theological thinking - be it &quot;total unrigorous manipulative pseudo-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theology&quot; or even the usual kind of theology taught to the average
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; working cleric has to be seen in the light of this comment.
</em><br />
<br /><br />The FOR book, Everett formulation of QM, and my own work rely on the 
<br />
computationalist hypothesis. Is this not a &quot;theological&quot; assumption? Is 
<br />
this not a belief in a form of survival after a form of possible death? 
<br />
A belief that I can survive with an artificial body can be seen as an 
<br />
argument for the ability of the &quot;soul&quot; to be independent of its body. 
<br />
No?
<br />
Those cases also illustrate the possibility of some theological 
<br />
assumptions about which we can reason. As Deutsch and Tipler do, it 
<br />
seems to me.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Theology wants to limit the field of ideas because theology is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; traditional gate-keeper of the intellect of organised religion.
</em><br />
<br /><br />It is not because 99% of the theologians, and this 99% of the time, are 
<br />
under the control of political organization (like science sometimes, 
<br />
somewhere: ex: genetic in Soviet Union), that we should dismiss the 
<br />
original questioning.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anyone heard of an organised religion that is gagging for new
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thinking, new ideas???
</em><br />
<br /><br />Come on. The jewish commentaries, the scolastic christians, The Muslim 
<br />
neoplatonist,  the Hinduism school, the taoist schools, the buddhist 
<br />
schools: all have been open some long time to critical argumentations 
<br />
and improvements. Hinduism and Buddhism have even had quite 
<br />
sophisticate internal school of logic.
<br />
Look at the neo-platonist tradition: quite a long and sincere 
<br />
argumentation. It still exists today everywhere on the planet, even if 
<br />
it is hidden by the media politically correct cacophonia.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Theology has an unspoken brief to limit the field of ideas to what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the powerbrokers in organised religions long ago decided was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; permissable
</em><br />
<br /><br />But organised religion, like organised academy, should be separate from 
<br />
the original intent.
<br />
The same is true for philosophy.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Science (and hopefully philosophy if it can keep up) will usually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seek to enlarge and populate the field of ideas with anything and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everything necessary to understand reality.
</em><br />
<br /><br />But by preventing seriousness in theology and its related questions, 
<br />
you make yourself an objective ally of those who want &quot;theology&quot; to be 
<br />
kept in the hand of social manipulators.
<br />
And the worst is that this attitude encourages a wrong understanding of 
<br />
science, like if science was answering (or even tackling) those 
<br />
questions, which for methodological reasons only, it does not. It makes 
<br />
science a peculiar theology : one which pretend to reach the truth. Is 
<br />
that not a form of arrogance?
<br />
Is not naturalism a religion? Is not the &quot;primitive universe&quot; or 
<br />
&quot;Nature&quot; just a &quot;Modern God&quot;?
<br />
After all, as I just recall in my preceding post, nobody has given a 
<br />
proof of the existence of Nature. Even Aristotle, as I begin to 
<br />
suspect, has been much more cautious on the existence of Nature than 
<br />
most of its followers.
<br />
I have no problem with scientists and theologians. I have problem with 
<br />
any dogma, both when used in science or in theology. But today, 
<br />
dogmatic theologians are less annoying than dogmatic scientists, 
<br />
because the dogmatic scientists pretend having no dogma, making dialog 
<br />
on fundamental open questions even more difficult I'm afraid.
