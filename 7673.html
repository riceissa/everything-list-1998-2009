<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Although it is of course debatable, I hold that what we call reality is

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our minds' &quot;understanding&quot; of our sensory perceptions.
</em><br />
<br />It's just amazing on this list.  Does no one speak up for
<br />
realism?  The *default* belief among *all* people up until
<br />
they take their first fatal dive into a philosophy book
<br />
is that there is an ordinary three-dimensional world that
<br />
we are all running around in.
<br />
<br />(Yes---one *may* look at it as a model, but is this *really*
<br />
necessary?  It prevents accurate understanding as well as
<br />
fosters terrible misunderstandings.)
<br />
<br />When 99% of the human race use the word &quot;reality&quot;, they mean
<br />
the world outside their skins. 
<br />
<br />If you sacrifice our common understanding of &quot;reality&quot;, then
<br />
you'll find yourself in a hole out of which you'll never climb.

<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; How do you (all) imagine experience/knowledge WITHOUT

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience and knowledge to absorb/create it? It is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (vicious?) circle. Do we start with a blank form to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fill in? What empty lines? what relations? where from?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You all use the word &quot;reality&quot; - who's and who knows
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what is 'behind' it? We interpret some figment by our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; own (1st mostly, but applying 3rd pers. info as well -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the extent how we absorbed it as our own 1st pers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; compliance) We are part of the &quot;reality&quot;-word....
</em><br />
<br />See?  This is what happens.
<br />
<br />Look, it's VERY simple:  take as a first baby-step the notion
<br />
that the 19th century idea of a cosmos is basically true, and
<br />
then add just the Big Bang.  What we then have is a universe
<br />
that operates under physical laws.  So far---you'll readily
<br />
agree---this is *very* simple conceptually.
<br />
<br />Next, look at this picture after 14.7 billion years.  Guess
<br />
what has evolved?  Finally, there is intelligence and there
<br />
are entities who can *perceive* all this grandeur.
<br />
<br />So, don't forget which came first.  Not people.  Not perceptions.
<br />
Not ideas.  Not dich an sich.  Not 1st person.  Not 3rd person.
<br />
NOT ANY OF THIS NONSENSE.  Keep to the basics and we *perhaps*
<br />
will have a chance to understand what is going on.  
<br />
<br />And have a common language with which to describe it.
<br />
