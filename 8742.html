</em><br />
<br /><br />I did elsewhere. Also I think we could have perhaps some vocabulary 
<br />
problems.
<br />
I agree that some believer in God does assume that a beautiful sunshine 
<br />
is a God's gift to us. Here I was more alluding to Plato's view of God 
<br />
as &quot;the Good&quot;, and I was talking about someone who makes such a 
<br />
personal experience of beauty, in front of that sunshine, that he takes 
<br />
it as a, personal or first person for sure, experience of the 
<br />
Good/God/whatever (sort of mystical experience if you want).
<br />
Of course it is not a proof (as in pure math), nor an evidence in the 
<br />
Popper sense of confirmation. Nor can a reconstitution of oneself 
<br />
during a teleportation be a proof of comp, nor can quantum suicide 
<br />
provides any proof that QM, or Everett, or comp are true. First Person 
<br />
Knowledge is just incorrigible and unfalsifiable, and as such 
<br />
unscientific. Science is concerned only with third person discourses, 
<br />
or, arguably, with first person plural discourses (the one which I 
<br />
defined explicitly through duplication of populations of individuals).
<br />
<br />Now I don't think it is really important to be so precise in the 
<br />
beginning. At some point I will be obliged to say many 
<br />
counter-intuitive propositions and explain how in some important cases 
<br />
first person truth can indirectly lead to 100% falsifiable third person 
<br />
propositions, but it is not easy to explain. Well, I wouldn' t have 
<br />
believe myself a large part of what I want to explain if that wouldn't 
<br />
have been confirmed by the Lobian interview. Nevertheless, I am 
<br />
realizing now  that many &quot;rational mystics&quot; (including the Neoplatonist 
<br />
pagan theologians) are closer to the lobian machine than I would have 
<br />
thought before reading Plotinus. I am still searching more confirmation 
<br />
because if this is confirmed (I have some criteria) it would put some 
<br />
new light on the discussion.
<br />
<br />I will try to sum up this in a new thread on Plotinus (and 
<br />
neoplatonism, more generally).
<br />
At some point I will explain how I am getting (apparently) an 
<br />
arithmetical interpretation of Plotinus, and on some part of Plato's 
<br />
Parmenides. My work would make Plotinus theory of matter 100% 
<br />
experimentally testable.
<br />
<br />Of course there is nothing miraculous that honest introspector converge 
<br />
toward the lobian discourse, given that this is the discourse of the 
<br />
self-referential correct machine.
<br />
<br />I don't know if that relation with Plotinus will help me selling my 
<br />
stuff, but this is another problem (for a future different thread). 
<br />
What some Christian theologians dismissed in Plato, they will dismiss 
<br />
it in any TOE.
<br />
<br />Bruno
