</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Prepare for some parenthetical remarks.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I assume you mean (s)he cares only about his/her implementation, body, 
<br />
gender or the like.  A utility function that depends on indexical 
<br />
information.  Fine, but tricky.  If I care only about my implementation, 
<br />
then I don't care about my &quot;brothers&quot;.  Things will depend on exactly how 
<br />
the experiment works.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, I don't think it's unreasonable for the utility 
<br />
function to not depend on indexical information.  For example, Bob might 
<br />
like Alice and place equal utility on both Alice's money and his own, like 
<br />
in the example I used.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In practice, I think people mainly place utility on those who will 
<br />
remember the stuff they are currently experiencing.  Thus if there was a way 
<br />
to partially share memories, things could get interesting.)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Note for James Higgo: the concept of &quot;self&quot; can be defined in various 
<br />
ways.  I do not mean to imply that there is any objective reason for him to 
<br />
use these ways.  e.g. I might decide, not knowing my gender, that I still 
<br />
care only about people who have the same gender as me.  Thus Bob would not 
<br />
care about Alice.  Silly, but possible.  I guess the drugs also make you 
<br />
forget which body parts go with what, but you can still look, so the 
<br />
experiences are not identical.  Just mentioning that in case someone would 
<br />
have jumped in on that point.)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I would also say that any wise man - which I am not - will certainly 
<br />
have a utility function that does _not_ depend on indexical information!  We 
<br />
are fools.)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OK, back to the question.  Forget I said a thing.]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's effectively a game.  But there's no point in debating sematics.  In 
<br />
any case, just choose a utility function (which will also depend on 
<br />
indexical information), analyse it based on that, and out comes the correct 
<br />
answer to maximize expected utility.  So let's concentrate on the case with 
<br />
just Bob below.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     You are correct as far as him thinking he is more likely to be in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;round 2.  However, you are wrong to think he will push button 1.  It is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;much the same as with the Bob and Alice example:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;You said that in the Bob and Alice example, they would push button 1 if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;they were selfish, which I'm assuming that they are, and you said that the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;seeming paradox is actually a result of game theory (hence the above 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;discussion). But in this example you're saying that the participant would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;push button 2. How is that the same?
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you're saying that even if they are &quot;selfish&quot; they would push button 
<br />
2, I won't argue.  I was just using a different utility function for being 
<br />
&quot;selfish&quot;, one that did not depend on indexical info.  Pushing 2 is better 
<br />
anyway, so why complain?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     He thinks he is only 1/101 likely to be in round 1.  However, he 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;also knows that if he _is_ in round 1, the effect of his actions will be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;magnified 100-fold.  Thus he will push button 2.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     You might see this better by thinking of measure as the # of copies 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of him in operation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     If he is in round 1, there is 1 copy operating.  The decision that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;copy makes will affect the fate of all 100 copies of him.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     If he is in round 2, all 100 copies are running.  Thus any one copy 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of him will effectively only decide its own fate and not that of its 99 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;brothers.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;That actually illustrates my point, which is that the measure of oneself is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;irrelevant to decision making. It's really the magnitude of the effect of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the decision that is relevant. You say that the participant should think 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;I'm more likely to be in round 2, but if I were in round 1 my decision 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would have a greater effect.&quot;
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it's nice to see that you accept my resolution of the &quot;paradox&quot;.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I have a hard time believing that your point was, in fact, the 
<br />
above.  You brought forth an attack on anthropic reasoning, calling it 
<br />
paradoxical, and I parried it.  Now you claim that you were only pointing 
<br />
out that anthropic reasoning is just an innocent bystander?  Of course it's 
<br />
just a friendly training exercise, but you do seem to be pulling a switch 
<br />
here.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I suggest that he instead think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;I'm in both round 1 and round 2, and I should give equal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consideration to the effects of my decision in both rounds.&quot;
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I assume you mean he should think &quot;I am, or was, in round 1, and I am, 
<br />
or will be, in round 2&quot;.  There is no need for him to think that, and it's 
<br />
not true.  Only one of the &quot;brothers&quot; was in round 1.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he doesn't care even about his own &quot;brothers&quot; we are back to game 
<br />
theory.  And don't say it's not a game because this time, the guy who is in 
<br />
round 1 definately does affect his &quot;brothers&quot; as well as himself.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;This way, we can make decisions without reference to the measure of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;conscious thoughts (unless you choose to consider it as part of your 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;utility function), and we do not need to have a theory of consciousness, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;which at least involves solving the implementation problem (or in my own 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;proposal where static bit strings can be conscious, the analogous 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interpretation problem).
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, anyone whose utility function does not depend on measure is 
<br />
definately insane in my book.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One good utility function could have the form
<br />
U = [sum_(thoughts) f(thought) M(thought)] + V
<br />
where f is some function, M is the (unnormalized!!) measure, and V is to 
<br />
take into account other stuff he may care about.  V = 0 is perhaps the 
<br />
wisest choice.  This does not take indexical info into account, so you will 
<br />
probably not like it.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, as we have seen anthropic reasoning leads to the conclusion 
<br />
that both rounds are equally important.  So you are not suggesting that he 
<br />
act any different in practice, you are just suggesting that he lie to 
<br />
himself about why he should act that way.
