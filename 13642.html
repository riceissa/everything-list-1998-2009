<br />
<br />DN:  OK
<br />
<br />RS:  Emergence is entirely a phenomenon of the observer. No observer, no
<br />
emergence. So I wouldn't really be calling it co-emergence.
<br />
<br />I just meant that the observer's world, taken with the 'physical' phenomena
<br />
correlated with it, could then be said to 'co-emerge'.  It was this
<br />
relationship I was emphasising (but see below).
<br />
<br />RS:  What must emerge from the physics is the perception of self, or
<br />
self-awareness. Whether this can be identified with consciousness is
<br />
rather a moot point, perhaps to be settled much later. Someone like
<br />
Hoftstadter with his strange loops would probably argue in favour of
<br />
this however. So would Dennett, if I read him correctly.
<br />
<br />DN:  Now this seems to me crucial.  When you say that self-awareness emerges
<br />
from the physics, ISTM that this is what I was getting at in the bit you
<br />
didn't comment on directly:
<br />
<br />&quot;My claim is....that if (machines) are (conscious), it couldn't be solely in
<br />
virtue of any 'imaginary computational worlds' imputed to them, but rather
<br />
because they support some unique, distinguished process of *physical*
<br />
emergence that also corresponds to a unique observer-world.&quot;
<br />
<br />However, perhaps what is significant is the distinction you make above
<br />
between 'self-awareness', and 'consciousness', which is what I'd been trying
<br />
to do in previous posts in my unintelligible way.  IOW, that some primitive
<br />
or 'distinguished' form of self-relation is associated with the physics, and
<br />
that the emergence of 'conscious' observer worlds then equates to a
<br />
hierarchy of emergence supervening on that.  To use a common analogy,
<br />
observer worlds would emerge by following something like the 'distinguished'
<br />
explanatory trajectory taken in the emergence of 'life' from 'dead matter'.
<br />
But, if we accept functionalism, we seem to have a horse of another, and
<br />
most peculiar, colour.  It seems, since there is no unique 'computational'
<br />
interpretation of the physical level of behaviour, that there can likewise
<br />
be no unique (and hence 'distinguished') set of self-relations associated
<br />
with any physical events that would in turn evoke a unique observer world.
<br />
<br />(But a glimmer of comprehension may be igniting in the dim recesses of my
<br />
(putative) mind.)  Perhaps when you say:
<br />
<br />RS:  The conscious entity that the computer implements would know about
<br />
it. It is not imaginary to itself. And by choosing to interpret the
<br />
computer's program in that way, rather than say a tortured backgammon
<br />
playing program, we open a channel of communication with the
<br />
consciousness it implements.
<br />
<br />DN:  .......you mean that if functionalism is true, then though any of the
<br />
myriad interpretations of the physics might possibly evoke an observer world
<br />
(although presumably most would be incoherent), only interpretations we are
<br />
able to 'interact with', precisely because of the consistency of their
<br />
externalised behaviour with us and our environment, are relevant (causally
<br />
or otherwise) *to us*.  And if this can be shown to converge on a *unique*
<br />
such interpretation for a given physical system, in effect this would then
<br />
satisfy my criterion of supervening on *some* distinguishable or unique set
<br />
of physical relations, even if we couldn't say what it was. So this, then,
<br />
would be the 'other mind' - and from this perspective, all the other
<br />
interpretations are 'imaginary' *for us*.
<br />
<br />(As an aside, this reminds me of a story about Nixon's press secretary, Ron
<br />
Ziegler. The White House Press Corps, having just listened in exasperated
<br />
disbelief to the nth version of the 'official statement' on Watergate,
<br />
protested: &quot;But Ron, what about all the other statements?&quot;  Ziegler replied:
<br />
&quot;This is the operative statement; all the other statements are
<br />
inoperative.&quot;  Perhaps the 'interaction model' we choose in effect selects
<br />
the corresponding 'operative consciousness' in terms of our world; all the
<br />
others are 'inoperative'.)
<br />
<br />This has a very 'strange' feel to it (but perhaps this is appropriate).  It
<br />
seems to follow that there can still in principle be a 'bridge' between a
<br />
functional (computationalist) account of a 'conscious' machine, and a
<br />
'physicalist' one - i.e. that either explanatory mode could account for the
<br />
same phenomena.  Perhaps this is what you mean by 'downwards' as well as
<br />
'upwards' causation?  So it then becomes an empirical project - i.e. that it
<br />
will eventually turn out - or not - that computationalism emerges as the
<br />
survivor in the competition to be the most Occamishly cogent account of the
<br />
relation between conscious phenomena and physics, and between a 'conscious
<br />
being' and its environment.  Olympia and Klara type arguments, if I've
<br />
understood them, seem to exclude any *fixed* relationship between 'physical'
<br />
events and computational ones, but this appears not to be required by a
<br />
functionalist interpretation of physical events, if what I've argued above
<br />
makes sense.  And 'physical', in this sense, needn't of course imply
<br />
anything like 'primitive matter'.
<br />
<br />I hope, unlike Father William, you will not kick me downstairs at this
<br />
point, but bear with me in this further debugging session.
<br />
<br />Cheers

<br />
<br /><br /><br />RS:  This is where I get lost. Stability of the world has to do with
<br />
the necessary robustness property of observers, as I argue in section
<br />
4.2 of my book. I note also in that section that alternative proposals
<br />
exist as well.
<br />
<br />Yes, sorry - I thought this might happen.  I meant 'stable' in the sense of
<br />
a stable or unique association between an observer moment and physical
<br />
events with which it is correlated.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; equates to the 'bit-string plenitude' (which is differentiable from 'no

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; computational emergence through bits up through, say, strings, quarks,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; atoms, molecules, etc - in other words what is perceived as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter-energy by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; observers.  I then assume that both 'physical objects' and any

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; IOW, the observer is the

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 1-person view, and the physical behaviour the 3-person view, of the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; underlying complex emergent - they're different descriptions of the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; events.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3rd person behaviour is that which is shared by all possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observers. There is also first person plural phenomena, sharable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between multiple observers, but not necessarily all. Science, as we

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; practise it today, is strictly first person plural, though in

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; principle at least shared by all humans regardless of culture. Some of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics, like quantum laws, and the conservation laws that arise from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point of view invariance is however a string candidate for being

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; called 3rd person.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; If this is so, then as you say, the opening of the 'communication

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; would be a matter of establishing the means and modes of interaction

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; any new consciousness, because the same seamless underlying causal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sequence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; unites observer-world and physical-world: again, different descriptions,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; same events.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK - it seems you're talking about supervenience here.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; If the above is accepted (but I'm beginning to suspect there's something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; deeply wrong with it), then the 'stability' of the world of the observer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; should equate to the 'stability' of the physical events to which it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; linked through *identity*.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is where I get lost. Stability of the world has to do with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the necessary robustness property of observers, as I argue in section
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4.2 of my book. I note also in that section that alternative proposals
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exist as well.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Now here's what puzzles me.  ISTM that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; imputation of 'computation' to the physical computer is only through the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; systematic correspondence of certain stable aspects of its (principally)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; electronic behaviour to computational elements: numbers,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; mathematical-logical operators, etc.  The problem is in the terms
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'imputation' and 'correspondence': this is surely merely a *way of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; speaking*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; about the physical events in the computer, an arbitrary ascription, from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; infinite possible set, of externally-established semantics to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intrinsic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; physical syntactics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The attribution of computation is performed by the observer (otherwise
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; known as user) of the computer, as you say. The attribution of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any processes can only be done by the conscious observer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; erself. Attribution of consciousness in any non-self process can never
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be definite, although it is typically useful to attribute a mind to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other processes in the environment to help reason about them (other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; people, obviously, but also many of the more complicated animals, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perhaps also to computers when they achieve a certain level of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sophistication).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But by accepting functionalism, we can even make stronger assertions -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; processes that sufficiently accurately mimic conscious ones, must
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; therefore be conscious.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Consequently, ISTM that the emergence of observer-worlds has to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; correlated (somehow) - one-to-one, or isomorphically - with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; corresponding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'physical' events: IOW these events, with their 'dual description',
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; constitute a single 'distinguished' *causal* sequence.  By contrast,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *any*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of the myriad 'computational worlds' that could be ascribed to the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; events must remain - to the computer, rather than the programmer - only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; arbitrary or 'imaginary' ones.  This is why I described them as 'nested'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; perhaps 'orthogonal' or 'imaginary' are better: they may -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'platonically' -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; exist somewhere in the plenitude, but causally disconnected from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; physical world in which the computer participates. The computer doesn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'know' anything about them.  Consequently, how could they possess any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'communication channel' to the computer's - and our - world 'out there'?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The conscious entity that the computer implements would know about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it. It is not imaginary to itself. And by choosing to interpret the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computer's program in that way, rather than say a tortured backgammon
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; playing program, we open a channel of communication with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness it implements.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We've had some discussion here about whether rocks can be conscious or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not, which has some bearing on this topic.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Of course I'm not claiming by this that machines couldn't be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious.  My
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; claim is rather that if they are, it couldn't be solely in virtue of any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'imaginary computational worlds' imputed to them, but rather because

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; this must also apply to the 'mind-brain' relationship.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; If I'm wrong (as no doubt I am), ISTM I must have erred in some step or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; other of my logic above.  How do I debug it?
