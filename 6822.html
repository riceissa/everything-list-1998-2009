Dear Prof. Standish,
<br />
<br />Thanks for the quibbles, which sound reasonable.  However, I'm going to 
<br />
stand my ground.
<br />
<br />You gave this reference about life's origins.  (I found it at 
<br />
<a href="http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/astro-ph/pdf/0209/0209385.pdf">http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/astro-ph/pdf/0209/0209385.pdf</a>)
<br />
<br />This article, as you point out, asserts &quot;that the rapidity of biogenesis on 
<br />
Earth suggests that life is common in the Universe.&quot;   This assertion is 
<br />
shown to be probably correct with some reasonable assumptions.  One of the 
<br />
assumptions is that if life occurs here, it must also occur on other 
<br />
terrestrial planets.  However, the part that I have trouble with is figuring 
<br />
out exactly how that first living organism was created.  (&quot;Living&quot; means it 
<br />
has the ability to take in energy from the environment and transform the 
<br />
energy for growth and reproduction.)  &quot;Living&quot; requires a highly organized 
<br />
and complex mechanism - that humans, so far, have not been able to create. 
<br />
I can't imagine how such an organism could occur accidentally.  I would call 
<br />
that first living organism a miraculous circumstance.
<br />
<br />As for all of today's humans coming from 2000 breeders 70,000 years ago, you 
<br />
point out that this may merely mean that natural selection caused other, 
<br />
inferior, &quot;Neanderthal&quot; lines to disappear.  This does not necessarily mean 
<br />
that some disaster had reduced the numbers of our breeding ancestors to 
<br />
2,000, as I assumed.
<br />
<br />However, a natural disaster did occur approximately 70,000 years ago, 
<br />
according to 
<br />
<a href="http://www.olympus.net/personal/ptmaccon/pif/time_lines/time_lines_4.html">http://www.olympus.net/personal/ptmaccon/pif/time_lines/time_lines_4.html</a> 
<br />
This source says, &quot;Largest volcanic eruption in 400 million years, producing 
<br />
2500-3000 kilometers of ash, and 1 trillion tons of aerosols.  Cloud was 
<br />
more than 34 kilometers high. Ash covers India between 1 and 6 meters deep. 
<br />
(May have started folllowing cooling period).  6 year period during which 
<br />
the largest amount of volcanic sulphur was deposited in the past 110,000 
<br />
years, followed by 1000 years of the lowest ice core oxygen isotope ratios, 
<br />
temperatures were colder than during the Last Glacial Maximum at 18 - 21,000 
<br />
years ago.  Sea level was 160 feet below current.  Global temperature drops 
<br />
average of 21 degrees.  Volcanic Winter lasted about six years. It was 
<br />
followed by 1,000 years of the coldest Ice Age on record. Warming begins 
<br />
again 1,000 years later.  Believed that the 1% human genetic variation stems 
<br />
from this time.  No other species shows such a small variation.  Genetic 
<br />
evidence suggests only 1,000 adults survived world wide. May be event which 
<br />
caused rise in modern racial differences - Professor Stanley Ambrose of the 
<br />
University of Illinois.&quot;  This article suggests that near-extinction of 
<br />
humans did occur.

<br />
<br />Minor quibbles, which don't actually detract from your argument:

<br />There is evidence that life might arise fairly easily, given the right

conditions. This is the so-called &quot;early appearance of life
<br />
argument&quot;. See arXiv:astro-ph/0209385.

<br />Endangerment of a species does not follow from a genetic
<br />
&quot;bottleneck&quot;. Consider a beneficial mutation arising 70,000 years ago,
<br />
and rapidly increasing to 100% fixation within the human
<br />
population. The genetic data would point to us all being descended
<br />
from a single &quot;Adam&quot; or &quot;Eve&quot; at the time, and the number of
<br />
individuals whose descendants ultimately breed with Adam or Eve's
<br />
descendents. All other germ lines are eliminated from the population
<br />
by natural selection. Thus a genetic bottleneck. However, the breeding
<br />
population may have been any number - eg 1 million, hardly an
<br />
endangered species.
