<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Logic&quot; are just our locally grown [and apparently sequential] way of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;revealing it.  The question I raise is the implicit inclusion of time in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this process.
</em><br />
<br />I think it would be simpler if you responded directly to quotes from my 
<br />
previous post, rather than just making general statements about issues 
<br />
raised in that post. For example, here you continue to *assert* that there 
<br />
is something inherently time-based about logical statements, but you don't 
<br />
in any way explain what is wrong with my counterargument from that post:
<br />
<br />'The laws of logic need not be thought of as rules of &quot;discovery&quot;, they can 
<br />
be thought of purely as expressing static relationships between static 
<br />
truths, relationships that would exist regardless of whether anyone 
<br />
contemplated or &quot;discovered&quot; them. For example, in every world where X and Y 
<br />
are simultaneously true, it is also true that X is true, even if no one 
<br />
notices this.'
<br />
<br />Likewise, you didn't address my point that &quot;I can't think of any historical 
<br />
examples of new mathematical/scientific/philosophical ideas that require you 
<br />
to already  believe their premises in order to justify these premises&quot;, and 
<br />
you didn't address my question about whether you think there could be a 
<br />
world/kernel where a vehicle simultaneously had different numbers of wheels, 
<br />
or my question about whether, when you make statements about your theory as 
<br />
a whole like &quot;the information re the Nothing is in the All so they are 
<br />
infinitely nested&quot; you are assuming that the negation of these statements 
<br />
(in this case, 'the information re the Nothing is not in the All so they are 
<br />
not infinitely nested') is false.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Should we have the hubris to impose this somewhat questioned concept on all 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;other universes?  In my view the states of all universes preexist in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;All [as some of the kernels] and &quot;Physical Reality&quot; washes over them in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;some sequentially inconsistent way.
</em><br />
<br />So do believe the statement &quot;the states of all universes don't preexist in 
<br />
the All, and 'Physical Reality' does not wash over them in any sequentially 
<br />
inconsistent way&quot; would be false? If so, it seems that you yourself have the 
<br />
&quot;hubris&quot; to apply the logical law of noncontradiction to statements about 
<br />
reality as a whole.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I do not agree with your &quot;rather&quot; based cancelation of the residual 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;information issue since I see it as an unnecessary complication of my own 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;method.
</em><br />
<br />I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;rather based cancellation.&quot; If you're talking 
<br />
about my point that every statement could be simultaneously true and false 
<br />
if you throw out the laws of logic, obviously *I* don't believe this is a 
<br />
good way to solve the &quot;residual information issue&quot;, since I think it's 
<br />
nonsensical to allow logical contradictions. But since you seem to be saying 
<br />
the laws of logic aren't absolute, I was just pointing out that you would 
<br />
have no basis for denying that statements about reality can be 
<br />
simultaneously true and false. If you say that it is an &quot;unnecessary 
<br />
complication&quot; to allow statements about reality as a whole to be both true 
<br />
and false, then you are in effect saying it would be an unnecessary 
<br />
complication to claim that the laws of logic don't apply to reality as a 
<br />
whole!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Can a kernel of information be self inconsistent?  From Bruno's last post I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;think it is possible to impose this idea on the All.
</em><br />
<br />I don't think Bruno's last post was really implying that &quot;everything&quot; would 
<br />
be inconsistent, I thought his point was more that you can't consider things 
<br />
like the collection of all possible sets to itself be a &quot;set&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;My current view is that each state of that dynamic has to be completely 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;independent of the current state.
</em><br />
<br />Does that mean you say the statement &quot;each state of the dynamic is 
<br />
completely dependent on the current state&quot; is false?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The way I describe this is to say that the dynamic is inconsistent.   It 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;helps this idea if there are kernels that are pairwise inconsistent.
</em><br />
<br />I don't understand what this means--can you give a concrete example of two 
<br />
kernels that are pairwise inconsistent?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I think that is straight forward enough.   If there are kernels that are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;self inconsistent then all the better.  Why should they be selected out?
</em><br />
<br />Then why did you earlier say &quot;I am not ready to include a two wheeled 
<br />
tricycle that is simultaneously a one, three, or four wheeled tricycle&quot;?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;As to does mathematics contain information, mathematics has the potential 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to erect boundaries so by my definition it is information.
</em><br />
<br />But doesn't *any* statement you make about reality as a whole, like &quot;each 
<br />
state of that dynamic has to be completely independent of the current 
<br />
state&quot;, erect a &quot;boundary&quot; between itself and its negation, in this case 
<br />
&quot;each state of the dynamic is completely dependent on the current state&quot;?
