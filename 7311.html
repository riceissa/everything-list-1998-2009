<br />
I can see an interesting new problem in this thread. Let me put it in a thought
<br />
experiment as the praxis in this list requires.
<br />
<br />You are in the same torture room as before, but now the guy is going to 
<br />
torture you to death. You have three options:
<br />
<br />A: you flip a coin to decide whether you are going to be tortured;
<br />
B: you press the copy button 100 times;
<br />
C: you press the copy button once.
<br />
<br />What do the people in this list choose?
<br />
<br />For some people, creating copies increases their 1st person probability
<br />
of escaping torture. So that at each time they press the button they can
<br />
associate with that a 50% probability of escape. These would
<br />
choose B, since then they would have a very near certainty of escaping
<br />
torture.
<br />
<br />For others,  creating copies does not increase any such probability, and
<br />
there is ultimately no meaning in talking about 1st person probability.
<br />
But for some reason they seem to feel a strong connection with the
<br />
copies, as if they are all the &quot;same person&quot;. They think it is just as
<br />
good to offer a good meal to the copies as it is to offer it for 
<br />
themselves. These people should choose C, since in this case they will
<br />
be comforted by the fact that a copy of themselves would survive and have
<br />
a good life. They don't really need more than one. Actually, one is much
<br />
better than many, since they wouldn't have the legal and financial problems
<br />
associated with having lots of copies around.
<br />
<br />For others, as myself, creating copies does not increase my 1st person
<br />
probability of escaping torture. And differently from Lee, I think it is just as
<br />
good to offer a good meal to my copy as it is to offer it to my family and
<br />
friends. But it is definitely different from offering it to me.
<br />
These people would choose A.
<br />
<br />I cannot really understand choice B. Would anyone really choose that or am I
<br />
just grossly misunderstanding some opinions in this list?
<br />
<br />About choice B, it raises other interesting questions: suppose you know that
<br />
the copies are going to undergo some sort of plastic surgery a week or so
<br />
after the experiment, and will look very different from yourself now. They could
<br />
also undergo some type of slow personality modification (as education), such
<br />
that they would at any moment agree that they are experiencing a continuity
<br />
of identity. Would you still choose B? What if this change really isn't slow,
<br />
but sudden, at the time of creation of the copy? Does it make a difference?
<br />
Then what is the difference between doing a copy of yourself or a copy of
<br />
someone else, since any two people could be connected by a series of
<br />
continuous transformations? Would you still be comforted by the fact that
<br />
someone, even if very different from you, would be created to replace you?
<br />
<br />Eric
