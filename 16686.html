<em class="quotelev1">&gt; testable. More in the comment below.
</em><br />
<br />So my only problem with the usual view of probability is that it
<br />
doesn't seem to me to emerge naturally from a platonic theory of
<br />
conscious.  Is your proposal something that would conceivably be
<br />
arrived at by a rational observer in one of the (supposedly) rare
<br />
worlds where white rabbits are common?   Does it have features that
<br />
would lead one to predict the absence of white rabbits, or does it
<br />
just offer a way to explain their absence after the fact?
<br />
<br />As I mentioned before, assuming computationalism it seems to me that
<br />
it is theoretically possible to create a computer simulation that
<br />
would manifest any imaginable conscious entity observing any
<br />
imaginable &quot;world&quot;, including schizophrenic beings observing
<br />
psychedelic realities.  So, then further assuming Platonism, all of
<br />
these strange experiences should exist in Platonia.  Along with all
<br />
possible normal experiences.
<br />
<br />I don't see any obvious, non-&quot;ad hoc&quot; mechanism to eliminate or
<br />
minimize strange experiences relative to normal experiences, and I
<br />
don't think adding one is justified just for that purpose, or even
<br />
necessary since an unconstrained platonic theory does have the obvious
<br />
virtue of saying that there will always be Kellys like myself who have
<br />
never seen white rabbits.
<br />
<br />As for your earlier questions about how you should bet, I have two responses.
<br />
<br />First that there exists a Bruno who will make every possible bet.
<br />
One particular Bruno will make his bet on a whim, while another Bruno
<br />
will do so only after long consideration, and yet another will make a
<br />
wild bet in a fit of madness.  Each Bruno will &quot;feel&quot; like he made a
<br />
choice, but actually all possible Brunos exist, so all possible bets
<br />
are made, for all possible subjectively &quot;felt&quot; reasons.
<br />
<br />Second, and probably more helpfully, I'll quote this paper
<br />
(<a href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/content/1/c6/04/17/78/manymindsandprobs.doc">http://www.kcl.ac.uk/content/1/c6/04/17/78/manymindsandprobs.doc</a>) by
<br />
David Papineau, which sounds reasonable to me:
<br />
<br />&quot;But many minds theorists can respond that the logic of statistical
<br />
inference is just the same on their view as on the conventional view.
<br />
True, on their view in any repeated trial all the different possible
<br />
sequences of results can be observed, and so some attempts to infer
<br />
the probability from the observed frequency will get it wrong.  Still,
<br />
any particular mind observing any one of these sequences will reason
<br />
just as the conventional view would recommend:  note the frequency,
<br />
infer that the probability is close to the frequency, and hope that
<br />
you are not the unlucky victim of an improbable sample.  Of course the
<br />
logic of this kind of statistical inference is itself a matter of
<br />
active philosophical controversy.  But it will be just the same
<br />
inference on both the many minds and the conventional view.
<br />
<br />[...]
<br />
<br />It is worth observing that, on the conventional view, what agents want
<br />
from their choices are the desired results, rather than that these
<br />
results be objectively probable (a choice that makes the results
<br />
objectively probable, but unluckily doesn't produce them, doesn't give
<br />
you what you want).  Given this, there is room to raise the question:
<br />
why are rational agents well-advised to choose actions that make their
<br />
desired results objectively probable?  Rather surprisingly, is no good
<br />
answer to this question.  (After all, you can't assume you will get
<br />
what you want if you so choose.)  From Pierce on, philosophers have
<br />
been forced to conclude that it is simply a primitive fact about
<br />
rational choice that you ought to weight future possibilities
<br />
according to known objective probabilities in making decisions.
<br />
<br />The many minds view simply says the same thing.  Rational agents ought
<br />
to choose those actions which will maximize the known objective
<br />
probability of desired results.  As to why they ought to do this,
<br />
there is no further explanation.  This is simply a basic truth about
<br />
rational choice.
<br />
<br />[...]
<br />
<br />I supect that this basic truth actually makes more sense on the many
<br />
minds view than on the conventional view.  For on the conventional
<br />
view there is a puzzle about the relation between this truth and the
<br />
further thought that ultimate success in action depends on desired
<br />
results actually occurring.  On the many minds view, by contrast,
<br />
there is no such further thought, since all possible results occur,
<br />
desired and undesired, and so no puzzle:  in effect there is only one
<br />
criterion of success in action, namely, maximizing the known objective
<br />
probability of desired results.  However, this is really the subject
<br />
for another paper, not least because the idea that agents ought to
<br />
maximize the known objective probability of desired results itself
<br />
hides a number of complexities which I have been skating over here.&quot;
