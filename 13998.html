Le 17-sept.-07, à 14:22, Russell Standish a écrit :
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sorry my fingers are slipping. Machines (computable functions) are a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; type of map, but not all maps are machines (or perhaps you prefer the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; word function to map).
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK. You know I like your little book as an introduction to the field, 
<br />
but, as you have already acknowledge, there is some lack in rigor in 
<br />
it, and it is not even clear if eventually you are of the ASSA type or 
<br />
RSSA type, or if you accept comp or not. Use of Bayes and Prior, for 
<br />
example, is a symptom of ASSA type reasoning. Distinction between 1 and 
<br />
3 person points of view is symptom of the RSSA type of reasoning, (and 
<br />
favored with comp).
<br />
RSSA reasoner does not necessarily condemn ASSA as useless or false for 
<br />
the explanation of geographical and cosmological aspect of our physical 
<br />
reality, but pure ASSA, without taking into account the 1-3 distinction 
<br />
is bound up to fail on the mind body problem (with or without the comp 
<br />
hyp.), that is ASSA could  explain things, but cannot explain the 
<br />
nature of mind and the nature of matter and the nature of the relation 
<br />
in between (and that is why they most often use &quot;Aritotle like identity 
<br />
theories&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not equivalent. Equivalent status. Assumption of the set of all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; infinite strings plays the same role as your assumption of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arithmetical realism, and that is of the ontological background.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I don't know. Let us fix a simple alphabet: {0, 1}. Then an infinite 
<br />
string like
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;111101000100111000000010100101100001101001 ..... (infinite on the 
<br />
right) can be seen as the chracteristic function of a subset of N (the 
<br />
first 1 in the string means then that 0 is in the set,, the second one 
<br />
that 1 is in the set etc. The resulting set is
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;{0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 12, 13, 14, 22, 24, 27, 29, 34, 35, 37, 40, ...}
<br />
So there is a bijection between the set of infinite strings on the 
<br />
{0,1} alphabet, and the subset of N. So without putting any 
<br />
extra-stcruture on the set of infinite strings, you could as well have 
<br />
taken as basic in your ontology the set of subset of N, written  P(N). 
<br />
Now, such a set is not even nameable in any first order theory. In a 
<br />
first order theory of those strings you will get something equivalent 
<br />
to Tarski theory of Real: very nice but below the turing world: the 
<br />
theory is complete and decidable and cannot be used for a theory of 
<br />
everything (there is no natural numbers definable in such theories). 
<br />
&nbsp;From this I can deduce that your intuition relies on second order 
<br />
arithmetic or analysis (and this is confirmed by the way you introduce 
<br />
time). But then this again is really a strong assumption, far stronger 
<br />
than arithmetical realism.
<br />
To be sure, I still don't know if your ontic base is just &quot;nothing&quot; 
<br />
(but then in which theory?) or the infinite strings (again, in which 
<br />
theory and as I said you will to use rich mathematics for that), etc.
<br />
As you know, I am trying to go a little beyond the UDA result so as to 
<br />
give a little smell of the real thing. The trouble is that the basic 
<br />
tools of logic and axiomatic are not very well known by anybody but the 
<br />
professional logicians.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It might seem like such uncountable sets are too much to assume, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in fact it is the simplest possible object. It has precisely zero
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information.
</em><br />
<br />Zero information. Zero justification. Occam razor ... I do agree with 
<br />
these major motivations for the everything idea, but I disagree with 
<br />
the proposition saying that the the set of strings needs 
<br />
zero-information. Why not the infinite strings on both right and left 
<br />
(coding the integers), or infinite many-dimensional lattices fit with 
<br />
zero and one on the vertex, or etc. ?
<br />
There is just a lack of enough precise definition so as to verify your 
<br />
statements that strings needs zero-information, and as I say above, 
<br />
from some standard and traditional view points, infinite strings needs 
<br />
a lot of information to be define.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; No countable set has this property.
</em><br />
<br />Why?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I put your objection
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; into the same category as those who claim the multiverse is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ontologically profligate. Apologies to intuistionists out there.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Apologies to intutionists and also to constructivist like Schmidhuber, 
<br />
but also to weak arithmetical platonist like, imo, digital mechanist 
<br />
ought to be.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Obviously I'm departing from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Schmidhuber at that point, and whilst in &quot;Why Occam's Razor&quot; I use 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; term Schmidhuber ensemble to refer to this, in my book I distinguish
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; between Schmidhuber's Great Programmer idea
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (which you confuse some time with the UD, I think).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; He does actually dovetail,
</em><br />
<br /><br />We have discuss this. In the first paper the &quot;great programmer&quot; is not 
<br />
a dovetailer, and indeed there is nothing in the ASSA approach for 
<br />
which dovetailing could play a role.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; so it is a universal dovetailer in all but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; name perhaps. But the ontological basis of the &quot;Great Programmer&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; differs very much from COMP.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Again this is not corect. Schmidhuber and me do agree on comp (100% 
<br />
agreement: we have the same hypothesis). And relatively to the comp hyp 
<br />
and the importance of the universal machine Schmidhuber and me are much 
<br />
closer than with Tegmark whi is just very naïve about notion of 
<br />
mathematical reality. Now the problem is that, unlike many people in 
<br />
this list, Schmidhuber does not address neither the mind body problem 
<br />
nor the 1-3 person distiinction, and the relativity of states which 
<br />
derives from that distinction. This forces him to literally defend the 
<br />
idea that randomness in nature never really exist, which is hard to 
<br />
justify in front of the physical branch of history we are living. This 
<br />
does not makes his work wrong, but at least incomplete (and then he 
<br />
should use Bennett notion of depth for the cosmological/geographical 
<br />
aspect (like I do in Conscience et mécanisme: using just Kolmogorov is 
<br />
not enough, but here I am going out topic.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course, although you'd better say the Standish ensemble so as not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to misattribute it to Bertie. Also, it is quite clearly a set (I think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you've read enough English papers to know the difference between and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ensemble and a set in English, I hope?)
</em><br />
<br /><br />Well, I hope you are not referring to the notion of &quot;ensemble&quot; as it 
<br />
occurs in physical statistics. Again, this would mean that you endow 
<br />
the space of infinite strings with a structure of a measure space 
<br />
(boolean sigma-algebra, for example). because this means that your 
<br />
basic ontology is much richer than just the strings. I am trying to 
<br />
understand a bit more clearly how you view of the everything thing.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; All of these concepts are more precise and have additional properties
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; to the set of all infinite strings. For instance, the reals have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; group properties of addition and multiplication that the strings
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; don't.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But as sets, they are isomorphic, and if you don't have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; extra-structure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; on your &quot;ensemble&quot;, the relation between your &quot;observers&quot; and your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;ensemble&quot;  is even more obscure, it seems to me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You've lost me here.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I'm the one saying that I'm lost here. I am just asking: how do you 
<br />
define &quot;observer&quot; in the infinite strings setting. (Actually with or 
<br />
without extra-strcuture, like what you need to have a measure space).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; So here you do explicitly accept extra-structure, a measure, on your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ensemble, making them again quite close to the reals.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; You cannot derive the existence of a measure from just a definition of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; a set. (There are *many* possible measures on any set).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes of course. The uniform measure has always been part of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definition.
</em><br />
<br /><br />This was not clear, sorry. Now you definitely need analysis or second 
<br />
order arithmetic. This is everything but nothing!
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; see Li &amp; Vitanyi example 4.2.1 for a detailed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; discussion. The idea is simple enough, however.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ... where they describe how to put a measure on some set of *subsets*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of an uncountable sets. You have to define a Borel structure on it,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It is indeed explained in Li &amp; Vitanyi (page 214q).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We must have different editions. On mine its page 243 :). So there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; must be some non-measurable subsets.
</em><br />
<br />This is not even provable in formal set theory like ZF (Zermelo 
<br />
Fraenkel). You need the axiom of choice, if I remember well. This means 
<br />
you presuppose set theory (a vastly bigger and richer ontology than 
<br />
arithmetic).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I fail to see how these can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be inverse images of an observers interpretation (O^{-1}(n)) must be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measurable). But then I admit I am acting like a physicist in glossing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; over these sorts of details.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I would not have dare to call you a physicist, but now that you admit 
<br />
you are acting a bit like them, I can understand better :)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It is the interpretation of the observer, but it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; isn't arbitrary.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Certainly not in Schmidhuber, as I remember (cf our discussions in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; list). OK, with comp, but in some RSSA way, and not in any ASSA way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; based on an ensemble.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Schmidhuber downplayed the role of the observer, as is typical of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; scientist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (OK, but only since 525 after J.C., and just because scientists have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; been forced to let the fundamental questioning to authorities mixing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; political and spiritual power ....).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What happened in 525 CE again?
</em><br />
<br /><br />The greek scientists, and after them all scientist, were forced to 
<br />
abandon the scientific field known as &quot;theology&quot; to the political 
<br />
authorities. 525 is the year where the Athenian Academy of Plato has 
<br />
been closed by the Christian emperor. Since then the human science are 
<br />
inexact at the roots,  making them inhuman at the roots too. Normal 
<br />
science and theology will surive up to the eleven century, thanks to 
<br />
the arabs, which will make it possible for the science to make a tiny 
<br />
come back at the Renaissance (Enlightnment Period) later. But 
<br />
scientific theology will not go through, and still today many scientist 
<br />
are unaware of the beautiful rational contribution of the platonist and 
<br />
neoplatonist in the human AND exact science. They are still putting 
<br />
under the rug all the interesting questions addressed by the Greek 
<br />
Theologian (To be sure most of these questions appeared also and before 
<br />
in China and India, but I never sure of the exact dates and places; 
<br />
many text are not yet precisely dated.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Since this appears to be the point of departure between you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; and he, I'll state that I've always followed you in this point, that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; the 1st person pov (what I call the semantic level) is important.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; OK. But again it could be misleading to call that &quot;the semantic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; level&quot;,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; because a relation between &quot;semantic&quot; and first person would be a very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; interesting things to dig on, but nobody has done that yet.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; All hypostases (first person, third person, first person plural, etc.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; have syntax and semantics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes but again we're mixing terminologies. When I refer to syntactic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; level, I'm refer to what stuff is,
</em><br />
<br /><br />You can do that. I see the point. But it is not standard at all and has 
<br />
to be explained in all detail, especially if you are not clear if you 
<br />
follow comp or not. Even with comp this is highly ambiguous.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and when I refer to semantic level,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I mean how it is interpreted.
</em><br />
<br />This is even less standard, and although I could put sense on it, this 
<br />
is only because I have tools for doing that. A term like 
<br />
&quot;interpretation&quot; can be seen as syntactical at some level and 
<br />
semantical at some other level.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This can be applied to all situations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where emergence is occurring.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I knwo a lot of people who are searching their gun when they hear the 
<br />
word &quot;emergence&quot;.  I mean this is a word which can be used once you 
<br />
take many precautions. Also, if comp is correct, as you know, it is 
<br />
matter (stuff) which emerges from consciousness/meaning (cf the 
<br />
reversal result).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So in the case of an ideal gas, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; molecular description is syntactic, and its thermodynamic description
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is semantic.
</em><br />
<br />Hmmm....  I cannot really accept this. Here is a case where emergence 
<br />
is far better than semantics.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  In the Game of Life, the update rule is syntactic, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; description in terms of gliders, puffers and guns is semantic.
</em><br />
<br />This is contrary to the standard use of those terms. You can do that, 
<br />
but you have to explain explicitly why and how. Logic is the science 
<br />
which is specialized in defining notion like syntax and semantics, both 
<br />
through mathematical structures.
<br />
Frankly a glider is still a finite syntactical object. A moving glider 
<br />
is a bit more ... dynamical, and this can be related through some 
<br />
&quot;operational&quot; semantics. Again, the point is to choose definition (no 
<br />
one are the best one) and then to stick on those definitions. I suggest 
<br />
to always use the original definition from the field which use the 
<br />
notion the most. And then you can modify them to suit your context, but 
<br />
it helps the reader if you do that explicitly.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It may
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not be the best terminology, but it is the best I've come across to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; date.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I doubt that. Perhaps be careful by using Wkipedia (it could be the 
<br />
best and the worth), verify perhaps on Stanford dictionnary, etc.
<br />
<br /><br />Another point where your fuzziness does not help is that you are not 
<br />
clear on the comp hyp. Schmidhuber is clear on comp, even if he has 
<br />
disagreed when discussing online in the list with the consequences I 
<br />
derive from it. But the disagreement comes not from what comp means, 
<br />
but from the 1/3 distinction, which Schmidhuber does not consider. 
<br />
Tegmark does introduce an embryo of 1/3 distinction (but quite 
<br />
different from mines (see below)), but Tegmark still uses some identity 
<br />
thesis implicitly for making observer belonging to universe, and minds 
<br />
to brain. Such identities have just no meaning at all once you 
<br />
postulate the comp hyp (or even strong weakening of it btw). OK? (by 
<br />
UDA). Yes?

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; definitions of the first person. In UDA it is the memory content of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; diary that a candidate for self-multiplication keep with him, and in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; AUDA I define the first person by the &quot;knower&quot; (and thus the knower
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; modal logic S4(*)) by using the more abstract theaetetical notion of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; knowledge given in the Theaetetus by Plato (they are related through
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the usual platonist &quot;dream argument&quot;).
