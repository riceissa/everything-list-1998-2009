<br />
<br />Hi John
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I really do not expect from you to give adequate replies to all these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; questions - it would make the grandkids of our grandkits scientifically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unemployed but you have unusual solutions and ideas and it may be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interesting to tape your mind..
</em><br />
<br />Whew!  But you are right about my inadequacies.  Indeed I see my basic
<br />
task, as others before me, to witheringly expose the specific
<br />
inadequacies of my replies to any and all questions.  To know less and
<br />
less with ever greater clarity is the journey and precisely-delineated
<br />
ignorance is the ultimate goal.  In that spirit......
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Mind is what brain does&quot; (although I find it a pars pro toto)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am questioning &quot;does&quot;. Would we restrict it to our ongoing image of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physiology, meaning: the brain does physical 'energy' consuming electrical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; changes by (physico/chemical) impact and by physiological changes (such as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; diffeences in blood-stream performance, chemical syntheses and migration of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; molecules) - or do we assign activities of some brain-image beyond today's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anatomical biology?
</em><br />
<br />I'm pretty convinced that we're going to be stymied in much of this
<br />
until we find another schema in which to re-express a new set of
<br />
'ultimates' for the purpose.  You've seen the various ways I've tried
<br />
to pump people's intuitions about this, but it may be that how one
<br />
feels about it is ultimately characterologically influenced rather
<br />
than logically compulsive.  However, I believe that we need a new
<br />
picture and a different language before the
<br />
physical-chemical-biological story you refer to above, and the
<br />
experiential, intentional narrative that we ignore at the cost of our
<br />
minds, can ever be reconciled satisfactorily.  On this basis, my
<br />
interest in COMP is not because I know it to be correct, but rather
<br />
that it is the beginning of an attempt to recast the investigation in
<br />
these terms, which is VERY hard to discover elsewhere.  In this regard
<br />
I should again note that Colin is working on his own approach on a
<br />
different basis but very much in the same spirit.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1. What instigates the 'function' (called mindwork) - ostentibly with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; connection to our 'material-figment' BRAIN,
</em><br />
<br />In my various ramblings, I've tried to cut the whole Gordian knot of
<br />
what can coherently be said to exist, and within this the whole debate
<br />
on materialism, panpsychism, mind-body hard problems, causal closure
<br />
of the physical, etc. by a simple expediency which then struck me as
<br />
obviously true (how about that?).  To re-state:
<br />
<br />1) Is there some logically prior requirement for anything to be said
<br />
to exist?  Reflect: 'something existing' necessitates presence not
<br />
absence.
<br />
2) What is the relation between presence and &quot;I&quot;' as I discover
<br />
myself?  Reflect: &quot;I&quot; discover myself to be present.
<br />
3) Conjunction of 1) and 2): There is presence and it is reflexive.
<br />
This constitutes what can be said to exist, and discovers it to be
<br />
personal (i.e. there is an &quot;I&quot; associated with it).
<br />
4) Is there some logically prior requirement to my 'knowing' anything?
<br />
&nbsp;Reflect: this and that must be distinguishable.  In terms of the
<br />
foregoing, this necessitates reflexive encounter (i.e.
<br />
self-differentiation)  This necessarily unites the senses of
<br />
'perceive', 'intend' and 'act'.
<br />
5) Conjunction of 1) - 4) &quot;I&quot; discover myself to be present through
<br />
reflexive encounter.  I've called this 'getting-a-grip-on-Oneself.
<br />
This move now collapses being, knowing, perceiving, intending and
<br />
acting.
<br />
<br />That's it.  But now we have all the prerequisites for not only
<br />
mindwork, but also matter-energy work, by this (as it seems to me)
<br />
simple recognition of a present and differentiable personal synthesis.
<br />
&nbsp;More: this very recognition now seems (to me at least) to be the
<br />
logically compelling prerequisite for any meaningful sense of
<br />
existence whatsoever.  From this simplicity, by differentiation we can
<br />
achieve mental and material multiplicity without limit, sans any
<br />
crazy-making ontological separation of mind and body.  The hard part
<br />
is the specifics of the correlation.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2. What keeps it running (and please, save me from the marvel of physicists
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the call 'energy' - but nobody knows what it is)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3. Who tells the process to buzz off, it is done,
</em><br />
<br />Well, it will appear, disappear, and reappear as the manifestation of
<br />
patterns of self-encounter.  Fundamentally, these patterns are not to
<br />
be distinguished into mind or matter, and this is crucial from the
<br />
necessary though limited perspective of causation, because it makes an
<br />
indivisible unity of perception, intention, and action central to the
<br />
logic of the story.  Nonetheless it will be a requirement of local
<br />
narratives in the 'traditions' either of physiology or phenomenology
<br />
to deploy the appropriate metaphors plausibly and to give intuitively
<br />
graspable answers to your the questions.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4. How does the 'product' incorporate into the rest of it?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (BTW these questions arise in 'functions','reactions',processes as well, if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we think beyond Physix Textbook 101).
</em><br />
<br />Ah, the product is of course yet another aspect of being/knowing.
<br />
IOW, we exist as mini-mes within perspectival horizons that limit us
<br />
to mindworlds  that nonetheless continue seamlessly in relation beyond
<br />
those horizons.  The mindworld by the arguments presented above
<br />
constitutes both our being and our knowledge. There is not (cannot
<br />
logically be) any observer and hence (unfortunately for Copenhagen
<br />
interpretations) no observation.  Reflect on the neonate: no
<br />
differentiation of self and other has yet occurred.  But through a
<br />
sort of inferred video game system of feedback, the &quot;I&quot; polarises to a
<br />
complementary subjective pole, forcing the rest of the mindworld to
<br />
the objective 'externalised' extreme, wherein characterisations of
<br />
'functions', 'reactions', 'processes' in terms of causality are
<br />
distinctively 'active' rather than 'intentional'.  Hence you may see
<br />
how all reality and all delusion stem from this survival reaction.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 5. Is a &quot;thought&quot; a product of the mind-process? if so, where does it settle
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to become consciously acknowledged for us... (for WHOM???)
</em><br />
<br />Well, I pursue my line of argument, and from this perspective thought
<br />
is a distinguishable modality of our mindworld - IOW a distinguishable
<br />
aspect at once of our being and our knowing.  And for whom?  Well,
<br />
I've been badgering Bruno on this very topic more than somewhat, but
<br />
again my line is that the 'whom' is the reflexively present global &quot;I&quot;
<br />
derived above, limited to mini-mes by perspectival horizons and pushed
<br />
to a subjective pole by the inexorable requirements of a
<br />
biological/evolutionary narrative.  You're entitled to claim on this
<br />
basis, as mini-me at any rate, that you are merely the master of all
<br />
you survey, but that couldn't be the case if in fact you weren't at
<br />
the same time heir to the whole ball of wax.
<br />

<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; David,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this question of mine is not within the ongoing discussion-details, just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'about' the ideas exposed in them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Mind is what brain does&quot; (although I find it a pars pro toto)
</em><br />

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; molecules) - or do we assign activities of some brain-image beyond today's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anatomical biology?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In the first case 'mind' is physical, memory, thought, mentality is as of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; yesterday and we can stop perspective research. Slowly return to faithful
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; creationism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If we believe in further enrichment of our cognitive inventory, I question:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1. What instigates the 'function' (called mindwork) - ostentibly with

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You mentioned below the 'mind-body' problem. Considering 'body' as part of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the figment of the 'physical world' and 'mind' something more than just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that, I see an old artifax of a problem, how to save obsolescence into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; advancement.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am not ready to go into that.

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; That's a bit of a straw man you're refuting.  I've never heard anyone
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; claim that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; the mind is the brain.   The materialist claim is that the mind is what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; brain does, i.e. the mind is a process.  That's implicit in COMP, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; idea that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; functionally identical units can substituted for parts of your brain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; without any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; untoward effects.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Yes indeed.  But what do we mean by a process in materialist ontology?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  To speak of what the brain 'does' is to refer to actual changes of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; state of physical elements - at whatever arbitrary level you care to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; define them - of the material object in question.  So now you have two
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; options: either the 'process' is just an added-on description of these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; material changes of state, and hence redundant or imaginary in any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ontological sense, or else you are implicitly claiming a second -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; non-material - ontological status for the mind-process so invoked. As
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I said, it would be difficult to imagine two states of being more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; different than minds and brains (i.e. this is the classic mind-body
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; dilemma).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; This is the insight in Bruno's requirement of the COMP reversal of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; physics and mind as described in step 08 of his SANE2004 paper.  It's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; aim is to deal a knockdown blow to any facile intuition of the mind as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the computation (i.e. process) of a material brain, and IMO the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; argument more than merits a direct riposte in that light.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Furthermore, in a platonic COMP, the question of the level of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; substitution required to reproduce your mind is unprovable, and has to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; be an act of faith in any 'doctor' who claims to know.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; AFAICS, until these 'under-the-carpet' issues are squarely faced, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; customary waving away of the brain-mind relation as a simplistic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; functional identity remains pure materialist prejudice, and on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; basis of the above, flatly erroneous. To say the least, any such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; relation is moot, absent a radically deeper insight into the mind-body
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; problem.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; THE APHORISMS
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; We do not see the mind, we see *through* the mind.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; What we see through the mind - its contents - is mind-stuff: dreams.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Hence dream content - i.e. whatever is capable of being present to us
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; - can't be our ontology - this would be circular (the eye can't see
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; itself).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; So the brain (i.e. what the eye can see) can't be the mind; but the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; intuition remains that mind and brain might be correlated by some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; inclusive conception that would constitute our ontology: Kant's great
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; insight stands.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; It's more than an intuition.  There's lots of evidence the mind and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; brain are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; correlated: from getting drunk, concusions, neurosurgery, mrfi,...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; It is similarly obvious that 'identity' theories and the like are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; non-sense: it would indeed be hard to think of two descriptions less
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 'identical' than brain-descriptions and mind-descriptions: hence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; again, any such identification could only be via some singular
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; correlative synthesis.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Hence any claim that the mind is literally identical with, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 'inside', the brain can be shown to be false by the simple - if messy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; - expedient of a scalpel; or else can be unmasked as implicitly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; dualistic: i.e. the claim is really that 'inside' and 'outside' are
</em><br />

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; functionally identical units can substituted for parts of your brain
