<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 7) U(.) is literally made of a relationship between the original axiomatic

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; making whole CAs relate to each other ...and so on... to an arbitrary

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; depth, you can get an idea of where I'm headed.
</em><br />
<br />[David]
<br />
The first comment that I would make for clarity is that your definition
<br />
of the function U(.) is of course an abstraction (as you acknowledge,
<br />
it merely points to reality). As you said earlier, our only *direct*
<br />
grasp of the noumenon is our subjectivity (it's Real In The Sense I
<br />
Am Real). Everything else consists in what we can mutually 'point'
<br />
to via relational modelling and abstraction. The 'modesty' of COMP
<br />
entails the acknowledgement that what we can claim to 'know' is
<br />
limited to what can be ascertained by interviewing 'machines' that
<br />
function relationally - and this includes ourselves. The 'ground'
<br />
of all this (i.e. the ultimate, not the relative, turtle) can't be
<br />
captured in this process, but COMP's point is that this is irrelevant
<br />
to what is being explicated. We deal only in relata. Hence COMP is at
<br />
pains to define the formal system to be used to define and manipulate
<br />
the relata.
<br />
<br />(This last point may be confusing. In a recursive, nested reality,
<br />
there may be any number of 'turtles' that instantiate 1-person
<br />
povs, each of which is 'inaccessible' at this level, in virtue of
<br />
its being the 'medium' of communication for 3-person relational
<br />
transactions that occur *in terms of this medium*.  In this sense, the
<br />
1-person medium is 'incommunicable', but the data distributed via
<br />
the medium is capable of re-instantiation, thus recreating 1-person
<br />
experiential analogs. This is a process that occurs both within, and
<br />
between, 'selves'. The transactions entailed in this can be
<br />
modelled independent of any commitment to what, if anything in all of
<br />
this, might be deemed RITSIAR.)
<br />
<br />[Colin]
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 10) The reality of EC is such that the |+| is NOT POSSIBLE! In other words:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  X(.) cannot exist without NOTX(.). There is no real boundary. No real
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; separation. At the same time U(.) is not a continuum in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; spatial/mathematical abstraction sense, although for practical empirical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; purposes, because of the sheer deth of the structure, it can be regarded
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as a continuum at certain scales.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 11) 'fundamental building blocks are IMPOSSIBLE in EC. Fundamental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; building blocks means that there exists X(.) and NOTX(.) for which no |+|
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exists. This assumption is the 'biggee' about which science is curently
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deluded.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 12) Having said (11) the 'axioms' are in fact 'fundamental'... but &quot;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ways of the turtles&quot; offers a way out of this - which will become apparent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; later (I hope!)
</em><br />
<br />[David]
<br />
Vis-a-vis your comments re boundaries vs. the continuum: I have a
<br />
sneaking suspicion that we come up against some sort of conceptual
<br />
barrier in this area. We are trying to describe or model a domain that
<br />
appears to have profoundly conflicting characteristics (e.g. particle /
<br />
wave). There are ways of dealing with this mathematically, but in the
<br />
end they amount to tricks that beg the question, if 'reality' is
<br />
our goal (and this is of course is the problem, not the solution).
<br />
Perhaps we need to accept that whatever we're embedded in embraces
<br />
what inevitably looks like paradox in terms of the relata that emerge
<br />
from it - i.e. a necessarily seamless whole that is at the same time
<br />
'divided'.
<br />
<br />[Colin]
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; NEXT STEP:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am going at this TOP-DOWN. When that is done the 'bottom up' axiomatic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; beginnings will emerge. I hope. On route towards an empirically testable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; outcome we'll look at what happens when X(.) is considered to be a human
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and how to depict a human including all the layers of nested hierarchy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that we see as brain material. I'll also introduce a 'being' operator.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We can later look at COMP equivalence at any level of what I have called
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the past 'Turing Granularity'. A bit like what Chalmers did in his
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'silicon replacement' zombie thought experiments....Except at multiple
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scales. At some point consciousness will be effected/affected. This will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be COMP replacement instead of silicon. Bruno(COMP)-granularity? :-)
</em><br />
<br />[David]
<br />
IMO in order to do this we will need to model the 'sensible matter'
<br />
aspect of 'brain material', which is precisely what we do not
<br />
'see' when we look at brains, or for that matter, computers. In
<br />
other words, if we are right, we will never recover the qualitative
<br />
1-person by modelling 'matter' or 'computation' solely in terms
<br />
of NOTX(.) relata. The instantiation must compute the *medium* in order
<br />
to incorporate (sic) the message - this is the issue of substitution
<br />
level, i.e. what is required to re-instantiate (an analog or copy of)
<br />
X(.)
<br />
<br />Simple. Next step please!
<br />
<br />David
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ok David,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let's start afresh and do this. At least give it a go. This is to be FUN.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not work.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I know enough about EC. You know enough about COMP. The goal is to get to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a more concrete formal understanding of the difference between reality and

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; trying to understand it) with COMP, as a 'master abstractor' of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everything.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We can jointly address epistemological and ontological issues along the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way. We can do this incrementally, one posting at a time. Nice and slowly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so we can follow it and point to where we fly off into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; respective weeds. I can pose symbols and relata. You can tear it to bits
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and interpose COMP interpretations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ======================================================
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; STEP 1:    The noumenon that is EC

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; depth, you can get an idea of where I'm headed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ====================================================
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; STEP 2:  Ontological demarcation (notional virtual cells)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In EC, if there is a chunk of noumenon that I would wish to depict I can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; draw a completely fictional CLOSED boundary around any subset of U(.), say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; X(.) and define its relationship to U(.) thus:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; U(.) = X(.) |+| NOTX(.)                      (1)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; NOTES:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) |+| must be regarded as messy/complex.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) |+| must be regarded not as addition, but SURGICAL RESECTION or JOINING
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3) |+| includes all entropy in and out of X(.).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4) |+| is to be thought of as a 2 way interchange over a notional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; boundary.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 5) INPUTS to X(.) are OUTPUTS from NOTX(.). If X(.) was a human then |+|
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; includes inputs (food/water/photons/heat/potential/kinetic energy,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; impacting nuetrinos, cosmic rays, everything)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 6) OUTPUTS from X(.) are INPUTS to NOTX(.) waste material, heat energy,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; phonons, kinetic energy dissapation, potnetial energy reliquishment and so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 7) |+|, despite all the above complexity, mentally can be conceptualised
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as addition. Just a very very messy addition.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 8) X(.) and NOTX(.), like U(.) are NOT abstractions. They are pointers to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; real EC entities just like U(.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 9) boundary CLOSURE makes the whole system lossless in an entropy sense.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This means that |+|, as a 'joining' of X(.) and NOTX(.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
