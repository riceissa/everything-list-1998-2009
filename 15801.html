Hi John,
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I decided so many times not to reflect to the esoteric sci-fi  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumptions (thought experiments?) on this list - about situations  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; beyond common sense, their use as templates for consequences.
</em><br />
<br /><br />It is as you wish, but it is my way to question the humans, through UDA.
<br />
Then the number is my way to question the machine, through AUDA.
<br />
<br />You seem to have a problem with thought experiences and with numbers,  
<br />
which prevent you to follow both path.
<br />
<br />Don't worry, because perhaps you have your own path and interest and I  
<br />
know we agree on some fundamental issue.
<br />
<br />The only thing which sometimes worries me is when it looks you are  
<br />
sure that machine or number are dumb, which for me illustrates a  
<br />
common human prejudice (the feeling superior ...)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, however, I can't control my 'mouse' - in random and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probabilistics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno quotes in  &quot; -- &quot;  lines, like the starting proposition:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;It is because an event can be random or probabilistic...&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;...the perfect throwing of the perfect coin gives an random
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience with a probability &quot;measure&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; HEAD = 1/2, TAIL = 1/2....&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Wrong.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A &quot;PERFECT coin PERFECTLY thrown gives ALWAYS either HEAD or TAIL.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is those imperfections unobserved(?) that makes the difference in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the outcome to 50-50. The only difference that really counts is the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; starting condition - whether it is thrown head or tail UP.
</em><br />
<br /><br />It seems to me that I agree with you. Let me give you my precise  
<br />
definition of a perfect throw of a dice. You know, as Brent Meeker  
<br />
recall nowadays there are magician which can &quot;cheat&quot; on those things  
<br />
in extreme brilliant ways.
<br />
So I will accept that a thrown of coin is &quot;perfect&quot; (relatively to the  
<br />
Probability 1/2) if the coin is enclosed in a velvet box and the box  
<br />
is shaken during 5 days by 500 monkeys themselves taken randomly among  
<br />
100000 monkeys, and this when God is not looking (to prevent God for  
<br />
being the magician accomplice, who knows ...).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To your subsequent 3 questions the answer is YES - depending how you  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; identify 'probability'. (I don't).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To your evaluating paragraph &quot;Fair Enough&quot;: fair enough.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That makes my point.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The &quot;experiments with sleeping in the room with whiskey&quot; are above  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my head (=my common sense). The Einstein conclusions show that even  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a big genius like him cannot cope with epistemic enrichment coming  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; AFTER his time.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Einstein was alas still a bit brainwashed by Aristotle, imo. You know  
<br />
that I think that the Platonists, and especially Plotinus, has well  
<br />
coped with the epistemic enrichment coming after him, and I believe,  
<br />
after us .... (Lewis Carroll too I think, actually).
<br />
<br />And I would so much be pleased to let you guess that the little Lobian  
<br />
machine can cope a so big epistemic enrichment too...
<br />
<br />Theology has to come back in Academy, I think, if only we want some  
<br />
human human science ... I'm afraid that  science has been interrupted  
<br />
in 529.
<br />
<br />The enlightnment period has only aggravated the gap between human  
<br />
science and exact science. This could explain in part the inhuman mess  
<br />
on the planet.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Which extends into the contemporary novelties as well?!)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;...Einstein missed comp by its &quot;conventionalist math&quot; blindness  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perhaps, togethet with the fact that he was not interested in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computer science. ...&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I admire Kim's scientific tenacity to absorb your 'explanations' to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the level of asking resonable questions.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I admire too. Kim is courageous.
<br />
Well, for the tenacity we will see :)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I could not spend so much time to submerge myself - and - maybe I am  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; further away from your domain to do so.
</em><br />
<br /><br />My domain is theology. scientific and thus agnostic theology.  I  
<br />
specialized my self in Machine's theology. Or Human's theology once  
<br />
assuming comp. The UDA shows (or should show) that physics is a branch  
<br />
of theology, so that the AUDA makes Machine's theology experimentally  
<br />
refutable.
<br />
<br />Will machines go to paradise?
<br />
<br />As a scientist I *know* nothing, but I can appreciate some theories.  
<br />
Theories are always hypotheses, waiting to be changed or reinterpreted.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thanks for the (*) added post scriptum, I missed it so far.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One word of how I feel about probability:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In the conventional (scientific/math) view we consider model domains  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for our observation (interest). Within such domain we 'count' the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; item in question (that is statistical) irrespective of occurrences  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; beyond the boundaries of that domain. The &quot;next&quot; occurrence in the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; future history is undecided from a knowledge of the domain's past  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; history in our best effort: we can consider only the 'stuff' limited  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; into our model, cannot include effects from 'the rest of the world',  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so we cannot tell a 'probability' of the 'next' occurrence at all.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ominscient is different. I am not.
</em><br />
<br />I am not sure I understand, given that &quot;probability&quot; is a measure of  
<br />
our ignorance (from us to God, depending on the domain indeed).
<br />
In deterministic theories like comp or Everett QM (the Many-World),  
<br />
all computable probabilities reflect an ignorance of a subject. With  
<br />
Omniscience probabilities are 0 or 1, it seems to me. Well, it depends  
<br />
at which level we look at, and through which notion of person we make  
<br />
the observation, also.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thanks for an interesting reading.
</em><br />
<br /><br />*I* thank you for your kind attention,
<br />
<br />Best,
<br />
<br />Bruno

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in the duplication-plus-delay in Step 4. Essentially, Step 4 is

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; cannot attribute a measure to my 1-pov in either step because the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; outcome is truly random.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is because an event can be random or probabilistic that we have to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; put a measure on it (like a distribution of probabilities, or of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; credibilities).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Example: the perfect throwing of the perfect coin gives an random
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience with a probability &quot;measure&quot; HEAD = 1/2, TAIL = 1/2.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I will ask you questions, if you don't mind. I prefer to ask question
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and illustrate the use of the word in place of teaching you the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probability theory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - Do you agree that if you throw a coin, you have a probability of 1/2
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to get HEAD?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - Do you agree that if you throw a dice, you have a probability of 1/6
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to get &quot;six&quot;?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - Do you agree that if you play lottery, you will win the biggest
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; price with a probability like 1/&lt;big number&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In most discrete case, we can infer equivalence of the elementary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; events on the base of symmetry (like in the old Pascal probability  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; calculus).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Here I would merely like to ask, random to whom?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Fair enough. In all situation which will interest us: it means  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;random for the subject who performs the (first person) experience&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You are the one throwing the dice? Then it will be random for you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (despite it will be random for your friend too, but perhaps not for  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; God).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Doesn't random mean  that no conscious mind (mine or &gt;yours) can  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; see the determinism behind it?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I could agree, although it is not necessary to dig on such detailed   
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; analysis, imo.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; We are tempted to say &quot;probability 1/2&quot; but that is only &gt;a comp- 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; style &quot;bet&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am not sure I understand. There is just one comp bet: the &quot;yes  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doctor&quot;, which we can be paraphrased in step 1by &quot;I survive (or I go  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to Mars) with probability 1&quot;. (and idem in step 2)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But in step 3, ASSUMING comp, it is hard for me to see any  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; difference with the throwing of a coin, *for the subject of the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience*.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Suppose I propose the following two type of experiences/experiments.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The ROOM ZERO and the ROOM ONE are NOT distinguishable from inside
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (but are of course distinguishable from outside). In particular, to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; make things 100% clear later, i add in both room a close box with a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bottle of whisky inside. And you know this fact about the rooms.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Type 1 experience: I make you asleep, then I throw a coin, if the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; outcome is HEAD I put you in the ROOM ZERO, if I get TAIL, I put you  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the ROOM ONE. In the room, I wake you up, and I ask you to evaluate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the chance of finding whisky in the box, and then the chance  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (probability) of being in room ZERO.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Type 2 experience: I make you asleep, then I scan you and annihilate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you, and I reconstitute you in both rooms ZERO and ONE.  I wake you  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; up in both room. In both rooms, you have to evaluate the chance  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (probability) of being in room ZERO or ONE,  and the chance of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; finding whisky in the box.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  From the first person points of view, sequences of such experience  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will seem equivalent, except for the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; or &quot;white  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rabbit&quot; youS, which will believe in special computable sequences. OK?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now the question can be asked BEFORE you undergo the experience. You  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can predict you will have whisky with probability 1.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So you can predict that you will NOT know in which room you are with  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probability one. So you can predict with certainty that you *will  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be* uncertain of which room you are. So you are now not knowing in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which room you will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be. So the 1/2 can be lifted in your past. You could not have known!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (This I sum up by the drawing: Y = II, bifurcation of &quot;futures&quot;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; differentiates the &quot;pasts&quot;)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You explained on this in Step 2:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;We see that the MEC hypothesis, generally considered as imposing a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; strong determinacy in nature, introduces on the contrary a form of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; strong indeterminacy. Even a God, or whatever possible Omniscient
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Being, cannot predict to you, before a duplication (of you)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; experiment, where you will feel to be after. If he told you &quot;you  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; feel to be the one in room A&quot;, the &quot;Kim&quot; in room A will say that  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; God was right, but the one in room B will know or believe that that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; God was wrong, and the point of MEC is that we have no reason to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; listen more to one Kim than to the other Kim. In particular the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Kim of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; room A will not convince the Kim of room B, that &quot;God&quot; was right. No
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Kim will ever be able to convince its counterpart about any possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; method of prediction for the particular future.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I want to grok this more. At this stage I can only believe you.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No, please, you should'nt. Hope the explanation above has clarified.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Take your time, ask any question.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I have  always felt (with Einstein) that reality is &gt;fundamentally  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deterministic, even if we have to point to &gt;stochastic features

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; along  the way.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I follow Einstein. Like the Everettian. Everett provide an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interpretation of QM where reality is fundamentally deterministic,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; yet, shows that the deterministic main equation of QM, SWE, explains  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; why observers, from their point of view, met indeterminacies, and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; how they can put measure on them and do the usual quantum probability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; calculus. In a nutshell: the observation of a quantum superposition  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is seen as a self-duplication experience, or a differentiation of a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; history.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I know you will be able to debunk this easily and  to my &gt;(and   
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Einstein's) satisfaction.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  From what Einstein said in the EPR paper, and from the extreme  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; confirmation of QM which has continued, I would think that Einstein  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would have adopted Everett, and then eventually comp. It is the same  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; philosophy. Einstein missed comp by its &quot;conventionalist math&quot;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; blindness perhaps, togethet with the fact that he was not interested
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in computer science.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Maybe dwell a little on this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK. Tell me if you get the point of above. Throwing a coin, and self-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; duplication are identical first person experiences.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You have to really do the thought experiences.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If I duplicate you in room 1 and 2, with repetition (iteratively), you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could predict that you will be the one with the diary 111111111...,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But all your doppelganger (the 1011100010..., the 0000000...) will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; know they were wrong. The &quot;111111111...&quot; *is* the first person white
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rabbit experience, that we should not, in this protocol, take into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; account.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and then move
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; on to Step 5 where you manage to email me to me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hmmm... It is just a teleportation without annihilation of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; original. I scan you on earth, and then I send the info on Mars where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you are reconstituted. the question is what is the probability that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you will find yourself on Mars, what is the probability you stay on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Earth. from you first person point of view you will not live both. OK?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is really a duplication, with a zero delay on one of its branch.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This is truly scary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; because here I meet &quot;myself&quot;. I recall with horror what Angier did
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; about his double in &quot;The Prestige&quot;...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Actually, I believe I have already met my double.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, yes, you should already in step 3 ! In all duplication you can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meet your doppelganger. It is the main relationship between the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prestige and comp: self-duplication. It is the key basic construction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the UDA and AUDA. I got all this by looking at amoeba, paramecium,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Euglena, and even Bacteria. I am inspired by &quot;real&quot; biology at the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; start. I have discovered computer science in the jacob and Monod paper
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on the Operon Lactose (a genetic sugar regulation system in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bacteria Escherichia Coli). My first models of self-replication where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; carbon based until i discover Gödel's proof which makes me suspect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that carbon has nothing to do with the key life principles.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Once, a man stopped
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; outside my house and stroked my cat, which was on the verandah. I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; greeted him and he told me that he had a cat that looked exactly  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; my cat and that it was his dearest and most cherished friend (I feel
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; much the same way about my cat). I then asked him what name he had
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; given his cat. He told me &quot;Cindy Bingy&quot;. I think my mouth must have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; fallen open in shock because that is the name of my cat too. From
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; memory, the man looked rather like me as well. He then walked off
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; while I stood there wondering about the improbability of all this (I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; cannot remember whether cannabis was in my system at the time)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So I will not try to interpret this :)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Tell me if you agree that self-duplication entails, from the first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point of view of the person(s) a feeling of uncertainty on their first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person future, and, when knowing the protocol, some means to evaluate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; their chance. I can use other thought experiences, like with the movie
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which I can explain in more details (perhaps the number
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2^(16180*10000)*(60*90)*24 of KIM 2.3 is not easy for you(*).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Best,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (*) I repeat there (quote from my post to Abram and you: KIM 2.3:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  don't want to give a definition of what is a normal machine, just  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that you feel the point.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let me give you another illustration which exploits the freedom of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thought a bit more. Indeed, let me duplicate you, or better,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; polyplicate you into 2^(16180*10000)*(60*90)*24.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I explain. I multiply you by 2^(16180*10000) in front of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (16180*10000) pixels screen, with each possible images (black and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; white) on it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And I reiterate every 1/24 of a second that multiplication, and this  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; during 90 minutes, that is 90*60 seconds.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What do you predict you will feel, as personal, subjective, first  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person experience. What do you think is more probable, among:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I will feel seeing a white screen
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I will feel seeing a black screen
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I will feel seeing a movie
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I will feel seeing a good movie
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I will feel seeing &quot;2001 Space Odyssey&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I will feel seeing &quot;2001 Space Odyssey&quot; with the subtitle of Caligula
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I will feel seeing a random-noise-movie (what you see on TV when there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is no emission).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course there is a sense to say: I will see all possible movies,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but this means you are talking about yourself at the third person  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point of view, and here what is asked, is what do you expect to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience or live in your future if you are invited to practice it.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; By MEC, you survive, and any of your first person experience is  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unique, on which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the above you would bet? What bet will you do if I tell you that  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I will accompany you in the multiplication. And send you to hell if  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your bet is wrong. What bet you will do if you want to optimize the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; chance of not going to hell?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The rest of the UDA reasoning shows that &quot;this&quot; thought experience  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happens all the time in arithmetic, but the &quot;probabilities&quot;, which  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; eventually could be credibilities or other uncertainty measure, are  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constrained by computer science/number theory. It extends the notion  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of normality from the protocol above to the whole Universal  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Deployment (which I will (re)define in KIM 3).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Exercise: define the notion of &quot;normal first person experience&quot; for  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine in the protocol above. With the UD protocol, things are so  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; much complex that I will interview the Universal Machine directly to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; provide hints ...
