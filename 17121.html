<br />
I note that the recent posts by Peter Jones - aka the mysterious 1Z,
<br />
and the originator of the curiously useful 'real in the sense I am
<br />
real' or RITSIAR - occurred shortly after my taking his name in vain.
<br />
Hmm.......
<br />
<br />Anyway, this signalled the resumption of a long-running debate about
<br />
the validity of causal accounts of the first person based on a
<br />
functional or computational rationale.  I'm going to make an attempt
<br />
to annihilate this intuition in this thread, and hope to encourage
<br />
feedback specifically on this issue.  You will recall that this is at
<br />
the heart of Bruno's requirement to base COMP - i.e. the explicitly
<br />
computational account of mind - on the the number realm, with physics
<br />
derived as an emergent from this.  Step 08 of the UDA addresses these
<br />
issues in a very particular way.
<br />
<br />However, I've always felt that there's a more intuitively obvious and
<br />
just as devastating blow that can be dealt to functional or
<br />
computational notions based on physical entities and relations
<br />
conceived as ontologically foundational and singular (i.e. no dualism
<br />
please).  So as not to be misunderstood (too quickly!) let me make it
<br />
clear at the outset that I'm addressing this to first person conscious
<br />
experience, not to third person descriptions of 'mentality' - so
<br />
eliminativists can stop reading at this point as there is nothing
<br />
further that requires explanation in their view (as odd as I trust
<br />
this sounds to you non-eliminativists out there).
<br />
<br />The argument runs as follows.  To take what physics describes with
<br />
maximal seriousness - as standing for ontological reality - is just to
<br />
take its entities and causal relationships seriously to the same
<br />
extent.  God knows, physicists have gone to enough trouble to define
<br />
these entities and relationships with the most precisely articulated
<br />
set of nomological-causal principles we possess.  Consequently, taking
<br />
these with maximal seriousness entails abjuring other causal
<br />
principles as independently efficacious: i.e. showing how - or at
<br />
least being committed to the belief that - all higher order causal
<br />
principles somehow supervene on these fundamentals.  Any other
<br />
position would be either obscurantist or incoherent for a physical
<br />
realist.
<br />
<br />Now I should say at this point that I'm not criticising this position,
<br />
I'm merely articulating it.  It follows from the foregoing that
<br />
although we may speak in chemical, biological, physiological or
<br />
historical narratives, we believe that in principle at least these are
<br />
reducible to their physical bases.  We also know that although we may
<br />
speak of cabbages and kings, weather, oceans, processes, computations
<br />
and untold myriads of equally 'emergent' phenomena, we still must
<br />
retain our commitment to their reducibility to their physical bases.
<br />
So of course, we can - and do - legitimately speak, in this way, of
<br />
physical computers as 'performing computations', but following the
<br />
foregoing principle we can see that actually this is just a convenient
<br />
shorthand for what is occurring in the physical substrates upon which
<br />
the notion of computation must - and of course does - rely for its
<br />
realisation in the world.
<br />
<br />To be more explicit: The notion of a 'program' or 'computation' - when
<br />
we place it under analysis -  is a convenient shorthand for an ordered
<br />
set of first person concepts which finds its way into the physical
<br />
account in the form of various matter-energy dispositions.  The
<br />
macroscopic media for these are variously paper and ink, actions of
<br />
computer keyboards, patterns of voltages in computer circuitry,
<br />
illumination of pixels on screens, etc.  All of these, of course, can
<br />
- and must - reduce to fundamental relations amongst physical
<br />
'ultimates'.  At some point after entering the physical causal nexus,
<br />
this chain of dispositions may re-enter the first person account
<br />
(don't ask me how - it's inessential to the argument) at which point
<br />
they may again be construed *by someone* in computational terms in a
<br />
first person context.  But at no point is the 'computation' - qua
<br />
concept - in any way material (pun intended) to the physical account;
<br />
a fortiori, in no way can it - or need it - be ascribed causal
<br />
significance in terms of the physical account.  After all, what could
<br />
this possibly mean?  Are these spooky 'computational' relationships
<br />
'reaching across' the energy-transfers of the computer circuitry and
<br />
changing their outcomes? Of course not.  How could they?  And why
<br />
would they need to?  Everything's going along just fine by itself by
<br />
purely physical means.
<br />
<br />I hope the foregoing makes it clear that computer programs and their
<br />
computations - at the point of physical instantiation - literally
<br />
don't exist in the world.  They're semantic formulations - ways of
<br />
speaking - that have applicability only in the first-person context,
<br />
and we can see that this is true any time we like by performing the
<br />
kind of 'eliminativist' demonstration performed above: i.e. we can
<br />
eliminate the concept without affecting the action on the ground one
<br />
whit.  Of course, this is the insight that makes the strictly physical
<br />
account of mind - as presently understood - problematic if one wishes
<br />
to take the first person seriously, because it shows the notion of
<br />
'emergence' to be redundant at the level of causation. It's just
<br />
another way of speaking, however much insight it carries - for us.
<br />
However, it isn't my wish to make that point again here.  Rather my
<br />
intention has been to show that whatever options are left in strict
<br />
physicalism to address the first person issues seriously - without
<br />
eliminating them - emergence is emphatically not one of them.
<br />
<br />I hope this makes the argument clear, and also illustrates the point
<br />
of Bruno's reversal of numbers and physics to save the computational
<br />
account of mind (and body, as it happens).  To be absolutely explicit:
<br />
if functional-computational relations are to be taken to be
<br />
fundamentally causally efficacious, they must be held to be real and
<br />
foundational in exactly the sense (RITSIAR) ascribed to those in the
<br />
physical account.  But for that to be the case, all other causal
<br />
relations must supervene on them - again just as in the physical
<br />
account.  But now, of course, this must include physics itself.
<br />
<br />Now, you don't of course have to accept COMP.  But if you want to be a
<br />
physical realist, it means you can only hang on to the computational
<br />
explanation of mind by eliminating the mind itself from reality.
<br />
Personally, not being committed to such an explanation, this doesn't
<br />
in itself constitute my problem with current physical accounts.  The
<br />
alternative is rather that physics as an account of mind must be
<br />
incomplete, or else it is wrong.   But that's another story.
<br />
