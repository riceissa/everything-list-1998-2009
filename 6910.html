<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I believe that tomorrow I will become one of the people in the multiverse 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; who believe they are me and share my memories.
</em><br />
<br />What if you have just taken Midazolam, and so won't remember
<br />
any of this tomorrow? (I contend that you'll be them anyway.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; When I think about this, I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hope that my future selves will have good experiences, and I fear that they 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; might have bad experiences. Once tomorrow comes, I no longer care about the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other versions, because they aren't me even though they think they are me. 
</em><br />
<br />We have agreed that some of your innate animalistic instincts aren't
<br />
necessarily *correct*. That is, even though you may continue to feel
<br />
a certain way, it can also happen that you succumb to some reason and
<br />
logic that force you to believe otherwise. IN this case, your choices
<br />
of whom to identify with should be consistent, and the easiest way
<br />
(I think) to make them so is to identify with all duplicates close
<br />
and far, future and past, modulated only by similarity of structure.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Looking back, also, I believe that I was only one of the possible versions 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the multiverse, and I no longer care about bad experiences that person 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; might have had in the same way that I care about bad experiences I am having 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at present or one of the versions of me might have in the future.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We normally take all this for granted, but if you think about it, it is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quite arbitrary. Why should I believe I will &quot;become&quot; another person who 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thinks he is me? Why should I identify with multiple versions of me in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; future, but not the present or the past? Why should I worry about what might 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happen to my future self but not my past self? The answer is, because that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is the way human minds have evolved. But that is the only reason.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, exactly!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It would be no logical contradiction to imagine a person whose mind functioned very 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; differently; for example, a person who had no fear of the future because he 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; considered the idea absurd that he could &quot;become&quot; someone with different 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; spacetime coordinates to his present ones.
</em><br />
<br />Well, I take as more inescapable the assertion that I am the same
<br />
person I was yesterday, and will be the same person tomorrow. Further,
<br />
physics seems to grab me by the throat and FORCE me to accept that
<br />
my duplicate across the room and I don't differ significantly.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is the failure to take into account this rather complex scheme we use to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; create individuals that leads to mistakes in the application of OM measure, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for example in criticising the QTI.
</em><br />
<br />Could you expand on that?  Part of my weakness has to do with QTI.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; To be precise let's say that tomorrow you will split into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the ten copies, one of which will be tortured. Then one *year* from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; now merging is scheduled to occur. Therefore you behave differently?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I don't think you should.  (You may *have* to because that's how we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; are built, but you still shouldn't.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Given this information before the split occurs, it makes it more likely that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I will experience torture: the 1/10 chance initially, then the certainty of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; merging in a year - although the merging may result in memory of the torture 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rather than the first hand experience.
</em><br />
<br />But still up for grabs is how widely the concept *I* should be
<br />
taken. I've extended it so that even the duplicate across the
<br />
room is you.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have to disagree with you here. Why should I care about the suffering of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some guy in another universe who thinks he is me, and whom I can never meet? 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would be more concerned about the suffering of strangers in third world 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; countries in my own universe.
</em><br />
<br />Of course, if you can't affect it, that's a reason for non-concern.
<br />
But if you could, then, I contend, one intervenes to prevent one's
<br />
duplicate from suffering for entirely *selfish* reasons. 
<br />
<br />I got here this way: to be consistent, I must use all my knowledge
<br />
to arrive at a class of events and processes that I approve of, and
<br />
classes that I disapprove of.  I decided that it was bad for me to
<br />
suffer.  Then since by physics, I seem to be any sufficiently similar
<br />
physical process, it is bad for any of them to suffer.  (That one of
<br />
me ends up being prejudiced as regards his own special skin seems to
<br />
be an unfortunate legacy of evolution, but one that doesn't support
<br />
much consistency.)
<br />
<br />Lee
