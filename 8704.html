<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno, list,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, on the basis of that which you say below (much of which I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unfortunately only vaguely understand), where you don't focus it all 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; decidedly on the particular issues of faith and belief, it actually 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does now sound more like some sort of theology. It has various 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; elements of theology in the broader or more comprehensive sense.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Thanks for telling. Note that it is all normal you only vaguely 
<br />
understand my last post, because it is a very concise summary.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The thing that it seems to be missing is gods or God. Considered as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theology, it seems like a wheel sorely missing its hub.
</em><br />
<br /><br />The neoplatonician use often the term &quot;God&quot; for &quot;ultimate explanation&quot;, 
<br />
and also use often (but it is an idiosyncrasies) the names of the greek 
<br />
Gods for concept (EROS = love, THANATOS = death, etc.). Strictly 
<br />
speaking, it has nothing to do with the judeo-christian notion of God.
<br />
Still, I like to define axiomatically God by something so big that it 
<br />
escapes any attempt to define it, except perhaps in some negative way. 
<br />
In that sense I could argue that the &quot;God&quot; of comp theology can be 
<br />
identified either with either the &quot;ultimate explanation&quot;, the &quot;root of 
<br />
everything&quot; or even with the unnameable SELF which caracterizes the 
<br />
comp first person.
<br />
Perhaps the chapter of &quot;God&quot; will be a necessary blank page in comp 
<br />
treatise.
<br />
Now, I think that &quot;GOD&quot; as a term has much more heavy connotation than 
<br />
theology, but I am probably underestimating the stealing of &quot;rational 
<br />
theology&quot; by the political power (this happened sometimes after 
<br />
Plotinus death).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; At this point, in terms of descriptive accuracy, this hublessness 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seems the hub of the matter. So it sounds like a kind of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; psycho-cosmology, or -- well, not a psychophysics, but, in order to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suggest your computationalist primacy of the soul -- a physiopsychics 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (in English, if the adjective is &quot;physicopsychical,&quot; it's a little 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; less suggestive of paranormalism, which is strongly associated 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nowadays with the adjective &quot;psychic.&quot;)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (C.S. Peirce held that matter is &quot;congealed mind.&quot; Though he thought 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that space would turn out to be curved, he was pre-Einstein and saw 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter as a kind of spentness and barrenness rather than as a tight 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lockup of energy.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Your theory may be empirically refutable but, if it survives such 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tests, what is there to support its affirmation?
</em><br />
<br /><br />The UDA+MOVIEgraph argument. I will simply say UDA. (Universal 
<br />
Dovetailer Argument).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Is derivability of physical laws from &quot;laws of mind&quot; really enough?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Would be nice, but the UDA shows there is no choice. Please understand 
<br />
that the UDA argument explains only but completely that if the comp 
<br />
hyp. is true then necessarily matter emerges from mind. Because this 
<br />
sounds so weird I have begin a derivation, at first just in order to 
<br />
illustrate what that could mean.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; An information theorist, John Collier, said at the peirce email forum 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;peirce-l&quot; that he had managed to derive each two among logic, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information theory, and probability theory, from the third remaining, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; though I don't know whether he ever published these derivations.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Could be interesting.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Have you shown that your &quot;laws of mind&quot; cannot be derived from physics 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in a way that shows that the nonderivability is not merely a result of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our insufficent knowledge of physical law? You may also encounter some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; flak on your conception of mind.
</em><br />
<br /><br />The problem is that physics does never really address the mind-body 
<br />
problem, with some exception like Mario Bunge, but he dismisses it and 
<br />
explain it &quot;away&quot; in a manner similar to Dennett. Many people have try 
<br />
and generally the honest one (like Dennett) admit their failure. It 
<br />
*is* a tricky problem. my original goal of my research (and thesis) was 
<br />
*just* to explain that the mind body problem was not yet solved. That 
<br />
is how and why I eventually translate it into a measure (on 
<br />
computational histories) problem, quite in line with discussion on this 
<br />
list.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For what it's worth, for my part, I would hold that a key factor in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intelligence, at least, which learns and grows, is an evolvability 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; factor, a kind of sufficient un-boundness to its &quot;codes&quot; and its 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; methods and systems of interpretation, in order to be able to test 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; those codes, methods, systems and to do so not only by trial and error 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but more sophisticated kinds of learning and testing, such that memory 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and active recollection take on particular importance.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I do agree with you here.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Do your laws of mind take evolvability into account? Maybe they don't 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; need to, though, depending on what you mean by &quot;mind.&quot; I tend to think 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the mind must involve the retention and evolvability factor in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some radical way, but it's quite vague to me how that would work. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maybe there are things which could fairly be called &quot;mind&quot; though I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would never have thought of them that way.
</em><br />
<br /><br />As far as you don't (re)introduce substances, there is a possibility of 
<br />
staying coherent with comp. Now you question is tricky. Like in the 
<br />
block-universe of relativity there is no time &quot;from outside&quot;. Time will 
<br />
be an internal modality, and can (and certainly will) play a basic role 
<br />
in the development of &quot;intelligence&quot;. Well &quot;space&quot; got some important 
<br />
role too, but is trickier that time.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If I understood your theory I might also try to challenge the idea 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the soul is both ontologically AND epistemologically primary.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Well I already distinguish the mind from the soul. The mind is a very 
<br />
general notion comprehending all imaterial notion from the number PI to 
<br />
the game of bridge and anything not reasonnablu described by pieces of 
<br />
Stuff (even nations and person belongs to &quot;mind&quot;). It is the 
<br />
&quot;spiritual&quot; or &quot;immaterial&quot; realm, and with comp it does not 
<br />
necessarily go outside the realm of mathematical (if not arithmetica) 
<br />
truth. The soul is really the first person or the knower, it is not as 
<br />
primary as arithmetical truth. It needs a lobian machine (which is a 
<br />
mathematical object). The knower is epistemological, but the mind is 
<br />
not. Comp reality is close to Rudy Rucker's Mindscape (if you know 
<br />
it(*)) except that it does not need many of its set theoretical 
<br />
construct at the bottom (they will appear as reflected in the 
<br />
object-discourse by machine).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Actually I wouldn't use, for my views, the term &quot;primary&quot; in a strong 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; foundationalist sense, I just mean that, for various reasons, I regard 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the (sequential) order of knowledge to be the opposite of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (sequential) order of being.
</em><br />
<br /><br />If Stephen Paul King is still there, I think he would suggest you to 
<br />
read Pratt's approach of the mind body problem where a similar duality 
<br />
appears. Could be interesting, but it is hard to explain without 
<br />
abstract math (category theory).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course, in logic, some oppositions seems to reverse themselves 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; across changes of level, so who knows, I'm not totally convinced about 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my own views either.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Me either ('bout my views). This is a lobian symptom of sanity :-)
<br />
(Note the Smiley, because I am saying probably a G* \ G  truth here, 
<br />
which means I should probably shut up).

<br />PS I don't despair to make some comments on your &quot;long post&quot;, although 
<br />
it could become less necessary given that I make partial answer through 
<br />
the posts which follow. In any case don't hesitate to repeat critics or 
<br />
question I would have missed.
