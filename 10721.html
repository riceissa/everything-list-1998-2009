Thanks Bruno, for accepting my position about atheists. You just did not add
<br />
that 'this is why I don't call myself an atheist'.
<br />
Theology is well thought of in your explanation, however IMO it carries too
<br />
much historical baggage (garbage?) since ~500AD to &quot;renew&quot; peoples' thinking
<br />
about the meaning of the term.
<br />
*
<br />
One question to the &quot;math-teach(er)&quot;:
<br />
you pressed the 'integers' as the basis of your number-world.
<br />
How about if we consider from the excellent explanation I read recently on
<br />
this list about 'string theory origins': to consider the &quot;inside the circle&quot;
<br />
equivalents of the 'points' (numbers) outside the circle,  - which are the
<br />
integers - AS THE INTEGERS??? (and call the reciprocals 'inside the circle'
<br />
as our integers?)
<br />
&nbsp;would that change the status of the world? Encased in the circle?
<br />
(That would be a definitely human-manipulated image).
<br />
You could freely apply all your theories on that, too.
<br />
<br />John

<br /><br />I can understand, but I *strongly* disagree on this. &quot;theology&quot; has
<br />
been studied by the so called &quot;rational mystics&quot;, which are also the
<br />
&quot;greek philosopher/scientist&quot; (but also by Chinese and Indian
<br />
logicians) during more than one millennia. It is just a sad and
<br />
contingent fact that theology has been appropriated by politician since
<br />
about 500 A.D. Abandoning the term &quot;theology&quot; is the product of a
<br />
confusion between the field &quot;theology&quot; and the contingent christian
<br />
theology.
<br />
Well, apparently, thanks to St-Augustin (french writing) 2/3 of the
<br />
main Christian Theology could be Plotinian, and so is closer to comp
<br />
than, for example the Atheist position, and comp (I mean together with
<br />
its &quot;immaterialist&quot; consequences) seems to be much harder to be
<br />
accepted  by atheists than by christians (I got many empirical
<br />
confirmation of this).
<br />
I agree with John Mikes: an atheist need to believe in something for
<br />
not believing in it. Actually they are doubly dogmatic, in the sense
<br />
they cannot doubt about the existence of &quot;a physical-stuffy universe&quot;,
<br />
and very often, atheist denies they are dogmatic (unlike typical
<br />
&quot;believer&quot;).
<br />
<br />I try to avoid completely the term &quot;metaphysics&quot;, mainly because I use
<br />
&quot;metamathematics&quot; in comp, and this could be confusing. I agree with
<br />
Peter, here, the two &quot;meta&quot; are unrelated.
<br />
(Actually a case could be made that Everett made &quot;metaphysics&quot; in the
<br />
sense of the &quot;meta&quot; in metamathematics: but I avoid insisting on that:
<br />
the term &quot;metaphysics&quot; is too much emotionally charged).
<br />
<br />Now we have already developed an entire thread on this &quot;vocabulary&quot;
<br />
problem, and I refer those interested to consult them. Other
<br />
opportunity will appear probably when I will give more explanations on
<br />
the arithmetical interpretation of Plotinus' hypostases. See the recent
<br />
&quot;ROADMAP (SHORT)&quot; for a preview.
<br />
<br />Bruno
