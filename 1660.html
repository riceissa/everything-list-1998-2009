<br />Bruno pointed out why solipsism is a sterile philosophy, so I won't
<br />
need to go into that. The reason I was comparing your ideas to that,
<br />
was based on an interpretation of your discussion. I can see your
<br />
ideas have been refined away from the initial extreme position in
<br />
discussion with James Higgo.
<br />
<br />In its extreme position, you are saying that only one observer moment
<br />
exists, all else are but memories connected to this. This is
<br />
solipsism, as no other point of view can exist, nor is there even any
<br />
process, except in memory.
<br />
<br />In your slightly less extreme versions, you affirm that all observer
<br />
moments exist, but are not connected in any way to each
<br />
other. Therefore, you should just expect to find yourself at one
<br />
observer moment, one of the most likely according to the ASSA. The
<br />
problem with this is what is the practical difference between this
<br />
point of view and the extreme position above, except that you've
<br />
answered the question of why this observer-moment, and not some
<br />
other. In particular, there is no time for you to interact with the
<br />
universe and find out about other observer-moments - you only have
<br />
memories. I would label this as &quot;neo-solipsism&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br />Finally, you could assume that one is sampling the observer moment
<br />
distribution, as a sequence embedded in some external time
<br />
dimension. This view was deemed repugnant by Jacques when I suggested
<br />
it. It presumably is rejected because it introduces the very concept
<br />
(that of time) that you want to get rid of. In any case it presents a
<br />
problem of how a conscious entity can make a coherent sense of the universe.
<br />
<br />As I have stated elsewhere in this discussion list (and in my Occam
<br />
paper) I believe instead that time should be elevated to a fundamental
<br />
postulate of conscious - without time consciousness can't exist, and
<br />
time provides a means for linking observer moments. Conscious entities
<br />
project out sequences of observer moments from the plenitude, these
<br />
sequences defining connections between them. 
<br />
<br />I take these postulates of consciousness (that of projection and of
<br />
time) to be true, just as I accept the Church thesis to be true. If
<br />
someone could come up with a convincing counterexample of how
<br />
consciousness could work in another way, then I will need to revisit
<br />
these assumptions.
