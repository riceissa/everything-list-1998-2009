This is the conclusion of &quot;A Computer Scientist's View of Life, the
<br />
Universe and Everything,&quot;, by Juergen Schmidhuber, from
<br />
<a href="http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen">http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen</a>.
<br />
<br />Although much of the paper was interesting, I was disappointed by this
<br />
concluding portion.
<br />
<br />: Philosophy
<br />
: 
<br />
: Life after death.  Members of certain religious sects expect
<br />
: resurrection of the dead in a paradise where lions and lambs cuddle
<br />
: each other.  There is a possible continuation of our world where they
<br />
: will be right.  In other possible continuations, however, lambs will
<br />
: attack lions.
<br />
<br />In the context of the paper, these continuations are presumably
<br />
different worlds with histories the same as ours, but with different
<br />
futures, including worlds which cease to follow the laws of physics.
<br />
<br />It's not clear where this resurrection is supposed to take place; is
<br />
it elsewhere in our own universe?  Is it here on earth?  You also have
<br />
Tipler's model where people are resurrected as simulations by
<br />
benevolent beings in the future, and those beings might well be
<br />
motivated to set things up so animals get along better than they do in
<br />
our world.  That seems more plausible than that the laws of physics
<br />
will be violated.
<br />
<br />: According to the computability-oriented view adopted in this paper,
<br />
: life after death is a technological problem, not a religious one.  All: 
<br />
: that is necessary for some human's resurrection is to record his
<br />
: defining parameters (such as brain connectivity and synapse
<br />
: properties, etc.), and then dump them into a large computing device
<br />
: computing an appropriate virtual paradise.  Similar things have been
<br />
: suggested by various science fiction authors.  At the moment of this
<br />
: writing, neither appropriate recording devices nor computers of
<br />
: sufficient size exist.  There is no fundamental reason, however, to
<br />
: believe that they won't exist in the future.
<br />
<br />This seems different from the &quot;continuations&quot; mentioned above.  Maybe
<br />
I misunderstood him.
<br />
<br />: Body and soul.  More than 2000 years of European philosophy dealt with
<br />
: the distinction between body and soul.  The Great Programmer does not
<br />
: care.  The processes that correspond to our brain firing patterns and
<br />
: the sound waves they provoke during discussions about body and soul
<br />
: correspond to computable substrings of our universe's evolution.
<br />
: Bitstrings representing such talk may evolve in many universes.  For
<br />
: instance, sound wave patterns representing notions such as body and
<br />
: soul and &quot;consciousness&quot; may be useful in everyday language of certain
<br />
: inhabitants of those universes.  From the view of the Great
<br />
: Programmer, though, such bitstring subpatterns may be entirely
<br />
: irrelevant.  There is no need for Him to load them with &quot;meaning&quot;.
<br />
<br />I really don't see what he is getting at here, other than that someone
<br />
outside the universe could just choose to ignore what people say.
<br />
Well, sure; so could someone within the universe.  But much of the
<br />
discussion about body vs soul actually has some interesting content,
<br />
related to the issues mentioned in the previous paragraph quoted.
<br />
What constitutes the essence of a human being?  Is there some aspect
<br />
of him which can be reincarnated separately from his body such that we
<br />
would feel that it was a legitimate continuation of the original
<br />
person?  These are interesting issues and just because this Great
<br />
Programmer chooses to ignore them, they don't go away.
<br />
<br />: Talking about the incomputable.  Although we live in a computable
<br />
: universe, we occasionally chat about incomputable things, such as the
<br />
: halting probability of a universal Turing machine (which is closely
<br />
: related to Godel's incompleteness theorem).  And we sometimes discuss
<br />
: inconsistent worlds in which, say, time travel is possible.  Talk
<br />
: about such worlds, however, does not violate the consistency of the
<br />
: processes underlying it.
<br />
<br />It would be more interesting to speculate on whether a universe is
<br />
possible in which, say, time travel &quot;seems to work&quot;, in the same sense
<br />
that the laws of physics seem to work.  Could there be a short program
<br />
running the universe which allows some form of time travel?
<br />
<br />: Conclusion.  By stepping back and adopting the Great Programmer's
<br />
: point of view, classic problems of philosophy go away.
<br />
<br />Well, I think he is throwing out the baby with the bathwater, choosing
<br />
to ignore too much which can still be of interest.
<br />
