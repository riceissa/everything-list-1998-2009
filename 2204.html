</em><br />
<br />It took a while, but I finally managed to get round to reading it and
<br />
I'm very glad I did.  It is a clear and thoughtful exploration of an
<br />
interesting topic.
<br />
<br />At the heart of the thesis is the Self-Sampling Assumption (SSA)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Every observer should reason as if they were a random sample
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; drawn from the set of all observers
</em><br />
<br />and its various generalizations.  Having motivated this assumption
<br />
by its usefulness in justifying multiverse theories in cosmology,
<br />
Bostrom is mainly concerned with working out its consequences and
<br />
in particular with whether or not some of those consequences are
<br />
paradoxical.
<br />
<br />Bostrom leaves two crucial questions open:
<br />
<br />1)  The reference class problem -- what counts as an observer?
<br />
<br />2)  Why should the self-sampling assumption be true?
<br />
<br />For many years now, I have been developing a detailed version of
<br />
the many-minds interpretation of quantum theory.  In the papers on
<br />
my web site
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.poco.phy.cam.ac.uk/~mjd1014">http://www.poco.phy.cam.ac.uk/~mjd1014</a>  
<br />
<br />I attempt to give a mathematically-precise definition of
<br />
an observer.  This provides a putative solution to question 1.
<br />
<br />More interestingly, my definition also suggests a solution to
<br />
question 2:
<br />
<br />The self-sampling assumption is true because all observers
<br />
are different possible developments of a single null observer.
<br />
<br />At first sight this looks a bit crazy.  It is based however on the
<br />
simple principle that any observer (any mind) is defined by his
<br />
history (by his mental life).
<br />
<br />Quantum theory in a many-minds formulation suggests that all
<br />
possible observer histories will exist within the universal quantum
<br />
state.  My explicit definition of an observer sees such a history as
<br />
a finite path of a Markov process on a discrete state space.  The set
<br />
of these paths is a tree with a unique root (the observer at the
<br />
beginning of his history).  
<br />
<br />When we consider an application of the self-sampling assumption
<br />
we should look at the likelihood of different observed paths. 
<br />
Fundamentally, this is exactly what we do whenever we consider
<br />
any empirical proposition.  
<br />
<br />The correct (objective) a priori probability of our observations is
<br />
defined by whatever is the true physical theory.  I assume that
<br />
some version of quantum field theory is true, and much of my work
<br />
has involved exploring the mathematical definition of probability in
<br />
the context of localized observers in a theory compatible with
<br />
special relativity.  This allows different observers to have
<br />
different probabilities dependent on their observations.
<br />
<br />As a first approximation to the correct probabilities, however, it is
<br />
not reasonable to guess that we are about as likely as most
<br />
observers like us.  This is the self-sampling assumption.
<br />
<br />One of the interesting problems that Bostrom raises for the
<br />
self-sampling assumption is what an observer with an obviously
<br />
expectional birth rank should believe.  In particular, to what extent
<br />
is the doomsday argument justified, and what should Adam and
<br />
Eve have believed?
<br />
<br />My response is that most of our empirical testing of the objective
<br />
probabilities which define our lives does not directly relate to our
<br />
birth rank.  If Eve has not studied quantum theory then it is hardly
<br />
suprising if her ignorance leads her astray.  However, if she has
<br />
learnt quantum theory, then she knows that, like all humans, her a
<br />
priori probability within the universal quantum state is very very
<br />
small.  Indeed, it is so tiny that factoring in the information that
<br />
Eve gained when she first learned the improbability of her birth
<br />
rank has negligible effect on the logarithm of her total a priori
<br />
probability.  Moreover, her net a priori probability changes rapidly
<br />
with time.  When she first sees the stars in the sky, for example,
<br />
she fixes them in her mind; collapsing one particular possible
<br />
stellar pattern out of all the possibilities that might have come to
<br />
her from the big bang.
<br />
<br />Nevertheless, Eve still must expect to be typical as an observer. 
<br />
Otherwise, she has no reason to believe her physical theories.  Her
<br />
birth rank puts her in the position of someone who has tossed a fair
<br />
coin 1,000 times and it has always come up heads.  But she is
<br />
tossing a million other coins at the same time so it isn't really that
<br />
surprising.  And if she tosses any of her coins again, she would be
<br />
better advised to predict the results using the physics of the coins
<br />
rather than her past experience with them.
