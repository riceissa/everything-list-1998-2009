</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Many people seem to believe in Popper?s Third World - Platonia more then 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in their own personal experience. People believe in many other things as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;well. It doesn?t mean that every ?designum? (designated object) of their 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;belief (signum) does really exist somewhere else then in Platonia, where 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;any every possible idea would exist. I used conditional to underline that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in my opinion there is no idea in Third World which was not created first 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in the brain of some conscious being. In such an understanding, Platonia 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would be nothing more than the global memory existing in whole the world. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In my opinion it is sublimated form of global (social) consciousness 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(culture) and as such is the property of more complicated level of matter 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;than single (human) being. 
</em><br />
<br /><br />But what is matter? Even in the physicist books I see only relation
<br />
between numbers.  &quot;My&quot; Platonia is numberland, including the many dreams,
<br />
obeying to the laws of dreams (computer/information science), I have no
<br />
serious evidence that substancial (aristotelian) matter exists in any
<br />
obvious sense. I don't postulate it.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;And as consciousness for humans is the property 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of material  brain, 
</em><br />
<br /><br />In which sense? I mean with or without comp? Few people doubt the
<br />
brain obeys computational laws at some level (like Schroedinger equation).
<br />
Even Hameroff accept it implicitely by postulating the brain is a
<br />
(universal) quantum machine. Only Penrose seems aware (for incorrect
<br />
reason unfortunately) that the existence of substancial matter 
<br />
(not intelligence) is incompatible with comp, so that a materialist
<br />
toe need a non computaionalist theory of mind. (Of course I got
<br />
the equivalent contraposition: a computationalist toe need an 
<br />
immaterialist theory of &quot;matter&quot;).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; ... the culture is the property of society. 
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK. I mean that comparison has some smell of truth ...
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Such a point 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of view is commonly identified with Marxism and too often declined only 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;due to that negative connotation - what a pity. In my opinion - as a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physicist -  materialism is much closer to physical description of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;world then any form of idealism. 
</em><br />
<br /><br />That is a quite respectable opinion. All what I say is that such
<br />
opinion is incompatible with comp (and weak form of Ockham). 
<br />
I proved that comp gives us no other choice, for solving the mind body
<br />
problem, than deriving the &quot;physical&quot; laws from a set of self-referential
<br />
truth. More generally from logic + arithmetic (I indeed translate a 
<br />
&quot;simple
<br />
argument (the dovetailer universal argument UDA) in arithmetic
<br />
by using the Godel trick (perfectionned by Lob, Solovay, Boolos, Visser,
<br />
Goldblatt). BTW I use also the formidable work of Grzegorczyk, a great
<br />
Polish logician. The arithmetical version of the &quot;first person&quot; is given
<br />
by his modal logical system S4Grz (Grz for Grzegorczyk).
<br />
You know Poland has been one of the most productive country in logic!
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;And physical description is the best 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;description humans worked out as the scientific method of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;cognition, so far.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I am quite amazed by physics and physicians. Still I am used to believe
<br />
that the mind/body problems is physics' Achile's Heel. It is the place 
<br />
where aventurous physicist will meet aventurous &quot;psychologist&quot; or 
<br />
&quot;theologians&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;There is no reason (even from the Okham?s point of view) to believe in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Platonia solely and neglect material world. 
</em><br />
<br /><br />Material world appear more solid when we will understand that
<br />
its stable laws emerge from machines forever dreaming in Numberland.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Everything you can state from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;such point of view, may be easily translated in terms of properties of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;matter.
</em><br />
<br />You talk like if you have a proof of the existence of matter. Like if it 
<br />
was
<br />
obvious subtancia are consistent. But you know substancia only appears
<br />
in Aristote mind when he misunderstood Plato doctrine on intelligible 
<br />
ideas.
<br />
(My opinion!). Despite the formidable success of physics, the main
<br />
problems are not solved: neither qualitative appearance, nor (the new
<br />
problem which appears through the comp hypothesis), the problem of the
<br />
qualitative *appearance* of matter and quantities.
<br />
<br />You talk like if matter has been defined, or if we know what it is.
<br />
I don't think we know that. From material point to probability waves
<br />
and superstring in complex space, it seems matter is elusive, even
<br />
with physicist standart.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Even if they are inexpressible on the present level of knowledge 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it doesn?t mean that there will be no such an explanation in (relatively 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;nearby) future. 
</em><br />
<br /><br />Just the time you learn french and read my Phd Thesis :-)
<br />
Other links in english are in my URL. In the everything list we discuss
<br />
similar ideas. In particular a version of the UDA in that
<br />
list can be retrieved from 
<br />
<a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m3044.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m3044.html</a>
<br />
If you believe in both comp and physicalism you should be able to
<br />
point on some error in the UDA.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;By the way, if they are not expressible in material terms, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you are not able to present sensible (commonly acceptable) idealistic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;explanation to them, either.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />I can do it partially, and, with comp, I can give light on the partial
<br />
gap too!  (For exemple I can show the necessary existence of that gap, and
<br />
even study the geometry of the gap).The commonly acceptable idealist realm
<br />
I use is really just arithmetic including intensional (modal) variant of
<br />
it, like computability, provability, axiomatic of knowledge, axiomatic of
<br />
observation.
<br />
<br />The UDA does not only shows that physics *must* be derivable from the
<br />
psychology of the universal turing machine, but it shows that
<br />
physics *can* be derived in some particular way.
<br />
(the particular way = translating the UDA in arithmetic, with Godel ...)
<br />
Ans when I do the derivation in that particular way (in the chapter 4),
<br />
I do get ..., well, let us say the shadow of the quantum.
<br />
And ten thousand open problems, to be precise :(
<br />
but no inconsistencies, so I think, at least, it is quite to
<br />
premature to abandon comp,
<br />
or mathematical idealism, for that reason.
<br />
<br />The net advantage of what I propose is the appearance of a road
<br />
explaing the logical origin (from numberland) of the physical realm.
<br />
We don't need no more that hypothesis in a material universe
<br />
for justifying empirical bets.
