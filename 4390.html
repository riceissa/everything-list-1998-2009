<br />
In the original verision of Quantum Suicide (QS), as understood in this 
<br />
list, the experimenter sets up a suicide machine that kills him if the 
<br />
world does not conform to his wishes. Hence, in the branching 
<br />
many-worlds, his consciousness is erased in those worlds, and remains 
<br />
intact in the worlds that do satisfy him.
<br />
<br />Is it possible to perform such a feat without suicide? What is the 
<br />
minimum &quot;attrition&quot; that is required and still get the effect of suicide?
<br />
<br />Here is a thought experiment that illustrates that this may be possible. 
<br />
There is a cost - it is not death - just a tiny weeny lobotomy. :-)
<br />
<br />All the experimenter has to do is set up his machine to erase the 
<br />
portion of his memory that stores the information dealing with the 
<br />
machine erasing from his mind the information about the machine erasing 
<br />
from his mind the information about the machine erasing from his mind 
<br />
the portion of his memory dealing with the experiment, (phew! I thought 
<br />
I was going into infinite regress!) and then have the machine erase  (or 
<br />
destroy) itself without a trace (this is important to maintain consistency).
<br />
<br />The outcome of the experiment in the many-world branches is as follows:
<br />
<br />1) in some branches the experimenter's wishes are satisfied and he 
<br />
remembers the experiment. His world is consistent.
<br />
<br />2) in the other branches the experimenter's wishes are not satisfied, 
<br />
and he does not recall performing the experiment. Whether he as done the 
<br />
experiment or not is not subjectively material to him. His world is 
<br />
consistent.
<br />
<br />What can we deduce from this? I don't really know for sure but I 'd like 
<br />
to discuss it.
<br />
<br />1) The erasing of the memory of the quantum suicide machine seems to be 
<br />
the &quot;minimum&quot; required in terms of information deletion. Why? What does 
<br />
the memory of the quantum suicide machine have to do with consciousness? 
<br />
Is the infinite regress relevent? - this infinite regress describing 
<br />
this machine erasing from his mind the information about the 
<br />
machine erasing from his mind the information about the machine erasing 
<br />
from his mind the information about the machine erasing from his mind 
<br />
the information about the machine... ?
<br />
<br />2) The &quot;other&quot; worlds in which the experimenter's wishes are not 
<br />
satisfied are of two kinds.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A) those worlds where he did not perform the experiment, and of 
<br />
course have no memory of performing the experiment
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B) those worlds where he did perform the experiment but does not 
<br />
remember performing the experiment because of the lobotomy.
<br />
In my opinion those worlds are equivalent because I believe in a 
<br />
subjective reality. But of course, many of you will disagree.
<br />
<br />3) The lobotomy was a way to shift the experimenter subjective &quot;frame of 
<br />
reference.&quot; How does the knowledge of the machine affect the frame of 
<br />
reference? What is the essence of the frame of reference?
<br />
