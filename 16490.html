<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; So you have indeed the necessity to abandon comp to maintain your form
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of immaterialist platonism, but then you lose the tool for questioning
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; nature. It almost look like choosing a theory because it does not even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; address the question ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Okay, going back to basics.  It seems to me that there are two
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; questions:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A) The problem of explaining WHAT we perceive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; B) The problem of explaining THAT we perceive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The first issue is addressed by the third-person process of physics,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and of just generally trying make sense of what we perceive as we go
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; through the daily grind of life.  Everybody has a grasp of this issue,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because you're faced with it everyday as soon as you wake up in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; morning, &quot;what's going on here???&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The second issue is obviously the more subtle first-person problem of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But, for A, the fact that we are able to come up with rational-seeming
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explanations for what we experience, and that there seems to us to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an orderly pattern to what we perceive, doesn't answer the deeper
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; question of the ultimate nature of this external world that we are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observing.  Here we get into issues of scientific/structural realism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In other words, what do our scientific theories really mean?  (http://
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; plato.stanford.edu/entries/structural-realism/)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I don't think we can assign any real meaning to what we observe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; until we have an acceptable understanding of the first person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subjective experience by which we make our observations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So the question of consciousness is more fundamental than the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; questions of physics.  We can come up with scientific theories to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explain our observations, but since we don't know what an observation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; really is, this can only get us so far in really understanding what's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; going on with reality.  Until we have a foundation in place,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everything built above is speculative.  To rely on physics as your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; foundation is &quot;with more than Baron Münchhausen’s audacity, to pull
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; oneself up into existence by the hair, out of the swamps of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nothingness.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But here we hit a problem because the process that we use to explain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; objective data doesn't work when applied to subjective experience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is a discontinuity.  The third-person perceived reality vs.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; first-person experienced reality.  The latter apparently can't be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explained in terms of the former.  
</em><br />
<br />But appearances can change.  At one it was apparent that life could not 
<br />
be explained in terms of chemistry and physics.  What constitutes an 
<br />
explanation is rather flexible.  If we could make robots that acted in 
<br />
every respect like conscious human beings and we could directly induce 
<br />
any given conscious thought into anyone's brain, would you still say we 
<br />
didn't understand subjective experience?  I know we might still feel 
<br />
there was a category gap, but people felt that about life too.  I think 
<br />
after some time we'd stop worrying about it and decide it was a 
<br />
non-question.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But without an explanation for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; latter, I don't see how any meaning can be attached to the former.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</em><br />
<br />Bruno seems to find that getting a cup of coffee in the morning is good 
<br />
because of the subjective pleasure that follows.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And I think that is for this reason that I don't get hung up on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;white rabbit&quot; problem.  Arguments based on the probability of finding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; yourself in this state or that state are fine if all other things are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; equal, and that's the only information you have to reason with.  But I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't think that we're in that situation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So I start with the assumption of physicalism and then say that based
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on that assumption, a computer simulation should be conscious, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then from there I find reasons to think that consciousness doesn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; depend on physicalism.  To me, the most likely alternate explanation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seems to be that consciousness depends on information.  
</em><br />
<br />But why did you feel justified in dispensing with the process 
<br />
implemented by the computer?   Did you consider the information in a 
<br />
stack of punch cards to be conscious?
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relying on some of my thought experiments that assumed physicalism as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; support for my conclusion of &quot;informationalism&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I think the discontinuity between first and third person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience is another important clue, because I think that this break
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will be noticeable to all rational conscious entities in all possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; worlds (even chaotic, irrational worlds).  They should all notice a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; difference in kind between what is observed (no matter how crazy it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is), and the subjective experience of making the observation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Further, let's say that I am a rational observer in a world where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; changes to brain structure do not appear to cause changes to behavior
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or subjective experience.  Physicalism wouldn't have much appeal in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this world.  Rather, dualism would seem to have a clear edge as the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; default explanation.  
</em><br />
But we seem to be in a contrary world in which structure and process 
<br />
determines subjective experience.  Maybe that's the kind of world that 
<br />
would NOT lead you to Platonism.
<br />
<br />Brent
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But it might be even easier to make the leap to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; platonism in such a world, as presumably Plato's &quot;ideal forms&quot; might
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be even more appealing.  So in such a world you wouldn't get to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; platonism by way of thinking about computer simulations of brains
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (since brain activity isn't correlated with behavior), but I think you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would still get there.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The question is, what kind of world NOT lead you to Platonism?  I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think only a world that didn't have first person experience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
