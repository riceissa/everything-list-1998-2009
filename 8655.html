<em class="quotelev1">&gt;encourage QTI followers to do risky things?

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The trouble with the notion of QTI suggesting we should all do risky things

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is much the same as the argument I give against quantum suicide as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;way of winning the lottery in my book. Most of the avenues of survival
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;from risky actions are in fact at considerable cost to health, social
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;standing etc. Only if these costs were outweighed by the benefits

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;accrued by the risky action is it worth doing. In fact the decision

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;procedure is not all that different to if QTI were not true - if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;anything it make risky actions somewhat less favourable, since QTI
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;guarantees that you experience negative outcomes from some failed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;action rather than having death as a way out.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Here is a variation on the idea of linking gambling with quantum suicide (it 
<br />
may have been discussed before in the earlier years of this list, but I 
<br />
don't recall reading about it). You build an easily concealed device which 
<br />
will allow you to quickly and surely kill yourself when activated; for 
<br />
example, a ring of plastic explosive around your neck which will detonate 
<br />
and decapitate you when you press a button hidden in your pocket. With this 
<br />
device in place, you go to the gambling venue of choice and place a bet, all 
<br />
the while with your finger on the button and the thought in mind that if you 
<br />
lose the bet, you will press it. Now, whatever you think of QTI, you're not 
<br />
crazy, and you are unlikely to go ahead and blow your head off if you lose. 
<br />
But however cautious and squeamish a person you might be, the fact that you 
<br />
are thinking about killing yourself and are able to do so instantly must 
<br />
mean that there is a non-zero probability you will do so if you lose the 
<br />
bet. In the MWI, this means that in some small proportion of the branches in 
<br />
which you lose the bet, you die. The result is that from the first person 
<br />
perspective, since you don't experience those branches where you die, you 
<br />
have managed to skew the probability of winning slightly in your favour. It 
<br />
may not be enough to beat the house (unless you are a gambler down to his 
<br />
last few dollars planning to end it all anyway), but it should be possible 
<br />
by statistical analysis after a sufficiently large number of bets to show 
<br />
that something other than pure chance is at work, and thus to prove (to 
<br />
yourself) the same thing as the QS experiment purports to prove, in a much 
<br />
less messy way.
<br />
<br />Another variation on this theme is to watch some natural random event, like 
<br />
the path of a fly walking up a wall. While wearing your suicide device, you 
<br />
stare intensely at the fly and think: &quot;Go to the right! If you don't go to 
<br />
the right, I'll kill myself!&quot; It should seem to you that you can thereby 
<br />
influence which way the fly walks just by thinking about it.
