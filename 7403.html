Hi Stephen;
<br />
<br />'Yeah, the contrafactual stuff is one of the most
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;counterintuitive aspects of QM that we have to fit into our philosophical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;modeling.'
</em><br />
<br />well im not sure that possible world stuff is just the province of QM or 
<br />
that we have to fit QM necessarily into any philosophical model. but perhaps 
<br />
those are other arguments.
<br />
<br />I feel a bit out of my depth. I did mean to stay out of the debate for a 
<br />
while, but, I think the Sophists have been given a bad rap so im going to 
<br />
have to defend them a little.
<br />
<br />For a moment consider Mr. Einstein. Now he just assumed space/time was 
<br />
relative. He had no evidence to suppose it was, Newton's stuff predicted 
<br />
celestial orbits fine. Well, within a narrow margin of error, the kind of 
<br />
margin all theories need, but his equations are as workable now as they were 
<br />
then. We still use them.
<br />
<br />So why did Einstein just assume that space/time was relative? Why did he 
<br />
assume that Newton had made a mistake at such a fundemental level? What 
<br />
reason did he have? In truth he didnt have any justifiable reason beyond: 
<br />
'Why the heck not?' or in otherwords: Sophistry. Real sophism, as opposed to 
<br />
the legal wrangling we all associate with it.
<br />
<br />Now, suppose Einstein was right. Suppose space/time actually is relative. We 
<br />
dont /know/ that. We accept it on the basis of the accuracy of the 
<br />
predictions of Albert's equations, but then where does that leave us with 
<br />
regards to Newton? Thats the really buzzing question in my opinion.
<br />
<br />It suggests that the accuracy of Newtonian equations do not depend on the 
<br />
/truth/ of his assumptions. Newton got into a big row with Liebniz I think 
<br />
about whether space had a frame of reference. Newton believed it did as we 
<br />
know. Well, if we accept Einstein, the we have to accept that Newton was 
<br />
wrong, AND that this didnt matter. Its this latter result that is a little 
<br />
suprising. We are taught that the truth of a conclusion follows logically 
<br />
from the truth of an arguments premises. Clearly the fact of the matter is 
<br />
more complicated than that. In the realm of inductive reasoning that isnt 
<br />
necessarily so.
<br />
<br />Can truth then follow from falsehoods? This is a counter intuitive idea that 
<br />
is difficult to cope with. For the life of me I cant actually see a way out 
<br />
of concluding that in science at least, if not math, truth is not as 
<br />
dependent on the truth of premises as we might like. The situation just gets 
<br />
worse if we protect Newton by attacking relativity. Whats more, I'ld go so 
<br />
far as to say that the accuracy of Newton's equations /depended/ on premises 
<br />
that in fact were false.
<br />
<br />Is this really counter intuitive? Perhaps a little bit. I dont think it is 
<br />
counter intuitive in the manner that say wave particle duality is, or that 
<br />
spookynatural quantum entanglement is. Sure, I can accept intuitively that a 
<br />
theory can be wrong in a certain sense but still yield predictions that are 
<br />
accurate.
<br />
<br />for me Sophistry is about asking 'What if....'. For me Einstein was the 
<br />
epitome of sophistry. Sophistry is about sifting through possibilities to 
<br />
see how the world could be. Listing the lot, and seeing what follows.
<br />
<br />When we talk about the world being a 10 dimensional place existing in an 
<br />
11th dimension, like bed sheets flapping on a laundry line, I can assure you 
<br />
that some kind of sophistry is at play. Im just sure of it.
<br />
<br />In a sense we have the math and we interpret it some way. but there would 
<br />
appear to be a distinction between the accuracy of an equation, and the 
<br />
truth of its interpretation.
<br />
<br />I dont know. These are heady issues impossible for one soul to solve. but 
<br />
the upshot for me is that I just can not agree that:
<br />
<br />'any model that ignores the implications of QM that have empirical support 
<br />
that we have of the world is sophistry. ;-)' in any sort of perjoritive 
<br />
sense.
<br />
<br />We should spare time to ignore the implications of QM, and do that before we 
<br />
spend money building another atom smasher. We should spare some time to be 
<br />
as disrespectful towards QM as Einstein was towards absolute space time.
<br />
<br /><br />'BTW, are you familiar with Hintikka's work?'
<br />
<br />Nope. I'll google on it.
<br />
<br />Speak soon.
<br />
<br />Chris. ;)
