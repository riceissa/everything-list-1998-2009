I comment on Rex's post, as quoted by David, and then I comment  
<br />
David's post.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It seems to me that the primary meaning of &quot;to exist&quot; is &quot;to be  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; conscious&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Hmm.. I do not completely disagree, because I can prove (with the AUDA  
<br />
definition of belief and knowledge, that what Rex says is indeed true,  
<br />
from the first person point of view. But taking this 100% seriously  
<br />
leads to solipism. If only to pursue this discussion I bet on the  
<br />
existence of some others, which consciousness I am currently  
<br />
disconnected from (thankfully, the net provides a way to share third  
<br />
person little pieces of things between us to supply that non first  
<br />
person apparent sharing).
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But what causes conscious experience? Well, I'm beginning to think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that nothing causes it.
</em><br />
<br />OK. I rather clearly disagree. Arithmetical relations &quot;cause&quot; it. They  
<br />
are clearly responsible for numbers introspection and numbers  
<br />
chatting, and their discovery of the gap between.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Our conscious experience is fundamental,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; uncaused, and irreducible.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Uncaused, OK, like any property of number can be said to be uncaused.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Why do we think that our conscious experience must be caused? Maybe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; this isn't a valid assumption. Maybe we are being led astray by the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; apparent nature of the macroscopic material world that we perceive?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Well, we search not necessarily a cause, but still an explanation. And  
<br />
that explanation has to fit with what we can prove, can know, can  
<br />
feel, can observe, and can infer.
<br />
<br />To say consciousness is fundamental does not explain many thing. It is  
<br />
a bit like saying matter is fundamental, except that in this case it  
<br />
is helped in some methodological way for some time.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; So on the surface this view of consciousness as fundamental may sound
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; a bit off-putting,
</em><br />
<br />And as, you seem to be aware, it leads to solipsism.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; but I think it's not so radical compared to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; competing theories.
</em><br />
<br />Hmm... It is a bit like David, you put to much emphasis, to say the  
<br />
least, on the first person, which is the subject of consciousness.  
<br />
Comp saves the first person from its materialistic elimination, but  
<br />
comp does not eliminate mathematics, nor physics. It provides a very  
<br />
precise theory which supplies the absence of matter and explain its  
<br />
appearance, and which I like to call &quot;machine or number theology&quot;, if  
<br />
only because it provides a clean purely arithmetical interpretation  
<br />
(AUDA) of Plotinus neoplatonist theory.
<br />
<br />The ONE is &quot;just&quot; arithmetical truth. But I am not sanguine about  
<br />
this, analytical truth works the same.
<br />
The INTELLECT is &quot;arithmetical provability&quot;
<br />
The KNOWER (alias the first person, alias the universal soul) is  
<br />
provability in case of truth.
<br />
INTELLIGIBLE MATTER is &quot;arithmetical provability in case of  
<br />
arithmetical consistency&quot;.
<br />
SENSIBLE MATTER is &quot;arithmetical provability in case of arithmetical  
<br />
consistency and truth&quot;.
<br />
<br />This makes 08 (meta)theories, which capture the same part of  
<br />
arithmetic, but have quite different modal logics, which correspond to  
<br />
different types of point of view. 8 because three of them are split  
<br />
into provable and unprovable parts by the incompleteness phenomena.
<br />
<br />To put it roughly: consciousness is a Goddess, sure, but it has seven  
<br />
Sisters.
<br />
If we follow Plotinus, those correspond to the degree of &quot;falling&quot; of  
<br />
the soul.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; David answered:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course I'm in sympathy with what you say here.
</em><br />
<br />I am not astonished :)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I've recently been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; picking the bones out of 'Panpsychism in the West' by David Skrbina
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which is a pretty comprehensive review of the surprisingly large
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; number of thinkers who've actually held - or hold - some version of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this view; and that's just in the West.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, I actually think we can do better than this.  The extraneous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; baggage attaching to 'mental' vocabulary really gets in the way of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; clarity if we attempt to phrase it as you have.  It's open to anyone
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reading what you say above to accept or reject based on the contents
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of *their* 'consciousness portmanteau'.  But perhaps we don't have to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; go this far: maybe we can say something more restricted which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; surprisingly turns out to be more radical.  Without repeating the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whole analysis here, my view is that the heart of the matter lies in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rigorous redefinition of the semantics of 'exist' and its cognates.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; These different senses get chucked about in such a variety of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ontological and epistemological guises that one is often at a loss to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; know what any particular use is attempting to pick out in the world.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So my point is simply: let's start from the understanding that to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exist is just and only what it is to exist-for-oneself: the defining
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; characteristic of existence is 'taking everything personally'.  The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; standard put-down at this point is something like 'well how personally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do you suppose an electron takes itself?' to which the riposte is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simply 'precisely as personally as it needs to exist'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course one might also ask 'how materially do you suppose an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; electron take itself?' and answer 'precisely as materially as it needs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to exist'.  But in granting a 'material' ontology to ourselves and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; electron, we are immediately at a loss for somewhere to locate the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; personal unless we add a second ontological category for it to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inhabit: and then any hope we might have a workable notion of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interaction is irretrievably dashed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So now you may legitimately enquire: fair enough, but how do we get
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness out of 'taking everything personally?'  Well, it depends
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what you mean by.....  But no, it does - really.  This is already the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'easy problem' (tee hee) in that once you see that you're at large in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a context that takes everything personally - but no more than it takes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to exist-for-itself - you can work on your theories of 'consciousness'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with some expectation that somebody will be there to take it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; personally when those great thoughts and feelings emerge.  It's a bit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like (in fact exactly like) the way we construct 'material' models in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the confident expectation that NOBODY will be there to take it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; personally when all those great 'processes' and 'structures' emerge.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But now we can see - as you point out below - that these 'material'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entities can really only be elements of our personal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence-for-ourselves.  Sure, we believe they refer to something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; beyond their representational role, but that something else is taking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things personally in another part of the forest.  And if they do not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thus refer?  Well, then they're just zombies.
</em><br />
<br />OK. With some reserves.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Rex:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Take the brain. I haven't verified it myself, but I'm willing to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; believe that the structure and function of the brain is closely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; correlated with the mind. My brain represents the contents of my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; conscious experience. The activity of the brain over time maps to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the contents of my conscious experience over time. Fine.
</em><br />
<br />OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But the brain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is not the cause of my conscious experience.
</em><br />
<br />OK. But is an evidence of having a deep and long computational  
<br />
history. And in a sense, the brain is the &quot;cause&quot; of my consciousness  
<br />
&quot;filtration&quot; in a vast subset of future computational histories.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; A brain is something that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; one is conscious OF, and thus has a secondary, derivative type of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; existence.
</em><br />
<br />OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; David:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Very well put.  I've mentioned David Bohm's model of a video game,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which actually got him thinking about the relationships inherent in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the above scenario, thus: there's a game taking place on a screen
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (explicate order) being acted on by (but not itself acting on) a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; program (implicate order), which in turn is being acted on by (but not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; acting on) the feedback from a player (super-implicate order).  In
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this analogy, the brain-body-world is akin to the on-screen
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; representation, which in fact emerges from, and is under the control
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of, an underlying set of orderings that seamlessly incorporate both
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; player and game.  Subject and object then emerge as a heuristic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distinction in the guise of complementary poles abstracted from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; feedback relationships.
</em><br />
<br />I will have to reread that.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Rex:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I can think about my brain, so it is something that I am conscious  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and so it exists in that sense. To the extent that I can examine and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; experiment on someone else's brain, that is also a perceived
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; experience. But again, all of these things could happen in a dream,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; hallucination, or to a brain-in-a-vat, or to someone in a computer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; simulation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, it could, but this may not be the version most conducive to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sanity!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But the brain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is not the cause of my conscious experience. A brain is something  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; one is conscious OF, and thus has a secondary, derivative type of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; existence.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, and this 'secondary' existence is just a category of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence-for-oneself.
</em><br />
<br />Here you talk about the 'brain' which is in your 'brain'. the physical  
<br />
brain is most plausibility a completely definable &quot;object&quot;. Its  
<br />
physics, as we can observe it, relies eventually on infinite histories.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  The contents of consciousness are precisely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what we are taking personally, else they couldn't exist for us.  We
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; co-habit with them.  But they don't just sit there: they connect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seamlessly beyond our personal horizons, which is how we get to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; justify the belief that they refer to something - as we tend to say -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; outside our selves.  But that 'outside' of course isn't outside at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all; it's just as 'inside' as we are, taking things just as personally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as it needs to exist, just like us.  The external world we see so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; clearly is a reflection of the inside-out surfaces of our mindworlds.
</em><br />
<br />OUR,  the Löbian machines. OK.
<br />
OUR,  the Humans. Not OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Similarly, science. I'm willing to believe that quantum mechanics and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; relativity both describe my observations very well. But this is just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the fitting of various mathematical formulas and narratives to what  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; are conscious of. There's no deeper meaning to science than that. It
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; doesn't tell us about what fundamentally exists.
</em><br />
<br />I recall that theology has been keep out of science and academies  
<br />
since 1500 years, and has still not really come back.
<br />
Due to this unfortunate situation, &quot;science&quot; is confused as being a  
<br />
sort of theology by itself, which it cannot be.
<br />
The least I have try to do is to illustrate that we can reason and  
<br />
proceed &quot;scientifically&quot; (= proposing modest refutable theories on  
<br />
consciousness, souls, person, identity and various &quot;god- 
<br />
like&quot;mathematical and non mathematical entities).
<br />
Science is half-blind since a long time, but it is not the fault of  
<br />
the science spirit, it is the fault of the human spirit which abuse of  
<br />
the ten thousand authority arguments around those fundamental  
<br />
questions, and, as consequence, that the spirit of science is  
<br />
forbidden there.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It provides us with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; stories that fit what our experiences: &quot;IF you were made from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; subatomic particles in a physical universe, THIS system of particles
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and forces is consistent with your current observations.&quot;
</em><br />
<br />Science will never provide more than IF this then THAT. Even theology.  
<br />
To defend theology as a science consists in admitting to propose  
<br />
theory (IF this), and then derive consequences in that theory (then  
<br />
THAT). And test it, directly, indirectly up to the refutation, and  
<br />
amelioration, correction, publication, etc.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, and of course WERE you thus made you wouldn't find anybody there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to take things personally.  The great value of COMP, I think, is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it pumps the intuition that we can't take persons for granted: they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't just map directly onto our representations, which I guess we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should have expected, because god knows they don't look like anything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that could be us.  Of course a computational narrative may turn out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not to be the way to go, but I strongly suspect that we still await a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; revolution in - well not physics, but..what? being-science? (gawd) -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that will be in a primary sense generative of persons prior to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generation of appearances.
</em><br />
<br />The theology of numbers. What they can feel and dream, about  
<br />
themselves and each others, relatively to each one.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  IOW, there probably has to be some sort of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fundamentally implicate-explicate-superexplicate thingamijig going on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; out there - er, I mean in here.
</em><br />
<br />Sure.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Science is basically us trying to make sense of a dream.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; So in this view, consciousness is very simple. What's complicated is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; fitting &quot;explanatory&quot; scientific theories to what is observed, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; identifying and understanding causal structures (e.g., a brain, a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; machine, whatever) whose evolving state can be interpreted as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; representing a series of &quot;connected&quot; or &quot;related&quot; instances of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; consciousness.
</em><br />
<br />Numbers do that.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But the observed physical system is NOT conscious, it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; just represents the contents of someone's conscious experience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Very well put.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; So initially this view seems somewhat...solipsistic (?),
</em><br />
<br /><br />Not necessarily, yet. You could have talk about  &quot;universal  
<br />
consciousness&quot;, which does make sense with comp, although I am not  
<br />
entirely sure. Universal consciousness is the consciousness of the  
<br />
virgin universal machine, which is rare to find those days (when you  
<br />
buy a computer it is already full of non universal programs). A  
<br />
particular consciousness is when the universal consciousness forget  
<br />
its origin. But this, to be sure, has not yet been asked to the  
<br />
universal machine (it is beyond AUDA, I mean).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ultimately I think it really isn't much more radical than any other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; theory on the table. For instance, any deterministic scientific  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; theory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; entails that we have the experience of making choices without making
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; actual choices (in the free will sense). And so does any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; indeterminstic theory that is based on bottom-up causation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, of course it's solipsistic, but that's its strength.
</em><br />
<br />?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only know yourself: but that 'self', properly understood, extends
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; beyond merely perspectival horizons, to everything that is.
</em><br />
<br />You are a billion times too much quick here.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the perennial philosophy, and in this case, perennial because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unavoidable.
</em><br />
<br />OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And as for 'deterministic', if we want to deploy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; causation in our narratives - and I don't see why we shouldn't - then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence-for-self gives you a conveniently monistically-collapsed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; version of the causal nexus that indivisibly unites perception,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intention  and action.  Since they're indivisible, they only work in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concert, and hence you can't get causal closure until the sense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessary in context gains expression.  As to 'first' causes, I think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we've reached the end of the semantic road.
</em><br />
<br />I disagree. For any rational people betting their brain is a machine,  
<br />
addition and multiplication are very good first cause. Equivalent one  
<br />
are abstraction and application. There are many other equivalent one,  
<br />
for the theology. They are not equivalent with respect to engineering,  
<br />
though.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you want, you can can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; elect to be a mathematical Prospero and conjure us from the deep by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tautological force majeure, or you can accept the mystery of our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contingent 'necessity'.  Take your pick.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Beyond that, all theories eventually boil down to having to having to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; take some set of fundamental entities and laws as unexplained,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; unsupported brute facts. So whether it's one level down or twelve
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; levels down, at some point they end up saying &quot;and these things just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; exist, created from nothing, supported by nothing&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, that's right. But some theories are elegant, does not eliminate  
<br />
person, are more fun, than others.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; So, no matter which way we go, reality doesn't match our common-sense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; expectations.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Right, but common-sense change all the time. Somehow, it is a provable  
<br />
promise that it never really stabilize, unless it remember its origin.  
<br />
In that case it can perhaps contemplate the big thing, but can no more  
<br />
play in it. (Again I am beyond AUDA).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I think this view makes the fewest assumptions, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ultimately seems no more fantastical than any other theory on offer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is what my mother used to call 'having the courage of your lack
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of convictions'.  I like it.
</em><br />
<br />I am not sure I understand that remark. To sum up you have the
<br />
<br />current paradigm:
<br />
<br />MATTER =&gt; CONSCIOUSNESS =&gt; NUMBER
<br />
<br />comp forces the reversal:
<br />
<br />NUMBER =&gt; CONSCIOUSNESS =&gt; MATTER    (followed by =&gt; HUMAN  
<br />
CONSCIOUSNESS =&gt; HUMAN NUMBER)
<br />
<br />Rex proposes something like:
<br />
<br />CONSCIOUSNESS  =&gt; ?
<br />
<br />It is radical, and it is difficult to say if it explains anything. I  
<br />
suspect the goal could be personal enlightnment instead of a search in  
<br />
a communicable theory which should or could explain the observable and  
<br />
non observable (but &quot;feelable&quot;, like pain) phenomena.
