Hi Lee ,
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It was just a figure of speech.  You are free, of course, to use
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the word &quot;reality&quot; any way you want.  I'm not comfortable for using
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it to describes one's subjective impressions, feelings, etc.
</em><br />
<br /><br />But I am not using the word &quot;reality&quot; to *describe*  one's subjective 
<br />
impression, it seems to me I am just acknowledging the existence of 
<br />
those subjective impression in many persons.
<br />
To acknowledge something is to admit that something has some kind of 
<br />
&quot;reality&quot;, it seems to me.
<br />
And it seems you did acknowledge those experiences too). To describe 
<br />
them, in the limit, I can only point you to great poets and artists, 
<br />
and they will hardly mention the word &quot;reality&quot;.
<br />
<br />You just seems to want those experiences are just an unnecessary 
<br />
epiphenomenon, and you would like that science never adresses what they 
<br />
really are and where they came from.
<br />
For you it looks like &quot;consciousness&quot; is just a sort of subjective 
<br />
mirror partially reflecting an objective third person describable 
<br />
reality in which we are embedded. And science should never leave the 
<br />
third person discourse. All right?
<br />
<br />Now, please understand that I agree (100%) with the last sentences: 
<br />
science should never leave the third person discourse.
<br />
But this does not prohibit science of looking to herself, and to try 
<br />
theories (hypotheses) about third person discourses, and even to 
<br />
*discover* sort of first person discourse canonically associated to 
<br />
some mathematical object.
<br />
<br />By taking the comp hyp enough seriously it just happens that 
<br />
&quot;consciousness&quot;, or just the &quot;ability to guess the existence of one (at 
<br />
least) world&quot; is not a little detail. Or it is a little detail but then 
<br />
remember that the devil is hidden in the little details. Why? Because 
<br />
if I am correct in my derivation it makes the physical law emerging 
<br />
from number theory.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So you say.  And I confess I haven't the energy (and probably not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the preparation) to study your thesis. So I'll wait for the experts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to acclaim you.  No one will cheer louder:  &quot;I knew him *before*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the world saw the truth to COMP!  He even knows who I am!&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><br />My heart appreciates very much. My poor brain, or some reasoner who 
<br />
appears to succeed to manifest himself through it, relatively to you, 
<br />
is a little bit astonished: you are amazingly honest and confess you 
<br />
could give a weight to authoritative argument. Ah la la.
<br />
I think it would be better to get the understanding by yourself, then 
<br />
you could say &quot; I thought it&quot;, but perhaps you do get some 
<br />
understanding, I think :-)
<br />
Actually my work is &quot;the work&quot; which people should understand by 
<br />
themselves, if only to understand the second part where they must 
<br />
understand that machine can understand it by themselves, in some 
<br />
precise sense.
<br />
You could also be disappointed. Although the conclusion is startling, 
<br />
technically my contribution is modest and leads quickly to soluble but 
<br />
intractable questions.
<br />
A paper entitled &quot;Theoretical Computer Science and the Natural 
<br />
Sciences&quot; should appear soon, though.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; My friends and I (and probably Daniel Dennett and so on) believe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that people who demand a 1st person &quot;account of the world&quot; (e.g.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Chalmers) will never get anywhere.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Actually, this is one of the main point where I differ from George Levy 
<br />
(OK George?), although I could make sense of it. The point is, and 
<br />
Dennett agrees on this, that, in cognitive *science*, we need to 
<br />
develop some third person discourse on the first person discourses.
<br />
OK, strictly speaking the quantum and physical discourses appears at 
<br />
some first person (plural) level.
<br />
<br />Chalmers is not getting anywhere(*), ok. Perhaps we agree on this.
<br />
<br />(*) Using Everett to defend dualism! See the quite good explanation how 
<br />
Everett is deeply monist in the book:
<br />
PRIMAS H., 1981, Chemistry, Quantum Mechanics and Reductionism, 
<br />
Springer-Verlag, Berlin (second, corrected edition : 1983)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; That the &quot;hard problem&quot; or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whatever is just a horrible consequence of the way sense impressions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; traveling on neurons give rise to people thinking that their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; own perceptions are a sort of reality independent of the physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality.  We think that this is a sort of delusion, although the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very #?!&amp;$-AT_SYMBOL-! structure of our language hideously leads from that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to &quot;who or what is being deluded?&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Mmhh....
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This might be a good time to ask what is meant by that word you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just used.  Hal explained &quot;computationalist hypothesis&quot; as used
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by philosophers, e.g., that a robot (that was just CPU driven)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could be conscious.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Actually this is the strong AI thesis. Logically comp is stronger, 
<br />
because comp is the thesis that &quot;I&quot; am a machine (I, You, ...). Comp is 
<br />
stronger because the fact that machine could think does not entails 
<br />
that only machine could think!  (despite Occam!).
<br />
Now comp is weaker than most functionalism in the philosophy of mind, 
<br />
because comp asserts only the existence of a level of substitution at 
<br />
which we are Turing-emulable. Functionalist reason like if the level 
<br />
was known, but that's impossible.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  have believed that since 1966 when I used
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to argue about it with people in high school. *Lots* of people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; believe that.  I have taken &quot;COMP&quot; to be Bruno's Thesis, in which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; practically everything can be derived fundamentally from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; integers alone, using Gödel's results, and other rather recently
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discovered truths.
</em><br />
<br /><br />No no. That's the theorem. Comp is precisely the conjonction of Church 
<br />
Thesis, of some amount of belief in arithmetic, + the act of faith 
<br />
saying &quot;yes&quot; to *some* digitalist surgeon.
<br />
All what I say, I derive it (hopefully correctly) from comp.
<br />
<br />It is also different from Schmidhuber (and many others) who makes the 
<br />
thesis that there is a &quot;physical universe&quot; and that it is computable 
<br />
(programmable). I think that comp is quasi-incompatible with this.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So I dismiss the 1st person, remarking that it's &quot;existence&quot; is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but only to be expected. If an ape or a parrot could talk, it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could yak on about it's impressions. And they'd be of little
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but therapeutic value.
</em><br />
<br />Thanks for acknowledging the therapy!  With comp, this would mean the 
<br />
appearance of the physical world originates in some intrinsic universal 
<br />
machine self-therapy. It makes sense when you realize that Lob formula 
<br />
(B(Bp-&gt;p)-&gt;Bp), the main axiom of the modal logic of self-reference (G) 
<br />
can be interpreted as showing that some form of honest placebo effect 
<br />
works! But this is something I am still taking with some grain of salt. 
<br />
See the book &quot;Forever Undecided&quot; to see Smullyan exploiting the working 
<br />
of some self-fulfilling beliefs.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; As anything scientific, yes. I agreed with John's statement:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Interpreted used as subjectivised. There is a fine line separating
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; solipsism from craziness...&quot;  at least insofar as I may read that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to mean that our subjective impressions actually turn out to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; less reliable than our efforts to understand things objectively
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (3rd person).
</em><br />
<br /><br />But I agree too! This does not prevent us the study of first person 
<br />
discourse, by use of all the possible scientific way to tackle 
<br />
problems.
<br />
<br />I must go now. Apology for not having respected the order of your 
<br />
paragraphs, but my computer take some initiative apparently!
<br />
<br />Best regards,
<br />
<br />Bruno
