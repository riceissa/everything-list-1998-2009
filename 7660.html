<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Hi Brent,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;    Ok, I am rapidly loosing the connection that abstract models
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; have with the physical world, at least in the case of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; computations. If there is no constraint on what we can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; conjecture, other than what is required by one's choice of logic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and set theory, what relation do mathematical models have with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; reality?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;    Is this not as obvious as it appears?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  [BM]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here's my $0.02. We can only base our knowledge on our experience
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and we don't experience *reality*, we just have certain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiences and we create a model that describes them and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; predicts them.  Using this model to predict or describe usually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; involves some calculations and interpretation of the calculation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in terms of the model.  The relation of the model to reality, if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it's a good one, is it gives us the right answer, i.e. it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; predicts accurately.  Their are other criteria for a good model
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; too, such as fitting in with other models we have; but prediction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is the main standard. So in my view, mathematics and theorems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about computer science are just models too, albeit more abstract
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ones.  Persis Diaconsis says, &quot;Statistics is just the physics of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; numbers.&quot;  I have a similar view of all mathematics, e.g.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arithmetic is just the physics of counting.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok, I would agree completely with you if we are using Kant's definition 
<br />
of *reality*- Dasein: existence in itself, but I was trying to be point out 
<br />
that we must have some kind of connection between the abstract and the 
<br />
concrete.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing that I hope we all can agree upon about *reality* is that what 
<br />
ever it is, its properties are invariant with respect to transformations 
<br />
from one point of view to any other. It is this trait that makes it 
<br />
&quot;independent&quot;, but the problems with realism seem to arise when we consider 
<br />
whether or not this *reality* has some set of properties to the exclusion of 
<br />
any others independent of some observational context.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QM demands that we not treat objects as having some sharp set of 
<br />
properties independent of context and thus the main source of 
<br />
counterintuitive aspects that make QM so difficult to deal with when we 
<br />
approach the subject of Realism. OTOH, we have to come up with an 
<br />
explanation of how it is that our individual experiences of a world seem to 
<br />
be confined to sharp valuations and the appearance of property definiteness. 
<br />
Everett and others gave us the solution to this conundrum with the MWI. Any 
<br />
given object has eigenstates (?) that have eigenvalues (?) that are sharp 
<br />
and definite relative to some other set of eigenstates, but as a whole a 
<br />
state/wave function is a superposition of all possible.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, what does this mean? We are to take the a priori and context 
<br />
independent aspect of *reality* as not having any one set of sharp and 
<br />
definite properties, it has a superposition of all possible. The trick is to 
<br />
figure out a reason why we have one basis and not some other, one 
<br />
partitioning of the eigenstates and not some other.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does this have to do with mathematics and models? If we are going 
<br />
to create/discover models of what we can all agree is sharp and definite- 
<br />
our physical world, we must be sure that our models agree with each other. 
<br />
This, of course, assumes that there is some connection between abstract and 
<br />
concrete aspect of *reality*.
<br />
