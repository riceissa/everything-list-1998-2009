This has been an interesting thread so far, but let me bring it back to 
<br />
topic for the Everything List. It has been assumed in most posts to this 
<br />
list over the years that our current state must be a &quot;typical&quot; state in some 
<br />
sense. For example, our world has followed consistent laws of physics for as 
<br />
long as anyone has been able to determine - the old &quot;no white rabbit worlds&quot; 
<br />
observation. In the face of ensemble type theories such as the MWI of QM, 
<br />
this is seen as presenting a problem: if &quot;anything that can happen, does 
<br />
happen&quot;, why does our experience of the world include only a very limited, 
<br />
orderly subset of this &quot;anything&quot;?
<br />
<br />There have been many attempts to answer the above question, eg. see Russell 
<br />
Standish' paper &quot;Why Ockham's Razor?&quot; But does our current orderly world 
<br />
imply that most possible worlds are orderly? It seems to me that there is an 
<br />
asymmetry between (a) what we can expect for the future, and (b) what we can 
<br />
deduce about the probability implicit in (a) from what actually does happen.
<br />
<br />Suppose that according to X-Theory, in the next minute the world will split 
<br />
into one million different versions, of which one version will be the same 
<br />
sort of orderly world we are used to, while the rest will be worlds in which 
<br />
it will be immediately obvious to us that very strange things are happening, 
<br />
eg. dragons materialising out of thin air, furniture levitating, the planet 
<br />
Jupiter hurling itself into the sun, etc. I think it is reasonable to expect 
<br />
that if X-Theory is correct, we will very likely see these bizarre and 
<br />
frightening things happen in the next minute.
<br />
<br />Now, here we are, a minute later, and nothing bizarre has happened after 
<br />
all. Does this mean that X-Theory is probably wrong? Perhaps not. After all, 
<br />
the theory did predict with 100% certainty that one version of the world 
<br />
will continue as before. The objection to this will no doubt be, &quot;yes, but 
<br />
how likely is it that WE end up in that particular version?&quot; And the answer 
<br />
to this objection is, &quot;it is 100% certain that WE end up in that particular 
<br />
version; just as it is 100% certain that 999,999 copies of us end up in the 
<br />
bizarre versions&quot;. Those 999,999 copies are not continuing to type away as I 
<br />
am, because they are running around in a panic.
<br />
<br />The above is simply a version of the Anthropic Principle as applied to 
<br />
intelligent life in the universe. A particular ensemble theory may predict 
<br />
that it is overwhelmingly unlikely that a particular universe will allow the 
<br />
development of intelligent life. Does the fact that we are here, appparently 
<br />
intelligent and alive, count as evidence against that theory? No, because 
<br />
the theory predicts that although unlikely, it is certain to happen in at 
<br />
least ONE universe, and obviously that universe will be the one we find 
<br />
ourselves in.
