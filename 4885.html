Hi,
<br />
<br />I disagreed with some points in your argumentation...
<br />
<br />----- Original Message ----- 
<br />
From: &quot;David Barrett-Lennard&quot; &lt;dbl.domain.name.hidden&gt;
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm trying to define &quot;identity&quot;...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let's write x~y if SAS's x and y (possibly in different universes) have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the same identity.
</em><br />
<br />You did not yet 'define' identity. You just proposed a relation between
<br />
two entities which is supposed to mean that these two entities have the
<br />
same 'identity'.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I propose that this relation must be reflexive,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; symmetric and transitive.
</em><br />
<br />This is a proposal which seems self-evident, but let us keep in mind that
<br />
we have no reason to propose it yet, since we don't even know what
<br />
'identity' means. I believe, in fact, that this relation '~' is NOT
<br />
transitive!
<br />
Let me try to argue why later.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This neatly partitions all SAS's into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; equivalence classes, and we have no ambiguity working out whether any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; two SAS's across the multi-verse have the same identity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Consider an SAS x that splits into x1, x2 (in child universes under
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MWI).  We assume x~x1 and x~x2.  By symmetry and transitivity we deduce
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; x1~x2.  So this definition of identity is maintained across independent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; child universes.
</em><br />
<br />This is where the '~' relation shows that it cannot be transitive. I don't
<br />
know what your definition of identity is, but in other posts I have
<br />
argued that I am not the copies of me in other universes. Therefore,
<br />
since you have come to the conclusion that I am, it must be the case
<br />
that your assumption of the transitivity of '~' is wrong. To support your
<br />
definition of '~', you must give a better reason to believe that you are
<br />
the copies of yourself in other worlds. Just defining an arbitrary '~'
<br />
relation does not do the job.
<br />
<br />In fact, I believe we should define another relation of personal identity,
<br />
which is NOT symmetric. I shall use the notation '&lt;' meaning
<br />
that if x&lt;y, x is a former state of y. 'x' is unambiguously defined by
<br />
following &quot;down&quot; the multiverse branching 'tree'. But we cannot define
<br />
the '&gt;' relation, i.e., the relation by which y&gt;x would mean that y is a
<br />
continuation of x 'uptree'. Since there are multiple choices for the next
<br />
state of x, it cannot be told in advance what the next subjective moment
<br />
will be.
<br />
<br />So you can say that x&lt;x1 and x&lt;x2, but it does not follow that x1&lt;x2 OR
<br />
x2&lt;x1. And since, by my definition, personal identity can be determined
<br />
only by the relation '&lt;', x1 does not have the same 'identity' of x2.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is at odds with the following concept of identity...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I am, for all practical purposes, one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and only one specific configuration of atoms in a specific
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; universe. I could never say that ' I ' is ALL the copies, since I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; NEVER experience what the other copies experience
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It seems necessary to distinguish between a definition of identity and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the set of memories within an SAS at a given moment.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is it possible that over long periods of time, the environment can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; affect an SAS to such an extent that SAS's in different universe that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are suppose to have the same identity actually have very little in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; common?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What happens if we &quot;splice&quot; two SAS's (including their memories)?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It seems to me that the concept of identity is not fundamental to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics.  It's useful for classification purposes as long as one doesn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stretch it too far and expose its lack of precision.
</em><br />
<br />Maybe it is not fundamental to physics, but it surely is fundamental to
<br />
us, since that may be the difference between immortality or otherwise.
<br />
Even more importantly, it is the basis for all our daily decisions.
<br />
It is not merely a classification purpose. When you decide not to spend
<br />
your money on the lottery, you don't think that doing so is good,
<br />
because you will be increasing the number of 'yous' who are
<br />
rich elsewhere. You don't care for the other 'yous' because you truly
<br />
believe that the probability that you will just lose yor money is too high.
<br />
And if you don't care for the other 'yous' they are not really 'you', they
<br />
are other entities.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This reminds me of the problem of defining the word &quot;species&quot;.  Although
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a useful concept for zoologists it is not well defined.  For example
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there are cases where (animals in region) A can mate with B, B can mate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with C, but A can't mate with C.
</em><br />
<br />Although you can safely ignore those classifications when relating to
<br />
objects,
<br />
you cannot deny that defining your identity is too easy. Cut your finger
<br />
and you will know who is feeling the pain.
<br />
<br />-Eric.
