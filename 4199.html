<br />
RS wrote on one level how the algorithmic revolution 
<br />
was &quot;epistemological&quot;. I objected to this partly. let me
<br />
quote the dictionary defn of epistemology
<br />
<br />epistemology-- the branch of philosophy that deals with 
<br />
the nature and theory of knowledge.
<br />
<br />now in newtons time, science was seen as a branch of philosophy.
<br />
however in modern times, philosophy has become somewhat disconnected
<br />
from science and followed its own course. so to me to label a genuine
<br />
scientific paradigm shift &quot;epistemological&quot; seems to downplay its
<br />
significance somewhat as a little too abstract. the scientific revolution
<br />
is not merely about a different way of seeing the universe, but a different
<br />
way of interacting with it. (experimental method, etc.) 
<br />
<br />this is exactly
<br />
the way in which I insist the &quot;algorithmic revolution&quot; be interpreted
<br />
as I outlined..  not &quot;merely&quot; a shift in the way 
<br />
we view the world. (unfortunately 
<br />
&quot;paradigm shift&quot; terminology sometimes implies a merely conceptual,
<br />
subjective shift in view, partly due to kuhns perspective, but a
<br />
paradigm shift means much more than a mere psychological rearrangement.)
<br />
<br /><br />next, RS defines the clockwork metaphor in terms of the newtonian
<br />
revolution. this is very reasonable and there is a high correlation.
<br />
however I would argue the clockwork paradigm is ongoing. the
<br />
clockwork universe involved multiple new ways of seeing the
<br />
world. one of them, indeed, was newtonian mathematical laws
<br />
for physics, gravitation, etcetera. another was determinism,
<br />
ala the famous laplacian quote re: atoms as billiard balls. 
<br />
<br />however another was simply, &quot;universe as mechanistic&quot;. the clock is a 
<br />
machine. the clock metaphor proposes the universe runs like a kind
<br />
of automated machine subject to mathematical/physical laws. 
<br />
<br />lets be very careful to define &quot;clockwork universe metaphor&quot; in terms
<br />
of the accurate history of its origination, not from our modern point
<br />
of view. note that in the middle ages, prior to
<br />
the newtonian revolution, the previous paradigm for the concept
<br />
of &quot;force&quot; was something sometimes involving supernatural aspects.
<br />
the world was presumed to be set in motion by god &amp; influenced
<br />
by various spirits, entities, etcetera in ways not fully conceivable.
<br />
this is what the clockwork metaphor replaced.
<br />
<br />the &quot;universe as mechanistic&quot; theme from the clockwork metaphor
<br />
persists to this day. einsteins relativistic theory involved the
<br />
consideration at clocks in moving frames. 
<br />
when physicists analyze particle dynamics,
<br />
or even search for a TOE as we are here, I would say the clockwork
<br />
metaphor is still alive. its still ticking, so to speak.. wink
<br />
<br />again, let me contrast the algorithmic metaphor for the universe
<br />
with the clockwork one. even in newtons time, the idea was
<br />
that the universe ran **like** a clock. it was a metaphor. but
<br />
the zuse-fredkin-wolfram idea of the universe is that the
<br />
universe evolves not merely **as** a computation, but that it
<br />
**is** a computation. 
<br />
<br />therefore, imho the algorithmic metaphor
<br />
is actually more than a metaphor, more than the clockwork model
<br />
was a metaphor.  its not merely a paradigm shift I would say, its
<br />
something more. its a new model, a new system, a new framework. 
<br />
its comparable to newtons discovery
<br />
of the law of gravitation if the program can be successfully
<br />
carried out.
<br />
<br />is the algorithmic idea incorrect? someday we will probably
<br />
notice that it has its deficiencies just as the clockwork idea
<br />
did, but we will not discard it entirely, just as we have
<br />
not discarded the clockwork universe idea.
<br />
<br />so imho to say the clockwork metaphor for reality is &quot;wrong&quot;,
<br />
is (uh) wrong. imho its a simplistic/facile rejection of a 
<br />
still-legitimate paradigm.
