<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; duplicates, it is a scientific fact that Bruno will watch TV (in one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; room) and will not watch TV (in the other room).  In short, it will

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; be true that Bruno will watch TV and will not watch TV---simply because

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; objective truth may well be that coin-tossing causes duplication and I do, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in fact, experience both, but don't realise it. I am interested in asking 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and/or answering the question assuming this sort of ignorance. Can it be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; done, or is it linguistically as well as physically and logically 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; impossible?
</em><br />
<br />Great question!  I go so far as to agree with your sense here.
<br />
<br />Here is an example: suppose that a million copies of you are to be
<br />
made every day, and for each of them, on the following day yet another
<br />
million copies are made. (Thus after N days there are (10^6)^N copies.)
<br />
Further, suppose that 1 of them will be 1000 feet under water, and the
<br />
others simply find themselves at STP.
<br />
<br />Your choice every day is whether to don the very bulky and time-
<br />
consuming diving equipment or not. It takes about half an hour to put
<br />
it  on, and after you have been copied, about half an hour to take it off.
<br />
<br />One day you are in a special hurry, and think, &quot;well, it's true that
<br />
in 1 case I will die a rather ghastly death which will be very uncomfortable
<br />
for about fifteen or twenty seconds, but in the other 999,999 cases I
<br />
can get about my important affairs and save an hour of fiddling with
<br />
the equipment&quot;.
<br />
<br />So that day you decide not to go through the ritual of putting on
<br />
and taking off the equipment. And, sure enough, one of you finds
<br />
himself in an unpleasant situation... *and in some sense regrets
<br />
the decision*.  Now logically, during the fifteen or twenty seconds
<br />
it takes him to die he realizes that his duplicates live, and that
<br />
in some sense it really was a good decision. But he also cannot help
<br />
but feel that he was &quot;unlucky&quot;.   A part of him must ask, &quot;now what
<br />
was the chance of this???&quot;
<br />
<br />At this point, he has relapsed into thinking of himself as an instance.
<br />
(Torture is another way that &quot;instance-thinking&quot; can be aroused even
<br />
in those with the broadest usage of &quot;I&quot;.) You know intellectually
<br />
that you are doing just fine almost everywhere, but in this peculiar
<br />
case you're dead.
<br />
<br />Yet it's probably *not* a good idea to put on the equipment everyday.
<br />
There are two reasons (that should be regarded as completely equivalent):
<br />
(1) in almost all cases I will save time (about a million hours all
<br />
together) and (2) the odds are very small that I'll need the equipment.
<br />
<br />I contend that (2) should be taken as really meaning just (1) and that
<br />
literally, (2) is incorrect.
<br />
<br />We all make these same choices every day:  &quot;Should I drive to work this
<br />
morning even though one in a million of me is going to die in a traffic
<br />
accident?&quot;  But to MWI devotees, the answer should be clear: it only
<br />
*seems* unlucky that I'm *just* here with a broken body in a heap of
<br />
twisted metal. The reality is that in most universes, today was not
<br />
unlike all the other days.
<br />
<br />To quote you again,
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is there any way of asking the question such that the answer is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;there is an even chance that I will see either a 1 or a 0&quot;? 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The objective truth may well be that coin-tossing causes duplication
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and I do, in fact, experience both, but don't realise it. I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interested in asking and/or answering the question assuming this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sort of ignorance. Can it be done, or is it linguistically as well
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as physically and logically impossible?
</em><br />
<br />So I'm translating your question as, &quot;Is there any way of asking the
<br />
question such that the answer is 'there is only a tiny chance that
<br />
I'll be killed this morning on the way to work'?&quot;.
<br />
<br />Chance seems to be overridden by MWI, and also in the cases of duplicates.
<br />
It's replaced by &quot;fractional thinking&quot;, I guess.  We might still use
<br />
the language of probability, but it should be just shorthand for the
<br />
better description of the situation in terms of fractions (of &quot;me&quot;).
<br />
<br />Sound right?
<br />
<br />Lee
