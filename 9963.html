Hi all,
<br />
<br />It's very interesting to see these ideas. Common people can understand 
<br />
common languages (like English, Chinese etc.).
<br />
So I think even the most difficult math. or physics theories can be 
<br />
translated into other common languages that 
<br />
common people can understand easily.
<br />
I don't see why common people can not understand the most difficult math. 
<br />
equations.
<br />
Those math. equations or theorems should be just like one language that can 
<br />
be translated into another common
<br />
language that everyone can understand.
<br />
<br />Thanks.
<br />
<br />WC.

<br />
<br />Bruno,
<br />
<br />George wrote an admirably wise note and you picked positively on the 
<br />
roadmap with the fruitful mind of a logician. 
<br />
It looks like you both start out from &quot;not agreeing because of 
<br />
non-understanding math sufficiently&quot; - which may be true, but not 
<br />
necessarily the &quot;real&quot; root. 
<br />
<br />I think many of us have the wrong information about 'math' in question. You 
<br />
called &quot;numbers&quot; the series of '1,2,3...many' and &quot;we&quot; think 'math' is a 
<br />
manipulation of such, even if many substitute and functional symbols are 
<br />
used. 
<br />
<br />My question (and I asked it several times here and on diverse other lists 
<br />
and got no satisfactory answer) - still prevails:
<br />
What are (in the new meaning) NUMBERS - how can we handle the non-number 
<br />
concepts by numbers - (whatever they are)? Rephrased: What is the 'new' 
<br />
meaning of &quot;math&quot; and how can non-math concepts be handled by math? 
<br />
<br />Norman touched it, 1Z goes around it, David Bohm even went that far as to 
<br />
state: numbers (and so math) are human inventions, probably based on Plato, 
<br />
who made the biggest (philosophical) argument - as the product  of HIS 
<br />
mind. 
<br />
<br />Words are loaded with different meanings and people tend to use their 
<br />
favorite - mostly from the mother tongue.  I admire George's open mind 
<br />
accepting the diverse positions and I am also no missionary who wants to 
<br />
convert people, but even if I think differently, I like to follow the 
<br />
mental ways of others. It may add usefully to my own thinking. 
<br />
<br />So I propose a 'starting' point to the 'roadmap':
<br />
How may one consider the new version(s) of number and math instead of the 
<br />
arithmetic-based and binary computer founded conventional ignorance? (It is 
<br />
not a 101 course what this list should be above, it may draw in 
<br />
'more-sided' opinions into the discussion - which is now pretty much on the 
<br />
math - physics base only. Extending to other planes of 'everything'.)
<br />
<br />Then we may proceed in understanding the 'stuffy' matter (as e.g.. a photon 
<br />
- ha ha) and the physicists' concepts mostly based on some mathematical 
<br />
application, including the most esoteric 'everything' topics. 
<br />
After all that I may try to speak about my ways how I am not in controversy 
<br />
with all that - only regarding it as a partial view of the totality (which 
<br />
is hard to talk about). Not for converting you or others, just for proving 
<br />
to myself some (Levy-type) sanity. 
<br />
<br />So how should I include the validity of a legal opinion into the numbers? 
<br />
How should I 'comp'(?) the feeling of love? How should I 'materialize' 
<br />
(physically?) the beauty of a sunset? 
<br />
(all without flattening those qualia into a quantitative plane)?
<br />
<br />Eager to learn
<br />
<br />John Mikes

<br /><br />Hi George,
<br />
<br /><br />A roadmap could be a very good idea. I will think about it. 
<br />
I will keep on your level notions:
<br />
<br />-kids
<br />
-grandmother
<br />
-colleagues
<br />
<br />(But not in any normative sense: I know kids who are better in math than 
<br />
colleagues, and I know a family where the computer and the net has been 
<br />
installed by the grand-grandmother! So here each one should judge by 
<br />
him/herself on which level they to feel to be.
<br />
<br />But a roadmap, some summaries ... are in need, sure. Not so easy of course. 
<br />
Just let me think about it.
<br />
Note also that if I explain in plain english, what I say could appear as a 
<br />
little weird, that is why I tend to be technical. And also, I don't know 
<br />
much people who can swallow both Godel/Church... and Everett/Deutsch ... 
<br />
Quantum information science can help, but this is a bit tricky by itself 
<br />
when you want to be enough precise, and still a long way from Godel-lobian 
<br />
notions.
<br />
<br />In any case thanks for letting me know when I get too much technical. 
<br />
Thanks to Norman who tries sometimes to convey a similar message, and 
<br />
thanks to Tom for enjoying apparently the more technical posts ...., and 
<br />
thanks to 1Z for playing the role of the skeptical one, and thanks to all 
<br />
of you, especially Wei Dai, for the kind patience.
<br />
<br />I will think about some roadmap, but also about some books which could 
<br />
provide helps.
<br />
<br />Feel free to say more on your &quot;relativity&quot;-information theory. Everyone can 
<br />
talk I certainly don't want to monopolize the threads (but then I got a 
<br />
result and I like to share with motivated people ...)...
<br />
<br />Now I will leave my office before I liquefy completely ....
<br />
<br />Bruno
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />Le 19-juil.-06, ?00:32, George Levy a 嶰rit :
<br />
<br /><br />Hi Bruno
<br />
<br />Each one of us like to do what we do best and we apply our preferred 
<br />
techniques to the problem at hand. Thus a mechanic may solve the pollution 
<br />
problem by building electric cars, and the cook may solve the same problem 
<br />
by preparing vegetarian meals.
<br />
<br />As a mathematician you are trying to compose a theory of everything using 
<br />
mathematics, this is understandable, and you came up with COMP which is 
<br />
strongly rooted in mathematics and logic.
<br />
<br />I came up independently with my own concept involving a generalization of 
<br />
relativity to information theory ( my background is engineering/physics) 
<br />
and somehow we seem to agree on many points. Unfortunately I do not have 
<br />
the background and the time to give my ideas a formal background. It is 
<br />
just an engineering product and it feels right.
<br />
<br />I believe that what you are saying is right,  however I am having some 
<br />
trouble following you, just like Norman Samish said. It would help if you 
<br />
outlined a roadmap. Then we would be able to follow the roadmap without 
<br />
having to stop and admire the mathematical scenery at every turn even 
<br />
though it is very beautiful to the initiated, I am sure. For example you 
<br />
could use several levels of explanation: a first level would be as if your 
<br />
were talking to your grandmother; a second level, talking to your kids (if 
<br />
they listen); a last level, talking to your colleagues. 
<br />
<br />George
