<br />
<br />This is actually the key point.  We don't know what subjectivity is.
<br />
<br />Passing the Turing Test is a necessary but not sufficient
<br />
condition for a consciousness.  A sufficiently responsive mechanism, but
<br />
lacking self-awareness with qualia, could &quot;outwit&quot; any possible Turning
<br />
test.  A proper definition of consciousness must await our understanding
<br />
its physical and computational basis.
<br />
<br />We don't know whether there will be a smooth reduction of our common
<br />
(and admittedly folk-psychological) concept of consciousness to strict
<br />
physics (the position called &quot;reductive materialism&quot;) or whether this
<br />
concept is so flawed that it will have to be junked completely
<br />
(&quot;eliminative materialism').  Until we actually understand how brains
<br />
work, and what we crudely call &quot;consciousness&quot; is generated, it is
<br />
premature to attempt an answer.
<br />
<br />Talking about &quot;interpretations&quot; and &quot;consciousness&quot; ( or &quot;subjectivity&quot;)
<br />
at this point therefore seems wholly premature.
<br />
<br />On the other hand, we CAN say what reality is like, because we do
<br />
understand its math, at least to a certain level, confirmed by massive
<br />
amounts of experimental data.  We can say, for example, that reality is
<br />
deterministic.  Consider the following 3 points:
<br />
<br />(1) QM really is the Everett formalism, and this implies determinism. 
<br />
And if we look
<br />
at work by Gell-Mann and Hartle, which extends Everett's and explains
<br />
approximate classicity at the coarse-grained level, we see the
<br />
determinism more clearly when we consider the full cosmological context,
<br />
where literally EVERYTHING comes about as a consequence of the form of
<br />
the initial density matrix.  I would also argue, although this may be
<br />
controversial, that by the understanding given of equivalence classes in
<br />
GMH, quantum state vectors are seen to be incomplete descriptions, and
<br />
the uncertainty principle, even though it is a rigorously derivable
<br />
consequence of the formalism of QM, therefore comes across (in some
<br />
appropriate sense) as only epistemological.  I find it bizarre that
<br />
Gell-Mann's merely verbal statements seem to go against what his math is
<br />
saying.  How, for example can he say that QM is somehow
<br />
&quot;indeterministic&quot; even though everything-the entire evolution of the
<br />
universe-is completely specified by the initial density matrix?  And how
<br />
can he claim, so arbitrarily, that the particular quasi-classical set of
<br />
correlations that we call our macroscopic reality is the only real one
<br />
or even somehow (except from our very parochial point of view) a
<br />
particularly special one? 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;(2) The &quot;view from nowhen&quot; of QM, almost by definition, means a fully
<br />
determinate block universe.  
<br />
<br />(3) It would appear, on the basis of the existence of quantum
<br />
correlations, that the only possible &quot;true&quot; wavefunction can be the wave
<br />
function of the entire &quot;Universe,&quot; i.e., of all that exists.  This
<br />
Universal wavefunction cannot depend on time or space.  One easy way to
<br />
see this is by bringing in general relativity.  If the Universal
<br />
wavefunction did depend on time or space, then we would have a
<br />
dependence on how we chose space or time coordinates, which is
<br />
inconsistent with general relativity.  Space and time must therefore be
<br />
derivative entities whose &quot;information content&quot; is already contained
<br />
within the timeless and metaphysically determinate Universal
<br />
wavefunction.  What is, is--complete determinism.  
<br />
<br />In a fully deterministic universe, what brings about the determinism? 
<br />
We can SPECULATE the answer is pure logical consistency.  Doing this
<br />
gives us a generalization of ordinary MWI to an &quot;everything &quot;
<br />
hypothesis.  And in an appropriate form (e.g., Tegmark's) this
<br />
hypothesis is testable.
