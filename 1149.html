</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Without the MWI, either the H branch exists or the T branch but not both.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; In any case you have changed the game when bringing time into the picture.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Am I now to understand that what Tegmark meant to say is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;      P(A,t2) = Sum over i [  P(A,t2|Bi,t1) P(Bi,t1)  ]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; which not the same at all as what you quoted him as saying.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Actually, I didn't change the game, Tegmark did.  I've re-read his paper,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; section III-B-2, &quot;Making Predictions&quot;, and here's what he says:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Suppose that a SAS at location L0 has perceived Y up until that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     instant, and that this SAS is interested in predicting the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     perception X that it will have a subjective time interval delta-t
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     into the future, at location L1.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     ... for any mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive set of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     possibilities Bi, the probability of an event A is given by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     P(A) = Sum over i { P(A|Bi)P(Bi) }.  Using this twice, we find that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     the probability of X given Y is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     P(X|Y) = Sum over L0 {  Sum over L1 {  P(X|L1)P(L1|L0)P(L0|Y)  } }
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; He uses L0 and L1 to label &quot;locations&quot; in the entire ensemble of all 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universes and all SAS-observer-moments.  L0 == (i0, j0, t0), where 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; i0 labels the structure, j0 labels the SAS, and t0 labels the subjective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some identity function is already clearly needed if P(X|Y) is to
<br />
mean what he said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly the L's do not label observables, except for t, while the
<br />
X and Y do.  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what does j0 mean?  Possibly a label for an implementation of a
<br />
computation, but hard to say since his identity function is quite
<br />
different from the concept of identity I endorse.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Tegmark clearly, in this line of reasoning, assumes some sort of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (unspecified) identity function, and makes that explicit in his discussion
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the second term above, P(L1|L0).  This is supposed to be the probability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the SAS &quot;will be&quot;, or will find herself, at L1, given that she is now
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at L0.  He says:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Since a SAS is by definition only in a single mathematical structure i
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     and since t1 = t0 + delta-t, the second factor will clearly be of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     form:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       P(L1|L0) = P(i1, j1, t1 | i0, j0, t0)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;                = kd(i0, i1) Dd(t1 - t0 - delta-t) P(j1 | i0, j0)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Where &quot;kd&quot; is the Kronecker delta function, and &quot;d&quot; is the Dirac delta 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; function. So P here is a probability density function of six independent 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; variables. We know we're interested in subjective times t0 and t1, so 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; P(L1|L0) vanishes for every value of (t1 - t0) except delta-t.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OK.  The first factor, kd(i0,i1) indicates that 'jumping' to
<br />
another 'world' is not possible, presumably regardless of whether the
<br />
structure 'i' you started on dissappears.  So that's fine with me,
<br />
probably not fine with some of you.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second factor is part of the definition of L, and probably
<br />
should be a Kronecker delta since subjective times are digital.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third factor I do not understand.  Apparently one can leap
<br />
from j0 to j1.  (Supposedly, that is.)  But when he says
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     instant, and that this SAS is interested in predicting the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     perception X that it will have a subjective time interval delta-t
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it seems that this third factor *should be* delta_j0,j1 since j
<br />
labels the SAS, and the SAS is said to be the one to have both of the
<br />
perceptions in question.  Then j would be the identity function.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to copying, an extended computation can give rise to multiple
<br />
perceptions simultaneously, so if that is what he meant, he must have not
<br />
taken copying into account.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The problem in the notation is exactly because of this unspecified 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; identity function.  The way I used it, I intended that P(H,t3|H,t1)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should mean &quot;the probability that she'll remember having seen heads,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and that she now sees the clock at t3, given that when she saw the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; clock at t1, she remembered having seen heads&quot;.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But in a strict reading of the notation, one would assume it to mean
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;the probability that she remembers having seen heads and the time 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is now t3, given that she remembers having seen heads and the time is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; now t1,&quot; which of course is 0 (the time cannot be both t3 and t1).
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right.  That's where he changed the game.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So  you have to assume some sort of identity function for this sort
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of reasoning to work at all.  Which is exactly what I was trying to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; say before, viz:  In option 4, this sort of probabalistic reasoning is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not possible.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I say that if we throw this out, then all is lost.  ALL we are are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; able to do, in physics, is make predictions about future observations,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; based on past experiences.  And all of these predictions are necessarily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subjective, for each one of us.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrong!  First, we are not aware of past experiences whatsoever.
<br />
We know only what our memory banks tell us now.  That's all we need.  We
<br />
can base beliefs about other times on that, but there's no way to prove
<br />
such theories.  More to the point, we (or at least our brains!) can make
<br />
decisions, of which stating predictions is a special case, based on our
<br />
beliefs about the future plus our desires (~utility function).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, an observer is not the sort of thing that can *do*
<br />
anything.  A computer can do things, and a computer gives rise to
<br />
observations, and those two facts are closely related in my opinion.  But
<br />
one can not identify a computer as an observer because a *single* computer
<br />
can give rise to multiple different conscious observations simultaneously.
<br />
If one were to admit zombies as a possibilty (which I don't; they are a
<br />
useful concept though) the difference would be even more obvious.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I don't see how an identity function, or lack thereof, could
<br />
make any difference.  Computers will continue to function regardless of
<br />
such ideology.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So let me re-assert what I mean by P(H,t3|H,t1), as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;the probability that she'll remember having seen heads,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and that she now sees the clock at t3, given that when she saw the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; clock at t1, she remembered having seen heads&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And let me ask you, how can this not be 1?  (Or at least as near as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dammit?)
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not a meaningful question, except in the sense of both
<br />
observations being derived from the same implementation as I discussed in
<br />
a previous post.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  If you like, forget about the copy machine and use a death
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine instead:  if the coin lands heads, then she'll have a 50/50
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; chance of being killed.  Should she expect a 1/2 chance of remembering
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; having seen heads at t1, but a 1/3 chance of remembering having seen
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; heads at t3?
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, but only if she's alive then.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I suppose you would say yes, because of the absolute SSA.  But then you'd 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have to conclude, I guess, that the reason we see things obey physical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; laws now is that the chance of our dying is relatively low.  
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What???  I have no idea what you mean by that.  Of course, our
<br />
chance of dying is relatively low only because the particular laws we see
<br />
are relatively favorable to our continued existance.  If all laws were
<br />
equally favorable predictions would be a lot harder to make.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Anyway, the reason, I guess, I adhere to the QTI is that the concept of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my own personal death just doesn't make any sense to me.  My own death
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is by definition outside the realm of my own experience.  This ties in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; directly with the discussion above, and with the strong sense I have that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my identity continues through subjective time.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boundary of a line segment is by definition outside the realm
<br />
of a line.  Therefore all line segments continue indefinitely.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; []
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, I think you're right about [memory vs. measure].  The expectation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; value for my memory should be right around the median.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, at least one thing you learned.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;         Life will continue but with decreasing measure.  Still it seems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that you can make a refutable prediction: namely, that the universe we are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in is not optimised for us to be here, but is optimised to give you a long
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; lifetime.  Basically you are saying that what the measure ratio (say,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; between two universes) will be in the future affects the measure ratio in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the present.  For example a universe in which lives decay polynomially
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; would be favored over one in which they decay exponentially.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have made a refutable prediction:  that we necessarily will find ourselves
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in a universe that will support eternal life.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's not refutable.  Thanks to the MWI, almost any universe
<br />
will.  The prediction I suggested is much stronger and seems implied by
<br />
your beliefs.
<br />
<br />From: Christopher Maloney &lt;dude.domain.name.hidden&gt;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But this doesn't make any sense!  Define &quot;old&quot;!  No matter what age you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are, you could always ask why you don't find yourself to be &quot;younger&quot; or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;older&quot;.  When I'm 10,000 years old, I think I'll still consider myself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;young, so I'd still be able to reason on the basis that I don't find 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;myself to be very old.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been over this *many* times.  A) &quot;Old&quot; is when your finite
<br />
brain is too old to even know how old it is.  B) In any case, &quot;old&quot; is
<br />
much older than the age that would be expected if QTI is false:  In QTI
<br />
one should expect one's age *relative to* the other people you see to be
<br />
large, certainly *****not***** less than or of order 1!  If you were
<br />
10,000 and everyone else was &lt;100 at least you would have reason to supect
<br />
the rules might be different for you than for third parties.
