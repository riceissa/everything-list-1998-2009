<em class="quotelev1">&gt;likewise
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;slow ones will have more measure than fast ones.  This is because in

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;each

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;OM in the vastness of a universe, and the slower and bigger an OM is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;easier it is to find.  I am inclined to tentatively accept these 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;results.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;It does imply that the extreme future vision of some transhumanists,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;to upload themselves to super-fast, super-small computers, may greatly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;reduce their measure, which would mean that it would be like taking a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;large chance of dying.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Could someone please explain what will happen to the hapless 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;transhumanists
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in their computer when their measure falls to alarmingly low levels? 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; they develop severe headaches, turn transparent like ghosts, or what?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This is a kind of transformation that hasn't been possible in the world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;before, so no normal phenomenon will exactly capture what happens.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;To a first approximation, if their measure were reduced by 90%, what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would happen subjectively would be the same as if they took steps that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;had a 90% chance of killing them, in this model.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now, objectively this is different because it would require other people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to deal with their deaths.  But subjectively it would be pretty much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the same.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Perhaps a closer approximation could be achieved if they were not only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;killed, but somehow everyone else's memory was changed so that no one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;remembered them or noticed that they were gone.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Imagine instead the question, what would it be like, subjectively,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to die instantly and without warning?  It's a hard question to answer.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But it is related to the question, what would it be it like to have your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;measure suddenly reduced?  You could imagine your larger before-measure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;as being represented by your mind being instantiated as many copies.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Then a certain percentage of those copies are instantly killed.  What is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it like subjectively?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;To the copies which remain, there is no subjective change.  To the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;copies which were killed, perhaps it is like nothing subjectively,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;because there is no longer any subject there.  But it is still a change.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I think a reduction of measure would be like a certain percentage of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;my instances being instantly killed.  When I imagine what it is like,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I picture myself being one of the unlucky instances.  I stop and never
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;know I stopped, while other copies go on.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The other night I had a strange dream.  I came into a room and met someone
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;whom I came to understand was myself.  I was a copy who had been created
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a few moments earlier, and he was the original.  There was a switch on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the wall which would instantly destroy the copy, and I was supposed to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;push it.  But I hesitated.  My own consciousness would be destroyed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;On the other hand I was supposedly a copy made just moments earlier,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;so only a few seconds of memories would be lost, hardly consequential.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Still I had to face that dilemma: what would it feel like to just stop,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;instantly?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Nervously, I went ahead and pushed the button, squeezing my eyes shut
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and making a kind of mental &quot;flinch&quot; or jerk.  To my surprise, I was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;still there, and when I opened my eyes, the other person was gone.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It turned out that he was the copy and I was the original.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Imagine facing your copy, perhaps an exact copy whose mind is synchronized
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with yours, and seeing a coin flip which will determine which one is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;destroyed.  Your measure will be halved.  In a sense it will have no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;subjective effect, your thoughts and memories will be preserved in one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of you.  But in another sense you face a 50-50 chance of experiencing that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mysterous effect of instant death.  I think it would be scary.  Logically,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;similar reductions of measure should be viewed in the same light.
</em><br />
<br />Hal,
<br />
<br />What I think you're describing is akin to the traditional view of personal 
<br />
identity as something firmly attached to a particular animal, computer or 
<br />
whatever. The most important insight the observer moment concept offers, to 
<br />
my mind, is that the observer effectively dies every moment, and the 
<br />
illusion of an individual persisting through time is created by the 
<br />
stringing together of appropriately related OM's. I wouldn't even call this 
<br />
a theory; I think it is true ipso facto.
<br />
<br />Consider an observer experiencing a series of conscious moments OM1, OM2, 
<br />
OM3... etc. Just as OM3 is about to start, he is vapourised by a nuclear 
<br />
explosion. Assuming for simplicity there are no parallel universes, the 
<br />
observer has died. What does &quot;dying&quot; mean in this context? It means that his 
<br />
last conscious moment was OM2, and there will be no more. Notice that 
<br />
nothing special has &quot;happened&quot; to OM2; it is the same as if he had continued 
<br />
living, and it is unaffected by what may or may not follow. Death consists 
<br />
in the absence of successors to OM2. Therefore, provisionally, as each 
<br />
conscious moment passes, the observer &quot;dies&quot; until or unless there is a 
<br />
successor.
<br />
<br />What counts as a successor to OM2? Normally, it would be OM3, implemented on 
<br />
the same hardware or wetware as OM2. The important thing about OM3 is not 
<br />
the physical substrate on which it is implemented, but the fact that it 
<br />
recognises itself to be a successor to OM2. So if the nuked observer had 
<br />
teleported himself to safety or uploaded his mind to a computer network 
<br />
before the nuking, he would suddenly find himself in a different place, 
<br />
experiencing OM3', which need not be the same as OM3 would have been, 
<br />
provided it is recognisably a successor to OM2. If the observer had been 
<br />
less prudent, but by a fantastic stroke of luck OM3'' was implemented on a 
<br />
computer in the Andromeda galaxy a billion years in the future, OM3'' being 
<br />
recognisably a successor to OM2 even if different from what OM3 or OM3' 
<br />
would have been, then again our observer would have survived the disaster.
<br />
<br />Now turn to your example. You and an exact copy whose mind is running in 
<br />
lockstep with yours are awaiting the result of a coin toss. (Actually, you 
<br />
should not be facing each other if your minds are in lockstep, since then 
<br />
you would be seeing things differently). Let's say that you are both 
<br />
experiencing OM2, as above, when the result of the toss is known and instant 
<br />
death is meted out to one of you. Should you be worried? Well, whether you 
<br />
are copy 1 or copy 2, once OM2 passes, it has vanished from the present 
<br />
universe more completely than any nuclear blast could achieve, and 
<br />
provisionally you are both dead, pending an appropriate successor OM. In 
<br />
other words, at the end of OM2, you are both in exactly the same position. 
<br />
What if you, copy 1, are the one who will suffer instant death? Certainly, 
<br />
this would mean that your brain won't be producing any successor OM's. But 
<br />
recall the earlier examples: it doesn't make any difference where or how or 
<br />
with what delay the successor OM is implemented, as long as it is actually 
<br />
implemented. So when copy 2's brain produces OM3, being the successor to 
<br />
both yours and his OM2 (because they were the same), you won't notice that 
<br />
anything at all has gone awry. In fact, you won't have any evidence that the 
<br />
&quot;instant death&quot; has happened at all, unless you are actually shown copy 1's 
<br />
dead body. That might be pretty scary, but at least you have survived.
<br />
<br />Finally, getting back to the transhumanists in their computer, the same 
<br />
result applies. If their measure - based on the number of copies in the 
<br />
multiverse - steadily decreases, they won't notice anything at all as long 
<br />
as *one* copy remains.
