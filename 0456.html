<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Such computable aspects of R, however, should not distract from the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;segments of some of the few computable reals (e.g., fractions).
</em><br />
<br />I'm afraid I don't follow you here. By dovetailing on all initial 
<br />
segments, it seems clear to me that I am dovetailing on all finite parts 
<br />
of ALL the reals.  
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; There are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;countable computable reals but uncountable others. Hence most reals
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are beyond dovetailing. From an information-oriented perspective, reals
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;tend to complicate things.  Most reals don't fit the Great Programmer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;religion, which is a simple one.
</em><br />
<br />Remember that for some intuitionist (including Brouwer) the reals are 
<br />
more simple than the naturals, and the continuum is considered more 
<br />
primitive than the discrete. This feature is somehow reflected by the 
<br />
classical theorem (by Tarski) which say that there is a complete 
<br />
first-order theory of the reals. And of course (by Goedel) there is no 
<br />
complete theory for the natural numbers (for exemple &quot;Fermat theorem&quot; is 
<br />
trivial if the scope of the quantifiers is R, and very complex if the 
<br />
scope is N).
<br />
But I admit this is besides the point, because we are speaking about the 
<br />
elements, not the mathematical structure. Nevertheless, with infinite 
<br />
dovetailing (which is what the great programmer does), all reals are 
<br />
generated. The set of reals is indeed uncountable, but the set of all 
<br />
finite initial segments of ALL the reals is countable. No more is used in 
<br />
the proof, thanks to the PE-omega thought experiment.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;The =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; observer cannot be localized in a unique computation. He can only be =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; associate with an infinity of &quot;sufficiently similar&quot; computations =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Why? It all can happen in a particular computable world - no obvious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;need to sum over &quot;an infinity of sufficiently similar&quot; computations.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Vague concepts such as &quot;sufficiently similar&quot; complicate things: making
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;them precise requires additional bits of information.
</em><br />
<br />The need to sum over &quot;an infinity of sufficiently similar&quot; computations 
<br />
is precily provided by the PE-omega thought experiment (the UD argument 
<br />
in my thesis).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;This reminds me of my brother (a theoretical physicist) who also used to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;insist on summing over all computations. I guess it's the way physicists
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;get trained.
</em><br />
<br />Thanks for telling me I am not the only crazy one ! (BTW I am not a 
<br />
physicist, but a mathematician with biological, chemical, physical and 
<br />
philosophical motivations).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It is necessary to concentrate ourself on the following thought =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; experiments (PE, PE1, PE2, PE3, PE4, PE-omega).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I guess I have to admit you lost me here. You mention abstract high-level
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;concepts such as teletransport experiments, reconstitution, time-delays,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;expectations, undeterminism, average robots.  True, some of the Great
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Programmer's universes may be interpretable (by appropriate computable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interpreters) as being inhabited by people who write messages about such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;things. But I was not quite able to see how this affects the contents of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;my little paper, whose main objective is to keep things simple, probably
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;because I am just a simple mind myself.
</em><br />
<br />I don't believe my work affects the main part of your paper, it only 
<br />
affects your conclusion : where you see an end I see a beginning (even 
<br />
one of the most promising beginning we could ever have hoped for solving 
<br />
the mind-body problem, including the problem of the origin of our belief 
<br />
in universe(s)).
<br />
<br />Don't feel sorry for not following my PE-omega thought experience. I'm 
<br />
used to that. Most of those, who have (apparently) understand it, have 
<br />
follow lenghty oral speech I've make, whith a lot of drawings, etc. It is 
<br />
unfortunate that it is still difficult to include automatically drawings 
<br />
in email !
<br />
I really intend putting more information in my URL, but I have some 
<br />
problem managing time.
<br />
<br />Now, if you agree, perhaps we can work the argument step by step.
<br />
I am sure you agree with the first PE experiment, i.e. the use of 
<br />
(classical) teletransport. This follows from your paper. Indeed, you 
<br />
agree that in some futur we could survive with an artificial brain. I 
<br />
guess you agree that such a survival doesn't depend where and when the 
<br />
artificial brain is build. So such survival experience is always a kind 
<br />
of teletransport.
<br />
To sum up : I ask you if you agree with step one which just say :
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STEP1: COMP entails WE CAN SURVIVE WITH AN ARTIFICIAL DIGITAL BRAIN
<br />
<br />Obviously I use a minimal amount of &quot;folk psychology&quot;, without which a 
<br />
term like &quot;survive&quot; has no meaning. I just hope you belief implicitely in 
<br />
step0, which is for exemple WE CAN SURVIVE READING THIS POST. If you did 
<br />
survive the reading of this post, then you understand what I mean by 
<br />
surviving, and you understand what I mean by minimal amount of folk 
<br />
psychology.
<br />
<br />Of course, it would be nice if any everythinger, who disagree at some 
<br />
step, tell me where and why.
<br />
