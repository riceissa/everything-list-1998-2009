<br />
Rutgers philosopher Tim Maudlin has a paper intended to challenge certain
<br />
views about consciousness and computation, which we have discussed
<br />
occasionally on this list.  It is called &quot;Computation and Consciousness&quot;,
<br />
Journal of Philosophy v86, pp. 407-432.  I have temporarily put a copy
<br />
online at <a href="http://www.finney.org/~hal/maudlin.pdf">http://www.finney.org/~hal/maudlin.pdf</a> .  This is a personal
<br />
copy and I would ask you not to redistribute it.
<br />
<br />The background question is when a given physical system can be said
<br />
to implement a given computation (especially, a conscious computation).
<br />
We imagine that the computation is specified in abstract terms, perhaps as
<br />
a program in a conventional computer language, or perhaps in a lower-level
<br />
form as a program for a Turing Machine or some other model of computation.
<br />
But it is abstract.  We then ask, given a certain physical system P,
<br />
is it implementing computation C?
<br />
<br />In practice, it seems that this is an easy question to answer.
<br />
Our computers implement the programs which are fed into them.  No one
<br />
denies that.
<br />
<br />But philosophers have argued that there is a way of viewing the activity
<br />
of a physical system that can make it appear to be implementing *any*
<br />
computation C.  We can think of C as passing through a series of states:
<br />
C1, C2, C3, and so on.  And we can think of the physical system P as
<br />
passing through a series of states: P1, P2, P3.  So if we map P1 to C1,
<br />
P2 to C2, and so on, we can argue that P is implementing C, for any C
<br />
and for pretty much any P.
<br />
<br />The philosophers' response to this is that it is not enough to be able to
<br />
set up such a mapping.  What is also necessary, to claim that P implements
<br />
(or &quot;instantiates&quot;) C, is that the *counterfactuals* would have to
<br />
exist in correspondence as well.  That is, not only the states C1, C2,
<br />
C3 but also other states of C that would have been taken if the inputs
<br />
had been different, have to have correspondences in P.  It is claimed
<br />
that the kind of arbitrary mapping described above will not work once
<br />
counterfactuals are taken into account.  (I'm not sure I fully understand
<br />
or agree with this rebuttal but it is well accepted in the field.)
<br />
<br />The principle that whether P implements C depends on these counterfactuals
<br />
is one of the issues that Maudlin addresses.  When referring to conscious
<br />
computations, this principle is generally considered part of the
<br />
&quot;computationalist&quot; hypothesis, that the instantiation of an appropriate
<br />
computation C in a physical system P actually produces a corresponding
<br />
sensation of consciousness.  Implicit in this hypothesis is that to be
<br />
said to be instantiating C, P must have had enough structure to also
<br />
produce counterfactuals, if they had occured.
<br />
<br />Well, that's a lot of background!  And there's more.  The other thesis
<br />
that Maudlin considers is called supervenience, a philosophical word for
<br />
what is fortunately a pretty straightforward concept.  It is that whether
<br />
a physical system implements a given computation depends solely on the
<br />
activity of that physical system.  No mystical or non-physical elements
<br />
or attributes need to be considered in judging whether P implements C.
<br />
All that matters is P's physical activity.
<br />
<br />In a nutshell, Maudlin argues that these two common views on the
<br />
matter are actually in contradiction.  But frankly, although Maudlin's
<br />
argument is complicated and involves all kinds of thought experiments and
<br />
elaborate, imaginary machines, I think it is actually quite an obvious
<br />
point.  Supervenience means that implementation depends on what P does,
<br />
while support for counterfactuals means that implementation depends on
<br />
what P doesn't do.  Q.E.D.!  Maudlin merely takes great time and care
<br />
to illustrate the contradiction in detail.
<br />
<br />Another place that counterfactuals come into play is when considering
<br />
whether replays are conscious.  If we re-run a calculation, but this
<br />
time we don't include the logic aspects but merely passively replay a
<br />
recording of each component's activity, is this conscious?  Does this
<br />
P instantiate C?  The answer, according to the counterfactual view, is
<br />
no, because a mere replay of a recorded set of events does not include
<br />
counterfactuals and will not work right if a different input is supplied.
<br />
On the other hand if the re-run is a genuine computation which merely
<br />
happens to be given the same input and hence to follow the same sequence
<br />
of operations, then that re-run would in fact be considered to generate
<br />
the consciousness.
<br />
<br />Now to bring in the multiverse perspective, in the flavor I have been
<br />
pursuing.  From the viewpoint that says that all information objects
<br />
exist and are distributed according to the Universal Distribution (UDist),
<br />
what can we say about these questions?
<br />
<br />First, the question of whether a physical system P implements a
<br />
computation C is seen to be the wrong question to ask.  C is an
<br />
information object and has a measure.  Likewise, although we think
<br />
of P as physical, in the UDist model the universe containing P is
<br />
merely one information object, and P is a subset of that universe.
<br />
The question is therefore, how much measure does P contribute to C?
<br />
That will depend on the measure of P and on how much of P's measure can
<br />
be seen as contributing to C.
<br />
<br />Now, here I need to address an ambiguity in some of the philosophical
<br />
discussion of this issue, which shows up in Maudlin's paper among other
<br />
places.  What do we mean by an abstract computation?  Is it a program,
<br />
or is it a run of a program (i.e. the sequence of states it goes through,
<br />
also called the &quot;trace&quot;)?
<br />
<br />Well, I suppose it could mean either one; from the UDist perspective,
<br />
both views can be supported.  As information objects, we can distinguish
<br />
programs and program traces, just as we could distinguish theorems and
<br />
proofs, or numbers and sequences.  They are related but not the same.
<br />
We could ask for the measure of a program, and define it by representing
<br />
the program in some canonical form like Java source code, then finding
<br />
the shortest program that would output that program.  Or we could ask
<br />
for the measure of a program trace, define it as a sequence of states
<br />
again in some canonical form, and ask for the shortest program that
<br />
would output that sequence.
<br />
<br />Maudlin talks about programs as sequences of states, which provides
<br />
for the most direct way of thinking of them as causing or creating
<br />
consciousness.  I'll do it that way, too.  So when I speak of P or C
<br />
here I am talking about sequences of states, not static structures
<br />
like machine descriptions or source code listings.
<br />
<br />The specific mechanism in the UDist framework for calculating the
<br />
contribution of P to C's measure is to imagine a program which takes
<br />
P as input and produces C as output.  Both P and C are considered as
<br />
information objects for this purpose.  Such a program can be quite small
<br />
for the case where our common sense would say that P does implement C.
<br />
We can find a mapping of P into C that is simple and straightforward,
<br />
and therefore corresponds to a small program.
<br />
<br />On the other hand in cases where common sense would say that P does
<br />
nothing to implement C, such as where P is a clock and C is a conscious
<br />
program, any such mapping from P to C is going to have to be about as
<br />
big as C itself.  P is of no help in calculating such a C and hence
<br />
there is no short program that produces C given P.
<br />
<br />There is no need to consider counterfactuals in this framework.  What
<br />
keeps a clock from contributing measure to arbitrary programs is not its
<br />
failure to implement counterfactuals, it is the fact that no short program
<br />
can use the structure of a clock to output an arbitrary computation C.
<br />
<br />This analysis also produces a different answer than the traditional
<br />
approach for considering the impact of replays.  Both &quot;passive&quot; replays
<br />
(which just play back a recorded sequence of states) and &quot;active&quot; ones
<br />
(which re-do a computational sequence) would both add roughly equal
<br />
amounts to measure, because both would allow for similarly short programs
<br />
which turn the sequence of P states to the sequence of C states.
<br />
<br />Turning to Maudlin's paper, his main effort is to construct a machine
<br />
(named Olympia) which essentially does a passive replay but which contains
<br />
triggers which will turn on an &quot;active&quot; machine if the inputs are not
<br />
what were recorded during the replay.  In this way he argues that the
<br />
machine does implement counterfactuals.  However when run in replay mode,
<br />
none of the counterfactual machinery gets activated, because in practice
<br />
the inputs are all given the correct values.  And his machine is so
<br />
simple in how it does the replay that the actual physical activity is
<br />
almost non-existent.  In this way he argues that the supervenience thesis
<br />
would find insufficient activity for consciousness, in contradiction to
<br />
the computationalist principle.
<br />
<br />I'm not sure I find Maudlin's argument persuasive even within the standard
<br />
framework, for a variety of reasons, but I won't go into that here.
<br />
My goal is to analyze it within the UDist framework.  In that case the
<br />
paradox or contradiction doesn't arise, because the only question is
<br />
the degree to which the structure of Maudlin's machine Olympia allows
<br />
for a short program that maps to the computational pattern C.  We can
<br />
first ignore the extra machinery for handling counterfactuals since
<br />
that is not an issue in the UDist approach.  For the rest, Maudlin
<br />
rearranges the program states and includes in Olympia a map from every
<br />
program state to some other program state, which will be an enormous map
<br />
for any actual conscious experience.  I suspect that the size of this
<br />
additional structure, and the way the states have been scrambled, will
<br />
complicate the program that has to do the translation somewhat, but that
<br />
it will still be possible to output C using a reasonably short program.
<br />
Therefore I would expect that his machine might not contribute quite
<br />
as much to the measure of C as a conventional machine would, but still
<br />
would contribute an appreciable measure.
<br />
<br />In any case, his machine certainly does not pose a challenge or paradox
<br />
for the UDist framework, since UDist is merely a recipe for how to
<br />
calculate a number, the measure of C.  All kinds of bizarre machines
<br />
might be imagined which would in some way relate to C, and still in
<br />
principle we could estimate out how much measure they would each add to C.
<br />
It seems that no paradox can arise from this type of analysis.
