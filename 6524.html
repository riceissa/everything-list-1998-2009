Man!  Talk about a full plate of new (and speculative) ideas.  I'm sure 
<br />
it would be if nothing else and interesting read.  I'll wait for the 
<br />
popular book (which I'm sure will come).  In the meantime, thanks for 
<br />
summarizing.
<br />
<br />One idea that was interesting (and I have thought myself), was whether 
<br />
some future super-civilization may be able to actually tinker with the 
<br />
laws of phyics, or otherwise influence events in a manner to cause the 
<br />
universe to collapse (if that is what they desired).

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I tried to read this paper, but it was 60 pages long and extremely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;technical, mostly over my head.  The gist of it was an updating of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Tipler's Omega Point theory, advanced in his book, The Physics of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Immortality.  Basically the OP theory predicts, based on the assumption
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that the laws of physics we know today are roughly correct, that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;universe must re-collapse in a special way that can't really happen
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;naturally, hence Tipler deduces that intelligent life will survive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;through and guide the ultimate collapse, during which time the information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;content of the universe will go to infinity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The new paper proposes an updated cosmological model that includes a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;number of new ideas.  One is that the fundamental laws of physics for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;universe are infinitely complex.  This is where his title comes from; he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;assumes that the universe is based on the mathematics of the continuum,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;i.e. the real numbers.  In fact Tipler argues that the universe must
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have infinitely complex laws, basing this surprising conclusion on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Lowenheim-Skolem paradox, which says that any set of finite axioms
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;can be fit to a mathematical object that is only countable in size.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Hence technically we can't really describe the real numbers without an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;infinite number of axioms, and therefore if the universe is truly based
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;on the reals, it must have laws of infinite complexity.  (Otherwise the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;laws would equally well describe a universe based only on the integers.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Another idea Tipler proposes is that under the MWI, different universes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in the multiverse will expand to different maximum sizes R before
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;re-collapsing.  The probability measure however works out to be higher
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with larger R, hence for any finite R the probability is 1 (i.e. certain)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that our universe will be bigger than that.  This is his solution to why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the universe appears to be flat - it's finite in size but very very big.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Although Tipler wants the laws to be infinitely complex, the physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;information content of the universe should be zero, he argues, at the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;time of the Big Bang (this is due to the Beckenstein Bound).  That means
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;among other things there are no particles back then, and so he proposes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a special field called an SU(2) gauge field which creates particles
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;as the universe expands.  He is able to sort of show that it would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;preferentially create matter instead of antimatter, and also that this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;field would be responsible for the cosmological constant which is being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observed, aka negative energy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In order for the universe to re-collapse as Tipler insists it must,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;due to his Omega Point theory, the CC must reverse sign eventually.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Tipler suggests that this will happen because life will choose to do so,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and that somehow people will find a way to reverse the particle-creation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;effect, catalyzing the destruction of particles in such a way as to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reverse the CC and cause the universe to begin to re-collapse.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Yes, he's definitely full of wild ideas here.  Another idea is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;particle masses should not have specific, arbitrary values as most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physicists believe, but rather they should take on a full range of values,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;from 0 to positive infinity, over the history of the universe.  There is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;some slight observational evidence for a time-based change in the fine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;structure constant alpha, and Tipler points to that to buttress his theory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;- however the actual measured value is inconsistent with other aspects,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;so he has to assume that the measurements are mistaken!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Another testable idea is that the cosmic microwave background radiation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is not the cooled-down EM radiation from the big bang, but instead is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;remnants of that SU(2) field which was responsible for particle creation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;He shows that such a field would look superficially like cooled down
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;photons, but it really is not.  In particular, the photons in this special
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;field would only interact with left handed electrons, not right handed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ones.  This would cause the photons to have less interaction with matter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in a way which should be measurable.  He uses this to solve the current
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;puzzle of high energy cosmic rays: such rays should not exist due to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interaction with microwave background photons.  Tipler's alternative does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not interact so well and so it would at least help to explain the problem.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Overall it is quite a mixed bag of exotic ideas that I don't think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physicists are going to find very convincing.  The idea of infinitely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;complex natural laws is going to be particularly off-putting, I would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;imagine.  However the idea that the cosmic microwave background interacts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;differently with matter than ordinary photons is an interesting one and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;might be worth investigating.  It doesn't have that much connection to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the rest of his theory, though.
