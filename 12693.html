<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the question of what is this &quot;non-thing&quot; entity called a &quot;person&quot;?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; By the way, the problem of evil that I am referring to is simply the

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; problem of the existence of evil.  We just know it exists.  We see
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; people treated as things. We know it is wrong.  The simple existence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of evil is a problem.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you don't believe in an omnipotent, benevolent God who orders the universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it isn't a problem.  It's just a consequence of different people having competing values.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />You are talking about a different &quot;problem of evil&quot; than I am.  You
<br />
are using the word &quot;problem&quot; in the sense of a logical contradiction.
<br />
I think you saw below that by &quot;the problem of evil&quot; I mean &quot;evil&quot;
<br />
itself.  It is something that is more direct and palpable, something
<br />
that requires a *person* to be conscious of its existence, rather than
<br />
just a mathematical processor cranking out a logical inference.  Evil
<br />
*is* the problem.
<br />
<br />At the risk of overkill, but I don't want to take any more chances,
<br />
let's take an analogy:  weeds on a lawn.  You are looking at the
<br />
classical &quot;problem of evil&quot; in the sense that if you believe that a
<br />
benevolent and all-powerful gardener is in charge of this lawn, then
<br />
(if you narrow the scope of all of the definitions enough) the
<br />
existence of weeds is a contradiction.  A mathematical processor could
<br />
infer that.  I'm just looking at the weeds themselves, independent of
<br />
any gardener, and saying, &quot;This is bad.&quot;  Being able to make that
<br />
judgment requires a person.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;I'm not talking about the wrongness of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; logical contradiction.  I'm talking about something that is even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;wronger than&quot; that.  When I talk about the problem of evil,  I'm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; talking about something that is *really* wrong, down at the core level
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of reality.  The reason that something defined by persons (such as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; person being treated as a &quot;non-person&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What it mean to treat a person as a non-person?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Even Kant's categorical imperative was not to treat a person *only* as a means.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's not evil to fail to ask your bank teller how they feel about cashing your check.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />This illustrates my point that the core of these problems and
<br />
questions is the essence of personhood.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;) can be &quot;really wrong&quot; at the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; deepest level is that the essence of a person is something that lies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; at the deepest level of reality.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's words or concepts that are defined by people.  What people judge as right or wrong seems far from &quot;basic reality&quot; since they so often disagree about it.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />This is my point.  Personhood is at the core of these concepts.  It is
<br />
irreducible (personhood, that is).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;This is why the &quot;problem of evil&quot; in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; general has been so hard to &quot;figure out&quot;.  It's because the very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; definition of the problem is illusive without defining what a person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is.  We try to define the problem by saying evil is a logical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; contradiction with whatever theory someone has, but this actually only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; proves even more how lost we are in figuring it out, and even more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; lost in solving it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; In the same way the &quot;meaning of life&quot; question on one hand seems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; nebulous and unuseful from a scientific viewpoint.  But it is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ultimate question.  We may ask, &quot;What is the meaning of the 'meaning
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of life'?&quot; But that just illustrates the meaning of the question
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; itself. Perhaps this is one of the attributes of a &quot;person&quot;, that we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; continually, recursively, as the question of meaning.  We just *know*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; what the meaning is of the question, &quot;What is the meaning of life?&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Thus, the essence of what a person is is key to this question, and key
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to the answer!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The trouble with &quot;the meaning of life&quot; question is that it implicitly assumes that life has some external referent that gives it meaning, the way &quot;grass&quot; is given a meaning by pointing to grass.  People who ask about the meaning of life usually want something like &quot;the purpose of my life&quot;, &quot;what goals should I pursue&quot;, etc.  Thus reformulated this has a simple answer, &quot;Whatever you want!&quot;.  The problem is that people want their lives to have purpose without providing it themselves.
</em><br />
<br />The question of &quot;the meaning of life&quot; I am referring to is deeper than
<br />
a &quot;what&quot; question.  It is a &quot;why&quot; question.  For instance, why is it
<br />
that a person is able to somehow create meaning?  At the core is the
<br />
essence of personhood.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Now when it comes to mathematical/logical systems, and Bruno's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; arguments, I think that we can see a &quot;type&quot;, or analogy, of what is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; going on here.  Through arguments that use things such as Church's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Thesis, diagonalization, the excluded middle, we can see that there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; are always some systems or sets which are provably not describable by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; other systems or sets.  I don't think this ultimately resolves the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; problem of evil or the meaning of life.  But I do think that it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; perhaps a &quot;picture&quot; of the limitlessness that is possible, even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; necessary.  It shows us the infinite proportions of these problems.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; They are intractable by human persons, and yet have at their core the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; essence of what a person is.
