Hi Russell,
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; BM: Exercice: why should we search a measure on the computational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; continuations and not just the computational states? Hint: with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; just the computational states only, COMP predicts white noise for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; all experiences. (ok Chris ?). With the continuations, a priori 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; we must just hunt away the 'white rabbit' continuations. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; You can also show that Schmidhuber's 'universal prior' solution 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  works only in the case the level of substitution
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is so low that my generalised brain is the entire multiverse.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;RS: Again, I do not know what you mean by this last comment.
</em><br />
<br />This is far from being an easy exercise. It is an ``exercice&quot;, not
<br />
because I think it is an easy homework, but because I do not need its
<br />
solution in the UDA (the proof that COMP -&gt; REVERSAL).
<br />
<br />Note that IF QM is correct, THEN we get (non constructively)
<br />
COMP -&gt; QM.
<br />
<br />The UDA shows ``only&quot; that we *must* extract the ``physical laws&quot; from
<br />
the computationnalist quantification (quantitative analysis) of the
<br />
comp-1-indeterminisme. But it does not tell us what really is the 
<br />
quantification's domain and how to compute it.
<br />
<br />And I believe it is a so difficult question that I have choosed to
<br />
approach it formally by substituting the folk psychology by the 
<br />
provability logics, searching for an arithmetical interpretation
<br />
of probability or credibility notion. The verifiable ``certainty&quot; of p
<br />
is modelized in that setting by []p &amp; &lt;&gt;p, and if p is DU-accessible
<br />
we get a sort of quantum logic, and this, I think, is promising.
<br />
<br />But it is also interesting to try to get an intuitive understanding
<br />
of the &quot;probability&quot; calculus, if only to make clear the relation
<br />
between Schmidhuber and me.
<br />
<br />In the course of doing this we will also discover a kind of apparent
<br />
objective weakness in my UDA reasoning. I have never try to hide that
<br />
weakness, but I have realize it is also unpedagogical to insist on
<br />
it too early. This weakness is not fatal for the UD Argument, but
<br />
is quasi-fatal for the hope of finding intuitively the
<br />
probabilities. Here again, that has motivated me for the modal
<br />
(more abstract) approach.
<br />
<br />Indeed. Remember the ``fundamental result&quot;: the way of quantifying
<br />
the (1) indeterminism is independent of the place, time and
<br />
the virtual/real nature of the reconstitution. The reason which has
<br />
been invoked is the first-person undistinguishability.
<br />
<br />Now let us consider again the thought experiment from the
<br />
renormalisation thread. I am in Brussels preparing myself for 
<br />
a multiplication experiment. After annihilation in Brussels I
<br />
will be reconstituted in ten *virtual environment*:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- one simulating perfectly Washington,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- the others simulating perfectly Moscow.
<br />
<br />I consider here virtual environments so that by comp 3-determinism
<br />
I can ensure that the 9 experiences of being in Moscow are 
<br />
completely identical, and thus first-person undistinguishable.
<br />
<br />Thus, if we take seriously first-person undistinguishability
<br />
we should consider equivalent the 1:9 multiplication experiment
<br />
described here with any 1:n multiplication experiments.
<br />
In that case P(M) = P(W) = 1/2.
<br />
In that case, with CUD, (there is a concrete running UD) we should
<br />
put the same weight on all ``compiler-equivalent&quot; computational states.
<br />
(Note that this equivalence is not so easy to define, but clearly
<br />
it entails that we must put the same weigth on all 1-steps
<br />
computational continuations of my brain state (I assume NEURO for
<br />
the sake of easyness). But remember the UD dovetails on the reals
<br />
(or the initial segment of the reals which is the same for the
<br />
1-person). So if my brain has n (binary, for easiness too) entries,
<br />
there will be 2^n such continuations, and so one: that means
<br />
that comp would entail white noise expectation for *any* 
<br />
experience in *any* experiment. 
<br />
That is not the case, so something is wrong with such equivalence.
<br />
So either comp is false or we must throw away this equivalence.
<br />
<br />As it appear in Mallah's reply, the idea is that we will take
<br />
into account more steps in the comp continuation. The idea
<br />
is to put weight, not on computational states but on
<br />
computational histories.
<br />
This move will lead us quickly toward comp-immortality
<br />
(contra Mallah, ironicaly enough!).
<br />
But how many steps make a computational history? And should we 
<br />
distinguish the equivalent one ? Surely we should if we keep
<br />
the first-person undistinguishability principle. But in that
<br />
case we will meet a new problem: with the first person possible
<br />
amnesy, the computational equivalence will make possible (cf GSLevy)
<br />
the merging (fusing) of computational histories, and this,
<br />
(although a good news for our hope about finding the comp
<br />
origin of the quantum laws) kill our hope to tackle the 
<br />
probabilities by pure intuition. But let us at least continue
<br />
our attempt.
<br />
<br />Let us go back to the question ``how many steps make a comput.
<br />
history?&quot;. The easiest answer is &quot;let us take all steps&quot;. So
<br />
a computation (modulo the compiler-equivalence) is just the whole
<br />
computation.
<br />
<br />Now, a platonist mathematician (unlike an intuitionist) will 
<br />
easily accept that there are two sort of computation:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- those which stops,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- those which never stops.
<br />
<br />So, relatively to a computational state X, (my Brussels' state
<br />
for example), there are computational continuations going through
<br />
X which stops, and the others which does not stop.
<br />
The stopping one can only be enumerable. The non stopping one are
<br />
at least as numerous as the reals.
<br />
So the stopping one can be eliminated from the probability
<br />
calculus. This is immortality with a revenge: we are immortal 
<br />
because we have 2^aleph_0 infinite futures and at most aleph_0
<br />
finite futures.
<br />
<br />But this is not enough. We should take into account more seriously
<br />
the nearness of computational histories, and this could depend
<br />
on Schmidhuber/Wei Dai Universal Prior (UP) of the roots (Wei Dai
<br />
little program) of the computations going through X. 
<br />
<br />In that case our probability formula becomes something like
<br />
<br />P(W) = P(W in y / conditionnalised by X :: UP(little 
<br />
program is an origin of X)). 
<br />
<br />Where ``::&quot; is still not defined, and y is one possible 
<br />
consistent infinite computation going
<br />
through the (actual) state X.
<br />
<br />The possible merging of the histories makes me feel that an
<br />
intuitive research of ``::&quot; is senseless, and personally
<br />
I have never been able to define it, and so I have decided
<br />
to interview the SRC UTM (and its guardian angels) itself. This
<br />
is possible thanks to the work of Boolos, Solovay, Goldblatt, etc.
<br />
<br />Only if my brain is the entire universe, my history is directly
<br />
defined with the UP of the little programs (Schmidhuber's solution).
<br />
<br />I see almost all this discussion-list as a search to define
<br />
the unknow relation ``::&quot; (oversimplifying a little bit).
<br />
I see it more and more as a search of making a good use
<br />
of both ASSA (based on the UP) and RSSA (taking the actual state
<br />
into account).
<br />
<br />Note also that there is something importantly true in the
<br />
saying (though vague as it is) of Higgo and Griffith.
<br />
Indeed it seems that an observer moment (the 1-person object on 
<br />
which the quantification of indeterminacy is done) is really
<br />
(with comp) a computational state *including* all computational
<br />
histories going through. It seems there is some kind of 
<br />
duality between ``observer moment&quot; and the sheaf of histories
<br />
(branching-bifurking sequence) going through the observer moments.
<br />
How to use that?
<br />
<br />With the modal logics, the observer-moment are the canonical
<br />
maximal consistent sets of formula for the logic Z1* (the
<br />
logic of []p&amp;&lt;&gt;p, p DU-accessible (or Sigma_1)).
<br />
That is very nice, because formally it gives a kind of
<br />
quantum logic. And here the duality between ``observer moment&quot;
<br />
and the sheaf of histories is akin to the ``Galois Connection
<br />
between theorie and models well known in logic.
<br />
But I'm still searching a semantics for Z1* for making that
<br />
duality and that Galois Connection genuinely useful.
<br />
