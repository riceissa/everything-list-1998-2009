<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I find this paradox a little disturbing, on further reflection. You enter

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the traffic by tossing a coin, so you are no more likely to end up in one

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lane than the other, and you would not, on average, benefit from changing

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lanes. Given that you are in every respect a typical driver, what applies to

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you should apply to everyone else as well. This SHOULD be equivalent to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; saying that if every driver decided to change lanes, on average no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particular driver would benefit - as Eric states. However, this is not so: 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the majority of drivers WOULD benefit from changing. (The fact that nobody 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would benefit if everyone changed does not resolve the paradox. We can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; restrict the problem to the case where each driver individually changes, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the paradox remains.) It seems that this problem is an assault on the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; foundations of probability and statistics, and I would really like to see it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; resolved.
</em><br />
<br />I found the answer of why you should be more likely
<br />
to enter in the crowded lane in this case. The answer
<br />
came after I tried to think about an example for few
<br />
people (which turned out not to work as I thought it
<br />
would)
<br />
<br />Suppose a coin is toss for N people, which enter one
<br />
of two rooms according to the result. Suppose first
<br />
N=3. Then it is more likely that I will be in
<br />
the crowded room, even though there was no particular
<br />
bias in each coin toss. But still, if I am given the
<br />
option to change, and if I am in the crowded room,
<br />
I'll probably still be in the crowded room after I
<br />
change!
<br />
<br />Now as N grows large, it is still more likely that I
<br />
will be in the crowded room, only it is less so. I was
<br />
neglecting the effect that you make yourself when you
<br />
enter the room/lane.
<br />
<br />When N is large and even, it is equally likely that the
<br />
lane I enter is slower/faster. But it may be that both
<br />
lanes have same numbers, so my entering will make that
<br />
lane be the slower, and that's where the effect comes
<br />
from.
<br />
<br />If it is odd, and I enter the fast lane, it is possible
<br />
that they become equal. If I enter the slower lane, it
<br />
will become even slower.
<br />
<br />A minute of thought shows that my changing lanes does not
<br />
affect the result, though, as much as changing rooms does
<br />
not make me more likely to be in the less crowded when
<br />
N=3.
<br />
<br />Therefore it is not a good advice for people to change
<br />
lanes in this case, even though it is more likely that
<br />
they are in the slower lane!
<br />
<br />Eric.
