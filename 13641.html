<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think I must be missing something profound in your intended meanings of:

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) 'out there'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) 'physically instantiating'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3) 'our world'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My current 'picture' of it is as follows.  The 'Platonic sense' I assume
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; equates to the 'bit-string plenitude' (which is differentiable from 'no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information' only by internal observers, like the Library of Babel - a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; beautiful idea BTW).  
</em><br />
<br />Its more actually &quot;out there in the Multiverse&quot;, rather than the
<br />
Plenitude, as the Multiverse is a necessary prerequisite of
<br />
observation. Its at least one level of emergence up from the bitstring
<br />
plenitude. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I'm assuming a 'hierarchy' of recursive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computational emergence through bits up through, say, strings, quarks,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; atoms, molecules, etc - in other words what is perceived as matter-energy by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observers.  I then assume that both 'physical objects' and any correlated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observers emerge from this matter-energy level, and that this co-emergence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; accomplishes the 'physical instantiation'.  
</em><br />
<br />Emergence is entirely a phenomenon of the observer. No observer, no
<br />
emergence. So I wouldn't really be calling it co-emergence.
<br />
<br />What must emerge from the physics is the perception of self, or
<br />
self-awareness. Whether this can be identified with consciousness is
<br />
rather a moot point, perhaps to be settled much later. Someone like
<br />
Hoftstadter with his strange loops would probably argue in favour of
<br />
this however. So would Dennett, if I read him correctly.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; IOW, the observer is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1-person view, and the physical behaviour the 3-person view, of the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; underlying complex emergent - they're different descriptions of the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; events.
</em><br />
<br />3rd person behaviour is that which is shared by all possible
<br />
observers. There is also first person plural phenomena, sharable
<br />
between multiple observers, but not necessarily all. Science, as we
<br />
practise it today, is strictly first person plural, though in
<br />
principle at least shared by all humans regardless of culture. Some of
<br />
physics, like quantum laws, and the conservation laws that arise from
<br />
point of view invariance is however a string candidate for being
<br />
called 3rd person.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If this is so, then as you say, the opening of the 'communication channel'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would be a matter of establishing the means and modes of interaction with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any new consciousness, because the same seamless underlying causal sequence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unites observer-world and physical-world: again, different descriptions,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; same events.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />OK - it seems you're talking about supervenience here.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If the above is accepted (but I'm beginning to suspect there's something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deeply wrong with it), then the 'stability' of the world of the observer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should equate to the 'stability' of the physical events to which it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; linked through *identity*. 
</em><br />
<br />This is where I get lost. Stability of the world has to do with
<br />
the necessary robustness property of observers, as I argue in section
<br />
4.2 of my book. I note also in that section that alternative proposals
<br />
exist as well.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now here's what puzzles me.  ISTM that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; imputation of 'computation' to the physical computer is only through the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; systematic correspondence of certain stable aspects of its (principally)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; electronic behaviour to computational elements: numbers,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical-logical operators, etc.  The problem is in the terms
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'imputation' and 'correspondence': this is surely merely a *way of speaking*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about the physical events in the computer, an arbitrary ascription, from an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; infinite possible set, of externally-established semantics to the intrinsic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical syntactics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />The attribution of computation is performed by the observer (otherwise
<br />
known as user) of the computer, as you say. The attribution of consciousness in
<br />
any processes can only be done by the conscious observer
<br />
erself. Attribution of consciousness in any non-self process can never
<br />
be definite, although it is typically useful to attribute a mind to
<br />
other processes in the environment to help reason about them (other
<br />
people, obviously, but also many of the more complicated animals, and
<br />
perhaps also to computers when they achieve a certain level of
<br />
sophistication). 
<br />
<br />But by accepting functionalism, we can even make stronger assertions -
<br />
processes that sufficiently accurately mimic conscious ones, must
<br />
therefore be conscious.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Consequently, ISTM that the emergence of observer-worlds has to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correlated (somehow) - one-to-one, or isomorphically - with corresponding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'physical' events: IOW these events, with their 'dual description',
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constitute a single 'distinguished' *causal* sequence.  By contrast, *any*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the myriad 'computational worlds' that could be ascribed to the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; events must remain - to the computer, rather than the programmer - only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arbitrary or 'imaginary' ones.  This is why I described them as 'nested' -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perhaps 'orthogonal' or 'imaginary' are better: they may - 'platonically' -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exist somewhere in the plenitude, but causally disconnected from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical world in which the computer participates. The computer doesn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'know' anything about them.  Consequently, how could they possess any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'communication channel' to the computer's - and our - world 'out there'?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />The conscious entity that the computer implements would know about
<br />
it. It is not imaginary to itself. And by choosing to interpret the
<br />
computer's program in that way, rather than say a tortured backgammon
<br />
playing program, we open a channel of communication with the
<br />
consciousness it implements.
<br />
<br />We've had some discussion here about whether rocks can be conscious or
<br />
not, which has some bearing on this topic.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course I'm not claiming by this that machines couldn't be conscious.  My
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; claim is rather that if they are, it couldn't be solely in virtue of any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'imaginary computational worlds' imputed to them, but rather because they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; support some unique, distinguished process of *physical* emergence that also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; corresponds to a unique observer-world: and of course, mutatis mutandis,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this must also apply to the 'mind-brain' relationship.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If I'm wrong (as no doubt I am), ISTM I must have erred in some step or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other of my logic above.  How do I debug it?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; David
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />OK - hopefully the above comments help. But in turn they probably need
<br />
to be &quot;debugged&quot;.
<br />
