<br />
I have been asked to compress my model so as to maximize its 
<br />
accessibility.  The following is an attempt to do so.  The result is rather 
<br />
cryptic and has little effort to &quot;prove&quot; anything.  It is frequently just 
<br />
an application of Occam's Razor.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BEGINNINGS
<br />
<br />Start with:
<br />
<br />1) Nothing - an empty finite consistent Formal Axiomatic System - an fc-FAS.
<br />
<br />2) Nothing is incomplete because it can not address the meaningful question 
<br />
of its own stability - it is an ifc-FAS.
<br />
<br />3) To address the incompleteness Nothing becomes Something.
<br />
<br />4) To address the question of the stability of Nothing, Something must have 
<br />
a bifurcation to implement the concept of &quot;Yes&quot; vs &quot;No&quot;, or &quot;True&quot; vs 
<br />
&quot;False&quot;, or &quot;Is&quot; vs &quot;Is Not&quot;, or affirmation vs negation. [As in &quot;Nothing 
<br />
is unstable.&quot; is a well formed statement Yes or No.]
<br />
<br />5) Something [in my view] takes the form of a growing, seething, foamy 
<br />
fractal of such bifurcations that are mathematically isomorphic to 1's and 
<br />
0's I call a superverse.
<br />
<br />6) Some [perhaps all] alignments by happenstance of these bifurcations 
<br />
within the Superverse are isomorphic to finite strings of N bits.
<br />
<br />7) Some such N bit strings are isomorphic to fc-FAS's.
<br />
<br />8) Some such fc-FAS are incomplete or ifc-FAS. [Open ended alignments?]
<br />
<br />9) Such ifc-FAS are composed of :
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) A finite theorem set [no more than 2^[N + c] as per AIT.]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Each theorem has a finite AIT complexity less than or equal to N + 
<br />
c bits
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and thus
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) A finite symbol set or alphabet.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) A finite set of axioms
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) A finite set of rules
<br />
<br />10) Some such ifc-FAS are isomorphic to mathematical objects U that are 
<br />
themselves isomorphic to universes.
<br />
<br />11) All such universes have physical realization.
<br />
<br />12) A low complexity class of such ifc-FAS have just one axiom.
<br />
<br />13) The proposal is that our physical universe is isomorphic to a 
<br />
mathematical object U that is described by an ifc-FAS in this class.  More 
<br />
precisely a currently realized physical configuration of the universe - a 
<br />
CRPC(i) is isomorphic to a current string configuration - a U(i) that is 
<br />
described by a currently expressed theorem of the ifc-FAS - a p(i).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MID STAGE DYNAMICS
<br />
<br />14) The only dynamic available in such a ifc-FAS is a recursive enumeration 
<br />
as follows:[viewing p(i) as an AIT shortest possible program]
<br />
<br />p(i) = {R acting on p(i - 1), PL(i)} will compute U(i) isomorphic to 
<br />
CRPC(i).
<br />
<br />where R is the rule set of the ifc-FAS, PL(i) is the self delimiter of AIT and
<br />
<br />p(1) = {R acting on [single axiom], PL(1)} will compute U(1) isomorphic to 
<br />
CRPC(1) and
<br />
<br />[single axiom] describes U(0) isomorphic to CRPC(0).
<br />
<br />15) Dynamic results so far:
<br />
<br />a) p(i) gets longer with each step of the recursion.
<br />
<br />b) Thus the information content of U(i) is higher than U(i - 1) isomorphic 
<br />
to the Second Law.
<br />
<br />16) The ifc-FAS as stated has a finite theorem set each with a finite 
<br />
amount of information. I think the simplest [perhaps only] isomorphic 
<br />
physical realization consistent with the above is a structure composed of 
<br />
discrete points.  The points are isomorphic through the mathematical object 
<br />
U to the alphabet of the ifc-FAS.
<br />
<br />17) At the moment we have a potential contradiction.  Successive U(i) have 
<br />
been shown to contain ever more information.  However, if the recursion is 
<br />
to stop with a theorem in the current ifc-FAS then this theorem must have 
<br />
no consequent other than itself when acted on by the rules.  We just 
<br />
described that theorem.  It is inherent in the rules and thus contains less 
<br />
information than any theorem in the recursion.  Wherein lies I believe the 
<br />
origin of much confusion over the origin and nature of the Second Law.  How 
<br />
to resolve this?  Well the ifc-FAS is incomplete and all that is necessary 
<br />
is to add ever more complex theorems to the ifc-FAS.  The easiest way to do 
<br />
this while preserving &quot;meaningfulness&quot; [history] across the event seems to 
<br />
be to increase the size of the alphabet - add more points.  This I call a 
<br />
perturbation of the ifc-FAS.
<br />
<br />18) The points would tend to form a structure because:
<br />
<br />a) They attract each other since the ifc-FAS would like to merge back into 
<br />
the Superverse as a destruction of the bifurcation alignment.
<br />
<br />b) They repel each other because if such fractures of alignments could take 
<br />
place it would destroy the assumed consistency of the ifc-FAS.  From the 
<br />
above the merger of two points  would sent the recursion back to some 
<br />
theorem that did not contain them from which step  it would then proceed 
<br />
down some other recursion.  Thus the ifc-FAS would have a mechanism that 
<br />
would allow the proof of both B and Not B from A - it would be inconsistent.
<br />
<br />19) The simplest dynamic structure that could contain SAS seems to me to be 
<br />
a 3 space in which the points are restricted to a fixed region of the 
<br />
structure.  The dynamic would entail some points following some pattern of 
<br />
relocations within their region - I call it a dance.  Some dances would 
<br />
have configurations that allowed them to move through the grid of 
<br />
points.  The simplest dances look like &quot;particles&quot;.  Thus the addition of 
<br />
points to incrementally resolve the incompleteness as a way of adding ever 
<br />
more complex theorems to the ifc-FAS would be [at least a small part of the 
<br />
perturbation] isomorphic to adding &quot;particles&quot; to the physical realization 
<br />
- that is produce quantum fluctuations.  SAS would be huge associations of 
<br />
dances - a super dance.
<br />
<br />20) Since the recursion steps need not take place in any fixed pattern 
<br />
&quot;time&quot; would be an illusion of SAS.
<br />
<br />21) &quot;Motion&quot; does not exist.  &quot;Forces&quot; would be an illusion.  Only 
<br />
quantified relocations of points upon a recursion step have physical 
<br />
realization.
<br />
<br />22) The system is naturally quantified and consistent with the postulates 
<br />
of relativity.  For developments of things like &quot;time&quot; dilation see my full 
<br />
draft at:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.connix.com/~hjr/model01.html">http://www.connix.com/~hjr/model01.html</a>
<br />
<br /><br />23) Due to the perturbations it is discontinuously computational i.e. non 
<br />
deterministic.
<br />
<br />24) Right now the most interesting candidate I have found for a point 
<br />
structure possibly yielding our universe is face centered cubic - again see 
<br />
my full draft.
<br />
<br />25) Some super dances may have to seek out and absorb other dances in order 
<br />
to maintain their structure.  Due to the inherent quantification of the 
<br />
system dances influence the gird over a limited range.  This process 
<br />
therefore requires levels of blind seeking - choices of alternates based on 
<br />
incomplete information.  Such choices can be based on a coupling to the 
<br />
perturbations as a source of randomness.  Thus my definition of life as 
<br />
being such super dances.
<br />
<br />26) This is applied to institutions by looking at how such super dances 
<br />
create rule sets.  Again see my full draft.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;END POINT DYNAMICS
<br />
<br />27) Looking at Turing's use of Cantor's diagonal argument I believe that 
<br />
when the FAS finally gets to be countably infinite it is as big as it can 
<br />
get - it is complete.  However, there is in general still no decision 
<br />
procedure so it must now be inconsistent.  This allows the previously 
<br />
forbidden merger of points and the alignment melts back into the superverse.
