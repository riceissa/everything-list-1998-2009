<br /><br /><br /><br />CANTOR'S FIRST RESULT
<br />
<br />There is NO bijection between N and N^N  (N^N is the set of functions  
<br />
from N to N. N = (0, 1, 2,  ...}
<br />
<br />Proof
<br />
<br />1) preliminaries
<br />
<br />Like for the irrationality of the square root of 2, we will proceed by  
<br />
a reduction to an absurdity.
<br />
<br />First note that there are many obvious injection (= one-one function)  
<br />
from N to N^N. For example the function which sends the number n on  
<br />
the constant function from N to N which send all numbers to n:
<br />
<br />0 ======&gt;  {(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0) ....}
<br />
1 ======&gt;  {(0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1) ....}
<br />
2  ======&gt; {(0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2) ....}
<br />
3 ...
<br />
...
<br />
<br />Such correspondence is one-one: two different numbers are send to two  
<br />
different functions from N to N. OK?
<br />
<br />With Cantor, inspired by what happens in the case of finite sets,  I  
<br />
will say that the cardinal of A is little or equal (â‰¤) than the  
<br />
cardinal of B, when A and B are infinite sets, when there is a one-one  
<br />
function, also called injection, from A to B.
<br />
<br />The injection described in the diagram above shows that the cardinal  
<br />
of N is little or equal than the cardinal of N^N.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I will say that the cardinal of A is equal to the cardinal of B when  
<br />
there is a bijection between the two sets.
<br />
<br />I will also use the canonical bijection between the set of functions  
<br />
from N to N  and the set of infinite sequences of numbers, to write  
<br />
any function from N to N, as a sequence of numbers. This will make the  
<br />
things more readable.
<br />
<br />The diagram above becomes:
<br />
<br />0 ======&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...
<br />
1 ======&gt; 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, ...
<br />
2 ======&gt; 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, ...
<br />
etc.
<br />
<br />OK?
<br />
<br />We can do that because we have all in mind the canonical order of the  
<br />
natural numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, .... so that the sequence of numbers can  
<br />
be seen a short way to describe a function from N to N.
<br />
<br />2) the proof
<br />
<br />Let us do the Cantor's reduction to the absurd.
<br />
<br />Suppose there is a bijection from N to N^N.  It will have some shape  
<br />
like:
<br />
<br />0 =====&gt; 34,  6,  678,  0,  6, 77,  8,  9, 39,  67009, ...
<br />
1 =====&gt;   0, 677, 901, 1, 67, 8, 768765, 56, 9, 9, ...
<br />
2 =====&gt;   1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, ...
<br />
3 =====&gt;   2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, ...
<br />
4 =====&gt;  1, 1, 2, 3, 6, 24, 120, 720, 5040, 40320, ...
<br />
5 =====&gt;  0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, ...
<br />
...
<br />
<br />May be you recognize some functions in the correspondence. The first  
<br />
two functions seems arbitrary. The third one seems to be the power of  
<br />
two, the fourth one is the constant function sending all numbers on 2,  
<br />
the fifth one seems to be the factorial functions, the sixth one seems  
<br />
to be an arbitrary function from N to {0, 1}.  From such finite set of  
<br />
data we can never be sure, given that the &quot;...&quot; could in this context  
<br />
mean practically anything.
<br />
<br />BUT, if there is a bijection between N and N^N, the correspondence is  
<br />
well defined, at least in Platonia, or in the mind of God. This means  
<br />
that each line must be thought as representing *some*, perhaps  
<br />
unknown, precise function. In particular, all numbers, including the  
<br />
double infinity of numbers that we have not represented, are well  
<br />
defined, perhaps unknown by us, numbers.
<br />
<br />But then, Cantor reasons, if the whole diagram above makes some sense,  
<br />
it is easy to conceive a NEW function, which can be shown not  
<br />
belonging to the diagram. That is there will be a function from N to N  
<br />
which is not represented at any line of the above diagram.
<br />
Indeed the following sequence will play that role:
<br />
<br />35,  678, 5, 3, 7, 1, ...
<br />
<br />Do you see where it comes from? It comes from the diagonal elements,  
<br />
from up-left to down-right, with one added to them:
<br />
<br />34+1, 677+1, 4+1, 2+1, 6+1, 0+1, ...
<br />
<br />Why does such sequence not belong to the diagram? Because it differs  
<br />
from the first sequence for the first output. Indeed the first output  
<br />
at the first line is 34, and the new function outputs 35. It differs  
<br />
from the second sequence at the second outputs. Indeed the second  
<br />
output of the second sequence is 677, and the second output of the new  
<br />
sequence is 678, etc. So, by construction, the new function differs  
<br />
from all the sequence in the list above. We proceed diagonally to be  
<br />
sure that by changing a function, we don't come back on some  
<br />
distinction already introduced.
<br />
<br />All the function being well defined, in Platonia, or in God's eyes (or  
<br />
in the eye of some omniscient being), automatically the new sequence  
<br />
is well defined too, and cannot belong to the sequence. Thus we get a  
<br />
contradiction. If the correspondence above is a bijection, then if  
<br />
fails as being a bijection.
<br />
<br />This reasoning did not depend on the choice of the supposed bijection.  
<br />
All possible bijections will fail, because for each one, their very  
<br />
existence makes them failed to be a bijection, because again their  
<br />
very existence entails the existence of the &quot;diagonal sequence&quot;, which  
<br />
by construction differs from each line of the correspondence. Indeed,  
<br />
you should see that they differ at the intersection of the diagonal  
<br />
and the line.  End of the proof.
<br />
<br />OK?
<br />
<br />3) Miscellaneous remarks, vocabulary.
<br />
<br />When Cantor discovered this, he was in shock. He said the famous  
<br />
sentence: &quot;I see it, but I don't believe it&quot;. His technic is know as  
<br />
the diagonalization (with a &quot;z&quot; or a &quot;s&quot; according to americans or  
<br />
english respective common uses).
<br />
<br />Is that proof 100% convincing?
<br />
<br />I let you judge by yourself. If you say yes, it means you could be  
<br />
realist on the notion of set. Torgny Tholerus has already send to the  
<br />
list, some month ago, an argument which can throw some doubt about  
<br />
such a reasoning. But I want to avoid such premature discussion. Why?
<br />
<br />Because I don't want you to redo the whole big set of discoveries, and  
<br />
mathematical constructions which have been inspired by Cantor's proof,  
<br />
and focus instead on what will become the 'discovery of the universal  
<br />
machine'.
<br />
<br />I let you know that this proof, that is Cantor's reasoning showing  
<br />
that there is no bijection between N and N^N, *can* be done without  
<br />
change in the context of formal axiomatic set theory (like Zermelo  
<br />
Fraenkel set theory). Such impossibility theorem is thus well accepted  
<br />
by classical mathematicians. Now, the discovery of the universal  
<br />
machine will come from a very similar reasoning, in a different  
<br />
context, and Torgny Tholerus' remark, for those who remembers it,  
<br />
cannot be applied, even without formal set theory.
<br />
<br />The biggest objection here would be that Cantor's proof invoke the  
<br />
name of God. Cantor will take that objection very seriously and he  
<br />
will literally ask the advice of the pope (!) to proceed. The  
<br />
formalization of set theory can hide a little bit that invocation, but  
<br />
eventually our diagonalization in the comp frame, will not invoke God  
<br />
or any omniscient being. We will of course come back on this.
<br />
<br />Accepting Cantor's proof, we know that the cardinal of N^N is bigger  
<br />
than the cardinal of N. So there are infinities 'bigger' than other  
<br />
infinities.
<br />
<br />Definition: we will say that a set S is enumerable if S is finite or  
<br />
if there is a bijection between S and N. We will say that an  
<br />
*infinite* set S is non enumerable if there is NO bijection between S  
<br />
and N. We can sum up Cantor's result by:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;N^N is non enumerable.
<br />
<br />Exercise (using 02 for the set {0, 1})
<br />
1) Does this prove that 2^N is not enumerable?
<br />
2) In case you answer &quot;no&quot; to the first question, can you prove that  
<br />
2^N is not enumerable?
<br />
<br />OK?
<br />
<br />I let you think and ask question if necessary.
<br />
<br />Next post: I will do again that very proof, but in a way which is  
<br />
somehow clearer, by using better notations (yet a bit more abstract,  
<br />
so that it is clearer only for those who are not afraid by math  
<br />
notations). I don't want to mix the two difficulties (new concept/new  
<br />
notations), in a first approach. In some sequel, I will give you the  
<br />
proof of what is known as Cantor's theorem: that the cardinal of a  
<br />
powerset 2^A is always bigger than the cardinal of the set A. But this  
<br />
is not needed for our computationalist purpose, so I will not insist  
<br />
on that. From this we get a ladder of bigger and bigger infinities.
<br />
<br />A last remark for Mirek, and those who remember what I said about the  
<br />
ordinals (which I have illustrated with the growing functions, some  
<br />
years ago). Mirek, to ensure that cardinals are ordinals, I would need  
<br />
the axiom of choice. But I will never use that, some I will not try to  
<br />
put the cardinals among the ordinals.
<br />
<br />Best,
<br />
<br />Bruno
