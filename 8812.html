&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a layperson who reads these discussions out of avid interest, and I
<br />
hope that someone will answer a question that I would like to ask in order
<br />
to enhance my own understanding.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an emphasis on AI running through these discussions, yet you
<br />
seem to delve into very philosophical questions.  Are the philosophical
<br />
discussions applicable to the development of AI (i.e., trying to grasp all
<br />
aspects of the mind of man if you are trying to develop a true copy), or are
<br />
they only interesting diversions that pop-up from time to time.  My thanks
<br />
to anyone who wishes to respond.
<br />
<br />Jeanne Houston

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; My belief is that in matters of faith, you can choose to believe or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; not believe based on whether it suits your personal preferences.  Your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; example of the Nazis  would not apply because there is overwhelming
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; evidence that the Nazis existed.  Perhaps it can be argued that there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; is meaningful evidence that the God described in Sunday school class
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; exists as well, however I don't think anyone would argue that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; evidence for that God is nearly as strong as evidence of the Nazis.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; As you say, religion, by necessity, is based on faith and therefore
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; little to no objective evidence.  I guess your point was that if you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; already have the faith in something without evidence, the fact that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; you are then taught as part of the belief system that there are some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; aspects not very appealing should not have any bearing on whether you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; still have your faith?  I would disagree with that in that you can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; have faith in something because the concept is attractive to you, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; then lose your faith when the concept is shown to be less attractive.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; (this was not really my situation as a child- I was never really
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; presented the opportunity to examine the faith until presented with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; the teachings described in the original post).  This is not entirely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; unrelated to the sciences.  Science has pushed into many areas into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; realms that can only tangentially, at best, be proven with objective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; evidence.  The MWI is a good example.  I believe in it, because I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; think it provides the most explanatory power over competing ideas.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; However, it would be difficult to fault someone for demanding more in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; the way of direct evidence.  In a sense, there is an element of faith
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; in such theories.  String theory is another example.  I'm not saying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; these things are not science, just that they are theories beyond our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; reach to prove or disprove at the present time.  Many scientists are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; quoted as endorsing string theory in part due to the elegance of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; theory.  This goes with what I was saying above about accepting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; something on faith as long as it appears to be the most attractive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; idea, even if it is not supported by much objective evidence.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; I doubt the beliefs of fundementalist Christianity will ever be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; absolutely proven or disproven, and as a faith belief I reserve the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; right to discard it at my choosing!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I think you are referring to that aspect of belief which has little to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; do with whether or not the belief is in accordance with reality. This is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; very common in everyday life, but it is also probably common in science
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; or other supposedly objective fields of enquiry. One could even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; speculate that having &quot;faith&quot; in a scientific theory in its nascent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; phase - that is, believing it to be true with greater certainty than the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; available evidence warrants - is important in motivating the theorist to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; do the experimental work which will ultimately validate the theory to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the satisfaction of the rest of the scientific community. This is fine,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; as long as we are clear that there is a distinction between the utility
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of a belief and the truth value of that belief. An interesting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; illustration of this distinction in philosophy of religion is &quot;Pascal's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Wager&quot;. Pascal aknowledged that it is not possible to decide with any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; certainty whether God exists, but continued to ask the question, should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; we believe that God exists? If we believe that he does and it turns out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that we are right, we gain eternal life in Heaven, while if it turns out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; we are wrong, we gain or lose nothing as a result of our false belief.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; On the other hand, if we declare ourselves atheists and are right, we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; gain or lose nothing, but if we are wrong, we end up in Hell. Therefore,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; we are better off believing that God does exist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The problem with almost all people with fundamentalist-type religious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; convictions that I have met, however, is that they are not as honest as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Pascal was. They claim that their belief is certainly or almost
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; certainly correct, and that it is based on empirical evidence, such as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the historical record contained in the Bible. Pressed further, they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; might describe &quot;faith&quot; as a kind of religious experience which allows no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; more doubt about the existence of God than ordinary sensory experience
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; allows doubt about the existence of the world - &quot;and if you had this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; experience, you would understand&quot;. If I suggest to them that they only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; believe because they were brought up that way, or because they want it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to be true (and I think these two reasons account for the vast majority
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of people with religious belief in the world), they deny this
</em><br />
vehemently.
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Returning to the point in my original post, I should have clarified it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; by saying that when it comes to the *truth* value of a belief, our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; attitude towards that belief is irrelevant. If some far future historian
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; studying the legend of the Nazis in the 20th century decides that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; legend is true simply because it would further his career if it were
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; true, he would deserve the contempt of his peers. If the evidence does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; not allow a conclusion one way or the other, the correct answer is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the evidence does not allow a conclusion one way or the other; it is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a license to choose whatever conclusion takes your fancy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; [Incidently, can you see the logical flaw in Pascal's Wager as described
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; above?]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Stathis Papaioannou
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I largely agree with Stathis.  I note a subtle difference in language
</em><br />
between
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Danny and Stathis.  Danny refers to &quot;believe in&quot;.  I don't think a
</em><br />
scientist
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ever &quot;believes in&quot; a theory.  That implies taking the theory as the
</em><br />
foundation
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of all further beliefs.  In fact most scientists don't &quot;believe&quot; any
</em><br />
theory,
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; except in the provisional sense of thinking them likely, or worth
</em><br />
entertaining,
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or suggestive.  Religious faith differs from ordinary belief and
</em><br />
scientific
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hypothesizing not only by the lack of evidence but even more in the
</em><br />
assertion of
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certainity.
