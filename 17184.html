<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You're doing it again. You are assuming that because the mental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is epistemically certain, it is ipso facto ontologically basic. But
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doesn't follow at all. I have evidence that the physical is basic --
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the whole
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of science. You have no evidence that the mental is basic because the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does not reveal its own ontological nature. All you have is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; **epistemic*** claim
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the mental definitely exists, in some sense.
</em><br />
<br />The unique feature of consciousness is not - as you claim - its
<br />
'epistemic' certainty, but its status as what is *ontologically
<br />
certain*.  To regard consciousness itself (or in Bruno's terms the
<br />
ontological first person) as merely the object of 'knowledge' is to
<br />
commit the fallacy of taking 'observation' in a naively literal sense:
<br />
i.e. to require there to be an 'observer'.  But this, self-evidently,
<br />
can only lead to infinite regress.  Consequently, consciousness does
<br />
not consist in the 'observation' of epistemic entities, but in their
<br />
instantiation.  Consciousness is, as it were, the 'ontology of
<br />
epistemology'.  When you say that the physical is basic, you are
<br />
yourself mistaking the epistemological for the ontological.  As to
<br />
your evidence consisting in 'the whole of science', since the nature
<br />
and significance of this evidence is precisely what is in question, it
<br />
is inadequate merely to make such appeals to authority.  It would be
<br />
more helpful if you would address these arguments in their own terms,
<br />
rather than begging various questions by appeal to 'pre-established
<br />
fact', or tilting at straw men of your own making.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; But you haven't said what the problem is in the emergence of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; mental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; from the physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; On the contrary, I've said it repeatedly.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Please say it again.
</em><br />
<br />The problem is this: in the face of one indubitable ontology - that
<br />
exemplified in consciousness - you try get physically-basic ontology
<br />
for free.  In other words, you simply assume that if we take ourselves
<br />
to 'be' - what? - say, neural activity in 'computational' - or some
<br />
yet-to-be-established  - guise, then - pouf! - the ontological first
<br />
person is conjured from mere description.  But there is no sense in
<br />
which one can simply 'be' an epistemic 'object' - a theoretical
<br />
construction. *This* is the explanatory gap, and you are trying to
<br />
jump it by this customary, well-worn sleight-of-intuition.  But it is
<br />
precisely this bit of magic that is in question.  And in my view the
<br />
right place to start questioning is the direction of inference, as
<br />
I've - repeatedly - said.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You still haven't said what the objection is to saying that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the mental emerges from the physical.
</em><br />
<br />I'm saying that all that can 'emerge' from one class of description is
<br />
another class of description.  If that exhausts your idea of the
<br />
'mental' I say you are an eliminativist.  But you say you're not.
<br />
What then?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Assuming (without justification) that anything can arbitrarily be said
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any function. That is an argument you have made elsewhere, it is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a particularly good argument, and it is not germane to this discussion
</em><br />
<br />This is a straw man of your own construction.  My argument does not
<br />
consist in the claim that 'anything can arbitrarily be said to have
<br />
any function'.  What I'm criticising, quite specifically, is the claim
<br />
that the self-evidently existent category of the ontological first
<br />
person is equivalent to a particular class of  arrangements of
<br />
ontologically-basic-in-their-own-right physical entities.  This, I
<br />
take it, can be construed only as a particularly odd form of dualism,
<br />
or eliminativism.   The 'arbitrariness' is inherent in the burden of
<br />
the term 'functionalism', which is intrinsically neutral as to the
<br />
details of physical implementation.  This is its great strength in its
<br />
legitimate sphere of application, and its fatal weakness in the
<br />
present context.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;But then one must
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; abjure functional-computational justifications for the 'mental':
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; again, fair enough (it's probably closer to my own prejudice).  But
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; unless you're an eliminativist about the mental, you can't have it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; both ways.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course you can! There are plenty accounts of the mental that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are neither functionalist nor elimintativist. Sheesh.
</em><br />
<br />Yes of course there are other accounts, but my argument at this point
<br />
is specifically against functionalist accounts based on an assumed
<br />
physical ontology.  So I repeat: the burden of my claim is that if you
<br />
want to be ontological about the physical, you must give up
<br />
functionalist arguments for mind; otherwise you are an implicit
<br />
dualist, or else an eliminativist, even though you may be unaware of
<br />
it (as indeed an eliminativist would have to be!)  You may of course
<br />
disagree, but saying 'of course you can' is not an argument.  Beyond
<br />
that, I'm not arguing here against other accounts of the mental,
<br />
though you don't indicate what you have in mind (as it were)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But I think we can save them quite handily.  First, calling something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'idealism' just pumps the intuition that there have to be sort of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; bright images everywhere independent of 'minds'.  The problem here is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that we're stuck with folk vocabulary that drags in extraneous notions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; left, right and centre causing an implosion of the imagination.  We
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; need to fix this, and I have a couple of suggestions.  The first was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; in my reply to Rex, where I suggest, in answer to your implicit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; question above, that the universe has to take things just as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; personally as it needs to exist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why, for heaven's sake? That seems completely arbitrary.
</em><br />
<br />Perhaps you could try a little harder to go beyond the vocabulary (I'm
<br />
sorry if this seems impolite, I don't intend it to be).  As I've said,
<br />
virtually every term we use has been used by someone else to mean
<br />
something different.  The use of the term 'personal' in this context,
<br />
as I've tried to explain, is to carry the sense that what 'exists' is
<br />
always, as it were, incipiently personal or 'owned'.  This is, I
<br />
believe, not crude idealism, but in fact the crucial prerequisite for
<br />
any intuition as to how the 'ownership' of consciousness could be
<br />
conceived to emerge from something in some sense more fundamental, but
<br />
nonetheless categorically congruent.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; This leads to the second suggestion: what we call 'mind' is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; evolved capacity for representation, memory and intention directed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; towards an environment, resulting from selected-for elaborations of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; primitive but critically-similar potentials.  Of course, this is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; standard direction of any explanatory thrust, but with the critical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; stipulation that we must be able to preserve the appearances from soup
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to nuts: this is, as you point out, the nub.  Again, I don't insist on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; any particular vocabulary, only the necessary sense.  As Popper
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; remarks, debate about words is futile - just clarify your terms until
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the problem emerges precisely, or goes away.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Repeating that we need to save the appearances does nothing to save
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them
</em><br />
<br />Patience.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Of the above factors, the one that bears, I think, most on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'appearance of mindlessness', is memory (a point made by Russell in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; his neutral monist guise).  Essentially, we're 'conscious' of what we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; can remember - this is inherent in the sense of re-presentation.  So
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; it may not in fact meet the case to hold that we're 'unaware' of what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; we don't remember so well, but rather that 'primitive' awareness is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; swamped in our memory by repeated re-presentation of dominant
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; higher-order themes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You cannot derive an &quot;is true&quot; from a &quot;might be true&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />No, of course not.  But your mind seemed to be boggled by the idea
<br />
that the fundamental 'personalisation' of the universe must
<br />
necessarily manifest with a very different appearance to that which is
<br />
in evidence.  I'm merely trying to apply a little massage to the
<br />
intuition that this doesn't have to be so.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You have no need to struggle to come up with a panpsychist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory,
</em><br />
<br />I don't have a 'panpsychist' theory.  Rather, I've made some general
<br />
arguments relating to the various senses of the term 'to exist' with
<br />
which I hope to give a shove to intuitions that have perhaps become
<br />
too stuck in one groove
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; since you have no valid objection to physicalism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Your argument so far has been based on two dubious premises --
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that eliminativism and functonalism are the only physicalist options,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and that functionalism is arbitrary and in-the-eye-of-beholder.
</em><br />
<br />Again, calling them 'dubious' is not an argument (as you correctly
<br />
pointed out when I lazily resorted to 'specious').  AFAICS you have
<br />
not independently argued for their dubiousness, but instead have
<br />
gestured towards 'well-established' positions.  Furthermore, I haven't
<br />
at all claimed that they are the *only* physicalist options, I've
<br />
simply attacked these specific positions where they are resorted to.
<br />
If you are prepared to confront what has actually been said,
<br />
specifically and point for point, we may make progress, but otherwise
<br />
I fear we shan''t get much further.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Cart before the horse:

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Why should anyone believe in an ontological gap that isn't backed by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; an explanatory gap?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Why indeed?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; Weren't you arguing for one?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The mere existence of the mental implies nothing whatsoever
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; about any dualism any more than the simultaneous existence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of cabbages and kings.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Well, I don't disagree with that, although I'm not quite sure what you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; intend by the dismissive 'mere'.  Our disagreements haven't usually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; been about the necessity of dualism, which I think we both abjure, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; rather whether mind is an abstraction from from matter or vice versa.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I'm not sure we'll ever agree on that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Dualism requires an ontological divide--not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; a mere difference of kind--and an ontological divide requires
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; explanatory irreducibility.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Couldn't agree more.  However, my starting point is that the existence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of the mental (not to struggle over terminology) is indubitable, which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; makes the direction of abstraction mandatory if we want to save
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; monism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; That doesn't follow at all. The epistemic fact that we are more sure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; of A than B doesn't imply any metaphysical fact that B is reducible to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; A rather
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; than vice versa. The epistemic arrow and the metaphysical arrow are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; two different arrows. Since we are macroscopic, we are constructed to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; better access to high-level phenomena such as chairs and rocks than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; fundamental particles that comprise them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Unless one denies reality to the mental (i.e. eliminativism)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I'm saying that further insistence on a material ontology in the usual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; sense is an implicit commitment to dualism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; THat doesn't follow either. For dualism you need materalism AND the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; mental AND an unbridgeable gap. You keep leaving the gap out.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Specious relationship
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; terms such as 'functional equivalence', 'identical to', 'inside of'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and the like just mask this, IMO, and under examination can be seen to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; imply two-ness, not one-ness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; Those positions have thei critics, but calling them
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; 'specious' is not criticism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;  Further, in addition to its obvious (at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; least to me) merit of 'saving the appearances',
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; Idealism does not save appearances. It cannot explain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; how there was a mindless universe for millions of years before
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; life evolved, for instance. Idealists usually have to flatly deny that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; particular
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; appearance.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; this narrative seems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to serve the rest of the story at least as handily as the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; 'externalised reality' version.  But I don't imagine we'll ever agree
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; on this either.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; BTW, perhaps I should clarify what I mean by 'the usual sense' of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; materialism, because it may be that this is part of any confusion.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; This sense is, I take it, the doctrine that reality is 'nothing but'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the material.  Stating it this way of course commits you, under
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; monism, to a purely abstract conception of the mental.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; I am not sure what you mean by abstract. Since the mental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; is uncontroversially not a fundamental item in physics. it has to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; higher-level
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; or emergent in some way, like shoes and ships and sealing-wax.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; But you haven't said what the problem is in the emergence of the
</em><br />
