I agree with everything you say in this post, but I am not sure that 
<br />
settles the issue. It does not change my mind on the preceding post 
<br />
where we were disagreeing; which was that IF I must choose between
<br />
<br />A) splitted between 10000 finite hells and 1 infinite paradise
<br />
B) Splitted between 1 infinite hell and 10000 finite paradises
<br />
<br />where &quot;finite&quot; and &quot;infinite&quot; refer to the number of computational 
<br />
steps simulating the stories of thoise hells and paradises, THEN I 
<br />
should choose A.
<br />
This is because all finite stories have a measure &quot;0&quot;. Infinite 
<br />
stories, by their &quot;natural&quot; DU multiplications will have a measure one.
<br />
<br />But we are on the verge of inconsistency, because in practice there is 
<br />
no way to garantie anything like the finiteness of any computation 
<br />
going through our states (this is akin to the insolubility of the 
<br />
self-stopping problem by sufficiently rich (lobian) turing machine).
<br />
<br />The idea that I try to convey is that if I am in state S1, the 
<br />
probability of some next state S2 depends on the proportion, among the 
<br />
infinite stories going through S1 of those *infinite* stories going 
<br />
also through S2. And all finite stories must be discounted.
<br />
<br />(It is not necessary I remain &quot;personally&quot; immortal in those infinite 
<br />
stories, the measure is given by the stories going through my states 
<br />
even if I have a finite 3-life-time in all of those stories).
<br />
<br />(btw, this entails also that comp implies at least infinite past and/or 
<br />
future for any universes supporting our present story).
<br />
<br />[Note that here I am going far ahead of what I can ask to the lobian 
<br />
machine, because our talk involves quantifiers on stories and that's 
<br />
very complex to handle. Well, to be sure I have till now only been able 
<br />
to translate the case of &quot;probability one&quot;, in machine term; but it is 
<br />
enough to extract non trivial information on the logic of &quot;observable&quot; 
<br />
proposition.]

<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have been arguing in recent posts that the absolute measure of an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer moment (or observer, if you prefer) makes no possible 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; difference at the first person level. A counterargument has been that, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even if an observer cannot know how many instantiations of him are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being run, it is still important in principle to take the absolute 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure into account, for example when considering the total amount of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suffering in the world. The following thought experiment shows how, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; counterintuitively, sticking to this principle may actually be doing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the victims a disservice:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You are one of 10 copies who are being tortured. The copies are all 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being run in lockstep with each other, as would occur if 10 identical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computers were running 10 identical sentient programs. Assume that the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; torture is so bad that death is preferable, and so bad that escaping 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it with your life is only marginally preferable to escaping it by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dying (eg., given the option of a 50% chance of dying or a 49% chance 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of escaping the torture and living, you would take the 50%). The 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; torture will continue for a year, but you are allowed one of 3 choices 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as to how things will proceed:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (a) 9 of the 10 copies will be chosen at random and painlessly killed, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; while the remaining copy will continue to be tortured.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (b) For one minute, the torture will cease and the number of copies 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will increase to 10^100. Once the minute is up, the number of copies 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will be reduced to 10 again and the torture will resume as before.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (c) the torture will be stopped for 8 randomly chosen copies, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; continue for the other 2.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Which would you choose? To me, it seems clear that there is an 80% 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; chance of escaping the torture if you pick (c), while with (a) it is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certain that the torture will continue, and with (b) it is certain 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the torture will continue with only one minute of respite.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Are there other ways to look at the choices? It might be argued that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in (a) there is a 90% chance that you will be one of the copies who is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; killed, and thus a 90% chance that you will escape the torture, better 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than your chances in (c). However, even if you are one of the ones 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; killed, this does not help you at all. If there is a successor 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer moment at the moment of death, subjectively, your 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness will continue. The successor OM in this case comes from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the one remaining copy who is being tortured, hence guaranteeing that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you will continue to suffer.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What about looking at it from an altruistic rather than selfish 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; viewpoint: isn't it is better to decrease the total suffering in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world by 90% as in (a) rather than by 80% as in (c)? Before making 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; plans to decrease suffering, ask the victims. All 10 copies will plead 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with you to choose (c).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What about (b)? ASSA enthusiasts might argue that with this choice, an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OM sampled randomly from the set of all possible OM's will almost 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certainly be from the one minute torture-free interval. What would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this mean for the victims? If you interview each of the 10 copies 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; before the minute starts, they will tell you that they are currently 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being tortured and they expect that they will get one minute respite, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then start suffering again, so they wish the choice had been (c). 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Next, if you interview each of the 10^100 copies they will tell you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the torture has stopped for exactly one minute by the torture 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; chambre's clock, but they know that it is going to start again and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they wish you had chosen (c). Finally, if you interview each of the 10 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; copies for whom the torture has recommenced, they will report that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they remember the minute of respite, but that's no good to them now, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and they wish you had chosen (c).
