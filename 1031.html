<em class="quotelev1">&gt; eyes and has feelings and beliefs (I can tell you what some of

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them are), and so was my teddy bear when I thought about it a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certain way.
</em><br />
<br />I think that this is not only basically wrong, it is fundamentally
<br />
useless.  I agree that it is often not useful to talk about 
<br />
consciousness as an objective fact, and we have seen where the
<br />
distinction can be blurred by replay-type devices or HLUTs.  But
<br />
even the reflective aspects of self-consciousness are, IMO, 
<br />
produced by some process - and I find computation to be a compelling
<br />
hypothesis.  
<br />
<br />A teddy bear or printed words on a page have no mechanism by which
<br />
they could be aware of themselves.  Now, that's not the same as 
<br />
saying that there are no universes in which a detective named 
<br />
Sherlock Holmes actually exists, fitting all the right descriptions.
<br />
I'm sure that there are, but they are not accessible by us.  In this
<br />
world-line in which we find ourselves, Sherlock Holmes is fictional.
<br />
<br />Non-fictional entities here-now, to which I would ascribe conscious-
<br />
ness, implement computational processes which I could, in theory,
<br />
objectively study.  Each person has a brain that could be dissected
<br />
and studied.  If our tools were sophisticated enough, we could
<br />
figure out what that creature was experiencing at that moment,
<br />
independent of his or her report.  We would have no such possibility 
<br />
with a teddy bear.
<br />
<br />Now, that is true of any &quot;computation&quot;, or computer program.  Given
<br />
enough information, we could, in theory, decipher what that program
<br />
was subjectively experiencing.  That wouldn't necessarily give us
<br />
enough so that we would &quot;know what it's like&quot; to be that program.
<br />
It may never be possible for us to, for example, know what it's like
<br />
to be a bat.  But we can certainly understand an awful lot about 
<br />
that bat, and provide detailed, objective descriptions of that bat's
<br />
subjective experiences.
<br />
<br />Also, for any computation, we could do the same sorts of dissections.
<br />
In the case of an abstract computation, that dissection is
<br />
independent of any actual instantiation of the program.  That's
<br />
where a lot of the confusion has been lately, and is the reason for
<br />
the subject of this thread:  &quot;Implementation&quot;.  As far as replay
<br />
devices, Olympia's, and HLUTs, here is my take:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;A replay device is not an instantiation of a computation in any
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;sense.  It is more analogous to ink on a page, and is therefore 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;in no sense conscious.  On could think of it as a particular run
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;of a program (Olympia), but as we have seen, in that case, the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;program which is actually implemented is a trivial one.  Note that
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;in this, I thoroughly reject Hal's and Jacques' suggestion that 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Olympia may be conscious.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;HLUTs are clearly conscious, because they implement a complex
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;computation.
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Should this idea be hard to grasp by people who imagine that whole
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universes exist simply by virtue of seeming to exist to the characters
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implemented in them?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; YOU exist simply by virtue of seeming to exist in your own self-model
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (which exists only insofar as you exist).
