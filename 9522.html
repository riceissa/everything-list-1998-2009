<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't know much about Church Thesis, but I want to learn more.  Even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; though it seems easy to recite, as in the existence of a Universal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Language, it seems very deep and mysterious.
</em><br />
<br />I think so.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Almost like stating a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Unified Field Thesis.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You just state it, and then see where it leads,
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; at least as far as you are able to follow it.
</em><br />
<br />? I mean we follow it. Comma. Of course in case we get a contradiction 
<br />
we will abandon it. If we get just weirdness, well, personnaly I follow 
<br />
Deutsch dicto: let us take our theory seriously, it is the only chance 
<br />
to make them wrong ...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But on the surface, the very prospect of someone trying to disprove
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Church Thesis is funny to me.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I think so too. To be honest, one paper on continuous (quantum) 
<br />
teleportation made me doubt on Church thesis during several hours ... 
<br />
but no more.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps I am missing something.  To
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think of a counterexample seems like a contradiction.  Didn't Turing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; describe his Turing machine as equivalent to what a mathematician can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do with a pencil and paper?  But the counterexample would have to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something that someone (probably a mathematician ;) could think up!  So
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a counterexample would be a function F that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) a mathematician could think up
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) without using a pencil and paper!  Oooo.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Not really, because Church thesis asks for the &quot;pencil and paper&quot;. So a 
<br />
counterexample of Church thesis would be a FINITE description of how to 
<br />
compute a function, description which can be send by radio wave or by 
<br />
pedestrian mailing and understandable by human but not by computer.
<br />
The main problem is that we cannot define really what we mean by 
<br />
&quot;FINITE&quot;. It is as hard to define the term &quot;finite&quot; (without using its 
<br />
meaning implicitly) than the term &quot;consciousness&quot;.
<br />
(and in my opinion the term &quot;matter&quot; is still more complex, and that 
<br />
almost follows from comp in fact, cf UDA).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Actually, I am aware that people like Penrose actually say that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something is going on in the brain (quantum-mechanically) that could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; never happen on a piece of paper.
</em><br />
<br /><br />After having read his cute &quot;road to reality&quot; book I think he has 
<br />
changed his mind.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  But putting it in the above way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; makes it sound funny.  And I think actually Penrose might claim that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the function G is just such a function.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Penrose knows perfectly well that no known human can compute g. (G can 
<br />
be compute partially and is in general undefined in a predictible way 
<br />
(for example on its own code)).
<br />
So Penrose has concentrated his non-comp argument on the formal version 
<br />
of that argument, that is on Godel second incompleteness theorem. He 
<br />
needs to say that humans know their are consistent and thus escape the 
<br />
godelian fate, but Judson Web already refutes such attempts. I propose 
<br />
we come back to this when we will go the fact 1 and to to the facts I 
<br />
and II (cf Smullyan). We need the notion of theory for doing that.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; He doesn't say much in his
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Shadows of the Mind about Church Thesis.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Interesting. I will try to reread what he says about Church thesis.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But, Bruno, your posts on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this seem to be assuming Church Thesis and then seeing what the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conclusion is about G, which is perhaps the opposite of Penrose.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Sure. remember I put explicitly Church thesis in the definition of 
<br />
computationalism.  Penrose postulates non-comp at the start (of its two 
<br />
best-sellers book).
<br />
penrose uses Godel as an argument for non-comp. I take it as the most 
<br />
lucky possible event for the mechanist, because it saves mechanism from 
<br />
reductionism.
<br />
With a good understanding of Church thesis you can realize that comp is 
<br />
the most anti-reductionist philosophical standpoint possible. Church 
<br />
thesis and comp are the rationalist road to the mystical notion of 
<br />
unconceivable freedom. Unfortunately, although we have practice 
<br />
rational mysticism for a millenium (from Pythagoras to Proclus), we 
<br />
have (irrationally, after mixing religion and state) separate them 
<br />
since about 1500 years.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Do you think that there is a possibility that Church Thesis has the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; same status as the Continuum Hypothesis in this sense:  the Continuum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hypothesis has been shown to be independent of the axioms of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arithmetic, i.e. both the truth and the falsity of the Continuum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hypothesis is consistent with the axioms of arithmetic.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />You mean with the axioms of Zermelo Fraenkel set theory, I guess. (The 
<br />
continuum hypothesis is not even expressible in first order axiomatized 
<br />
arithmetic, like Peano).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Could the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Church Thesis be independent of... what?... The problem is: what body
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of knowledge is there that is in the pursuit of truth, and is also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intimately affected by the Church Thesis?  The mind-body problem, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; guess.  Could the Church Thesis be independent of the mind-body
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Quite interesting question. In 1922, Emil Post, the real first 
<br />
discoverer of &quot;Church thesis&quot; (except perhaps for Babbage and Ada) 
<br />
considered it as a law of mind, and speculated that progress in 
<br />
psychology could perhaps settle it.
<br />
Together with arithmetical realism I make Church Thesis part of comp. 
<br />
Just for making precise the digital, numerical aspect of it.
<br />
<br />Again, we talk about the classical Church Thesis (CT). There are 
<br />
intuitionistic and epistemological variants of CT which can be 
<br />
formalized, and then prove to be independent of some axiomatization of 
<br />
intensional or intuitionistic mathematics, but this should not concern 
<br />
us before we met the arithmetical notion of (first, first plural, 
<br />
third) notion of person (the &quot;hypostases&quot;).
