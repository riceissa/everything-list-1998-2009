Hi Bruno,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;OK. I think we are making progress. I will start the other thread 
<br />
after this message
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;as I don't really have more obvious divergences from you and you are 
<br />
kind enough
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;to indulge me in this little diversion. As before I will erase the 
<br />
obvious points of
<br />
&nbsp;agreement below...

<br />&nbsp;Hi Godfrey,

&nbsp;&quot;No YD, no Bruno&quot;!?! You make me anxious :)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sorry! That was very callous of me! I really did not mean to 
<br />
imply that you would be &quot;eliminated&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;by my argument! Much on the contrary, I am hoping you will be... 
<br />
illuminated (;-) !!!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;SWE : Schroedinger Wave Equation
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;YD: Saying Yes to a doctor who propose you an artificial digital 
<br />
&quot;generalized brain&quot;. First axiom of comp.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Some people complains out-of-line for the acronyms, so I repeat them 
<br />
once by mail).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">  &gt; It seems to me that you are weaseling out of it but I don't quite &gt; 
</em><br />
care if you take refuge in another Everett World.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; That
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; would be a cop out and I am sure you know it. I want you and I &gt; 
</em><br />
digitised IN THIS WORLD! I don't care for copies!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Well: not of copies IN THIS WORLD, I guess. Giving that that is really 
<br />
the by-product of saying YES to the DOCTOR (YD).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to leave copies out of the YD because I think those would 
<br />
actually invalidate the premise. If you ran into
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;a copy of yourself in the street you may suspect that something is 
<br />
amiss in your world!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt; [GK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; I don't much care what you can deduce from COMP, Bruno. I care that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; COMP=YD+CT+AR and that shooting down YD would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; shoot down COMP. You could very well deduce from COMP my &gt; 
</em><br />
non-existence if YD is false.
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Only if YD is *proved* false!!! (I could deduce your inexistence from 
<br />
the SWE if any TOE (theory of everything) which supposed SWE true, if 
<br />
SWE is false!). You are saying something very general here!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;What I propose to do is to show you that your premise, YD, is false. 
<br />
That allows me to dismiss anything you say based
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;on that premise. That is actually not general at all but extremely 
<br />
specific. From here on I will make no comment on
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;any sentence you preface with &quot;But from COMP (or YD) I can prove 
<br />
that...&quot; . Nothing personal, please understand.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">  &gt; BM: Ouh la la. You are close to the 1004 fallacy (asking for more &gt; 
</em><br />
precise definition than the reasoning itself). At the start you can &gt; 
<br />
use the term &quot;axioms&quot;, &quot;postulates&quot;, &quot;theses&quot;, &quot;premises&quot;, &gt; 
<br />
&quot;assumptions&quot;, &quot;hypotheses&quot;, etc.. in a similar way.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; [GK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; I think you get my point. I am not asking for precision at all. I am 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pointing out that thesis and doctrines are not hypotheses
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; tout court. These three &quot;assumptions&quot; do not have the same epistemic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; status and it is misleading to call them the same.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; If you don't like it, than acknowledge my pragmatics: if your &gt; 
</em><br />
point-of-view is falsifiable it should be so without compromising &gt; 
<br />
either CT and AR which stand very well on their own as you underscore &gt; 
<br />
below:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mmhhh... This is your opinion, and perhaps mine. But not of most 
<br />
people to which my proof is addressed (computer scientist).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh I would not worry! Computer scientists are by, now, used to have 
<br />
their hopes dashed (;-). And you strike me as a &quot;real
<br />
&nbsp;grown-up&quot; since you are not afraid of facing up to empirical testing!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;(skipped)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt; [BM]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; Well, I have decided to put it explicitly, because, in front of my &gt; 
</em><br />
reasoning, some people cop out simply by saying &quot;Ah, but you are a &gt; 
<br />
platonist!&quot;. So I prefer to say it at once. I agree with you it is a &gt; 
<br />
sort of &quot;cop out&quot;. Now, although 99,99999999 % of the mathematician &gt; 
<br />
are platonist during the week, most like to pretends they are not (the 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; week-end!).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; [GK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; Ditto.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;Hope you are not serious!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;Sorry! &quot;Ditto&quot; over here in the States is used as a note of agreement.
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;(skipped)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, you will perhaps accuse me of weaseling out again, but thinking 
<br />
twice, I believe I have answer too quickly in the sense that for saying 
<br />
yes for an artificial *digital* brain to a Doctor you need to know a 
<br />
bit what &quot;digital&quot; means, and for this you need CT (Church Thesis), and 
<br />
for this, I think, you need AR (Arithmetical Realism). But as you say, 
<br />
CT and AR are mainly bodyguards of YD.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh. No problem there. Maybe I did not make it clear enough. What I am 
<br />
suggesting is that we (you and I) agree implicitly
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;that CT and AR are unassailably true for the purposes of my argument! 
<br />
I will in fact need that to be the case at the very least
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;for CT. As for &quot;digital brain&quot; I am sure we can reach some agreement 
<br />
on that.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;(skipped)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; [GK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; Bruno, you are weaseling out again, here! Let me ask you this in &gt; 
</em><br />
clear terms again:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; Can you, Yes or No, derive your whole &quot;grand manege&quot; from CT and AR 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; alone?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; Because if it is a &quot;yes&quot; here I will give you the Oscar (and the &gt; 
</em><br />
Nobel) and let you go. I can than concentrate on
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; being a good machine for the rest of my existence since I don't want 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to loose my platonic allegiances or my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; heuristic acquiescence to CT.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;If by &quot;grand manege&quot; you mean the physical laws: the answer is YES ! 
<br />
(Thanks for the Oscar and Nobel :).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;If by &quot;grand manege&quot; you mean deriving the physical laws and 
<br />
understanding why it is necessarily so, the answer is probably NO. (Nor 
<br />
could Everett derive the Wave Collapse appearance without something 
<br />
equivalent to the YD).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;In that case enjoy the prize! If you derived the laws of physics from 
<br />
CT and AR alone you surely deserve the recognition you
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;will enjoy because that is a remarkable accomplishment! 
<br />
Congratulations!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel like saying: my work here is done! Without even trying I have 
<br />
let you relinquish one of your hypothesis!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope you give me a note of recognition when you re-write your proof 
<br />
and take that pesky YD from the set of
<br />
&nbsp;hypothesis! (:-)
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;(skipped)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is just fair! For refuting a proof in applied logic it is 
<br />
sufficient to show the inconsistency of the premises. If you succeed 
<br />
not only you really don't need to follow the UDA steps (UDA= Universal 
<br />
Dovetalier Argument), but nobody will ever need to do that!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually the two or three first steps of UDA are just there to make 
<br />
the premises clearer.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Please note that in the UDA I generally add supplementary hypotheses 
<br />
which I eliminate later with the Universal Dovetailer.
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;See, now you put me in a really tricky position! People in this list 
<br />
are already claiming that I am acting coy or trying to bluff
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;my way out of giving them what I promised!!! That is what is NOT fair! 
<br />
On one hand you want to see my cards, on the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;other you don't want to risk anything and you are now saying that YD 
<br />
is worth nothing and that you just include it to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;make computer scientists happy! That is not cool! Right when I was 
<br />
taking you for a &quot;grown up&quot;!...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; What I would like to do next is the following:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; 1) State the YD hypothesis in a way that is both consistent with 
</em><br />
your &gt; statement and useful for my purposes. I will
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; do that in a separate thread shortly. I need you to agree on that &gt; 
</em><br />
version, of course.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Careful: your statement should not just be consistent with YD, but 
<br />
equivalent to it or at least imply by it to derive something ...
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, YD is so secondary to your purposes, why do you care? I am 
<br />
almost sure you would approve my version but I am not
<br />
&nbsp;putting it down until you give me a good reason to do it!!!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; 2) Once you agree I will tell you a little parable (allegory is more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; platonic, I guess) that illustrates the strict use of that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; statement and the contradition that obtains from it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; 3) After that I will tell you what that contradiction may be useful 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in settling a certain dispute on the question of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; whether QM has anything to say about consciousness or not.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; OK? What do you say?
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very interested, Godfrey. Please go and shoot comp. You would be 
<br />
the first.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;But remember that in YD there is a use of folk-psychology or 
<br />
grand-mother psychology (a fundamental concept of theoretical cognitive 
<br />
science/philosophy of mind), and then I translate the argument in 
<br />
arithmetic, and the grandmother will be substituted by the 
<br />
introspective universal machine (which I call also the &quot;Lobian Machine&quot; 
<br />
in honor of Lob).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Bruno
<br />
<br />&nbsp;<a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/</a>
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sorry, Bruno, but I see no glory in disappointing a few computer 
<br />
scientists(and their grand-mothers)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;since, you and I agree that their physics stinks! You are the one that 
<br />
claims to derive the true physics so you are the one I would like to 
<br />
shoot down! If you really only need CT and AR I really have no other 
<br />
choice but to worship at your altar (;-) since I really don't want to 
<br />
have to go through your proof and I am no match for CT or AR. It is a 
<br />
pity because it is a cute little argument I have up my sleeve ....
<br />
<br />&nbsp;So long,
<br />
