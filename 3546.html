<br />I think you probably misunderstood what you read. What's true is that
<br />
universal priors based on different Turing machines are close to each
<br />
other, up to a multiplicative factor that depends on the pair of universal
<br />
priors being compared. But this multiplicative factor is not necessarily
<br />
insignificant in terms of practical consequences, and there are other
<br />
candidiate measures proposed by Juergen that seem about as attractive as
<br />
universal priors (i.e. the less dominant speed prior, and the more
<br />
dominant one based on GTMs which I'm not sure has a name).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is also the point I and others have made, that you are not just an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer from outside the universe, but a participant inside.  This ties
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you to the universe in a way which might constrain you.  I think your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argument above makes more sense if you think of yourself as an observer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of a multiverse in which you are not participating, say some kind of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computer simulation.  Then the idea of measure seems pretty arbitrary.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However once you are inside you are influenced by the reality of measure.
</em><br />
<br />Even though you're inside, you can (and I think in some cases must)
<br />
consider your situation from an outside perspective. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't see how you can reconcile the notion that measure is arbitrary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with the observation that the laws of probability work.  Aren't these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; phenomena tied together?  Living here in this world, aren't you forced
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to either believe that the universe is fantastically improbable (because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we live in an extremely low-measure universe for some arbitrary measure),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or else that we do in fact live in a high measure universe, meaning that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure is not arbitrary?
</em><br />
<br />One thing you do give up when you abandon the concept of an objective
<br />
measure is an explanation of why you are who(/when/where) you are. But I
<br />
can't shake the feeling that perhaps the question doesn't really make
<br />
sense, because how could you not be who you are? However, if you don't
<br />
want to give this up, you can keep the notion of an objective measure just
<br />
for the purpose of having this explanation, but adopt an arbitrary
<br />
subjective measure for making decision. In other words, even if you think
<br />
there is an objective measure, you don't have to care about each universe
<br />
in proportion to its measure.
<br />
<br />Now suppose you could manipulate the beliefs of your future selfs and not
<br />
have them remember the manipulations (e.g. like the protagonist in the
<br />
movie Momento). What would you want your future selfs to accept as the
<br />
objective measure? Well it would be the same as your subjective measure,
<br />
because otherwise you'd be in a situation where the future selfs that you
<br />
care a lot about don't have a good explanation for why they are where they
<br />
are, while some of the ones you don't care much about do have a good
<br />
explanation. And what's the downside to your future selfs believing in
<br />
the &quot;incorrect&quot; objective measure? There doesn't seem to be one.
