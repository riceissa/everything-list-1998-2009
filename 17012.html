</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; that I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; am real' (RITSIAR - a gnomic acronym that has surfaced before on  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; list).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Hmm... OK. Nice. Not completely convinced yet.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let's try to be clear(!)  I don't intend 'RITSIAR' to refer merely to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the 1-person, but to the 0-person and all the other persons you can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think of.  Why?  Because given that &quot;I&quot; am indubitably RITSIAR, then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whatever &quot;I&quot; emerge from must also subsist in a status that is also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; RITSIAR in some uneliminable *ontological* sense.  Naturally I don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intend by this that either the One, or 3-person descriptions,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; literally call themselves &quot;I&quot;, but rather that what is ontologically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; RITSIAR in the 1-person is irreducibly so in the whole, and vice
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; versa.  As an analogy, if - merely for the sake of argument - we were
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to choose to ascribe fundamental 'materiality' to the world', then we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; also must consistently hold that all and any constituent parts and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sub-wholes subsist in ontological 'materiality' by the same token.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not to do this would be equivalent to accepting sudden non-linear
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; step-changes in *ontological* status merely as a function of scale -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which AFAICS is incoherent - i.e. I wouldn't have a clue what this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could possibly mean.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't want us to talk past each other merely on the basis of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; incommensurable jargon - if there's anything I can do to make this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point clearer, I'll go on trying.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I think I do agree with you. The problem is more pedagogical. RITSIAR  
<br />
involves the notion of &quot;I&quot;, which is *very* delicate. Some will  
<br />
identify &quot;I&quot; with the body, and concludes that &quot;I&quot; is material, for  
<br />
example.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; 1) The unknowable is singular (i.e symmetrical, holistic,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; indivisible:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; e.g. Plotinus' One)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;unknowable&quot;?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; or unprovable, uncommunicable, that is unbelievable,  unjustifiable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here I'm saying that the *undifferentiated* One is unknowable, because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'knowing' is here posited precisely to subsist in differentiated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ways-of-being adopted by the One *posterior* to its bare,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; undifferentiated 'presence'.  Hence, this 'bare presence' or personal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ground is a priori both unknowing and unknowable.  'Knowledge'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subsists in the multiplicity of distinguished ways-of-being that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emerge from the bare presence of the One: i.e.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'getting-a-grip-on-Oneself'.
</em><br />
<br />Again, I do agree with you. Again you refer to &quot;knowability&quot;, a term  
<br />
on which philosophers fight since millenaries.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The excluded middle principle is what you need to think and dream
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; about what you build, and what can follow, and talk on it with  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; others.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; You need it somehow to believe in another one. Also, it prevents not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the falsity of solipsism, but the falsity of any doctrinal (3-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; communicable) solipsism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm not abandoning the principle, rather I was pointing to the fact
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that in analysis at this level, there is something deeply mysterious -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; apparently paradoxical in terms of mutually exclusive 'opposites' -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about a 'seamless' unity nevertheless being 'differentiable'.
</em><br />
<br />Sure. Plotinus wrote many chapter on this. How could the ONE be  
<br />
responsible for the MANY without lying to its own nature. Difficult  
<br />
question.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; As a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter of personal psychological compulsion, I feel it necessary to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point this out, to forestall someone else asking &quot;how can you claim
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that 'parts' ultimately subsist in the context of a 'seamless' whole?&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you like, I consider myself to be a sort of dualist in this sense:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that there seems to me ultimately to be an inescapable duality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (meaning two irreducible ways of being) between intuitions of 'whole'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and 'part'.
</em><br />
<br />You are right. My problem is that I have a theory, so I can provide  
<br />
answer in the frame of that theory. I can show that correct machine  
<br />
can guess ONE = MANY, and I can show they are bound to discover things  
<br />
like:
<br />
<br />(ONE = MANY) entails I will never be able to understand that (ONE =  
<br />
MANY).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Once we have reasoned as far as we can in terms of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'ultimates', we're left with nothing to 'separate' the 'whole' into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'parts'.  If we believe we can 'actually' *sever* the 'whole', what do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we suppose 'lies between' the 'parts' (e.g. the old notion of 'atoms
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the void')?  Nothing?  One may simply say that this of course is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the well known tension between intuitions of the 'continuous' and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'discrete'.  But at this level of discourse, there seems to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something wrong that can't be fixed by invoking higher-order 'limit'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theories unavailable even in principle at this depth of analysis.
</em><br />
<br />I think that you are right. But of course I can only say: I think your  
<br />
intuition fits well in the comp theory (when it is taken seriously).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Nonetheless, the unknowable - unknowably - somehow resolves this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; paradox.  But maybe I'm the only one who cares about this.  Or maybe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it's just gibberish.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Almost! Yet I do agree. The consistency of machine theology comes from  
<br />
the fact that its main part is not provable by the machine on which  
<br />
the theology applies. Like Plotinus or Proclus theology, machine's  
<br />
theology is negative. We have to have faith in those truth, and the  
<br />
faith eventually is reduced to some self-involvment in &quot;yes-doctor&quot;  
<br />
practical kind of things, when we assume the comp theory.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; 8) Taken together, 5, 06 and 07 collapse into a basic intuition of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; existence as - always and everywhere - constituted by a 'personal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; self-actualisation' which is posited to be characteristic of reality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; 'from the ground up'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ? This belongs to the incommunicable part. If you communicate it, you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; bet on the existence of someone else, and on something sharable. But
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; then you do science, and in honest science you share only doubts.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Do you see what I see?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Do you believe what I believe?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hm, I think there may be a misstep in emphasis here.  The key
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intuition, which I was deriving step-by-step up to that point, is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whatever it is that we take to be 'real' or 'existent' - and by that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; token fundamentally RITSIAR - must thereby be both 'personally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; present' and 'self-actualising'.
</em><br />
<br />This is fuzzy. I can agree, and I can disagree.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  In my terms, this would have to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so whether we take RITSIAR to be based on Number, 'matter' or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; spiritual green cheese.  I agree this isn't science, and hence is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'immodest' or theological - or guesswork.  But nevertheless I can't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; make any sense out of science or any other attempt to account for what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I (or you) see or what I (or you) believe unless I ground this in such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intuitions.  Can't help it.  And you're going to say 'yes, the Lobian
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine would say exactly that'!  But does that mean that such an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intuition isn't in some deep sense foundational?  And hence that it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - in that foundational sense - explanatorily 'true'?
</em><br />
<br />This is a very difficult point. Where the machine will say &quot;I am not a  
<br />
machine&quot;, and where we have to acknowledge she is 100% right. But how  
<br />
could a machine be right when saying &quot;I am not a machine&quot;? This is due  
<br />
to the fact that the first person associated to the machine (the  
<br />
knower) is indeed not a machine from the machine first person point of  
<br />
view.
<br />
The beauty is that, although seemingly very paradoxal, the comp math  
<br />
here can give a precise and transparent sense to such talk.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I prefere the phrasing &quot;is the truth of an arithmetical statement,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; like &quot;there is no biggest prime number&quot; true (or false) dependent of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; you?&quot; I don't think it is RITSIAR, although only RITSIAR can really
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; appreciate it here and now.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, I know you prefer this phrasing, and I'm going to say that this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is the nub of some of the most intractable debates that have gone on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in this list since it started.  The burden of what I've been arguing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; above is that if you want to ground reality, existence, being or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whatever cognate you like on any intuition whatsoever, then that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intuition must be credibly RITSIAR - not merely 1-person subsets of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it, but the whole 0-person superset.
</em><br />
<br />You may be right. I have no answer on this (yet).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If RITSIAR isn't there from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; start - i.e. if it's not the basic ontology - then it can't be 'jammed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in' at a later stage.  Consequently, if you want to rest your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'numerical ontology' on 'truth', then 'truth' is your foundational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; criterion of 'what is RITSIAR': i.e. 'present and self-actualising'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; IOW, it would have to be the case that &quot;I&quot; - the 1-person - and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One in which &quot;I&quot; subsist, are RITSIAR entirely in virtue of such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; present and self-actualising 'truth'.  And moreover such truth is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *necessary* or tautological truth - it doesn't depend on contingent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence in the sense that 'matter' might.  Hence it 'conjures'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; worlds into existence merely in virtue of its truth.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, I agree. But it is dangerous talk, it is near the truth which  
<br />
become false when asserted. Assuming comp, we can bypass such  
<br />
&quot;danger&quot;, by studying the &quot;theology&quot; of a simple machine which  
<br />
simplicity provides us with the knowledge that the machine (by  
<br />
construction) will be consistent and (arithmetically sound). Then we  
<br />
can lift that theology on ourself, by making explicit both the comp  
<br />
assumption, and the &quot;hope&quot; we are arithmetically sound. If not, we  
<br />
became inconsistent. I think that theology *is* the scientific field  
<br />
which requires the utter most rigor. It invites to many travels &quot;near  
<br />
inconsistency&quot;.
<br />
Here I should not say &quot;I agree&quot;. I should say that, in case I am  
<br />
arithmetically sound and comp is true, my &quot;guardian angel (G*)&quot; would  
<br />
agree with you, but *I* can't.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now I'm not at this point (or perhaps at any point) arguing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conclusively against such a notion of 'existence'.  I just want to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; know if you think that this line of argument is invalid or incoherent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and not just that it is 'predictably Lobian'!
</em><br />
<br />It is coherent as far as you are aware of some &quot;bets&quot; or &quot;hopes&quot;. It  
<br />
is a question which provides the answer, as far as it remains a  
<br />
question.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; In other words, does this view hold that the ineluctable,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; independent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; 'necessity' of mathematical 'truth' is capable of, as it were, of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; *invoking* 'what is' - thereby resolving the Wittgensteinian  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; mystery:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;that the world is&quot;?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; With a gap. But with an explanation why there is a gap, and then  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is the beautifulness of the geometry of the gap, and of the nature of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the gap, ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is this a contradiction of what I just said above?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Not at all.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; That is, our discovery of its actual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; presence, prior to time and space, necessarily - radically -  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; excludes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; its non-presence, but nonetheless we retain the intuition (perhaps
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; incoherently) that - counter factually - it 'might not have been  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; thus
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; present'?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I will read this sentence ten times before breakfast. Gosh, that's an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; hard one.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sorry, perhaps I'm making it harder to say than need be.  I'm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contrasting 'contingent existence' - i.e. the fact that we believe 'a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world' to exist when in some sense 'it might not have existed' - with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the kind of 'tautological' or 'arithmetical' necessity that I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; described above.  Perhaps you don't accept the distinction, but it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appears to me that your resting your case on the 'truth' of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical assertions as a proxy for 'existence' is tantamount to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conjuring the world through 'necessity'.  Neat trick.  Maybe right.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dunno.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In my own analysis, as described above, Arithmetical Reality would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; needs be grounded in a foundational 'duality' deriving from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logically prior 'bare presence' of the One.  I would further say that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the presence of the One is contingent: i.e. although its presence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definitively rules out its absence, one still can't say that in such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; absence its presence would have been 'necessary'.
</em><br />
<br />This could be related to the fact that we cannot prove the existence  
<br />
of numbers. Our belief in numbers remains a complete mystery. But we  
<br />
can conceive their absence, like we can decide to be ultrafinitist and  
<br />
we can decide in non believing in comp, and all that. That is why comp  
<br />
is a theory, that is, an object of doubt. RITSIAR is not. RITSIAR lead  
<br />
to certainty. It lives in the land of the knower. With comp, the  
<br />
knower knows, but has to stay mute. The intellect does not know as  
<br />
such, but can talk, and remains coherent by adding the interrogation  
<br />
marks.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  (Note to self -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perhaps this is trying to stretch what is sayable beyond breaking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point).  Thus 'dualised presence', manifesting self-motivatedly and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-referentially, is basic to what is RITSIAR in everything that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; follows.  The schema itself is describable and justifiable within the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; limits you specify in terms of AR etc.  But in the end I would say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that my 'bet' is that this is a descriptive schema the 'realisation'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of which subsists in the 'dualised presence' of the One.  In other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; words, we can't dispense with either theology or science: which is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just fine!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Easy, eh?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I didn't expect this one.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We call this irony!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Sure, nice post. You still seem to reify a bit the third hypostase,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the universal self, the god within. It is an important one, but comp
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; makes it possible to take the ONE as a zero-person being, more like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;the truth&quot; (on the machine). Then the other hypostases &quot;emerge&quot; or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;emanate&quot; (to use Plotinus' word) from it, with their communicable  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; incommunicable statements.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; See what I mean?  When you phrase it as you do above, I feel that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we're 'violently agreeing', except that you insist on the One as being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'more like &quot;the truth&quot; as opposed to 'reification'.
</em><br />
<br />This is due to the contingent and uninteresting fact that many  
<br />
attributes me some original theory, when I build on a theory which  
<br />
every scientist agree on, except Penrose. Some believe that  
<br />
arithmetical realism presuppose a sort of realm where 0, 1, 2, 3, ...  
<br />
exist in some loaded metaphysical sense, where I use 0, 1, 2, 3, ...  
<br />
in the same sense that in any part of math.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maybe in the end
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this is just semantics.  Indeed I'm not trying to say that the One is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'any thing'.  I might be content to say that &quot;the truth&quot; equates to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what is present and self-actualising, in the basic senses I attempt to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attribute to it above, and that this is a sufficient basis for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deriving the knowable and provable aspects of 'what is RITSIAR' whilst
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at least being able to refer in some sense to its deeper
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unknowablility.
</em><br />
<br />You may be right, and we may differ only on the methodology. I try to  
<br />
avoid any introspective notion of truth. Of course, when studying  
<br />
consciousness, this is difficult, and I have to invoke at least one  
<br />
introspective 'act' at some point. I do this by the &quot;yes doctor&quot; in  
<br />
the comp frame. I bet my &quot;RITSIAR&quot; remains invariant for some  
<br />
transformation of my body, whatever it is, and then I try to deduce  
<br />
things. I do think that  we 'violently' agree on where we can be lead,  
<br />
but differ perhaps with the practical goal. My goal is addressing the  
<br />
usual scientists, and showing them that we have still a lot of work to  
<br />
do for solving, as much as possible, the mind body problem. Indeed, we  
<br />
have to recover the whole physical appearance from one (or many)  
<br />
modalities of self-reference. And then, this makes the comp theory  
<br />
testable in the rather accepted sense of Popperian test.
