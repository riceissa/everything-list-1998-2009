<em class="quotelev1">&gt; involves some calculations and interpretation of the calculation

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in terms of the model.  The relation of the model to reality, if

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it's a good one, is it gives us the right answer, i.e. it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; predicts accurately.  Their are other criteria for a good model
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; too, such as fitting in with other models we have; but prediction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is the main standard.
</em><br />
<br />This makes sense but you need another element as well.  This shows up
<br />
most explicitly in Bayesian reasoning models, but it is implicit in
<br />
others as well.  That is the assumption of priors.
<br />
<br />When you observe evidence and construct your models, you need some
<br />
basis for choosing one model over another.  In general, you can create
<br />
an infinite number of possible models to match any finite amount of
<br />
evidence.  It's even worse when you consider that the evidence is noisy
<br />
and ambiguous.  This choice requires prior assumptions, independent of the
<br />
evidence, about which models are inherently more likely to be true or not.
<br />
<br />This implies that at some level, mathematics and logic has to come before
<br />
reality.  That is the only way we can have prior beliefs about the models.
<br />
Whether it is the specific Universal Priori (1/2^n) that I have been
<br />
describing or some other one, you can't get away without having one.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So in my view, mathematics and theorems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about computer science are just models too, albeit more abstract
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ones.  Persis Diaconsis says, &quot;Statistics is just the physics of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; numbers.&quot;  I have a similar view of all mathematics, e.g.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arithmetic is just the physics of counting.
</em><br />
<br />I don't think this works, for the reasons I have just explained.
<br />
Mathematics and logic are more than models of reality.  They are
<br />
pre-existent and guide us in evaluating the many possible models of
<br />
reality which exist.
