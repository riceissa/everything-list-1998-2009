<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is a modest metaphysical posit which can be used to explain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a variety of observed phenomena, ranging from Time and Change
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the observed absence of Harry Potter universes.
</em><br />
<br /><br />How could a substantial world be' a modest metaphysical posit?
<br />
First nobody knows what such a &quot;substance&quot; can be defined without 
<br />
infinite regress.
<br />
Second, those who have defined it, are always led to the admittance 
<br />
such a substance must be decomposable and get his property for the 
<br />
property of its subparts (Aristotle the first). But then, the 
<br />
ontological existence of such &quot;substance&quot; does not fit neither the 
<br />
experimental facts, nor the quantum theory (which describes those 
<br />
facts), nor the computationalist hypothesis (see my URL).
<br />
<br />If you want use the ontological existence of &quot;matter&quot; to solve the 
<br />
Harry Potter enigma, I can prove to you in all details that the only 
<br />
way to do that would consist in positing actual non computable 
<br />
infinities in matter. Just ask, or read the already available info on 
<br />
the list or in my url.
<br />
<br />And then, having that heavy matter to play with, you will still have to 
<br />
explain how do you link the first person experience to it (the 
<br />
mind/body problem).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The question is not whether there is a world beyond even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logical possibility, but why the observed world is so much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; smaller than the Platonias. Matter answers that easily.
</em><br />
<br />That the &quot;observed world&quot; is smaller than platonia is trivial: our 
<br />
observation are finite, and platonia is infinite.
<br />
Now, you, following (I agree) common sense infer the existence of an 
<br />
ontological world, but I don't see any clues from which you can infer 
<br />
it is smaller than platonia. Actually many infinities appears at the 
<br />
bottom, and it is hard how to interpret them.
<br />
<br /><br />1Z (to George Levy):
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Science may have moved close to making the observer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; central epistemically , but it has not room for the idea
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that observers are ontologically fundamental.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Observers are people, homo sapiens, the product of millions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of years of evolution. Scientifically speaking.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Human observers are people. With comp, *any* locally or partially 
<br />
irreversible machine is up for the job. Still, comp makes that large 
<br />
class of number/digital-machines basic for just (re)defining a coherent 
<br />
notion of physical reality, which remained to be tested with the facts 
<br />
(current test are going in the quantum direction).
<br />
<br /><br />1Z (to John M)
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The no-metaphysical-role for observers rule is one that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; maintains the consilience of science.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://www.csicop.org/si/9701/quantum-quackery.html">http://www.csicop.org/si/9701/quantum-quackery.html</a>
</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree that there is a lot of quantum-quackery, as there is 
<br />
godel-quackery. This makes progress in our fundament fields 
<br />
psychologically difficult to assess.
<br />
Unfortunately, many if not most scientist reaction to those quackeries 
<br />
are lacking rigor, and contend themselves to present some facts as 
<br />
&quot;scientific&quot; when they are not.
<br />
Let me give you an example. After Godel published its 1931 
<br />
incompleteness paper, the belgium logician Barzin publishes a detailed 
<br />
&quot;refutation&quot; of Godel's proof (like many). If I remember well it is 
<br />
Kleene, or Kreisel: I should verify, but the point is that big guy in 
<br />
logic will criticize, technically, Barzin's attempt to refute Godel. 
<br />
All scientist will believe that matter settled until 20 years later, 
<br />
Kleene himself (or Kreisel himself) find an error in his own critics. 
<br />
It was just false and Barzin's point appeared to be much subtle and 
<br />
harder to refute. For sure, Barzin *was* wrong, but many scientist took 
<br />
Kleene (or Kreisel) first reply like an authoritative truth ...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; JM: The observer seems so fundamental in the views of this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; list (and in wider circles of contemporaryh thinking)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that a more general identification may be in order.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No, no,nooooooo!!!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is far too general already.
</em><br />
<br />I don't think so. Read about the lobian machine ...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The list needs to be a lot more particualr about the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; difference between ontology and epistemology, between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;to be&quot; and &quot;to know&quot;. Then they would not slide
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from &quot;X cannot be known without an observer&quot; to &quot;X cannot exist without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an observer&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />You make a good point, but I am not sure it is a genuine answer for 
<br />
John or me.
<br />
I will not insist because it is an easy consequence of the UDA (and I 
<br />
recall you saying you don't want to study it because, if I remember 
<br />
well,  you are so sure the result is false that you don't need to read 
<br />
it, but then you miss the opportunity to either find a real error of 
<br />
reasoning in my deduction or to discover that the greek theologian were 
<br />
right, and naturalism (nature deification) is wrong).
<br />
<br />1Z to Lennart Nilsson
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am trying to get away from the idea that logic needs to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be propped up by some external authority. The validity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of logic comes about from the lack of any basis
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to criticise it that doesn't presuppose it. That's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; epistemology, not metaphysics.
</em><br />
<br />I agree for the part of logic use in elementary mathematical theories. 
<br />
Still there has been (and still exist) some critics on some formula. 
<br />
The most known case is the case of the third excluded principle (A v 
<br />
~A). In my context such a critics is a confusion between first person 
<br />
and third person. Could say more when I get to the Arithmetical 
<br />
Hypostases ...
<br />
<br />1Z to Brent
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The claim I made was &quot;Whatever else you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do, you'll be using logic. There is no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; standpoint outside of logic. No, not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even evolutionary theory&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />I agree with you, as an arithmetical platonist.
<br />
<br />Bruno
