<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The copenhagen interpretation is just one of several ways of thinking about QM, though. Other interpretations, like the many-worlds interpretation or the Bohm interpretation, do try to come up with a model of an underlying reality that gives rise to the events we observe empirically. Of course, as long as these different models of different underlying realities don't lead to any new predictions they can't be considered scientific theories, but physicists often discuss them nevertheless.

Look at how Lisi is programmed to think by the training a physicist gets...It's like there's some sort of retreat into a safety-zone whereby &quot;if I make noises like this then I'll get listened to&quot;....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and I'm not talking about some minor nuance of scientific fashion. This is a serious cultural problem in physics. I am talking about that fact that science itself is fundamentally configured as a religion or a club and the players don't even know it. I'll try and spell it out even plainer with set theory:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  = {descriptive laws of an underlying reality}
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  =  { every empirical law of nature ever concocted bar NONE, including QM, multiverses, relativity, neuroscience, psychology, social science, cognitive science, anthropology EVERYTHING}
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You're not being very clear about why you think things like the Bohm interpretation of QM cannot fall into the category &quot;descriptive laws of an underlying reality&quot;. By &quot;descriptive&quot; do you mean something intrinsically non-mathematical, so that any mathematical model of an underlying reality wouldn't qualify? If so, how could this non-mathematical description give rise to quantitative explanations of what we actually measure empirically? On the other hand, if you do allow the descriptive laws to be mathematical, what is it specifically about something like the Bohm interpretation or the many-worlds interpretation that makes them fail to qualify?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</em><br />
The 'mathematicality'  (that a word?) or otherwise of descriptions is 
<br />
moot. That the natural world happens to cooperate to satisfy the needs 
<br />
of certain calculii, making certain mathematical abstractions useful, is 
<br />
only that - happenstance...In the final analysis the 'laws' are merely 
<br />
descriptions in the sense that they  facilitate prediction, which is how 
<br />
the natural world will appear to us when we look (with our 
<br />
P-consciousness). Or, in the applied sciences, how we should make the 
<br />
world appear in order that a desired behaviour occurs. That's all. Being 
<br />
merely descriptions, they cannot automatically be ascribed any sort of 
<br />
structural role. Such an assumption is logically flawed. Conversely our 
<br />
situation does not a-priori prohibit the assembly of a set of 
<br />
descriptions of actual underlying reality... provided it is consistent 
<br />
with everything we know AND predictive of an observer.
<br />
<br />As I said in the first post: &lt;aspect 1&gt; is descriptions of an underlying 
<br />
reality. &lt;aspect 2&gt; is also a set of descriptions, but merely of 
<br />
generalisations/abstractions of the appearances in an observer made of 
<br />
&lt;aspect 1&gt;. Both aspects are equally empirically supported. You can't 
<br />
give either aspect priority-ownership of the evidence.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; FACT
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;   = {Null}
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; FACT
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;   = {has NO law that predicts or explains P-consciousness, nor do they have causality in them. They never will. Anyone and everyone who has a clue about it agrees that this is the case}
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What do you mean by the term &quot;P-consciousness&quot;? Are you talking about the first-person aspects of consciousness, what philosophers call 'qualia'? Personally I'd agree that no purely third-person description of physical phenomena can explain this, but I like the approach of the philosopher David Chalmers, who postulates that on the one hand there are laws which fully determine the mathematical relationships between events in the physical world (so the physical world is 'causally closed', the notion of interactive dualism where some free-willed mind-stuff can influence physical events is false), and on the other hand there are 'psychophysical laws' which determine which patterns of events in the physical world give rise to which types of first-person qualia. Of course, since I prefer monism to dualism I have some vague ideas that the laws of mind might actually be fundamental, with the apparent physical laws being derived from them--see <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/everything-list.domain.name.hidden/msg13848.html">http://www.mail-archive.com/everything-list.domain.name.hidden/msg13848.html</a> for my speculations on this.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</em><br />
I have provided (see below) a quote from my stockpile.... it explains 
<br />
the P-consciousness term. Yes, it's the 1st person perspective.
<br />
<br />I'm seeing Dave next week. He's in town...maybe I'll get in his ear 
<br />
about this... I do not see how 'mind-stuff' has been made false.... but 
<br />
that is moot, for I do not posit or need any such thing. This is a dual 
<br />
aspect MONISM. There is only 1 reality: that which is described as 
<br />
&lt;aspect 1&gt;. Within that reality, we concoct stories about those things 
<br />
we find 'physical'.... like matter. But that does not entail that the 
<br />
underlying reality is completely defined by our descriptions: ie that 
<br />
our notion of 'physical' is all that there is to be described.
<br />
<br />This is a dual-aspect EPISTEMOLOGY. One collection of stuff, 2 
<br />
collections of descriptions of it.
<br />
<br />The problem is that */we/* have defined 'physical', when actual reality 
<br />
can be quite different to what we call 'physical' and very consistent 
<br />
with all observation...indeed it must be different  ...because all our 
<br />
so-called 'physical' laws fail to deliver an observer (see below).
<br />
<br />In the post to Brent Meeker I outlined a cellular automaton version of 
<br />
the &lt;aspect 1&gt;/&lt;aspect 2&gt; situation. Imagine yourself an entity inside a 
<br />
CA and that collections of 'cells' in the CA are 'painted' by your 
<br />
perceptions to appear fundamental. Let's say you call one of these 
<br />
fundamental entities an electron, which actually involves 2347502457923 
<br />
cooperating cells in the CA. You, inside the CA, made of the CA, see 1 
<br />
electron. You describe the electron in &lt;aspect 2&gt; science terms. But 
<br />
this is in stark contrast to describing 2347502457923 cells 
<br />
collaborating in some way (according to the rules of operation of the 
<br />
CA), which are then revealed to you, through mechanisms inherent to the 
<br />
CA, as an electron. &lt;aspect 1&gt; describes collaborating parts to &lt;aspect 
<br />
2&gt;'s description of appearing 'wholes'.
<br />
<br />When you talk of any physicist making any interpretation of QM anything, 
<br />
in the current mode of the operation of science (which I call SINGLE 
<br />
ASPECT SCIENCE), all you are talking about is rearranging the 
<br />
'appearance deckchairs' on the &lt;aspect 2&gt; titanic. You can do it until 
<br />
the end of time - you will never explain P-consciousness, because you 
<br />
have failed to talk about actual reality because you have failed to 
<br />
predict an observer (P-consciousness). In context, scientific 
<br />
observation and P-consciousness are literally identities.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; In other words, scientists have added special laws to  that masquerade as constitutive and explanatory. They are metabeliefs. Beliefs about Belief. They ascribe actual physical reification of quantum mechanical descriptions. EG: Stapp's &quot;cloud-like&quot; depiction. I put it to you that reality  could have every single particle in an exquisitely defined position simultaneously with just as exquisitely well defined momentum. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That's exactly what's true in the Bohm interpretation, particles have well-defined positions and velocities at all times. If you're not familiar with this interpretation see <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-bohm/">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-bohm/</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</em><br />
This does not help for the reasons outlined above! No amount of 
<br />
interpretation of &lt;aspect 2&gt; 'laws of appearances' can be construed 
<br />
structural. If they could, when we open up a cranium we'd literally see 
<br />
appearances, NOT BRAIN MATERIAL. That is, if an observer X was 
<br />
encountering a green thing moving about in the external world then 
<br />
something green moving about would be evidenced inside X's cranium. This 
<br />
disparity between predicted (by physics) and actual evidence (by 
<br />
neuroscience) proves that describing appearances and describing 
<br />
structure are NOT the same set of descriptions. Dual aspect science is 
<br />
thus empirically justified. Single aspect science (of the Bohmian or 
<br />
anyotherian kind)  is thus empirically refuted.
<br />
<br />I hope I am making progress here... as a physics participant, you have 
<br />
been handed 'Single Aspect Science', SAS, imbued with failure, as a 
<br />
given. You are expected to continue with it despite it being empirically 
<br />
refuted ... and.. you have been programmed to consider science itself as 
<br />
developmentally complete, when I claim the reverse... science has not 
<br />
finished developing. It has one more hurdle to cross, when its 
<br />
inconsistencies are eliminated: Dual Aspect Science
<br />
<br />REF: see Velmans, M. 'Reflexive monism', Journal of Consciousness 
<br />
Studies vol. 15, no. 2, 2008. 5-50.
<br />
...an excellent conceptual grounding - he calls it a 'reflexive monism', 
<br />
but he does not apply the concept to science itself.

*/----------------- Terminology
<br />
/*
<br />
<br />*/Neuroscience and cognitive science have a highly developed and well 
<br />
documented system used to discuss the subjectively delivered, privately 
<br />
presented experiential life of humans. It has been adopted from the 
<br />
terminology in the relevant discourse in philosophy./ *&lt; !--[if 
<br />
supportFields]&gt;The primary senses of vision, audition and so on are a 
<br />
subset of the totality of the perceptual fields, which also includes 
<br />
visual imagination, primordial and situational emotion and others. The 
<br />
perceptual fields have acquired various collective nouns: 
<br />
'P-consciousness' [1], 'phenomenal consciousness' [2], 'qualia' [3] and 
<br />
'phenomenality' [4]. These are synonyms. P-consciousness will be used 
<br />
here. These terms are widely used, but within a discourse that 
<br />
acknowledges a chronic state of complete explanatory failure. Thus 
<br />
P-consciousness, the ultimate mediator of all scientific observation 
<br />
(see below), is accepted as '/a robust phenomenon in need of 
<br />
explanation/'[2, 5]. The physics basis of the 'perceptual fields' that 
<br />
are the subjective experiences of vision, hearing and so forth is thus 
<br />
acknowledged as one of the great mysteries in science[6, 7]. The 
<br />
explanatory problem itself even has its own name: the '/hard problem/' 
<br />
of the physics of P-consciousness[2]. The best known method for 
<br />
discussing 1^st person experience is that it is 'like something' to be 
<br />
in receipt of the experiences[8].
