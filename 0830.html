<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think the idea is that each observer-moment has a measure which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; describes the probability that it would be selected randomly from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; among all observer-moments.  Each moment of consciousness that we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience is weighted by that measure, and it is much more likely that we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience high measure moments than that we experience low measure ones.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In particular, our current experiences of reading and writing on this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mailing list should be relatively high measure compared to a potentially
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; vast number of extremely low measure and hence improbable ones.
</em><br />
<br />I think you understand it the same way I do.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The question then is whether we should commit quantum suicide (QS) in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this model.  There are two problems that we have to dispose of first.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The first is that this universe is deterministic, hence questions of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; policy may seem meaningless, since there is no free will.  We will in fact
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; commit QS or not depending on the laws of physics and not any policies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we adopt.  This objection I think we can dispose of in the standard ways
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in which free will is coupled with determinism, mainly claiming that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; two phenomena are identical but occur at different levels of description.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The second problem is that there seems to be no need for a definition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of identity in this model; each observer-instant exists on its own,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and although the laws of physics are such that its measure will be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; related to the measures of succeeding and following observer-instants,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is no other necessary coupling between them.  In particular we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't assume that there is one person whose identity flows from one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moment to the next.  Rather, each observer instant exists on its own.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So it is not clear what it means to ask whether &quot;I&quot; should commit QS,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if the concept of identity isn't used.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Nevertheless I think we can say that whatever policy is appropriate with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; regard to QS can be expressed independently of any concept of identity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The policy would be something like, &quot;commit QS if circumstances at the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer-instant in question satisfy condition X.&quot;  The question is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then what rule a general observer should adopt in deciding whether to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; commit QS.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We still need one more element, though: what the goal is of the observer?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; He needs to decide whether to commit QS based on some criteria.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What should they be?
</em><br />
<br />I agree completely. I've been arguing that there is no justification for QS
<br />
that is independent of one's goals. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It seems to me that we can identify two goals which are both plausible,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one which would justify QS and one which would not.  The first would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be to maximize the average happiness of all observer-instants in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe.  The second would be to maximize the total amount of happiness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the universe.  (I believe this was discussed earlier on the list,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so I apologize for going over old ground, but I have forgotten the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; resolution if any.)
</em><br />
<br />Unfortunately neither of these goals make much sense. The first one you
<br />
propose leads to the unpalatable conclusion that not only should you commit
<br />
QS but that you should kill (murder) anyone whose happiness drops below
<br />
average. The second goal implies that you should construct Von Neumann
<br />
probes that would reproduce and fill the universe with either computer
<br />
simulations of pleasurable mental activity or static copies of pleasureable
<br />
mind state depending on which theory of consciousness you accept. I don't
<br />
think either of these are any less arbitrary than any other goal, such as
<br />
minimizing the standard deviation of happiness of all observer-instants
<br />
(which can be interpreted as making the world fairer).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So it seems to me that even with the absolute SSSA (if I have understood
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it properly) there is a matter of goals which must be resolved before
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we can say that QS is unjustified.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, but I don't think the goals themselves can be justified in an absolute
<br />
sense (i.e. not relative to some other goals) so the final result is that
<br />
there is no absolute justification for QS.
