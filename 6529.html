<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; interaction between body and mind? What do you lose if you simply accept,

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; as per Gilbert Ryle, that the mind is what the brain does?
</em><br />
<br />Stephen answers:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In a phrase, I would lose choice. What you are asking me is to give up 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any hope of understanding how my sense of being-in-the-world is related to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any other phenomena in the world of experience and instead to just blindly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; believe some claim.
</em><br />
<br />I think that it comes down to a perceived need of an &quot;answer&quot;.
<br />
Some of us require (demand) an explanation for the fact that
<br />
mathematics is so tightly coupled to the physical universe;
<br />
others need that, but more: they require an explanation beyond
<br />
the existence of mere abstract mathematical patterns; yet others
<br />
want that too, but more: they demand answers beyond naive
<br />
materialism for the existence of 1st person experiences. Yet
<br />
others go way beyond, and demand a Force to be responsible for
<br />
everything, and others beyond that, that this Force be personal
<br />
and omnipotent (how else to explain certain feelings?)
<br />
<br />I'm scared sort of bad, that my own case may turn out to be
<br />
that I'm homozygous recessive in the religiosity gene, and
<br />
the people I mentioned first on the list are entirely heterozygous,
<br />
and the people I mentioned last are homozygous dominant!  :-)
<br />
<br />If not a religiosity gene, then some manner of unshakable almost
<br />
innate predisposition to be satisfied or unsatisfied with these
<br />
explanations. For the life of me, I can't see (nor have ever been
<br />
able to see) what the big deal is about 1st person experiences.
<br />
Of course I have 'em. So does everyone. It's as though people
<br />
expect 3rd person explanations for 1st person experiences, and I
<br />
think it is in principle impossible: i.e., that *no* possible
<br />
string of words in the English language could ever establish 1st
<br />
person &quot;truths&quot; by 3rd person descriptions of what physically is.
<br />
<br />Stathis went on:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Otherwise, you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; could seek a special explanation for an electronic calculator's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; matter/mathematics dualism, or a falling stone's matter/energy dualism, or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; any number of similar examples. Occam's razor would suggest that such 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; complications are unnecessary.
</em><br />
<br />Another homozygous recessive, like me, eh?  :-)
<br />
<br />I won't agree that Occam's razor really can be deployed here.
<br />
It's just that you can't *see* the problem they're seeing.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Pratt's disdain follows from the obvious failures of other models. It 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does not take a logician or mathematician or philosopher of unbelievable IQ 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to see that the models of monism that have been advanced have a fatal flaw: 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the inability to prove the necessity of epiphenomena. Maybe Bruno's theory 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will solve this, I hold out hope that it does; but meanwhile, why can't we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consider and debate alternatives that offer a view ranging explanations and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unifying threads, such as Pratt's Chu space idea?
</em><br />
<br />I just have to say that I have utterly no sense that anything
<br />
here needs explanation. 
<br />
<br />Now I am not kidding: Once, when I was exasperated, I joked with 
<br />
with a couple of friends and half-persuaded them that I was not
<br />
conscious. Do we really know for sure that Stephen, Lee, and
<br />
Stathis all have the same kind of consciousness?  Could it be
<br />
that whether or not you see a problem depends on the extent
<br />
and kind of consciousness you have?  Could we be making a fatal
<br />
mistake by assuming that everyone here has the same kind of
<br />
consciousness?
<br />
<br />Lee
