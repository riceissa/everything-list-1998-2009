<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  An interesting question can now be asked: Does the prisoner only exist 
</em><br />
when 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the computer is simulating his universe, or does his universe exist 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; independently of our universe and simulating his universe simply means that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we can take look at his universe and even interact with him? 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<br />To answer the question of where does the prisoner live, in a simulated world 
<br />
or an a &quot;real&quot; world we must discuss the issue of INDETERMINACY inherent in 
<br />
the definition of the real world and of the simulated world. 
<br />
<br />No matter how precise you specify the prisoner' world, you will leave out 
<br />
some parameters that specify that world. These parameters could be 
<br />
indeterminate because either they are not specified (or controlled) or 
<br />
because they are not observed.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From your own perspective there will be an indeterminacy in the definition of 
</em><br />
his world. There is no way for sure you could say that the prisoner is 
<br />
actually simulated. You may be 99.9999% sure but never 100%. And you will 
<br />
never know for sure who the prisoner is since there are uncertainties in the 
<br />
measurements of his parameters.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From the perspective of the prisoner, his own world is also indeterminate. He 
</em><br />
may be living in any number of worlds within an indeterminacy window. And 
<br />
that number is most likely infinite, with each one of these worlds, more or 
<br />
less identical to each other. Some worlds could even be super Hollywood sets 
<br />
that simulate these worlds - Think of the movie &quot;The Truman Show.&quot; Other 
<br />
worlds may be sets within sets constructed by some very advanced 
<br />
civilizations. Think of &quot;The Making of the Making of Honey I Shrunk the Kids.&quot;
<br />
<br />The prisoner will make measurements to reduce the uncertainty of his world, 
<br />
but will never reduce it to zero. In fact, for every measurement, new 
<br />
branches will open up. From the relativistic point of view,  the uncertainty 
<br />
will remain the same. ie., Planck's constant remains the same.
<br />
<br />The only standpoint which I find logical is to assign &quot;equal&quot; validity to 
<br />
consciousness no matter how this consciousness arise, and what is the level 
<br />
of implementation of the world that gives rise to it.  
<br />
<br />You may find that the prisoner lives in a simulation, yet, you can never be 
<br />
sure that it's not the other way around, that you are the one living in a 
<br />
simulation and that you have been fooled by some grand scheme.
<br />
<br />In summary, the answer to your question is PARADOXICAL:
<br />
<br />1) Yes,  the prisoner only exist when the computer is simulating his 
<br />
universe. Time for the prisoner is not the same as your own time.
<br />
<br />2) Yes his universe exist independently of our universe. If you unplugged the 
<br />
computer and never turned it back on again, the prisoner will continue living 
<br />
in a different branch of the plenitude where there is a computer or an 
<br />
equivalent environment appropriate to support his life. Transition from the 
<br />
computer environment to &quot;another environment adequate to support his life&quot; is 
<br />
seamless within the window of indeterminacy specific to his universe.
