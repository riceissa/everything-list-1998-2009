I comment a Post by Stathis addressed to Lee and I end up with a 
<br />
question to Hal.
<br />
<br /><br />Le 24-juin-06, à 15:01, Stathis Papaioannou a écrit :
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Lee,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  It’s perhaps unfortunate that we are arguing about this because I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think we basically agree on what Derek Parfit has called a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reductionist theory of personal identity (in his 1984 book “Reasons 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and Persons”; apparently “reductionist” was not in wide use as a term 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of abuse back then). I like to emphasize the instantaneous or granular 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nature of personhood not because we literally die and are resurrected 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; every moment, as those words are commonly understood, but because it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would make no significant difference to our stream of consciousness or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense of self if in fact this were the case. Although in our 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience the sequence of mental states making up an individual’s 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stream of consciousness always occur in the one brain, the brain does 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not provide any special “glue” joining the mental states together, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no such joining is necessary. Two or more mental states are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experienced as part of the one stream of consciousness if their 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; content is related in a particular way, like elements in a set. How, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where and when the mental states are implemented is irrelevant and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unknowable from a first person perspective, unless it actually affects 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the content of the mental states.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Hal Finney in his recent thread on teleportation thought experiments 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; disagrees with the above view. He suggests that it is possible for  a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subject to apparently undergo successful teleportation, in that the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; individual walking out of the receiving station has all the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appropriate mental and physical attributes in common with the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; individual entering the transmitting station, but in reality not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; survive the procedure. I have difficulty understanding this, as it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seems to me that the subject has survived by definition.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I mainly agree with you but I would not have ended with &quot;by 
<br />
definition&quot;. I would have mentionned instead the comp *assumption* and 
<br />
perhaps also the serendipitously good  choice of the correct level of 
<br />
substitution.
<br />
&nbsp;From a logical point of view it is consistent (possible) that the one 
<br />
reconstituted is a zombie (although this would contradict comp or the 
<br />
choice of the level).
<br />
<br />Comp itself cannot be proved but what can be proved is that IF comp is 
<br />
correct then comp cannot be proved, necessarily. So we have, somehow, 
<br />
to be open to non-comp beliefs.
<br />
<br />Put in another way: if you survive when saying YES to the doctor, you 
<br />
have to respect those who say NO to the doctor (unless you have bad 
<br />
intentions of course or are ignorant).
<br />
<br />Parfit has not see this, and that is why he dares to qualify (a bit 
<br />
provocatively I would say) his identity theory as a reductionist 
<br />
theory, or &quot;the reductionist theory&quot;. With comp (when made explicit) 
<br />
Parfit's theory is mainly correct except on two points:
<br />
<br />1) What I have just said: the theory is not reductionist---It is the 
<br />
contrary: it provides (by diagonalizations!) many vaccine against many 
<br />
form of reductionism. After dinner ;) I could even go as far as to say 
<br />
it gives a path toward that Unconceivable Freedom described by some 
<br />
mystic like Vimalakirti!
<br />
2) We are type, not token. There is no physical token. (with comp). 
<br />
Parfit thinks we are token. I have not the Parfit under the hand, I 
<br />
will give you the pages later. I don't think there are any mathematical 
<br />
token either. It looks like Parfit makes us token for avoiding 
<br />
immortality at the start.
<br />
<br />To sum up, Hal Finney seemed to me coherent, giving that in its recent 
<br />
post he admits questioning comp. It is less clear for me how he can 
<br />
still use Kolmogorov complexity (a computer science notion), but still, 
<br />
logically that could make sense, perhaps through some Powerful Oracle 
<br />
resource (actual infinity of highly uncomputable information). I don't 
<br />
know.  Hal?
<br />
