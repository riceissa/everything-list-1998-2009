In this message, I neither want to support the ASSA nor utilitarism.
<br />
But I will argue that the former has remarkable consequences for the
<br />
latter.
<br />
<br />To give a short overview of the concepts, I remind you that
<br />
utilitarism is a doctrine measuring the morality of an action only by
<br />
its outcome. Those actions are said to be more moral than others if
<br />
they cause a greater sum of happiness or pleasure (for all people
<br />
involved). Though this theory seems to be attractive, it has to cope
<br />
with a lot of problems. Maybe the most fundamental problem is to
<br />
define how 'happiness' and 'pleasure' are measured: In order to decide
<br />
which action is the most moral one, we need a 'felicific calculus'.
<br />
However, it seems that there is no chance to find a unique felicific
<br />
calculus everyone would agree upon. Until today, there is a lot of
<br />
arbitrariness:
<br />
<br />- How do we measure happiness?
<br />
- How do we compare the happiness of different people?
<br />
- How do we account for pain and suffering? Which weight is assigned
<br />
to them?
<br />
- Even maximizing 'the sum of happiness' in some felicific calculus
<br />
does not necessarily determine a unique action. Maybe it's possible to
<br />
increase the happiness of some individuals and to decrease the
<br />
happiness of other individuals without changing the 'sum of
<br />
happiness'. What is preferable?
<br />
<br />Most of us have a mathematical or scientific background. We know that
<br />
such a situation can lead to an infinity of possible felicific calculi
<br />
each one defined by arbitrary measures and parameters. In the
<br />
sciences, one would usually discard a theory that contains so much
<br />
arbitrariness (philosophy however is not that rigorous).
<br />
<br />The application of the ASSA can help to surmount these conceptual
<br />
difficulties. Assuming the ASSA, we are able to define a uniquely
<br />
determined utilitarism. Nonetheless, the practical problem of deciding
<br />
which action one has to prefer remains rather unchanged.
<br />
<br />1st step: Reducing the number of utilitarisms to the number of human
<br />
beings.
<br />
<br />The ASSA states that my next experience is randomly chosen out of all
<br />
observer moments. For the decision of my action, only those observer
<br />
moments are of interest that are significantly influenced by my
<br />
decision (e.g. observer moments in the past aren't). Since my next
<br />
observer moment can be any of those observer moments, I am driven to a
<br />
utilitarian action. Utilitarism directly arises whenever an observer
<br />
wants to act rationally while assuming the ASSA. I could say that
<br />
utilitarism is 'egoism + ASSA'.
<br />
<br />2nd step: The unique utilitarism.
<br />
<br />Starting from the definition that utilitarism is egoism in combination
<br />
with the ASSA, I argue that all observers will agree upon the same
<br />
action. At first you might think that the preferred action depends on
<br />
the individual preferences of the deciding individual. For example, if
<br />
I was suffering from hunger, I could perform an action to minimize
<br />
hunger in the world. But this is a wrong conclusion. When I experience
<br />
another observer moment, I am no longer affected by my former needs
<br />
and preferences.
<br />
<br />Directly speaking: Since all observers must expect to get their next
<br />
observer moments out of the same ensemble of observer moments, there
<br />
is no reason to insist on different preferences.
<br />
<br />But there is still one problem left. Different observers have
<br />
different states of knowledge about the consequences of a potential
<br />
action. In theory, we can exclude this problem by defining utilitarism
<br />
as the rational decision of a hypothetic observer that knows all the
<br />
consequences of all potential actions (of course while assuming the
<br />
ASSA).
<br />
<br />It's a nice feature of the ASSA that it naturally leads to a theory of
<br />
morality. The RSSA does not seem to provide such a result. Though, I'd
<br />
like to have similar concepts out of the RSSA (according to Stathis, I
<br />
belong to the RSSA camp).
