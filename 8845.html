<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In many of our discussions of multiverse models, we have explicitly or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implicitly included the notion of measure, that some universes would be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more &quot;common&quot; or more &quot;prominent&quot; than others.  This is often linked to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; extensions of Occam's Razor, so that universes with relatively simple
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; models would have higher measure than those that are more complex.
</em><br />
<br /><br />The necessity of &quot;simplicity&quot; could perhaps be a consequence of comp, 
<br />
but this remains to be shown. But even if that is the case, I don't see 
<br />
how &quot;simplicity&quot; would make the model having a higher measure, unless 
<br />
you attach consciousness to particular individuals in particular 
<br />
universe, but this can be done only by identifying the first person and 
<br />
some arbitrary particular third person description. And the UDA shows 
<br />
this cannot be done (with comp).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Physics is a science, and that means it needs to work with theories 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can be tested and disproven.  We are a long way from being able to come
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; up with any experiment that a working physicist in his lab could run
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to see whether multiverse models are correct.  (And no, quantum suicide
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doesn't count!)
</em><br />
<br /><br />The day physicists will understand the logician's sense of model and 
<br />
theories, things will be pretty much clear. If we agree that physicists 
<br />
obey the same laws as the particles they describe, then, even just the 
<br />
two slits experiment entails mutiverses, and confirms QM which is 
<br />
literally a mutiverse theory (even with the collapse,  which is just an 
<br />
invention for cutting on the typical quantum contagion of the 
<br />
superpositions).
<br />
Also, note that the 0-universe, 1-universe, infinity-of-universes are 
<br />
all on the same par. Nobody has ever tested the existence of a 
<br />
primitive physical universe nor of the existence of Aristotelian Prime 
<br />
Matter, and other common sense idea  on which those physicalist ideas 
<br />
derive.
<br />
Note also that the theory of Matter given by the loebian 
<br />
(introspective) machine is 100% testable.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I also get the impression that Susskind's attempts to bring 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;disreputable&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multiverse models into &quot;holy&quot; string theory is more likely to kill
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; string theory than to rehabilitate multiverses.
</em><br />
<br /><br />String theory relies entirely on QM and so inherits all its 
<br />
interpretation problems.
<br />
Except that in String Theory, like Quantum Cosmology,  the &quot;wave 
<br />
collapse&quot; is still more unintelligible. Witten makes the points in a 
<br />
conference some years ago. According to him String Theory is still very 
<br />
fuzzy on the whole wave aspect of strings, above its  traditional role 
<br />
as computation tool.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Perhaps I am getting a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; biased view by only reading this one blog, which opposes string theory,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but it seems that more and more people are saying that the emperor has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no clothes.  If string theory needs a multiverse then it is even less
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; likely to ever be able to make physical predictions, and its prospects
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are even worse than had been thought.  A lot of people seem to be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; piling
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on and saying that it is time for physics to explore alternative ideas.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The hostile NY Times book review is just one example.
</em><br />
<br /><br />To be sure I disagree that string theory is not testable, and I think 
<br />
the multiverse idea is testable and already indirectly tested and that 
<br />
it is the most certain consequence of QM.
<br />
Now, as a theory of everything, string theories, like QM and actually 
<br />
the whole physics enterprise, are flawed at the start, because those 
<br />
approach relies (consciously or not) on a hardly clear or coherent 
<br />
theology inherited mainly from Aristotle, and which tends to put the 
<br />
mind-body problem under the rug.
<br />
