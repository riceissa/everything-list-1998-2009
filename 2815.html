<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Just as an example, he says most philosophers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would agree that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; []A-&gt;A, where []A is interpreted as knowing A. This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is clearly a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different meaning of the word &quot;to know&quot; that we use
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; here in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Australia.
</em><br />
<br />I get the impression folks here assume that when one
<br />
person knows something, that only that person knows
<br />
that something. For other people to know the same
<br />
something, they have to discover and assimilate it for
<br />
themselves. It also seems that folks here assume
<br />
knowledge is some kind of pattern that exists separate
<br />
from the truth of surrounding it's existence.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From a mystic standpoint, this can't be. To know
</em><br />
something is closer to the analogy of a subscriber
<br />
line. When one *knows* something, anything, they
<br />
subscribe this pattern.
<br />
<br />Another issue is how folks seem to thing knowledge is
<br />
inanimate until someone acts on it, like words on a
<br />
paper being meaningless until someone read them. From
<br />
a mystic standpoint, that isn't so. Knowledge and
<br />
expression is simply manifest from one place to
<br />
another. The knowledge itself is not constrained to
<br />
the limits of those that would interpret it. Those
<br />
entities interpret and then express that understanding
<br />
wherever they happen to be existing.
<br />
<br />For someone to try to form the basis for existence
<br />
based on what one thinks others can know in terms of
<br />
what I've tried to counter, I feel intuitively that
<br />
they would fail, or not succeed completely. 
<br />
<br />One analogy to explain this is someone caught in an
<br />
event horizon of a black-hole. The realm formed by
<br />
this Event-Horizon can be vast, but is still by
<br />
definition, limited. I see people trying to define
<br />
existence by illusionary data like someone trying to
<br />
understand the universe by what he can see from his
<br />
vantage point in the Event-Horizon. Drawn out, it
<br />
would look like someone walking in a circle.
<br />
Eventually, he'd come back to where he started. He
<br />
might vary his path slightly to see different things,
<br />
but he'd simply be make the circle bigger. He can
<br />
never know what lay outside the circle with his given
<br />
modus operandi.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From my perspective, true knowing, is being what you
</em><br />
know. Which implies a great deal on what is truly
<br />
knowable. If you look at what we're used to here, we
<br />
have belief and knowing implicitly understood in
<br />
statistical terms. We know we can walk, we've done it
<br />
so often, so we don't doubt we can. Belief seems to be
<br />
predicated on the existence of doubt. True knowing has
<br />
no constraints of doubt. To know is to be one with
<br />
that knowledge. This from a mystic standpoint, is true
<br />
faith. Faith is *not* belief. Faith is knowing.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;I know of plenty of people who know that
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; God exists. And I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; know of a number of other people who know that God
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doesn't exist. So,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by this application of Modal logic, we can conclude
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that God both
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exists and doesn't exist at the same time, which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seems kind of illogical.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps the way out of this mess is to say that I'me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; really talking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about belief, rather than knowledge, however that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would imply that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; knowledge is devoid of meaning, since it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; impossible to establish
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with certainty whether any particular fact is true.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Even Mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proof is contingent upon belief of the efficacy of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the formal proof,
</em><br />
<br />Again, I had thought the point of these threads were
<br />
to try to describe consciousness with the idea in mind
<br />
of trying to synthesize consciousness in software or
<br />
some other artificial means.
<br />
<br />I propose the best way to do this is to know what one
<br />
is after specifically, then solve the problem of
<br />
achieving it.
<br />
<br />If one attempts to use a limited thinking style to
<br />
implement something interpreted with that same
<br />
thinking style, the end result would seem to
<br />
necessarily be limited to perceptional constraints of
<br />
that thinking style. I get the intuitive sense, that
<br />
linear or sequential thinking will not result in the
<br />
kind of achievement we're talking about.
