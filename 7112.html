<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I presume the answer is that rather than look at physical size/weight of our

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information content devoted to that part of our beings essential to being an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer (probably something to do with the amount of grey matter).
</em><br />
<br />Yes, I think that's right.  Our bodies don't directly contribute to our
<br />
conscious experiences.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; again, this surely changes as we age. My brain (and consciousness) at age 2
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was much smaller than at age 30, and will start to shrink again as I get
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; senile. Does our measure increase with age?
</em><br />
<br />I think you meant &quot;decrease&quot;, at least in terms of becoming elderly.
<br />
Of course we already know that measure decreases with age due to the
<br />
continual risk of dying.  But yes, I think this argument would suggest
<br />
that there is a small decrease in measure due to brain shrinkage.
<br />
It would not be a very large effect, though, I don't think.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If we get brain surgery, does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our measure diminish?
</em><br />
<br />You mean if they cut out a piece of your brain?  I guess that would
<br />
depend on whether it affected your consciousness.  If it did you probably
<br />
have bigger problems than your measure decreasing.  Your consciousness
<br />
would change so much that your previous self might not view you as the
<br />
same person.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And once the transhumanist's dream of mental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; augmentation is possible, will our measure increase as our consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; increases?
</em><br />
<br />Yes, I think so, assuming the brains actually become bigger.  Although
<br />
there is a counter-effect if the brains instead become faster and
<br />
smaller, as I wrote earlier.  So this raises a paradox, why are we not
<br />
super-brains?  Perhaps this is an argument against the possibility that
<br />
this will ever happen, a la the Doomsday Argument (why do we not live
<br />
in the Galactic Empire with its population billions of times greater
<br />
than today?).
<br />
<br />Although these conclusions may be counter-intuitive, I find it quite
<br />
exciting to be able to derive any predictions at all from the AUH in the
<br />
Schmidhuber model.  It suggests that uploading your brain to a computer
<br />
might be tantamount to taking a large chance of dying; unless you could
<br />
then duplicate your uploaded brain all over the world, which would greatly
<br />
increase your measure.  And all this comes from the very simple assumption
<br />
that the measure of something is the fraction of multiverse resources
<br />
devoted to it, a simple restatement of the Schmidhuber multiverse model.
