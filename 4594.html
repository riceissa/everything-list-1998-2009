<br />Yes. Ok. I left out some details. One way of looking at it though is 
<br />
that the brain
<br />
evolved from hard-wired control-system hardware to become a more and 
<br />
more general
<br />
information processor. This must have something to do with the fact that
<br />
the terrestrial environment has lots of different opportunities for an 
<br />
ecological
<br />
generalist with opposable thumbs, if only that generalist can figure out 
<br />
what to
<br />
do (how to behave) in novel situation-types.
<br />
<br />You could even say that the human brain (cortex?) has distinguished 
<br />
itself from
<br />
the brains of other animals by the evolution of this general computing 
<br />
capability
<br />
(and the consequent ability to do abstract thinking, situation-modelling 
<br />
with hypotheticals,
<br />
conceptualizing, precise but extensible linguistic commucation, 
<br />
introspection etc.)
<br />
even if (granted) the general computing ability is employed in habitual and
<br />
stereotypical ways most of the time, and is optimized to support those 
<br />
habitual
<br />
or instinctual patterns.
<br />
<br />Many other animal species  share with us the &quot;hard-wired&quot; or &quot;firm-wared&quot;
<br />
kinds of behaviours that you ascribe to our brains. We have gone further
<br />
than any of them in generalizing the information-processing and storage
<br />
capabilities of our brains so that they are &quot;turing-equivalent&quot; AND ALSO
<br />
still optimized for carrying out instinctual behaviours, albeit in 
<br />
creative ways.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You brain is so much more than a computer.. think of it like a galaxy 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or even it's own universe.
</em><br />
<br />I think that's going a little far in the Carl Sagan direction.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This all brings up more questions. What about memory transfer. We code 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our memory by the continious rearangement of pathways. Unless you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could copy the coding and rearrangement, decode it by that persons 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; CODING... 
</em><br />
<br />I don't remember claiming (maybe someone else claimed) you could copy a 
<br />
mind.
<br />
I do believe we'll eventually be able to build them, (and not out of 
<br />
traditional
<br />
organic materials) but if we do build them, then once each A-mind
<br />
starts processing and assiimilating information from its uniquely 
<br />
situated point-of-view
<br />
and its unique experiences/learning sessions, then it will become 
<br />
different from all
<br />
other A-minds and from all other human minds, in the same way that ours are
<br />
different from each other because of nurture. There would be ways to mimic
<br />
differences in built-in biases, preferences, 
<br />
cognition-optimization-directions etc
<br />
as well, if that was useful for groups of A-minds.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
The task is not only to understand what a human brain does in the process of
<br />
its being/becoming a mind. The task is to figure out &quot;IN GENERAL&quot; what
<br />
&quot;being a mind is&quot; and to figure out how the human brain is doing THAT and
<br />
also what are all the things that something other than a human brain would
<br />
have to do to be also doing THAT.
