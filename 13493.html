<br />It should go a little further than puberty--the accumulated wisdom of
<br />
grandparents may significantly enhance the survival chances of their
<br />
grandchildren, more so than the decrease in available resources in the
<br />
environment they might consume.
<br />
<br />So I agree that once you have sired all the children you ever will, it
<br />
makes sense from an evolutionary perspective to &quot;get out of the
<br />
way&quot;--that is, stop competing with them for resources.  But the timing
<br />
of your exit is probably more optimal somewhat after they have their own
<br />
children, if you can help them to get a good start.
<br />
<br />I do wonder if evolutionary fitness is more accurately measured by the
<br />
number of grandchildren one has than by the number of children.  Aside
<br />
from the &quot;assistance&quot; line of reasoning above, in order to propagate,
<br />
one must be able to have children that are capable of having children
<br />
themselves.
