Well, when the ball is dropped, in one universe it falls down, and Bob has

Well, each of us only experiences a single universe (and further, all
of the other humans that we observe<br>
are also observing the same universe we are observing.) Even if one
believes a strong version of MWI in<br>
which there are untold numbers of other us's experiencing other
universes, it's still true that each of those<br>
duplicates only gets to experience a single universe. That's something
about the nature of observation and<br>
observable universes themselves.<br>
<br>
So if Alice and Bob are IN the same universe, where balls fall down,
they'd both be well-advised to<br>
"believe in" the facts of their own universe, and not some speculative,
or at the very least completely<br>
inaccessible, alternate universe. From the perspective of an observer
(within a universe), the universe<br>
they inhabit is more important. <br>
<br>
PRINCIPLES:<br>
---------------<br>
1. A UNIVERSE IS WHERE ONLY ONE OF THE POSSIBILITIES FOR ANYTHING
HAPPENS. <br>
<br>
2. EACH OBSERVER ONLY EXPERIENCES ONE UNIVERSE<br>
<br>
3. COUNTERPART OBSERVERS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED DIFFERENT OBSERVERS,
BECAUSE<br>
THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS CROSS-UNIVERSE ACCESSIBILITY OR EXPERIENCE.<br>
<br>
I simply do not believe that the notion of an observer being able to
access or meaningfully experience the life<br>
of the observer's other-universe counterparts, even if counterpart is a
well-formed notion.<br>
I'm familiar with all of the various logic variations of the notion<br>
of trans-world identity, and I find them to be model-level concepts
(matters of representative opinion) more than<br>
object-level concepts. What I've learned about identity is that there
is a mixture of objectivity and subjectivity <br>
(affected by focus of concern) to it as a concept. What trans-world
identity means (or is useful for) if a premise of<br>
total inter-world inaccessibility is accepted, is questionable.<br>

Choosing a measure from some other universe that you speculate exists
(with, necessarily, no evidence) is<br>
risky and counterproductive to your survival in your universe. I'd
advise you to get out of the path of<br>
the falling ball. Even if "counterparts" makes sense (not granted), if
all counterparts made decisions<br>
based on their speculations about other-world likely happenings, then
all counterparts of that particular<br>
observer would quickly die off for sure. Observers like that would not
evolve. Only home-body observers<br>
(with local-universe concerns) would.<br>
