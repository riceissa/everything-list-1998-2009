Joel:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Bruno:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But don't we have a contradiction, or something like an empirical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; contradiction here. I can certainly hope for certain futures, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; honestly I think (at least from past experience) that some are more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; probable than others. For exemple I am now preparing some coffee. I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; would have the feeling of lying to myself if I was telling you that I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; do not believe &quot;drinking&quot; coffee is probable. So &quot;something&quot; is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; probable. So, if we maintain comp, we must explain why, after I have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; done coffee, drinking coffee got an higher degree of probability. We
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; must aknowledge that physicalist do have an explanation here. There
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is coffee, there is a material machine preparing it, etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Hmm... I think I see the problem now.  But I don't understand your proposed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;solution.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I am glad you begin to see the problem. I have not proposed a 
<br />
solution (yet), I have only try to give an accurate description
<br />
of the problem. Later I will point onto some strategy to search the
<br />
solution, which, btw, cannot be &quot;proposed&quot;. The solution exists
<br />
or does not exists. If the solution does not exists (provably),
<br />
then comp is false (refuted).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Do you want to 1) make predictions about the future based on past
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observations, or 2) make predictions about the future based on all possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;histories, or 3) something else entirely.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Nicely formulated question: it is neither &quot;1)&quot;, neither &quot;2)&quot;, neither 
<br />
&quot;3)&quot; !
<br />
What I want to do ... Well, no: what I'm *obliged* to do (keeping comp)
<br />
is to explain why &quot;1)&quot; seems to work giving that comp force me to
<br />
accept &quot;2)&quot;. We must justified something like &quot;2) =&gt; 1)&quot;.
<br />
Perhaps more precisely: why a third person &quot;2)&quot; implies a first person
<br />
&quot;1)&quot;. Perhaps that will be clearer below where I will attempt
<br />
to conclude the UDA less rapidly.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;In the first case (1), I think I can see how this might be possible.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;For example, if every 9 out of 10 times you drink the coffee after making
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it, then you should be able to reasonably conclude that the next time you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;make coffee, you will most likely drink it.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree, except that this is what we need to explain.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;This seems to work in our current simulation because for the most part, our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;world appears to be mostly &quot;predictable&quot;.  But it will start to fail in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;worlds where there is little regularity.  (e.g. making coffee and drinking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;coffee almost never happen)
</em><br />
<br /><br />So we must explain why, summing on all computational stories, we
<br />
stabilise on &quot;predictable&quot; stories. Note also that an expression like
<br />
&quot;our world&quot; is unavoidably ambiguous, and strictly speaking cannot
<br />
be used with comp (through the UDA).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;But in the second case (2) I can't see how we can make any meaningful
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;predictions since the number of all possible histories is infinite.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes, even uncountable. But that is not a problem. Measure theory,
<br />
including Lebesgue integration theory has been invented for dealing
<br />
with probability on uncountable domains. This is used in elementary
<br />
(non relativistic) quantum mechanics too.
<br />
The problem is not even to find an ad hoc measure which makes the
<br />
white rabbit stories negligeable, but to show that the unique measure
<br />
forced by UDA (or arithmetical translation of UDA) is such that
<br />
rabbit stories are (relatively) negligeable in it.
<br />
In case it is not, comp is refuted.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Put in another way, we must derive the laws of physics from computer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; science. And, through the role of the notion of 1-pov, we must derive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; physical belief from coherent discourse by machines, or more simply
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; derive physics from (machine) psychology.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Do you agree?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I'm not sure.  I'm still unclear about what you are proposing.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I am not proposing anything. I'm just showing that if we are machine
<br />
then next instants are defined by a (relative) measure put on
<br />
the set of consistent reconstitutions *as seen by themselves* (the
<br />
1-person psychology) generated by the UD.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;How can we derive physics from psychology?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Interesting question. Note that the UDA just show that: if we are 
<br />
machine then we *must* derive physics from psychology (itself, by
<br />
comp, embedded in number (meta) theory.
<br />
Mmh... UDA shows more. It shows that your next instant is 
<br />
&quot;determined&quot; by all computational histories (generated bu the UD)
<br />
going through your 3-state.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Can you give some simple example, like the coffee experiment?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Excellent idea! I will make myself a cup of coffee.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; If you follow me perhaps you can understand why, in case your MUCA
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is *the* bottom, then we should not postulate that!!! We should prove
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; it, for exemple by showing that the measure behave well only thanks
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to the infinite MUCAs' work generated in arithmetics (or by any DUs,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; or in Numberland, as I like to say.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;No - sorry.  I don't understand that either.  I think you've lost me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; If you really take the comp 1-indeterminisme seriously, perhaps you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; can guess also why our very finiteness makes us confronting some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; continuum, and some random oracle, ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Infinite possibilities?  I don't know.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Remember that you have answered &quot;yes&quot; to the ten first question.
<br />
<br />Let us run the UD &quot;again&quot;, and let us look what happens when I
<br />
am preparing a cup of coffee.
<br />
<br />Let us consider one instantaneous (relative) description of my
<br />
state of mind S among the states I am going through during my
<br />
coffee preparation.
<br />
<br />And look what does the UD. It generates that state S infinitely
<br />
often. Oh, at first it generates that state in 10^googol steps, and
<br />
it generates it again much (very much) later. It generates it 
<br />
through different but similar computational histories. It generates 
<br />
&quot;dummy&quot; copies also : for exemple it generate S + 0, and later S + 1,
<br />
and later S + 00, and later S + 01, and later S + 10, ... ,
<br />
and later S + 00000000100010000111, and later ..., dovetailing
<br />
on all finite initial segment of the real.
<br />
This is of course still countable when you look at the domain 
<br />
from a third person point of view. But, as you aknowledge in
<br />
question 7, the delays does not count for the first person, so
<br />
the domain of 1-indeterminacy, which is of course a first person
<br />
notion, is, thanks of that delays elimination, given by the
<br />
union (which is just the set theoretical interpretation of the or)
<br />
of all portion of UD* (the execution of the UD, an infinite
<br />
three dimensional cone in case the UD is implemented in a
<br />
two dimensional cellular automaton) in which my &quot;preparing coffee&quot;
<br />
state appear. (Reread that sentence slowly, I have written 
<br />
it slowly, and without doubts it's too long).
<br />
<br />So UDA gives the shape of the solution. The technical problem
<br />
which remains is to isolate the &quot;correct&quot; proximity  relation
<br />
among infinite computational histories.
<br />
<br />Do you understand?
<br />
<br />(But here we are near entering the second part of my thesis 
<br />
where I begin to extract that topology/measure from intensional 
<br />
variants of the logic of provability (godelian self reference logic),
<br />
or, as I like to say, I interview the sound universal machine
<br />
about that measure).
<br />
<br />Believe it or not but I drank that coffee unconsciously!!!
<br />
I will try again ... :-)
<br />
<br /><br />Bruno
