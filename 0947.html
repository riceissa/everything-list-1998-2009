Hi,
<br />
<br />Some comments about Devin Harris, Hal Finney, Alasdair Malcolm's
<br />
posts concerning mathematical structures.
<br />
I finish by a short comment on a short question by Wei Dai to
<br />
Hans Moravec, concerning subjectivity/objectivity.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The point could be that there is no collection of mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;structures that are not definable in mathematical terms. 
</em><br />
<br />This is rather similar in spirit to some constructive axiom like
<br />
Brouwer's &quot;all functions are continuous&quot;. Of course such axioms
<br />
are in general just in contradiction with classical logic. But
<br />
their intended logic are in general weaker logic. For exemple
<br />
Brouwer's axiom &quot;all functions are continuous&quot; make perfect sense
<br />
in some formalised intuitionistic analysis.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;All
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mathematical structures necessarily have in common an existence.
</em><br />
<br />This does not necessarily help. You could have said that all
<br />
mathematical structure have in common the fact that they ere equal
<br />
to themselves. But this does not help to give existence to the 
<br />
set V = {x : x = x} in naive set theory. Of course today we would use
<br />
kind of &quot;special&quot; set theory which make possible the mathematical 
<br />
*structuration* of the mathematical universe.
<br />
All first attempts leads to contradiction. Today you can work with
<br />
NF (The Quine New Foundation formalisation of set) with a Universal 
<br />
Set. Nobody is really sure it is consistent, but nobody know for sure 
<br />
it is not. NF is very different from the better knowed ZF (Zermelo
<br />
Fraenkel Theory).
<br />
More generaly you can use any sufficiently big untyped universe.
<br />
Category theory provides tools for doing this in a clean way.
<br />
(I can give you references).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Existence is fundamental. There is no middle ground or alternative.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Systems don't partially exist because there is no other state. There
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;isn't even a choice between existing or not existing. Non-existence by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;definition cannot be. 
</em><br />
<br />Mmmh... My (humble) opinion is that &quot;existence&quot; is relative.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;There is no such thing; no meaning to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;anomalous idea that something doesn't exist. 
</em><br />
<br />I like the idea, but I would put in in the relative way. Everything
<br />
exist for the genuine observer who can looks at things from
<br />
some angle. I would say that there is no meaning to the
<br />
anomalous idea that something doesn't absolutely exist, except that 
<br />
I don't believe in square circle or transcendantal fraction.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;There is no such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;alternative. There is only being. That existence becomes what we think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of as a mathematical system and all mathematical structures are subsets
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the one elementary math. 
</em><br />
<br />Euh ... This is a little to vague.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Consequently it is wrong to imagine two
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mathematical structures that have no relationship to one another or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;somehow form realities that are ultimately incompatible and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;irreconcilable. 
</em><br />
<br />This raises a nice question. In this list lot of people seems
<br />
to appreciate that, in some sense, every world exists.
<br />
But, does this necessarily implies that every worlds are accessible.
<br />
I maintain that if you keep classical logic, the all-accessibility
<br />
will lead you into a contradiction or trivialness. It is your 
<br />
choice to choose a weaker logic, or a suitable frame where 
<br />
all-accessibility axiom can make sense.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;This is to say, there is, always has been, and always
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;will be, a universe. And there is no place the universe is not.
</em><br />
<br />As far I can understand what you are saying here, I want to say
<br />
I am not quite sure about that. But it is very vague.
<br />
Does &quot;universe&quot; means the mathematical universe, the physical
<br />
universe, the MW, the universal object in an untyped formalisation
<br />
of mathematics ...
<br />
<br />You know, I tend to belief in universal turing machines and in their
<br />
extravagant dreams ... and not a lot more ...
<br />
And this entails curiously enough (perhaps) that I belief in the
<br />
MWI interpretation of QM (and of Arithmetical Truth) ...
<br />
More on this below.
<br />
<br /><br />=========================
<br />
<br />Hal wrote:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Does Tegmark attempt to define rigorously what is a &quot;mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;structure&quot;?  I recall his chart showing different mathematical objects
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and their relationship, groups, rings, fields, integers, etc.
</em><br />
<br />It seems to me that Tegmark is not really aware of the problem
<br />
of what is mathematical truth and all the problematic of the foundation
<br />
of mathematics. A recent good book is Feferman's book &quot;In the light
<br />
of Logic&quot;. I recommand a serious reading for those who (unlike me) want
<br />
&nbsp;pursue Tegmark's idea to put an ontology on the &quot;whole mathematics&quot;.
<br />
But the whole task will be disappointing.
<br />
My feeling is that &quot;mathematics&quot; as a whole simply doesn't exist, neither
<br />
objectively, neither subjectively.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps we candefine a mathematical structure as a formal system?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;A formal system consists of axioms and rules of inference.  Its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;theorems are those things which can be proven by starting with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;axioms and applying the rules of inference.
</em><br />
<br />Only a very tiny part of the possible mathematical structures can be
<br />
formalised or axiomatized.
<br />
There is no possible formalisation of Arithmetical Truth.
<br />
This is a consequence of Godel's Theorem.
<br />
<br />This is not a problem for the daily mathematician which
<br />
work with formalisable structures by construction. But it is a problem 
<br />
for 
<br />
those who want make real the whole mathematics, especially
<br />
if they want put some kind of measure on it.
<br />
The daily mathematicien is more concern with organising his knowledge
<br />
than to find an ontological foundation for it. I guess that category
<br />
theory will provided some helps for them. I don't know.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;At a somewhat lower level, it consists of a language, which is the set
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of letters or characters in which theorems are written, and possibly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;some rules about which strings of characters are well formed.  The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;axioms are then strings, and the rules of inference tell how to turn
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;one string into another.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;We can enumerate all possible theorems by starting with all axioms and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;applying all possible rules of inference in turn.  This procedure is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;somewhat like the dovetailing universal computation we have discussed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;which runs all programs at once.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;There are obvious similarities between formal systems and Turing Machine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computations.  In each case we start with an initial state and have rules
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;for evolving the state forward.  The set of possible successor states
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is implicitly determined by the initial state and rules, but usually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the only way to actually learn what they are is to work the procedure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;forward and see what states (theorems) develop.
</em><br />
<br />Indeed. Note that you can add &quot;differential equation&quot;. For them too:
<br />
we start with an initial state and have rules for evolving the state
<br />
forward.  The set of possible successor states is implicitly 
<br />
determined by the initial state and rules, but usually the only way to 
<br />
actually learn what they are is to work the procedure forward and see 
<br />
what states (theorems) develop.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Can this analogy be made tighter?  Can we say that for each TM there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is a formal system whose theorems are the successor states of the TM
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(tape + head)?  Contrariwise, can we say that for each formal system
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;there is a TM which implements it?  I'm sure these questions have been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;studied but I am not familiar with the literature.
</em><br />
<br />You can make an tight analogy between a decidable (completetely 
<br />
axiomatizable) system and a recursive set  (a total machine) and you can 
<br />
make a tight analogy between a semi-decidable (axiomatizable system) 
<br />
with a recursively enumerable set (a partial machine). 
<br />
This is known as Post-Turing thesis, and
<br />
formidable papers are those by Reinhaerdt (I will look for the 
<br />
references).
<br />
My feeling is that Post-Turing thesis and Church Thesis are equivalent, 
<br />
but,
<br />
you know, these question themselves has been formalized. I can even ask 
<br />
this
<br />
question to my (quantified version of) etalon philosophy (G, G*, S4Grz, 
<br />
Z, Z1, Z*, Z1*). Sometimes I suspect that some internal version of 
<br />
Church's Thesis could be unsastified.
<br />
<br />Now the whole problem is to extend that analogy in the tranfinite.
<br />
<br />You can see *theoretical computer science* as a branch of mathematics.
<br />
You can even see it as a branche of integer number theory. But 
<br />
*theoretical
<br />
computer science is typically not *completely* formalisable. 
<br />
Now you can axiomatize portion of it.
<br />
The parts which will provably accessible by a Turing Machine will 
<br />
correspond
<br />
to some constructive or recursive ordinal. And beyond ?
<br />
Beyond : because you can also be interested in parts accessible by some 
<br />
Turing Machine but in a necessary non provable ways. Or in a provable 
<br />
ways,
<br />
&nbsp;but not in a bornable time, or space.
<br />
Or in provable time relatively to the halting problem. After all
<br />
we can also be interested in Turing Machine embedded in a kind of 
<br />
universal
<br />
dovetailer and which bet &quot;NON-STOPPING&quot;, in front of any machine 
<br />
non-stopping machine. In each case a machine is wrong, she will &quot;know 
<br />
it&quot;. In some sense such machine is less and less wrong. And there is a 
<br />
sense to study mathematically the projection or the limit of the set of 
<br />
&quot;beliefs&quot; of these machines...
<br />
So we will arrived to descriptive set theory and eventually to analytical
<br />
sets, ...
<br />
<br />So your question is really extraordinarily complex. With comp, it is 
<br />
ultimately linked to the question of the mathematical learning abilities
<br />
of sequence of evolving collection of Turing machines.
<br />
A very good recent textbook is &quot;Systems that Learn&quot; by Jain, Osherson, 
<br />
Royer,Sharma. MIT press 1999. It is at the intersection of
<br />
limit computing (Gold) and theoretical artificial intelligence (Putnam, 
<br />
Myhill, Case  etc.). It relies heavily on recursion theory.
<br />
The whole field is going in the direction that in the limit the machine
<br />
will ask more questions than solve problems (my modest intuition).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If the answers turned out to be affirmative, it would unify the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Schmidhuber and Tegmark approaches [...]
</em><br />
<br />I think so. I think that Church Thesis and some 'constructive' 
<br />
mathematics could unify both approach.
<br />
The problem is that neither Schmidhuber nor Tegmark seems aware
<br />
of the measure problem linked to the reversal entailed by,
<br />
essentially the fact that, like Everett, they embeds the &quot;observer&quot; in 
<br />
the &quot;observed thing&quot;.
<br />
This is a little weird because the very originality of Everett, is that
<br />
he takes into account the discourse of the machine, and, in physics, 
<br />
is the first to explicitely distinguish the first person (subjective) 
<br />
view and the third person (objective) view.
<br />
The distinction is implicit in Galilee and Einstein.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [...] and move us closer to the goal of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;model which is so simple that it must be true.
</em><br />
<br />Although, as an (Arithmetical or Pythagorean !) Platonist I like
<br />
very much the idea of equating truth and simplicity, I must say
<br />
that my pragmatical realism attracts my attention to the fact that 
<br />
the very presence
<br />
of only one universal turing machine in our neighborhood will make the
<br />
relation between truth and simplicity a glorious and Platonic ideal.
<br />
<br />But there is another problem here. And it is linked with the problem of 
<br />
talking of the *whole mathematical reality.* 
<br />
Chris proposes us today model theory as a tools for our investigations.
<br />
Good idea, but proof theory is needed here too.
<br />
To prevent misunderstanding, model, for the logician (and the painter), 
<br />
means
<br />
a &quot;reality&quot; (essentially a valuation of the propositions of a language in 
<br />
some truth set, for exemple {0, 1}). A theory (the painting) is the little
<br />
syntactical capture of the intended model.
<br />
<br />Now, with theories sufficiently rich to add and multiply numbers, we know,
<br />
by Godel first incompleteness, that you can never syntactically defined 
<br />
the big pictures, at each step (even recursive transfinite) you get still 
<br />
an infinity of non-isomorphic models.
<br />
In fact it is the relation between theories/proof and 
<br />
models/transformation-of-model which are interestings.
<br />
There is a *Galois connection* between theorie and models.
<br />
Adding axiomes in a theory = substracting models for that theory.
<br />
<br />If we take your principle of simplicity, we should choose the simplest
<br />
theory which has ever existed : the empty theory. This theory is one 
<br />
which admit the most models. Indeed in no model at all could you make the 
<br />
null
<br />
theory wrong. But here the link is rather trivial.
<br />
<br />But I have the same intuition than you and I take the next simplest
<br />
theory which is: &quot;there is a universal turing machine here&quot;.
<br />
And then the miracle occurs for, as Godel admits, Church's thesis makes
<br />
computability an absolute notion, the UTM gives a sort of universal object
<br />
&nbsp;and a kind of untyped universe, and ... and everything we need to unify
<br />
Tegmark and Schmidhuber (your term).
<br />
<br />The galois connection and the weakness of the axiom of UTM existence
<br />
make possible a very large &quot;everything&quot; theory or frame, yet nameable!
<br />

</em><br />
<br />In fact both Tegmark and Deutsch (in his critics of Wheeler) don't
<br />
realise (IMHO) that mathematical (even arithmetical) truth in not 
<br />
analytical (in Kant's sense).
<br />
There is no completely objectifiable mathematics (notion of proofs).
<br />
With Church's thesis, there is an absolute notion of computability + the
<br />
immense variety of definable truth sets associated with machines.
<br />
<br />So the answer is :only *these* mathematical structures are meaningfull for
<br />
an UTM, in term of UTMs.
<br />
There is no equivalent notion of 'whole' for mathematical truth as the 
<br />
term is used by Tegmark.
<br />
<br />With Church's thesis (and stronger version ...) it is not at all a
<br />
restriction. And with comp, in some way the splashed UTM (UD*) is a 
<br />
well defined, shallow, mathematical whole.

<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Why do you believe that subjectivity is a subjective attribute? Could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;subjectivity not be an objective attribute?
</em><br />
<br />Good question (IMHO). I would also ask:
<br />
Do you think there is an objective notion of 'objectivity'. Or is 
<br />
'objectivity' a purely subjective notion ?
<br />
<br />Those who follows my posts can guess that my objective notion
<br />
of 'objectivity' is inter-subjectivity or 'relative subjectivity'
<br />
So I need an 'objective' notion of subjectivity.
<br />
Here, in the UTM interview (alias chapter 5, alias etalon philosophy) 
<br />
I use the theetetic definition of the knower.
<br />
<br />But, in the mechanist thought experiments, I use the first/third
<br />
person distinction for memory-machine like Everett.
<br />
Note that Everett use 'inside' and 'outside' 
<br />
instead of 1/3-person, but it is equivalent.
