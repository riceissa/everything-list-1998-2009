2009/7/19 Rex Allen &lt;rexallen314.domain.name.hidden&gt;:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In your view, Bruno (or David, or anyone else who has an opinion),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what kinds of things actually &quot;exist&quot;?  What does it mean to say that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something &quot;exists&quot;?
</em><br />
<br />This is naturally the $64k question for this list - or any other, for
<br />
that matter (pun intended).  I don't know the 'answer' - of course -
<br />
but it doesn't stop me banging on about it interminably, here and
<br />
elsewhere.  Anyway, I'll have another go, but naturally only on the
<br />
basis that anything that follows is just a 'way of speaking' that
<br />
might - or mightn't - be helpful in resolving apparent puzzles
<br />
stemming from linguistic or logical confusions.
<br />
<br />Personally, I find it useful to start from a more primitive position
<br />
prior to speculating about the status of say, mathematical formalisms.
<br />
&nbsp;Like Schopenhauer, Spinoza, Schrodinger and very many others, I find
<br />
dualism to founder hopelessly on the rock of interaction and
<br />
explanatory redundancy.  Hence I'm a monist (or a non-dualist) who -
<br />
given the singular incorrigibility of first-person 'experiential
<br />
reality' - concludes that though whatever underlies remains forever
<br />
*unknowable* it must nonetheless perforce be 'real in the sense that I
<br />
am real' (RITSIAR - a gnomic acronym that has surfaced before on this
<br />
list).  Other primitive intuitions are founded on this:
<br />
<br />1) The unknowable is singular (i.e symmetrical, holistic, indivisible:
<br />
e.g. Plotinus' One)
<br />
2) The unknowable is pluralistic (asymmetrical, differentiated: i.e.
<br />
pattern and order manifested within the One)
<br />
3) 01 and 02 taken together are of course 'paradoxical' in the light of
<br />
the logic of the 'excluded middle'.  This, I believe, is not vicious,
<br />
but rather points virtuously towards the limit of such logics.  It
<br />
situates an unresolvable mystery appropriately, rather than attempting
<br />
speciously to dispel it or ignore it.
<br />
4) 1 and 2 taken together must be RITSIAR.  For me, this comprises the
<br />
intuition that 'existence' is fundamentally - and only - a 'personal
<br />
and present way of being'.  To put it another way, epistemology and
<br />
ontology are enfolded into the unmediated intuition of  'the way one
<br />
is' as follows:
<br />
5) 1 (uniqueness, symmetry) - relating to an intuition of bare
<br />
'reflexive presence' (i.e. the whole is 'present-to-self', as &quot;I am&quot;).
<br />
6) 2 (asymmetry, differentiation) - relating to orderings of
<br />
'motivated self-access' (i.e. an intuition that 'presence' manifests
<br />
in recursive orders of reflexively-intimate self-relativisation.  Note
<br />
that this vitiates and replaces the notions of 'observation' and
<br />
'action' and thereby collapses otherwise infinite regresses.  It also
<br />
welds 'causal closure' to an indivisible primitive intuition that
<br />
enfolds - of necessity - both 'perception' and 'intention'.
<br />
7) All subsets of being, as it were - including the first-personal -
<br />
emerge as a consequence of the 'superset of being' (the '0-personal')
<br />
'getting a grip on itself' (or better: *oneself*).
<br />
8) Taken together, 5, 06 and 07 collapse into a basic intuition of
<br />
existence as - always and everywhere - constituted by a 'personal
<br />
self-actualisation' which is posited to be characteristic of reality
<br />
'from the ground up'.
<br />
<br />The foregoing treatment attempts to summarise a (well-known: e.g.
<br />
Plotinus, Vedanta, etc.) set of intuitions intended to underpin other
<br />
notions of 'existence' in all its forms - i.e. any other postulation
<br />
of 'existence' whatsoever is parasitic on the 'master' intuition that
<br />
whatever 'exists' must be 'personally present as an actualised
<br />
way-of-being'.  So, in this light, what of the 'existence' of
<br />
mathematics, 'possible' worlds, and other such 'abstractions'?  Well,
<br />
they indeed qualify in this sense (trivially) in the form of our
<br />
shared 'mental constructions'.  But are they additionally present - in
<br />
some other form - *in-their-own-right*?  One's view on this will
<br />
clearly depend on the way one's theories (implicit or explicit) posit
<br />
how the particular zoo of worlds, universes etc. one favours emerges
<br />
from the ground outlined above.  I would dichotomise such views into
<br />
two camps: necessitist and contingentist.
<br />
<br />COMP, I think (but I may be off-beam here: see below) falls into the
<br />
first camp.  As far as 'reality' goes in COMP, I'm reasonably sure
<br />
that what Bruno (conceding that he is almost always way ahead of me on
<br />
any of this) implies in the metaphysics (or theology) of COMP, is that
<br />
'arithmetical reality' should be regarded as 'real' and 'present' in
<br />
more or less the sense of 'RITSIAR'.  Hence, the 'Platonic existence'
<br />
that underpins COMP is RITSIAR.  By this I don't mean the 'numbers'
<br />
and 'operators' that we denote verbally or in writing - these of
<br />
course are just a 'way of speaking' - a language.  Rather these
<br />
symbols gesture towards an unknowable domain that nonetheless
<br />
possesses these characteristics in some (rigorously definable?) sense.
<br />
&nbsp;And this domain is inescapably 'personal' - it is 'us', and it is
<br />
everything else, too.
<br />
<br />One astonishing consequence of this schema is that any 'possible
<br />
world' derivable from such a RITSIAR intuition of mathematical
<br />
infinities must also be 'real' in this sense (though this is not the
<br />
same as experiential coherence: hence the need to invoke filters such
<br />
as COMP).  This directly implies something like MWI, or at least 'many
<br />
minds', and the radical indeterminacy of the first-person (although
<br />
this can also be a consequence, in a 'non-computational' and more
<br />
restricted sense, of 'weak' materialism).  Whether one considers this
<br />
is a defect or an advantage depends on temperament, I believe.  One
<br />
thing I notice about it, however, is that it seems to ground the idea
<br />
of 'what is' firmly on *necessity*.  Bruno has frequently remarked on
<br />
the independence of mathematical truths of anyone's believing them,
<br />
but I'm not quite sure if he means that one should thereby take this
<br />
to transcend all notions of 'contingency'.
<br />
<br />In other words, does this view hold that the ineluctable, independent
<br />
'necessity' of mathematical 'truth' is capable of, as it were, of
<br />
*invoking* 'what is' - thereby resolving the Wittgensteinian mystery:
<br />
&quot;that the world is&quot;?  Or does 'what is' merely comprise that which is
<br />
'contingently necessary'?  That is, our discovery of its actual
<br />
presence, prior to time and space, necessarily - radically - excludes
<br />
its non-presence, but nonetheless we retain the intuition (perhaps
<br />
incoherently) that - counter factually - it 'might not have been thus
<br />
present'?
<br />
<br />Easy, eh?  I don't imagine for a moment that the foregoing is
<br />
compelling enough, or sufficiently coherently conceived or expressed,
<br />
to persuade anyone who isn't already lurching in that direction.
<br />
However, having recently been extending my reading and thinking in
<br />
this area (yet again!) I feel a renewed interest in continuing the
<br />
debate, should anyone feel motivated, which might advance mutual
<br />
understanding just a little (the impetus, I take it, behind this
<br />
list).

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So what are your thoughts on my question as to whether abstract

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concepts other than numbers also exist in a platonic sense?  For

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; example, the idea of &quot;red&quot;?

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So obviously we can cast everything as numbers and say, &quot;In this

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; talking about here, and 0xff000000 is just a place holder...a symbol
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for what actually exists.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In your view, Bruno (or David, or anyone else who has an opinion),

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what kinds of things actually &quot;exist&quot;?  What does it mean to say that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something &quot;exists&quot;?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It seems to me that maybe consciousness is actually very simple.  It
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is just a group of platonic ideals, like red, that are related to each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other by a point of view:  &quot;I like red&quot;, or &quot;I see a red sphere.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maybe what is complicated is constructing or identifying a causal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure (e.g., a machine, a brain, a program, etc) whose evolving
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; state can be interpreted as representing a series of &quot;connected&quot; or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;related&quot; instances of consciousness.  But the machine (physical or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; otherwise) is NOT that consciousness, the machine just represents that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In this view, consciousness itself consists directly of the abstract
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; platonic ideals that form the contents of a given moment of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It remains to explain the relative stability of that illusion. How and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; why some dreams glue, in a way sufficiently precise for making
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; predictions about them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maybe unstable illusions exist, but, being unstable, don't ponder such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; questions?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Obviously we have such conscious beings here in this world, with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; schizophrenics and the like.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So your questions about &quot;why are my perceptions so orderly&quot;, would NOT
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be universally valid questions, because there are conscious entities
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whose perceptions are NOT orderly.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And I would say that even my perceptions are not consistently orderly,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as when I dream I often experience strange scenarios.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To say that dreaming and hallucinating are special cases I think is to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; make an unfounded assumption.  It would seem to me that orderly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perceptions are the special case, and dream-logic realities would be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the norm.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If consciousness is in some way a result of computation, then a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; program that generates all possible mind-simulations will surely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; result in the vast majority of resulting minds experiencing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dream-logic realities, not &quot;law-and-order&quot; realities like ours.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think Sean Carroll (who I'm reasonably sure would disagree with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everything I've proposed above, but still) had a pretty good point on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such &quot;counter-intuitive&quot; predictions:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;The same logic applies, for example, to the highly contentious case
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the multiverse. The multiverse isn’t, by itself, a theory; it’s a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prediction of a certain class of theories. If the idea were simply
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; “Hey, we don’t know what happens outside our observable universe, so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; maybe all sorts of crazy things happen,” it would be laughably
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; uninteresting. By scientific standards, it would fall woefully short.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But the point is that various theoretical attempts to explain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; phenomena that we directly observe right in front of us — like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; gravity, and quantum field theory — lead us to predict that our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe should be one of many, and subsequently suggest that we take
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that situation seriously when we talk about the “naturalness” of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; various features of our local environment. The point, at the moment,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is not whether there really is or is not a multiverse; it’s that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way we think about it and reach conclusions about its plausibility is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; through exactly the same kind of scientific reasoning we’ve been using
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for a long time now. Science doesn’t pass judgment on phenomena; it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; passes judgment on theories.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So, I could continue further and go into a lengthy defense of why I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think this supports what I'm saying, BUT maybe you'll come to the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conclusion I have and I can save myself a lot of typing!  So, I'll
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just try that approach first.
