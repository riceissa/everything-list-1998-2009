<br />
Thank you Jose, for your slightly more civilised approach to my  
<br />
(admittedly) provocative thought about music's relation to our  
<br />
discussion on this list. Many people would argue (Edward de Bono as a  
<br />
primary example) that the whole meaning of any artistic product is  
<br />
the meaning that our minds bring to bear on it, whatever the author  
<br />
says. If that is &quot;true&quot; then the whole of art is a 1st person  
<br />
experience and cannot be reduced to anything else. I take it that we  
<br />
are investigating the ultimate mystery of 1st person experience  
<br />
(amongst other things) here. My point of view on that is surely as  
<br />
valid as yours since neither you nor I can appreciate (ie experience)  
<br />
each other's experience of anything.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that a little provocation from an &quot;outsider&quot; would actually  
<br />
help the discussion find new and fertile terrain - this is called  
<br />
lateral thinking. If you reject without some form of investigation  
<br />
the notion that music is encoded mathematical reality then I feel  
<br />
very sad for you. Many musicaians have striven to understand the link  
<br />
between music and mathematics. You cannot &quot;play&quot; a quadratic equation  
<br />
on your piano. Yet you can appreciate a melody by Mozart or a guitar  
<br />
break by Joe Satriani in JUST THE SAME WAY that you experience the  
<br />
elegance of a mathematical sentence. Do not physicists and  
<br />
mathematicians have a certain feeling for &quot;elegance&quot; and  
<br />
&quot;symmetry&quot;???? Is it not at least slightly interesting that composers  
<br />
and other artists strive for something like that as well????? What if  
<br />
we are all talking the same language but simply don't have the  
<br />
intellectual grunt to PERCEIVE that?
<br />
<br />Notating music is a very simple problem for a computer to solve,  
<br />
admittedly. Composing music is a very controversial problem that  
<br />
people are trying to enlist the help of machines to solve at this  
<br />
time. UNDERSTANDING music takes a n EDUCATION in it. Just like  
<br />
understanding math requires a solid grounding in that discipline.
<br />
<br />Do not undedrestimate the power of the simple. There is a lot of talk  
<br />
on this list about complexity but I have had enough dialogues with  
<br />
other minds to be convinced that simplicity is a higher value in life  
<br />
than complexity. After all, simplicity and elegance is what  
<br />
physicists and philosophers are hankering after.
<br />
<br />Musicians have been dealing in that since the time of Machaut in the  
<br />
15th century. Let's get together and talk seriously about this link.  
<br />
There is something vaguely ridiculous about playing this eternal game  
<br />
of trying to &quot;prove&quot; each other wrong.
<br />
<br />There are quite as many points of view on this issue as there are  
<br />
heads in the room thinking about it. There is great meaning in what  
<br />
you say. There is great meaning in what I say.  Don't ATTACK me and I  
<br />
promise not to attack you.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; So apparently those who do not scale the dizzying heights of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; metamathematics have no hope of understanding reality?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I never said that, but you simply can't take a theorem about a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; specific area, that is true
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; within a context and take it out from that context to try to use it  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;in reality&quot;, to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;give&quot; social explanations. That's what pseudoscience do.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I will say that without mathematical (not methamatematical)  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; knowledge, one cannot aspire
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to understand reality (in the terms a physic understand it).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; There will come a time very soon when all of this comp stuff will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; need to be translated into terms the LAYman can understand easily.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Russell Standish has already made the attempt. I appreciate gratly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; his attempt. Stop wanking off that mathematics is the ONLY script in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; which reality is encoded. It could well turn out to be music.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You are thinking it the other way around - the incorrect one. Music  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is a small, small part
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of physics, and therefore, it's represented by a (quite simple)  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical model.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Reality is more complex than that model, and other aspects of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality can be modelled by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; math different from the one used in the music model, so the reality  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can't turn out to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; music in that sense.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, I'm speaking about the mechanical phenomena of music, that  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are simple, not about the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way our brains interpret it, that can be quite complex and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; enjoyable (that's why we say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it's an art).
</em><br />
