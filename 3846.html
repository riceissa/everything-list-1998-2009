<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Googling on &quot;causality&quot; led to a brief web page that summarized

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;2000 years of philosophical thought in a few paragraphs,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;<a href="http://www.helsinki.fi/~mqsalo/documents/causalit.htm">http://www.helsinki.fi/~mqsalo/documents/causalit.htm</a>.  Generally there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;seem to be two schools of thought; one is that causality is an artifact
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of our minds' efforts to understand and interpret the world; the other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is that causality has objective reality.
</em><br />
<br /><br />With comp you get both at once. Causality can be seen as a law of mind.
<br />
Eventually and fundamentally causal computations rest on arithmetical
<br />
laws, like (3 divides 17) entails ((3 = 1) or (3 = 17)), so that (3 does
<br />
not divide 17), etc.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The real mystery is why our physical laws are time symmetric.
</em><br />
<br /><br />But what are physical laws? Where does those laws come from.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Functionalists adopt essentially the view that Bruno calls COMP,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that consciousness is a computational phenomenon and any system which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;implements the corresponding computation will be conscious.  This is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the foundation for ideas of &quot;uploading&quot;, that is, brain simulation by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computer.  Functionalists believe such simulations are conscious in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;same way that the brain was, provided that the simulation is performing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the same computation that the brain did.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK. Note that functionalists presuppose the level being high (at the
<br />
biological brain level for example). Although in the thought experiment
<br />
I presuppose also a high level, I explicitly shows that the
<br />
reasoning works on any levels (once it exists). Even if the only way
<br />
to duplicate me consists in solving DeWitt-Wheeler equation of the
<br />
&quot;entire quantum cosmic universe&quot;, the conclusion prevails. This because,
<br />
for example, the UD will generate solutions of the Dewitt-Wheeler.
<br />
Comp entails that the universe is not computable (not generate by a
<br />
program) except if &quot;I am the universe&quot;. This case is a degenerate form of
<br />
comp with a non-comp look.
<br />
.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;This then raises the question of whether a particular physical system
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(like a computer) is implementing a particular computation (which is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;an abstract program, perhaps expressed in some computing language).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Surprisingly, this is a difficult and yet unsolved question in philosophy.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Surprisingly?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;No one has ever come up with a widely accepted, hard and fast rule or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;procedure to decide whether a physical system is implementing a given
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computation.
</em><br />
<br /><br />There is an interesting result, known as Rice Theorem, which shows
<br />
that there is no algorithm capable of saying if a given program
<br />
computes or not ... the factorial function (or whatever!).
<br />
If you find that hard to believe, tell me if the following
<br />
programs compute the factorial:
<br />
<br />Begin &lt;is-it-fact? var = n&gt;
<br />
Giving n, search for a formal proof of the twin primes conjecture
<br />
in Peano Arithmetic, once you get it compute output n*(n-1)* ...1
<br />
End &lt;is-it-fact?&gt;
<br />
<br />This proves nothing of course.
<br />
But the general result is a direct consequence of the universality +
<br />
self-referential abilities of machine. Little programs can behave
<br />
in &quot;uncomputable&quot; (in the sense of unpredictable) ways.
<br />
With comp there is two form of indeterminacy: 1)the form of immediate
<br />
first person indeterminacy due to self-duplicability, and 2) a form
<br />
of third person unpredictability in the long run. There exists evidence
<br />
that this long run unpredictability is related to deterministic chaos.
<br />
Both are important in the rise of consciousness + physical laws.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Broadly speaking, the basic approach is to set up a mapping or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;correspondence between aspects of the physical system and aspects
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the abstract computation.
</em><br />
<br />Don't forget to set up a mapping between the abstract computation
<br />
and the personal experience of the person being simulated.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;This works well in this case, but there are two problems.  The first is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that it does not capture the causal nature of the program.  A computer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;which was not actually computing, but just playing back a recorded pattern
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of charge distributions, would successfully satisfy the mapping.  I'll say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;more about this in a moment.  The second problem is that by making the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mapping more elaborate, one can show that simple, even trivial systems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are implementing complex computations; essentially you do all the work
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in the mapping.  It's hard to set up a concrete rule for how complex
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the mapping can be, and I don't believe anyone has succeeded in this yet.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Observe that comp doesn't have that problem. Consciousness and 
<br />
physical reality appears where anticipations remains stable, almost 
<br />
by definition.
<br />
In that sense comp generalizes the anthropic principle, making it a
<br />
consistent-machine-thropic principle.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;But the more relevant problem for now is the issue of causality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Most functionalist philosophers believe that for a physical system to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;truly implementing a computation, it must include all of the causality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of that computation and not just &quot;passively&quot; reproduce the patterns.
</em><br />
<br />And here Maudlin 1989 argument or my Toulouse Movie graph 1988 paper (see
<br />
&quot;movie&quot; in the archive) shows that such counterfactualness cannot
<br />
be captured in any singular physical exemplifications. Here also, the
<br />
&quot;everything idea&quot; is hardly avoidable.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;When we apply this rule to the functionalist model of consciousness, it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;works out like this: if a system has the right causality, it is conscious;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;if it is only passive, it is not conscious.
</em><br />
<br />I could swallow this sentence. the &quot;right causality&quot; is not so different
<br />
from the relative self-referential correctness of the hopefully
<br />
consistent machine.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This elevates causality to having a functional role in the physical world!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It makes the difference between a system having a mind and just being an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;elaborate tape recorder.  It means that we cannot view causality as just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;an artifact of our perceptions, it must be a true element of reality.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes. A true element of the reality of mind. A fundamental principle
<br />
operating at more than one level.
<br />
It is the &quot;material singular&quot; aspect of reality which is an artifact
<br />
of the mind.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;[...]
</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree very much with your post where you say:
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;One of the criticisms of no-collapse theories has always bothered me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Some people say that the mystery of non-determinism in conventional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interpretations of QM is replaced by an equally baffling mystery in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;no-collapse theories: why do I end up in *this* branch rather than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;some other?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The critics understand, I presume, that observers end up in all branches
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;asking themselves this question.  But they still seem to think there is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;some mystery about the process, something that needs to be explained.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I don't see what the mystery is.  We have often considered thought
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;experiments involving duplicating machines, which show the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;phenomenon.   A man walks into a duplicating machine and two men walk out,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;each having equal claim to being the original.  Both ask this question:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;Why did I end up as *this* person instead of the other one?&quot;
</em><br />
<br />Note that when you say:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Traditionally, no-collapse models were also criticized on two other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;grounds.  (I will ignore the complaint that the theory is inparsimonious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in its creation of multiple universes, because IMO this is more than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;made up for by the simplicity of the theory.  Algorithmic complexity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;theory teaches us that it is the size of the program that counts, not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the size of the data, and that is the measure we have used on this list.)
</em><br />
<br />I also ignore that complains, but not exactly for the same reason.
<br />
Although the size of the programs needs to be taken into account, it is
<br />
the degree of &quot;self-splittability&quot; of the programs which plays the 
<br />
most important role for making  our histories more relatively stable.
<br />
This follows from the fact that I must consider also
<br />
the reconstitution made by the UD of my current comp state generated
<br />
slowly (through a very long computation) by arbitrary big programs.
<br />
Those arbitrary big programs are infinitely more numerous than little
<br />
programs for obvious reason. The UD cannot be made non redundant.
<br />
Consciousness stabilizes when little programs generates vast data/programs
<br />
with a high degree of &quot;self-splittability&quot; generating big numbers
<br />
of (relatively) similar histories.
