</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;if we take comp seriously (comp = AR + TC + &quot;yes doctor&quot;) then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physics is eventually a branch of machine's psychology (itself a branch

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of computer science&quot; itself a branch of number theory.&quot;
</em><br />
<br /><br />BM:
<br />
But your very quote of what I said confirms what I was saying. I don't 
<br />
understand.
<br />
When I say IF comp is true THEN physics is a branch of machine psychology, 
<br />
it is part of the prood that comp will imply monistic idealism. This comes 
<br />
from the UD Argument. You have not yet tell me at which steps you disagree (cf
<br />
<a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m3044.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m3044.html</a>
<br />
I could simplify my presentation by postulating what i call sometime 
<br />
Pythagorean COMP,
<br />
which postulates Arithmetical Realism AND NO MORE (but in my thesis that &quot;pyth&quot;
<br />
is a consequence, i have worked hard enough for not postulating it :)).
<br />
<br /><br /><br />SPK:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;We cannot dismiss physicality!
</em><br />
<br />BM:
<br />
Why? We can certainly dismiss it in the hypothesis once we explain its 
<br />
appearance. That is the point of the technical part of my thesis. Wait 
<br />
perhaps a little bit I provide more explanation.
<br />
I just don't need the physicalist hypothesis, and besides I show it 
<br />
incompatible with comp (UDA).
<br />
<br /><br />SPK:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     One thing that I have always been attracted by in science and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematics is that I was not required to blindly believe some statement. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What you are asking of me is not different from the &quot;blind faith&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (unjustified belief) that I was raised in by Fundamentalist Christian 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; parents. You must understand that I have a severe allergy to postulations 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that cannot be justified.
</em><br />
<br /><br />BM:
<br />
I do not ask you to believe in anything!    I do just prove the following 
<br />
two things:
<br />
<br />1) IF comp is correct THEN indeed a machine must make an act of faith to 
<br />
PRACTICE it.
<br />
(Put in another way : if COMP is correct, then if a doctor tells you that 
<br />
science implies comp, then you KNOW he is a lier).
<br />
As an analogy (which will run deeper latter) it is like CONSISTENCY for a 
<br />
machine:
<br />
IF a machine is consistent THEN the machine cannot prove it. With Godel + 
<br />
comp, you can guess that even just self-consistency need a sort of &quot;blind 
<br />
faith&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;SPK:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     On The Other Hand (OTOH), I agree with your statement about Gödel 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theorem: If I am a machine I will be unable to &quot;prove&quot; that I am. That is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not my problem. My problem is in finding a falsifiable justification for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the belief that &quot;I am a Machine&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><br />BM:
<br />
But this is exactly what I provide: I show (simplifying a little bit for 
<br />
reason of shortness, giving that is what I am suppose to explain, but it 
<br />
*is* &quot;my thesis&quot;):
<br />
<br />IF comp is true then physics is given by the propositions which are
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) true in all our consistent extensions
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) true in at least one consistent extension
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(By Godel, 1 does not imply 2 !)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) accessible par the universal dovetailer.
<br />
<br />This is translated by
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;observable(p)  =   []p &amp; &lt;&gt;p, with p sigma_1.
<br />
<br />I showed: 1) the logic of &quot;observable(p)&quot; obeys a sort of quantum logic.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) that logic is sufficiently constrained to derive the 
<br />
whole physical probailities.
<br />
<br />To evaluate comp, it is enough to compare those probabilities with the 
<br />
empirically evaluated probabilities.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />BM: previous
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;You say that again. Perhaps you are right. I would be please to know some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;references.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In the case of monistic idealist theory I do think &quot;phenomena&quot; or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;appearances&quot; are less misleading terms.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;Until the present century the duality of mind and brain was never in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;question except, that is, to the adherents of various Idealist or

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Phenomenalist doctrines which, in defiance of common sense, insisted that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;matter was just a construction of mind and had no ontological 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;independence. What was at issue was whether the brain was self-sufficient 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and operated on a purely physical basis or whether mind could intervene in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;its operations so as to ensure one overt action rather than another. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Determinists insisted that the brain was a machine and so mental events 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;could have no influence on behaviour, they were mere 'epiphenomena.' &quot;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Another term related to this Problem, as it occurs of Monistic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Materialism is &quot;conscious inessentialism&quot;.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;What this basically means is that, in principle, all the actions we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;perform can be performed without consciousness.  Walking, eating, sleeping 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and talking are all things that our bodies can do.  They don&#x2019;t, in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;principle, require consciousness in order to do them.  It should be noted 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that in discussions about zombies, consciousness is considered to be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;qualia of any kind.  We&#x2019;re not just talking about being able to think 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;abstractly here.  For something not to be conscious, it must not be able 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to feel anything.  Zombies don&#x2019;t experience anything at all.  It&#x2019;s not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;like anything to be a zombie.  Now, we&#x2019;re left with the question: if 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consciousness isn&#x2019;t required for the things we do, could beings exist 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;which perform these things without being conscious (i.e. could 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;philosophical zombies exist)?  Now, if such beings could exist, it&#x2019;s very 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;important to stress that they would be capable of doing everything we are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;capable of.  Therefore, there could be a bunch of zombies sitting in a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;classroom discussing the merits of conscious inessentialism.  There could 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be a zombie who refuses to go on a plane and says he&#x2019;s afraid of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;heights.  There could be a zombie acting angry at the fact that he didn&#x2019;t 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;win the lottery.&quot;
</em><br />
<br /><br />BM:
<br />
Your quotations illustrate well what I was saying.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />SPK:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Basically, the Problem, as I see it in your thought, boils down to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the fact that all examples of &quot;physicality&quot; are mere &quot;appearances&quot; that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should have no &quot;causal efficacy&quot;, e.g. that any appearance that physical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; state X &quot;causes&quot; physical state Y is merely some numerical relation. The 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Physical World&quot; is just a 1st person &quot;appearance&quot;. I have no problem 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that that IFF we only considered a single Observer. When we consider many 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observers, each with their own 1st person &quot;world of appearance&quot;, How can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we recover any coherent notion of a 3rd person view? Somehow, the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;appearances&quot; have to mesh together and be synchronized!
</em><br />
<br /><br />BM:
<br />
I agree it looks impossible, but then tell me where I am wrong.
<br />
Be carefull to distinguish clearly (especially for the benefit of the 
<br />
others, what I do postulate at the beginning, and what I pretend (at least) 
<br />
having deduce from the postulates).
<br />
<br /><br />SPK:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Leibniz considered such a situation in his Monadology and argued that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the synchrony of appearances where due to a &quot;pre-ordained harmony&quot;.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     I am arguing that such a &quot;pro-ordained harmony&quot; is impossible because 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it would require the computation of all possible interactions between all 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible observers and find, among these, the one that, to use the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics term, has the &quot;least action&quot;. I assume that your Universal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dovetailer could do such a computation, but have a serious problem with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the claim that the mere a priori existence of a numerical representation 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of that computation is sufficient to derive all of our 1st person 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appearances.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />BM:
<br />
Show it, and you will refute comp. My attempt to show it has lead me toward 
<br />
QM, so
<br />
I conclude it is premature (at least) to conclude comp is incorrect.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;SPK:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  My claim is that such a computation requires at least one &quot;step&quot; and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that for it do have such it has to be &quot;implemented&quot; somehow. If the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computation has to be &quot;implemented&quot; in order to account for appearances, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could we not consider that the &quot;physicality&quot; that we experience is the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;implementation&quot; itself?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     This idea seems to argue for a kind of dualism, doesn't it?
</em><br />
<br /><br />BM:
<br />
Perhaps, but then you should be able to either find an error in my 
<br />
deduction, or to
<br />
abandon the comp hyp (no problem with that).
<br />
Then you will need to explain me what is matter, what is mind and how they 
<br />
are related.
<br />
(With comp we do not need the materialist hypothesis.)
<br />
<br /><br /><br />SPK:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you must admit that &quot;anticipation&quot; implies the existence of 
<br />
&quot;temporal transitivity&quot; in that an anticipated event is one that is 
<br />
predicted to be experienced somehow but such an event has not yet occurred. 
<br />
This takes me right back to my question about how it is that we can recover 
<br />
the experience of time from COMP. There is no &quot;time&quot; in Platonia! All that 
<br />
exists is co-present, there is no meaningful notion of &quot;delay&quot; or 
<br />
&quot;duration&quot;. How do we fit &quot;at least one computational step&quot; in this?
<br />
<br /><br />BM:
<br />
This is an important question, but I told you before to wait I show how to 
<br />
extract the &quot;temporal/intuitionistic&quot; logic S4Grz.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;BM: previous:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Please remind me what means &quot;OTOH&quot; I always forget this one!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It is not sufficient to make that act of faith to solve the mind-body 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;problem, I agree. Although it is sufficient for surviving the digital 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;brain transplantation (if comp is correct).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But I'm afraid the (epi)phenomena are addressed. I can even sum the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;technics up in one short sentence: just apply the Theaetetus' definition 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of knowledge from opinion with opinion defined by machine's formal provability.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;[SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;      Bruno, this looks like circular reasoning! COMP assumes digital 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; substitution, thus we have to &quot;believe&quot; in digital substitution to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; believe COMP! The question, for me, is: How could we Falsify COMP?
</em><br />
<br /><br />BM:
<br />
See above.
<br />
<br /><br />SPK:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I see Digital brain transplantation as the falsifiable aspect of your 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;theory and thus most of my questions are pointed at it. ;-)
</em><br />
<br /><br />BM:
<br />
I really try to do that!  Comp asks for an act of faith IF TRUE, but if 
<br />
false then it is falsifiable by comparing the comp-physics and the 
<br />
empirical physics.
<br />
I will not answer your last questions because it anticipates on what I feel 
<br />
the need to still explain for the technical part of the thesis, and I want 
<br />
to avoid too much repetitions. My general feeling is that you do have a 
<br />
sort of (blind?) faith in matter or physicalities. But then just abandon 
<br />
comp or tell at which step of the UDA you are stuck. OK?
<br />
<br />Have you bought the book &quot;forver undecided&quot; by Smullyan? It can help a lot.
<br />
<br />Kindest regards,
<br />
<br />Bruno
