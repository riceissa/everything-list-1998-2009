<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This brings up an interesting conundrum that I raised three or four 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;torture
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; experiments ago. Given 10 instantiations of a person having an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;unpleasant
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; experience E ... for example 10 sentient programs running in parallel, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; it better, if we aim to reduce suffering, to (a) terminate 9 of the 10
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; programs and leave one still running and experiencing E, or (b) stop 5 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the 10 programs from experiencing E, but leave them running,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Ah ha! And having what sort of experience?  It's crucial: I shall
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;assume that they are having very mildly positive experiences, e.g.,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that their lives are barely worth living in this condition.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, this is what I meant: that given a 49% chance of escaping E and living, 
<br />
or a 50% chance of escaping E by dying, dying would be the preferred option.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and leave the other 5 programs continuing to experience E?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I will say that it is better to terminate 9 of the 10,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;because we are given that the experience E is horrible
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But I would argue that if you are one of the suffering victims,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (a) does you no good at all: subjectively, you will continue to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; suffer, since the one remaining program that is running will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; serve as continuation for any of the 9 terminated ones.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Here is the dreadful &quot;closest continuer&quot; method of Nozick and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;others. I claim it gives the wrong answer. Look, the &quot;continuation&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;happens anyway, whether you die here or not!  Especially if the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;events are outside each other's light cones, how can what happens
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;here possibly affect what happens there?  Just because you, say,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are *not* terminated here does not mean that you don't &quot;continue&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;there just as much.
</em><br />
<br />It is the &quot;closest&quot; part of Nozick's method that I disagree with, based as 
<br />
it is on the assumption that that there can only be one &quot;real&quot; you - the 
<br />
closest continuer - out of multiple possible candidates. I believe that even 
<br />
though someone can only *experience* being one person at a time, in the 
<br />
event of duplication all the copies have an equal claim to being 
<br />
continuations of the original, and it is in attempting to reconcile these 
<br />
two facts that I arrive at the notion of subjective probabilities for the 
<br />
next observer moment.
<br />
<br />As for everything else you say in the above paragraph, I agree completely! I 
<br />
had been assuming that the experiment was being done in an isolated system, 
<br />
but if you take into account the rest of the multiverse, there is no reason 
<br />
why the continuer (or successor OM) at the point where the (a)/(b) decision 
<br />
is being made must come from the experiment rather than, say, 10^10^100 
<br />
metres away. (Some might argue that there has to be some sort of information 
<br />
transfer if the successor OM is to count, but I can't see why this should be 
<br />
so.)
<br />
<br />The number of successor OM's and the type of experiences they are having is 
<br />
important, and it changes the calculations to determine the subjective 
<br />
probabilities. Let's assume that the external successor OM's all have a 
<br />
bland, average sort of experience, similar to the alternative to E in choice 
<br />
(b). If there is one other successor OM, then choice (b) would still be 
<br />
better:
<br />
<br />(a) Pr(E)=1/2, (b) Pr(E)=5/11
<br />
<br />If there were two external successor OM's, choice (a) would now be better:
<br />
<br />(a) Pr(E)=1/3, (b) Pr(E)=5/12
<br />
<br />If there were more than two external successor OM's, (a) would be an even 
<br />
better choice.
<br />
<br />Given the existence of the rest of the multiverse, where all sorts of things 
<br />
impossible for us here to know, let alone control, may be happening or (more 
<br />
importantly) may in future happen to other versions of us, a general 
<br />
argument can be made that it *is* helpful to increase our measure as much as 
<br />
possible, as a sort of counterbalance to any terrible things that may be 
<br />
happening to us elsewhere. It is the relative measure, which determines 
<br />
subjective probability of what our next moment will be like, which is 
<br />
important rather than absolute measure per se. In most cases it may turn out 
<br />
the same whether you look at it your way or my way, but in certain special 
<br />
cases, such as the thought experiment above considered as an isolated 
<br />
system, there are differences.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; In fact, there is no way for someone inside the simulated system
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to know that any of the instantiations had been terminated, as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; long as at least one keeps running.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Well, even if they are ALL terminated, the subject does not know.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Knowing is an activity, and so you don't know if suddenly you all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;die.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; On the other hand, with (b) there is subjectively a 50% probability that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; your suffering will end.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;People who use probability when discussing duplicates seem to talk
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;as though an executing process had a magical serial number generated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;by God. When the subject dies, it's as if the serial number is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;instantaneously transferred to *one* other of the possible systems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that could support him, but not to the others. But there are no souls.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;There are no serial numbers. You become all the others equally, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with 100% probability for each. You even become them if &quot;you&quot; do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not die.
</em><br />
<br />There is no transfer of anything, and no-one &quot;becomes&quot; anyone else, or even 
<br />
a future version of himself. I don't even think these things are true for 
<br />
ordinary, moment to moment existence, let alone duplication. If you want to 
<br />
use terms like this, then you do have to resort to something like a soul to 
<br />
hold it all together. All that really exists is a series of conscious 
<br />
moments (or a series of sentient observers, if you prefer) which are 
<br />
interpreted by our brains as a unique individual persisting through time, 
<br />
based on such things as memories and a &quot;sense of identity&quot;. This is not just 
<br />
a belief, like the belief that the Earth is flat because it looks flat, and 
<br />
the concept of a spherical Earth has not provided any survival advantage 
<br />
during man's evolutionary history. It is more like an ovewhelming, pervasive 
<br />
conviction, no matter how rational a person you are. Perhaps it would have 
<br />
been different had we evolved in a world where copying and encounters with 
<br />
one's copy were common. But we did not; we evolved in a world where copies 
<br />
are hidden away in parallel universes we can never contact, if MWI is true, 
<br />
allowing us to continue thinking that we are unique and that probability 
<br />
theory describes what happens to us as we live our life.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;What will happen if you choose A is that you will experience E through
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;one bad session. If you choose B, you will experience E through five
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;bad sessions, and E' through five so-so sessions. Given that E' is of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;no particular value either positive or negative, A is the better choice.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(This is just using different language to do the same calculation as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;above.)
</em><br />
<br />Do you doubt that each of the 10 copies if you choose (a) will continue 
<br />
experiencing E? Is it a problem with cramming 10 minds pre-choice into one 
<br />
mind post-choice? If you accept that there are no serial numbers, no 
<br />
transfer of consciousness, no soul, and the only thing that matters in 
<br />
maintaining the illusion of continuity of identity over time is the 
<br />
relationship between the memories and &quot;sense of identity&quot; of the earlier and 
<br />
the later version, you will see that (a) perfectly satisfies this 
<br />
relationship, and all 10 versions will continue to suffer. Note also that if 
<br />
the 10 versions started to diverge, then the relationship no longer holds: 
<br />
only *one* of the 10 will have a continuer after choice (a); the rest will 
<br />
be dead.
