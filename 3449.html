<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Do you understand Marchal's postings? I really have trouble making sense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of them. If you do, would you mind rephrasing his main ideas for me?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />And Juergen Schmidhuber answered:
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;No, unfortunately I do not understand him. But provability does seem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;important to him.  Maybe someone else could post a brief and concise
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;summary?
</em><br />
<br /><br />I appreciate very much Juergen talking now as if perhaps something
<br />
was understandable in my posts. That's a reconforting step. Thanks.
<br />
<br />But I am astonished by Wei Dai's remark. 
<br />
I guess I react even to much to it probably.
<br />
Here is why.
<br />
<br />First: why saying this now after I send more than 500 posts to the list.
<br />
Second: I enter the list because I have seen many people sharing
<br />
similar ideas with mine, with somehow different formulations. In brief 
<br />
everything exists ... with some measure. Then *you*, Wei,have discovered
<br />
that terrible ASSA/RSSA distinction which leads indeed toward mainly
<br />
two deeply different interpretations of &quot;everything exists&quot;:
<br />
the absolute one which makes apparently possible bayesian type of
<br />
anthropic reasoning (on a very fuzzy reference base though).
<br />
The relative one, which in my opinion is the one by Everett with his
<br />
universal wave function. This one leads to the search of a neighborhood
<br />
structure between the observer-moment, alias possible first person
<br />
universe. (through the comp or even QM reversal).
<br />
Imo, the relative one need the or a 1-person/3-person distinction.
<br />
<br />When you single out that important distinction you said that you
<br />
have accepted for a time the &quot;relative&quot; way, but then you change your
<br />
mind. So surely you see the main point.
<br />
<br />Should I conclude you were not understanding only the *AUDA* posts,
<br />
which relies on Logic, Godel, etc. ?
<br />
<br />What is exactly your opinion about the importance of that first and
<br />
third person point of view distinction when we discussed our possible 
<br />
computational extensions (like in the WM self-duplication thought Exp.)?
<br />
<br />To sum up, I mean, I don't understand at which step of the reasoning
<br />
you begin to be troubled. I believe both comp and QM are troubling
<br />
by themselves so the consequence of our belief can be troubling and
<br />
hard to believe, but then it is a good reason for trying to make
<br />
things precise (including the question). 
<br />
<br />I mean I could understand if you tell me that you are not convinced
<br />
by my argument for this or that reason.
<br />
Or that you are not interested, because it would be no relevant
<br />
for your decision theory. But you have been to vague I'm afraid.
<br />
<br />Let me try one question which has been perhaps asked before by me
<br />
or someone else:
<br />
I ask you to accept comp for the sake of the argument, I ask you
<br />
to imagine you are taking each day a transporter which cut and paste
<br />
you from home to work and back again.
<br />
<br />But then you learn that some &quot;channels&quot; are pirated by some sadical
<br />
people in need of chair ..., and some commercials tell you that by
<br />
paying a little more, your code can be quantum protected on some
<br />
channel making such piratery much more difficult if not impossible.
<br />
<br />My question is: supposing you can afford it, would you pay for that
<br />
extra security? Are you willing to accept that a reasonable
<br />
computationalist practionner *should* pay for it?
<br />
<br />What would you decide?
<br />
<br />Bruno
