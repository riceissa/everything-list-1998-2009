<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Considering the kind of set of equation we figure up to now,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; completely specifying our universe from them seems to require
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; two additional things:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 1) The specification of boundary conditions (or any other equivalent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;    additional constraint.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 2) The selection of a set of global parameters.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; My suggestion is that for 1), instead of specifying initial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; conditions (what might be problematic for a number of reasons),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; one could use another form of additional high level constraint
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; which would be that the solution universe should be &quot;as much as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; possible more ordered on one side than on the other&quot;. Of course,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; this rely on the possibility to give a sound sense to this, which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; implies to be able to find a canonical way to tell whether one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; solution of the set of equations in more &quot;more ordered on one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; side than on the other&quot; than another solution.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think this is a valid approach, but I would put it into a larger
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perspective.  The program you describe, if we were to actually implement
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it, would have these parts: It has a certain set of laws of physics; it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has a certain order-measuring function (perhaps equivalent to what we know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as entropy); and it has a goal of finding conditions which maximize the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; difference in this function's values from one side to the other of some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; data structure that it is modifying or creating, and which represents
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the universe.
</em><br />
<br />That's it. I would say that this is a clever reformulation back
<br />
in the context of the computational perspective. However I do not
<br />
find this perpective larger.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It would not be particularly difficult to implement a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;toy&quot; version of such a program based on some simple laws of physics, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perhaps as you suggest our own universe might be the result of an instance
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of such a program which is not all that much more large or complex.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In the context of the All Universe Principle as interpreted by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Schmidhuber, all programs exist, and all the universes that they generate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exist.  This program that you describe is one of them, and the universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that is thus generated is therefore part of the multiverse.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So to first order, there is nothing particularly surprising or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problematical in envisioning programs like this as contributing to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multiverse, along with the perhaps more naively obvious programs which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perform sequential simulation from some initial conditions.  All programs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exist, including ones which create universes in even more strange or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; surprising ways than these.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; By the way, Wolfram's book (wolframscience.com) does consider some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non-sequential simulations as models for simple 1- and 2-dimensional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universes.  These are what he calls &quot;Systems Based on Constraints&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discussed in his chapter 5.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Where I think your idea is especially interesting is the possibility that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the program which creates our universe via this kind of optimization
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; technique (maximizing the difference in complexity) might be much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shorter than a more conventional program which creates our universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; via specifying initial conditions.  Shorter programs are considered
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to have larger measure in the Schmidhuber model, hence it is of great
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; importance to discover the shortest program which generates our universe,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and if optimization rather than sequential simulation does lead to a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; much shorter program, that means our universe has much higher measure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than we might have thought.
</em><br />
<br />In the more classical mathematical perspective, I would say that
<br />
this principle could be considered as an additional axiom from
<br />
which a lot could be derived, leading (possibly) to a description
<br />
of universes much shorter in axiom count than many alternatives.
<br />
<br />An even more general axiom would be that &quot;if a symmetry has to
<br />
be broken, it has to be broken as much as possible&quot;, things having
<br />
to either as symmetrical as possible or as asymmetrical as possible.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, I don't think we can evaluate this possibility in a meaningful
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way until we have a better understanding of the physics of our own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe.
</em><br />
<br />Yes and maybe even if we finally figure which laws are to be used.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am somewhat skeptical that this particular optimization
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; principle is going to work, because our universe's disorder gradient is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dominated by the Big Bang's decay to heat death, and these cosmological
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; phenomena don't necessarily seem to require the kinds of atomic and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; temporal structures that lead to observers.
</em><br />
<br />I know of the dominance of the near big bang decay to heat death
<br />
but it might be that however small the remaining might be, it could
<br />
still be enough to make a difference. Also, the remaining &quot;operates&quot;
<br />
on a much longer time-scale and this could somehow balance things.
<br />
It is certainly too early to decide whether this optimization
<br />
principle is actually useful and whether the optimal point would
<br />
actually turn out to be our type of universe. I am not so confident
<br />
that it would but I don't think either that this could be ruled
<br />
out yet.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you look at Tegmark's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; paper <a href="http://www.hep.upenn.edu/~max/toe.html">http://www.hep.upenn.edu/~max/toe.html</a> which lists a number of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical-constant coincidences necessary for life, not all of them would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have cosmological importance and change the order-to-disorder gradient
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the universe.
</em><br />
<br />Maybe the principle would work only for some of the global
<br />
parameters, others being justified from other principles and yet
<br />
others really being free ones.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It might well be that this additional constraint can also be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; used for selecting the appropriate set of global parameter for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the set of equations considered in 2). It does not seem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; counter-intuitive that the sets of global parameters that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; allows for the maximization of the gradient of order among all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; possible solutions considering all possible values for global
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; parameters be precisely those for which SASs emerges and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; therefore those we see in our universe: universes not able to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; generate complex enough substructures to be self aware would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; probably equally fail to exhibit large gradients of order and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; vice versa.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Certainly an interesting suggestion.  Again, when we look at the larger
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; view of all possible programs, we have optimization programs which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have some parameters fixed; and optimization programs which allow the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; parameters to vary as part of the optimization process.  The latter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; programs would tend to be smaller since they don't have to store the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; value of the fixed parameters; but on the other hand the need to allow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for varying the parameters may add some complexity, so it might be that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particularly simple values of parameters can be accommodated without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; increasing program size.
</em><br />
<br />Within the mathematical perspective, specifying a real value
<br />
for a parameter requires additional axioms. From the uncountable
<br />
number of reals, only a countable number of them can be specified
<br />
using a finite set of axioms. It is not clear that universes
<br />
associated (via global parameters) to those reals that cannot be
<br />
specified using a finite set of axioms have the same mathematical
<br />
existence as those that can (the first series of universes would
<br />
need an infinite set of axioms to be described while the others
<br />
only needs a finite set of axioms). It might be that the universes
<br />
with smaller number of axioms would be more generic and have more
<br />
chance or weight to exist. Form this perpective, the lesser the
<br />
number of axioms, the better.
<br />
<br />Georges Quénot.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The hypothesis of the maximization the gradient of order seems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; even Popper-falsfiable. At least one prediction can be made:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Given the set of equation that describe our universe and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; corresponding set of global parameters, if we can find a canonical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; way to compare the relative global gradient of order within the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; universes that satisfy this set of equations:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 1) It could be possible to determine the subset of universes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;    that maximize the gradient for each set of global parameters
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;    (comparing all possible universes for a given set of global
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;    parameters), these being called &quot;optimal&quot; for this set of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;    global parameters.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 2) It could be possible to determine the sets of global parameters
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;    that maximize the gradient in an absolute way (comparing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;    optimal universes for all possible sets of global parameters).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The prediction is that the set of global parameter that we observe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is one of those that maximizes the gradient of order within the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; corresponding optimal universes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, that's a good prediction, and you may be right that we could already
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; take some steps towards testing it.  Tegmark's paper can be interpreted
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as providing some such tests.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Maybe also the constraint could be used at a third level if it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; can remain consistent as a mean to select the appropriate set of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; equations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, or at least for part of the equations.  As with the case of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; parameters, all different versions of such programs would exist, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the real question is which one is shortest.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;From Wolfram's book, though, I can't escape the suspicion that no such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; programs will turn out to be the shortest ones; but that there will be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some much smaller program that lacks the logic and clean division of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; function that I describe above (the three parts, etc) but which still
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; manages to create our universe.  Once we move away from sequential
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simulation and start considering optimization and other more exotic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; techniques, it is difficult to avoid taking the next step and considering
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; random programs.  Wolfram's first few chapters amount to a taxonomy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of how random programs behave, and his tentative conclusion is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a substantial fraction of them generate complex-looking structure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It may be a leap of faith to suppose that our highly intricate and ordered
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe could be generated by some incomprehensible mess of a program,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something much smaller and tighter than any human programmer could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; create or perhaps even understand.  But there is some historical basis
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for the idea that random programs can be more efficient in size than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; human-designed ones; I recall that in one of the early Artificial Life
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiments, the original replicator carefully designed as the initial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seed soon self-improved to be even smaller than the human designer had
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thought possible.
