Hi Everyone -
<br />
<br />I've recently subscribed to the Everything List, and have been browsing 
<br />
through the archives. I have to confess that I find some of the discussion 
<br />
there incomprehensible, but nevertheless it's exciting to find people who 
<br />
take this very unusual idea seriously.
<br />
<br />My background is in Computer Science. I've been reading people like Daniel 
<br />
Dennett and Douglas Hofstadter for years, and I accept in general the 
<br />
&quot;computational&quot;, &quot;algorithmic&quot;, or &quot;functionalist&quot; view of mind (though all 
<br />
of these terms mean different things to different people). I'm intrigued by 
<br />
the Computational Physics concepts expounded by Fredkin, Wolfram, et. al., 
<br />
but I don't understand Quantum Physics, so I really don't feel qualified to 
<br />
judge the specifics.
<br />
<br />Years ago I was struck with the thought that the Many Worlds Interpretation 
<br />
of QM *seemed* to imply that I will never die. I never knew how seriously 
<br />
to take this idea, since I couldn't even get a straight answer from my 
<br />
physicist friends about what things were impossible in QM as opposed to 
<br />
highly improbable. (Is it impossible in QM for an elephant to suddenly 
<br />
materialize in my room? Or is it just highly improbable? I still don't know!)
<br />
<br />Speculations about the implications of QM seemed less interesting to me 
<br />
than questions like &quot;Why is our physics true rather than some other 
<br />
physics? Why does our universe have this property of &quot;physical existence&quot;, 
<br />
when other perfectly good universes (like Conway's Life) don't?&quot; It seemed 
<br />
to me that the most sensible answer to this question is that universes like 
<br />
Conway's Life have just as much &quot;physical existence&quot; (whatever that means) 
<br />
as our own.
<br />
<br />Most of my thinking on these issues has been devoted to defending this 
<br />
position philosophically - starting with some brand of mathematical or 
<br />
computational realism, and then arguing that this ultimately implies 
<br />
&quot;mathematical physicalism&quot;. Much less of my thinking has been devoted to 
<br />
working out the implications of this mathematical physicalism. It certainly 
<br />
seems to imply that I will never die. However, I would say that in general 
<br />
my current position on the implications of the AUH is quite a bit more 
<br />
agnostic or skeptical than that of many of the people on this list. 
<br />
Currently, I can't see how to apply the concept of &quot;measure&quot; to the 
<br />
ensemble of universes (or the ensemble of 
<br />
&quot;my-next-possible-observer-moments&quot;, or whatever), and I'm not entirely 
<br />
sure the idea even makes sense. I'm not even convinced that the regularity 
<br />
we perceive in our own universe (i.e. the lack of &quot;white talking rabbits&quot;) 
<br />
is something that requires explaining. Perhaps I will come to view this as 
<br />
a problem as I continue to think about it.
<br />
<br />-- Kory
