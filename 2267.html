Dear Bruno:
<br />
<br />You commented on my step 9 which in my most recent post on the subject reads as
<br />
<br />9) N-bit, ifc-FAS are composed of:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) A finite theorem set [no more than 2^[N + c] as per AIT.]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Each theorem has a finite AIT complexity less than or equal to N + 
<br />
c bits
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and thus the FAS has
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) A finite symbol set or alphabet.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) A finite set of axioms
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) A finite set of rules
<br />
<br />The issue you raised has to do with &quot;a&quot;: an ifc-FAS has,
<br />
<br />a) A finite theorem set [no more than 2^[N + c] as per AIT.]
<br />
<br />You then point to what I take to be [remember I am not a mathematician] a 
<br />
theorem cascade that exists [seems to anyway] in a particular what I also 
<br />
take to be a not too complex FAS.
<br />
<br />In fact I made a slight slip from my model of the moment in this area on 
<br />
one of my recent posts when I said.
<br />
<br />&quot;Chaitin showed that a consistent FAS that actually has a Decision 
<br />
Procedure and if that procedure is finite then the FAS could not contain a 
<br />
choice between alternates that were more complex than the Decision 
<br />
Procedure except for a constant.&quot;
<br />
<br />While this may not be false it is not what I wished to say, but perhaps I 
<br />
stumbled onto something.
<br />
<br />Getting back to my step 9a I take it to be Chaitin's result.  His result 
<br />
[neglecting for the moment his constant c] as I understand it is that an 
<br />
N-bit FAS can not contain theorems more complex than the FAS.  There is no 
<br />
more than 2^N such theorems - a finite number if N is finite.  The result 
<br />
applies whether or not the N-bit FAS is complete.
<br />
<br />Now looking at FAS that contain recursive enumeration theorem cascades 
<br />
would seem to create a problem.  Chaitin says they should stop because each 
<br />
theorem in the cascade is more complex than the last so when you get to a 
<br />
complexity of 2^N you must stop.  In the case you give you only assume that 
<br />
you could write down all those theorems but is there enough ink and paper 
<br />
in the universe to actually do so?
<br />
<br />Further the cascade can only stop on a theorem &quot;that has no consequent 
<br />
under the rules&quot;.   That fully describes the theorem so it is not too 
<br />
complex.  This appears to me to be a contradiction.  How to resolve it?
<br />
<br />Well in my step 17 I gave my view that this is what spontaneously drives 
<br />
the ifc-FAS to be perturbed until it is countably infinite.
<br />
<br />My slip the other night now leads me to believe that even complete finite 
<br />
FAS that contain a theorem cascade will be pushed until they are countably 
<br />
infinite.  The fact that Godel has them go incomplete along the way is not 
<br />
relevant.  This widens the scope of possible universes - excellent.
<br />
<br />So I am really not at odds with your example.  By the time you get to write 
<br />
down all those theorems there might be enough ink and paper.
<br />
<br />You also wrote:

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;What do you mean by &quot;nothing&quot; ? The empty set ? (In which theory ?),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The null theory (In which logic), the physical void (in which frame?).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;What do you mean by stable ?
</em><br />
<br />I just made a post the other night which might clear this up some.  There I 
<br />
try to show that both Nothing and Everything are unstable and go to a 
<br />
middle ground.
<br />
<br />By Nothing I really mean it.  A completely empty system.  No alphabet, no 
<br />
axioms, no rules, no theorems.
<br />
<br />By stable I mean the usual engineering/physics concept.  Think of the 
<br />
inside of a tea cup.  Everything is on the smooth surface on one side of 
<br />
the cup.  It goes straight to the bottom. Nothing may get stuck on the side 
<br />
for awhile but must eventually also go to the bottom. At the bottom lies 
<br />
Something - my superverse which rattles around near the bottom with a 
<br />
random dynamic &quot;forever&quot;.
<br />
