&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What exactly is a White Rabbit (Wabbit for short),
<br />
in the techinical sense we want to use?  I've stated
<br />
that it's an extra bit of complexity in the laws of
<br />
physics.  But how can we distinguish that from the
<br />
apparent complexity that is merely due to being in one
<br />
of many worlds?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, one way is to be a physicist.  Physicists
<br />
like to distinguish between general theories and
<br />
particular data sets.  Again, how precise is that?  A
<br />
borderline case seems to be the constants of nature,
<br />
which appear to us to be real numbers with infinite
<br />
Kolmogorov complexity.  Are the general laws
<br />
infinitely complex then?  No, as MWIers we just say
<br />
that it must mean that the whole set of all possible
<br />
&quot;constants&quot; exists, thus making the whole thing not
<br />
very complex.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we don't want to invoke the MWI too often, or
<br />
we will end up defining all possible observed
<br />
complexity out of existance.  We want to be able to
<br />
distinguish wabbits, if only to show that the
<br />
statement &quot;the AUH implies the statistical lack of
<br />
wabbits&quot; means something.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will consider a bitstring, b.  If it has very
<br />
high K-complexity, it is random; it must be the
<br />
product of a MWI process, and therefore indicates low
<br />
complexity in the &quot;laws of physics&quot; that produced it.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it has very low K-complexity, it is nonrandom,
<br />
and must the product of simple &quot;laws of physics&quot; in
<br />
operation, where we don't need to invoke the MWI.  If 
<br />
K(b) is medium, b might just be a random segment
<br />
appended to a simple segment.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly K-complexity is not good enough to find
<br />
wabbits.  We could try turning to the Santa Fe
<br />
Institute and see what they have to say about
<br />
complexity, but what I want is an algorithm.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One way to try to get at what I want is to
<br />
consider the use of induction on a string.  Suppose we
<br />
use induction, starting as usual with the ensemble of
<br />
all programs having uniform Bayesian probability, to
<br />
continue a finite string.  We will obtain a
<br />
probability distribution of continuations p(r) for the
<br />
string.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If b was random, the continutation r will probably
<br />
also be random, but now we lose the specific
<br />
information about the exact specification of b.  If b
<br />
was simple, the continuation will probably also be
<br />
simple.  In both cases, consider R = sum_r p(r) p0(r)
<br />
where p0(r) is the probability distribution of
<br />
continuations for an empty string, ie is the universal
<br />
distribution.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now R will be fairly large in either the random or
<br />
the simple case.  But suppose b consists of 100
<br />
sequences, interwoven, each digits of some slightly
<br />
complex number like pi or sqrt(3).  In that case the
<br />
induced continuation is likely to continue those
<br />
patterns, and therefore will have small R.  One can
<br />
thus use -log R as a kind of complexity.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That seems OK if the string b is fairly uniform,
<br />
but problems seem to happen if it consists of an
<br />
isolated region with complicated stuff, surrounded by
<br />
long stretches of random bits.  It is likely that the
<br />
induced continuations would be mostly random, losing
<br />
the information about the special region.  One could
<br />
try averaging over all truncated segments of b, but
<br />
the average would approach the value for random
<br />
strings.  Summing instead of averaging would result in
<br />
something that is about proportional to the length of
<br />
b, not what I want.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One possibility is to consider the measure of
<br />
strings formed by interleaving such continuations. 
<br />
Let r_n be the induced continuation r for the string
<br />
truncated at the nth bit.  Let v be the interleaved
<br />
string consisting of bits from such.  Let
<br />
T = - log (sum_v p(v) p0(v)).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm just thinking out loud here.  What do you
<br />
think?
