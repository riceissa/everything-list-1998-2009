<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; BM: '  (= Bruno Marchal, not Brent Meeker)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  OK, except I don't see what you mean by on a &quot;number&quot; basis. We know 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that number have a lot of quantitative interesting relationships, but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; after Godel, Solovay etc.. we do know that numbers have astonishing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; qualitative relationship to (like the hypostases to mention it). '
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MP:  No no no, sorry, this is just me being colloquial. Nothing deep 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or important was intended! :-)  I was responding to a *possible 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implication* in Stathis's statement about religious fanatics. I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thought it was  worth emphasising that, along with the deluded 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; majority who think they are 'doing what is right', there are also 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; those whose motivation is strictly instrumental and manipulative and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; who find willing collaborators amongst the naive fanatics. This 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; situation is not confined to 'religious' organisations of course but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to any sub-culture in which the description of the world has fallen 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; into a closed loop.
</em><br />
<br /><br />We agree on this.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; BM: 'Except that Dawking and Dennet fall in their own trap, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perpetuates the myth of a &quot;physical universe&quot; as an explanation. They 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; continue to bury the mind/body problem under the rug.'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  MP: Well I think that we will rapidly reach our 'agree to differ' 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; line with this one. I think physical just means both extended and able 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to be measured.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I can agree with that. Actually &quot;can be measured&quot; is enough. Some 
<br />
measure will then be interpreted as extensions. But OK, sorry for not 
<br />
always cutting the air genuinely .... :-)
<br />
If this is really what you mean by &quot;physical&quot; we could be closer than 
<br />
you think at first sight. What I don't believe in are the &quot;primitive 
<br />
material token&quot;.
<br />
For example I do even believe there is a (comp) standard &quot;model&quot; of 
<br />
particles. But their &quot;token-materiality and primitivity&quot; is a deformed 
<br />
view from inside &quot;arithmetics&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; As such it is fairly close to self-evidently true, in my book. OK, so 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that is an 'anthropic' outlook but I exist and seem to be some sort of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anthropos or whatever [sorry I never studied Greek and only ever 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; achieved 35% in my one year of formal Latin studies :-]. It seems to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; me that physical is as physical does; as I wrote responding to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Stathis, number is theory is just that - theory.
</em><br />
<br /><br />See my preceding post. I agree to disagree on you on this :)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is incredibly useful in all manner of practical applications as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; well as effective in keeping lots of people off the streets doing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; amazing logical/arithmetical things for interest and entertainment's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sake. I watch with awe and admiration, but I remain careful to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; acknowledge that a description is a description not the thing it is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; describing.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I also consider that we have to distinguish a description and the thing 
<br />
it is describing. I could explain you without *much math* why the 
<br />
number reality can be shown to transcend all languages and theories, 
<br />
showing how much those things are different.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Existence per se is ultimately mysterious
</em><br />
<br />Even number existence seems to me highly mysterious. But with the comp 
<br />
hyp there is a possibility that both the mystery of seemingly existing 
<br />
matter and the (really existing) mind can be explained from the mystery 
<br />
of numbers. This is not really a &quot;reduction&quot; (only if you have a 
<br />
reductionist view on number and machine at the start).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and our experience of being here now is essentially paradoxical: the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience is what it is like to be the updating of a model of self in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the world [always 'my' model] but we conflate the experience with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; actually BEING here now, when the experience is much more limited than 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I do agree.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It would be much truer to say, I think, that this consciousness I take 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so much for granted is ABOUT my being here now.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK. It is coherent with my view that consciousness is somehow an 
<br />
instinctive belief in a reality.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; As much as anything I like to characterise it as: the registration of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; difference between what my brain predicted for perceiving and doing as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; opposed to what actually happened.
</em><br />
<br /><br />And I do agree with this. My point is just that, once we take comp 
<br />
seriously enough, there is case that physics is no more the fundamental 
<br />
science. What remains? Since 1970 I call it (in order) biology, 
<br />
mathematics, biology, computer science, metamathematics, biology, 
<br />
theology, biology, theology, psychology (suggested by Delahaye), .... 
<br />
and I'm going back to (pagan) theology, at least in this list, for a 
<br />
time. But the name is not important, or should not be important for 
<br />
those who search understanding (in place of propaganda).
<br />
<br />Like you, I think, I am uneasy with all form of reductionism,
<br />
Unlike you perhaps, I disagree with reductionist conceptions of the 
<br />
natural numbers and machines ... Truth about numbers and machine are 
<br />
provably not subject to complete or reductionist languages and 
<br />
theories. I am not pretending this is entirely obvious, and it is 
<br />
related to technical stuffs (which are easier than many people think, 
<br />
btw).
