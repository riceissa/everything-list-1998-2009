</em><br />
<br />First, welcome to the list.
<br />
<br />You are right that in the strict MWI, if we define an observer-moment
<br />
to be restricted to one branch, then observer moments do not merge.
<br />
<br />I might mention that there is some disagreement among aficionados of
<br />
the MWI as to what constitutes a branch.  Some reserve the concept of a
<br />
unique branch, and branch splitting, to an irreversible measurement-like
<br />
interaction, as you are doing.  Others say that even reversible operations
<br />
create new branches, in which sense it is OK to say that branches can
<br />
merge.  David Deutsch does this, for example, when he says that quantum
<br />
computers use the resources of many branches of the MWI (and hence prove
<br />
the reality of the MWI!).
<br />
<br />However, particularly as we look to larger ensembles than just the MWI,
<br />
it becomes attractive to define observers and observer-moments based
<br />
solely on their internal information.  If we think of an observer as
<br />
being a particular kind of machine, then if we have two identical such
<br />
machines with identical states, they represent the same observer-moment.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From the first-person perspective of that observer-moment, there is no
</em><br />
&quot;fact of the matter&quot; as to which of the infinite number of possible
<br />
implementations and instantiations of that observer moment is the real
<br />
one.  They are all equally real.  From the inside view, the outside is
<br />
a blur of all of the possibilities.
<br />
<br />If we apply that concept to the MWI, then we retrieve the concept of an
<br />
observer-moment that spans multiple branches.  As long as the information
<br />
state of the OM is consistent between the various branches, there is
<br />
no fact of the matter as to which branch it is really in.  That is the
<br />
sense in which we can say that observers merge and that observer moments
<br />
have multiple pasts.
