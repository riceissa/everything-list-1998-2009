<br />This is far better!  Not yet correct though.
<br />
<br />I gave you the hint that there are 8 elements. Let us count:
<br />
<br />The empty set { }  ..................................1
<br />
Three singletons {1}, {2}, {3}................3
<br />
Two doubletons {1,2 }, {2,3 }................2
<br />
The biggest subset  {1,2,3}..................1
<br />
<br />1 + 03 + 02 + 01 = 7
<br />
<br />A subset is missing! Can you see which one?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And I give you a little subject research: if a set x has n elements,

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; how many elements are in (power x)?

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />Good intuition that there is a problem with the accolades. Although  
<br />
your expression is not *missing* accolades. Actually it has *too much*  
<br />
accolades.
<br />
<br />If x represents a set, for example the set {1,2}, it means that in the  
<br />
formula x can be substituted by {1,2}. we could write that x = {1, 2},  
<br />
the accolades are in x, if you want.
<br />
So on the left, you should have written (power x), like in the  
<br />
enunciation of the subject research, actually.
<br />
<br />If x is the set {1,2}, (power x) is (power {1, 2}). But (power {x}) is  
<br />
(power {{1,2,3}}), i.e. the powerset of {{1,2,3}}, which is {{ },  
<br />
{{1,2,3}}}.
<br />
(Power {x}) looks like the powerset of an indeterminate singleton, a  
<br />
set with only one element.
<br />
<br />You  could have written this:
<br />
<br />When x has n elements, then (power x) = n(n-1) ... (n-x+1) / x!
<br />
<br />Let us see. After all you already computes the powerset of { }, which  
<br />
is the set with 00 element, and you told me (power { })  = {{ }}. So it  
<br />
has one element, and your formula should confirm this, and ... well,  
<br />
your formula begins by n multiplied by something, if n = 0 then we  
<br />
will get 0,  because 0 times any number gives 0. But we have just seen  
<br />
that (power { }) = {{ }}, which is a set with 1 element. So your  
<br />
formula is already contradicted by the first example. Hmm...
<br />
<br />May be that was bad luck, and sometimes in math the first example is  
<br />
also the trickiest, so let us look for n = 1. Let us take a set with  
<br />
one element, like {24}. Its power has 2 elements: {{ } {24}}, and you  
<br />
can guess that all singletons (set with two elements) have the same  
<br />
number of elements in their power set. So the answer is 2, in this  
<br />
case. If x has 1 element, the powerset of x, (power x) has two  
<br />
elements. Your formula should give 2, when n is equal to 1.
<br />
Let us see ...
<br />
<br />it gives 1(1-1) ... (1 -
<br />
<br />... but now, what could you mean by (n - x ...). ???
<br />
<br /><br />n is supposed to represent a number, x is supposed to represent a set,  
<br />
how could I, or you, subtract a set from a number?
<br />
<br />So I'm afraid that your formula is senseless, although I will perhaps  
<br />
take the time, in some future, to explain why there *is* an atom of  
<br />
truth in it! The correct formula is much simpler, though.
<br />
<br />Morality: if you have a theory, or a formula, test it on what you  
<br />
already know before submitting to publication!
<br />
<br />To find the formula, you could try first the tedious brut force (if  
<br />
this is english). (Few mathematicians admit to do that, but all  
<br />
mathematicians do it!)
<br />
<br />The number of sets included in { } = 1   (you have seen that). If x  
<br />
has 0 elements, (power x) = 1.
<br />
The number of sets included in  {a} = 2    (you have seen that). If x  
<br />
has 1 elements, (power x) = 2.
<br />
The number of sets included in {a, b} = 04  (you have seen that). If x  
<br />
has 2 elements (power x) = 4.
<br />
The number of sets included in {a,b,c} = 8 (cf the hint, exercise  
<br />
above). If x has 3 elements (power x) = 8
<br />
<br />Could you compute and/or guess the number of sets included in  
<br />
{a,b,c,d} ?
<br />
<br />And what about {a,b,c,d,e}?, and {a,b,c,d,e,f} ?, and ... ?
<br />
<br />Bruno
<br />
<br />PS Did I say that (power x) is called the powerset of x? It could be  
<br />
better to write (powerset x) instead of (power x), to emphasize that  
<br />
the powerset of x is the *set* of the sets included in x. OK? (Sorry).
