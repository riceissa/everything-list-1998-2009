&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
At some point in the past various of us have argued about whether the 
<br />
simulation argument and / or the multiple worlds interpretation of 
<br />
quantum mechanics implies an &quot;every possible world&quot; (EPW) 
<br />
interpretation, i.e. one in which highly improbable events, laws of 
<br />
physics, etc. obtain.
<br />
<br />Stumbled across an interesting if tangential paper that has something 
<br />
to say about this.  First some terminology:  let's call events that are 
<br />
highly improbable &quot;white rabbits&quot; and universes in which such events 
<br />
happen frequently (or universes with entirely inscrutable laws of 
<br />
physics) &quot;white rabbit worlds.&quot;
<br />
<br />Let's further adopt the term &quot;djinni&quot; or (to follow Gott's 
<br />
nomenclature) &quot;jinni&quot; to refer to closed time-like (causally cyclic) 
<br />
curves, and &quot;jinn worlds&quot; as worlds (n-dimensional &quot;spacetime&quot; slices 
<br />
of the higher-order spacetime, or rather n-m dimensional phase-space 
<br />
volumes where n is the total dimensionality of the phase space) that 
<br />
contain such causal cycles.  In order to explain what this means:  
<br />
these are causally consistent chains of events in which there is no 
<br />
ultimate cause, but rather a closed causal chain that traverses both 
<br />
forward and backward along the time dimension.  A peculiarity of this 
<br />
idea is that, in such a world, information &quot;appears&quot; without cause.  
<br />
For example a computer employing a closed time-like curve as a register 
<br />
can compute &quot;hard&quot; problems, but when one examines the execution 
<br />
history of the computer through time one finds that it never actually 
<br />
executes the computation!  Cf.:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/0209061">http://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/0209061</a>
<br />
<br />Anyway, &quot;jinni&quot; are these little closed curves of causality in the 
<br />
presence of time travel that are consistent but defy common sense.
<br />
<br />David G. Boulware of the University of Washington published this paper 
<br />
in PRD:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9207054">http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9207054</a>
<br />
<br />...in which he studies the behavior of quantum fields in spaces with 
<br />
closed time-like curves.  What he finds is that probabilities are not 
<br />
&quot;conserved&quot;, i.e. not unitary, in such spaces.  That is, the Feynman 
<br />
sum-over-histories approach always yields precisely 1 --- except when 
<br />
space contains one or more jinn.  In such cases, there are quantum 
<br />
events that simply cannot occur.
<br />
<br />So:  jinn defeat white rabbits.  If any world-line through the phase 
<br />
space is cyclic / allowed to self-intersect, the overall phase-space is 
<br />
constrained, presumably to those set of configurations which are of 
<br />
higher probability.  The very existence of such causal cycles may 
<br />
indeed be --- meta-paradoxically ;-) --- essential in stabilizing the 
<br />
overall structure of the phase space.  It would seem that these cycles 
<br />
act as a kind of strange attractor around which probable configurations 
<br />
(universes) coalesce.
<br />
<br />Speculation:  it may be that through studying the impact of such closed 
<br />
time-like curves in various spacetimes that we ultimately reconcile 
<br />
Cramer's transactional interpretation (retarded waves moving forward in 
<br />
time, advance waves reaching back to &quot;handshake&quot; on each quantum event, 
<br />
producing a kind of causal contract) of QM with MWI --- and ultimately 
<br />
COMP.  Indeed, each retarded wave-advance wave pair *is* a jinni.  
<br />
Cramer doesn't just embrace jinn in his interpretation --- he bases the 
<br />
whole idea on their existence!  (FWIW:  this seems to me an 
<br />
embarrassment of riches.  Why should *every* quantum event require a 
<br />
jinni, when a few --- acting as strange attractors --- might suffice?  
<br />
Though admittedly the latter leads to the questions which few, and 
<br />
why?)
<br />
<br />The implication ala Boulware is that if this is a real physical effect, 
<br />
then this provides a kind of global probabilistic censorship that makes 
<br />
the world the predictable place that it is!  And --- connectionism --- 
<br />
it's rather ironic that Cramer's transactional hypothesis is based in 
<br />
part on some of Feynman's own speculation, when Feynman probably didn't 
<br />
realize the essential seemingly paradoxical consequences of pairing the 
<br />
histories approach with cyclic causality.
<br />
<br />So that's all well and good for physics, but what about the more 
<br />
algorithmic cosmologies?  One school of thought regarding the COMP 
<br />
hypothesis is that it is easier to simulate all possible worlds than it 
<br />
is to simulate any subset of them.  (Cf. previously-discussed 
<br />
Champernowne machine / &quot;everything&quot; algorithm.)  But what if the 
<br />
dynamics of the simulation are such that these jinni exist as a priori 
<br />
structural parameters, &quot;roots&quot; if you will of the computation?  In such 
<br />
an environment, &quot;every computable universe&quot; is NOT every possible 
<br />
universe.
<br />
<br />Curiouser and curiouser,
<br />
<br />jb
