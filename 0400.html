I just liked to remind you the old Greek paradox that demonstrates
<br />
rigorously that there cannot exist any sand heap:
<br />
Let N be the number of sand grains in the collection:
<br />
if N=1, it is not a sand heap.
<br />
if you add a single grain to what is not a heap, you cannot transform it
<br />
into a heap.
<br />
So the proposition is logically demonstrated.
<br />
<br />May be you think this has nothing to do with this debate. For me it has. It
<br />
demonstrates first that formal logic may be insufficient to handle common
<br />
sense. Second that the very large majority of concepts we use don't have a
<br />
precise meaning, and most things &quot;are&quot; not intrinsically something or other
<br />
thing; &quot;To be AND not to be, that is the question&quot;.
<br />
(You can easily extend the paradox to any material thing, made of a finite
<br />
number of atoms, nothing to say about moral concepts!)
<br />
<br />Conciousness, intelligence, memory, knowledge, but also computers, do not
<br />
exist by themselves. As we cannot define them properly, we cannot measure
<br />
them and tell anything about there *precise* properties. You can try to
<br />
define computers as machines handling information, but then how do you
<br />
define information?
<br />
May be they are many computers scientists who think that the reality *is* a
<br />
computation. They are also many theologist that think that the reality was
<br />
created by God. But the number of believers has nothing to do with the
<br />
pertinence of ideas.
<br />
<br />The modern science has begun when scientists have stopped to ask themselves
<br />
about the &quot;true&quot; nature of reality. You must accept that physics offers
<br />
only a representation of the universe suited for our brain. It does no more
<br />
pretend tell anything about the profound nature of it.
<br />
<br />Most of you seem to think that a computation can represent adequately the
<br />
reality, or better &quot;be&quot; the reality. I think that computations offer only
<br />
an approximation of theories, that are themselves approximations of
<br />
reality. I must remind you that there is currently no theory of physics
<br />
that can assess without contradiction what is a state of the Universe, and
<br />
by which kind of object it must be represented. I think you have very hard
<br />
time to demonstrate that a state of the Universe is a string of 0 and 1,
<br />
that is an integer number.
<br />
Those who believe in that seem to forget that behind their computations,
<br />
there is a computer made of physical elements! Explaining A with B that
<br />
require A seems to me a little bit strange. It's like if you said that
<br />
molecules of water are made of water!
<br />
Furthermore, once again, a string can be interpreted as something (a word,
<br />
the solution of Wheeler-DeWitt equation or anything else) only by an
<br />
intelligent observer. It does not contain information per se.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;So I'm ready to buy any theory that :
<br />
1) is logically consistant
<br />
2) allows to make the most precise predictions of what we actually observe.
<br />
<br />I really don't see how a set of all possible finite strings (if I don't
<br />
mistake, the simple set of integer numbers N), can be used to tell anything
<br />
reasonable about the Universe! Physical theories are interesting exactly
<br />
because they do the opposite: the *forbid* most things to appear!!
<br />
<br />QM is currently very precise, but not logically consistent. MWI adds
<br />
logical consistency, but is not yet for me in a state of completion.

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       Let's try to establish a few cogent premisses. I realise you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probably won't  agree with them all, but I'd be interested to know why:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;1]. Consciousness is  neither dependent upon nor implied by intelligence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(a man with Downs' syndrome  is no less conscious than a genius).
</em><br />
<br />&lt;GH&gt; : you cannot quantify precisely both of them. You can define many
<br />
kinds of intelligence, and there is many states of consciousness. They are
<br />
famous &quot;idiots savants&quot;, who were totally dumb but could calculate much
<br />
more rapidly than ordinary people. Were they intelligent? You cannot deny
<br />
that intelligence and consciousness are linked in some way.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;2]. Consciousness is neither dependent  upon nor implied by memory (a man
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;suffering from amnesia is no less conscious than a man who remembers every
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;detail of his  life).
</em><br />
<br />cf Hal's answer.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;3]. Consciousness is neither dependent upon nor implied by  knowledge (you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;cannot increase your consciousness through memorising the  Encyclopaedia
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Britannica).
</em><br />
<br />&lt;GH&gt; : same as 1). You cannot have consciouness without any knowledge. I
<br />
don't know what &quot;increase consciouness&quot; means.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4]. Consciousness is fundamentally a physical phenomenon since it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;clearly affected by physical processes (alcohol, injury, sleeping).  
</em><br />
<br />&lt;GH&gt; : I agree but, I would personnaly define physical processes by all
<br />
what we can observe. So it's a truism.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;    Two people make a bet based on the toss of a  coin while a third
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;unobserved &gt;person looks on discretely from the corner. The  probability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of heads or tails &gt;is fifty-fifty, 0.5. The coin lands heads, one of  them
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;loses, fair enough.   &gt;Having seen this, our voyeur steps out of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;room, gets in his time machine, &gt;and returns to witness the same event.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But what  are the probabilities of heads &gt;and tails now? Are they still
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;fifty-fifty, or are  they now 1 and 0 &gt;respectively?   This little
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;argument seems to  pose 3 possible conclusions. 1. &gt;Time travel is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;impossible
</em><br />
<br />&lt;GH&gt; : May be not following general relativity. However if a time machine
<br />
exists, it should transport you in a world where you already arrived in the
<br />
past. If you don't see you arriving before entering the time machine, it
<br />
means that you will not arrive in this world after your trip. This is not
<br />
contradictory since in MWI a world has many possible futures. In some of
<br />
them you wouldn't see you, and in other you would see you arriving from
<br />
future. You need quantum gravity to avoid paradoxes!!
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;2. Probability (and therefore our  human concept of free will) is an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;illusion &gt;(assuming of course, that someone  with a capital S is watching
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;over the &gt;proceedings).
</em><br />
<br />&lt;GH&gt; : Free will is an illusion. Apparent probabilities exist for quantum
<br />
processes (measure of the spin of an electron), because of different
<br />
worlds, that may have different measures. For macroscopic process like the
<br />
toss of a coin, 1/2 probability is an illusion because the result is
<br />
probably largely determined by unknown macroscopic parameters (state of the
<br />
muscles, wind,..).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3. There is a fundamental flaw in  this line of reasoning.   The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;responses I &gt;got (thanks by the  way) were based entirely on the MWI which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;said that the &gt;probability remained  unchanged.
</em><br />
<br />&lt;GH&gt; :
<br />
Not for macroscopic processes. You should choose a much higher probability
<br />
for the winning case, unless you think your arrival from future has
<br />
strongly perturbed the toss (by the wind it has produced, for example).
<br />
Replace the toss by a Stern and Gerlach experiment, then you must keep the
<br />
1/2 probability.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Your view of  the 2 to 1 event splitting 3 ways, with 2 identical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;universes is really an  equivalent way of looking at it when there are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;only a finite number of  outcomes. I don't believe it is a useful
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;picture when there is a continuum of  outcomes.   These answers do not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;seem so clear-cut to me, particularly as there seems  to have been so much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;confusion about what 'measure' is. Furthermore, I do not  understand the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;notion of 'splits on a continuum'. Either time is discrete (with  the unit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of Planck-length) or it is infinitely divisible. If it is discrete,  then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the MWI seems to limit the splitting process to once every Planck-length.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;However, it is reasonable to suggest that there may be two totally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;different  events occurring far away from each other at the same time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Does this  mean therefore that there are multitude of universes springing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;up at every  instant?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; How are simultaneous events integrated into the MWI? On the  other hand,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;if time is continuous we are faced with the possibility of an  infinite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;number of universes springing up at every instant - a daunting  prospect.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;A third possibility which gets around these problems is that time is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;indeed continuous but we define an instant as the time between the two
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;most  closely separated events ever to occur. This will mean that no two
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;events can be  simultaneous since we can proceed to the nth decimal place
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;along the measure of  time to find a difference.    Anyway, I've probably
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;said enough for now.   
</em><br />
<br />&lt;GH&gt;:
<br />
The term &quot;many world&quot; is in fact misleading (and has not been used by
<br />
Everett). There is only one Universe, whose wavefunction contains as a
<br />
superposition an infinite number of macroscopic worlds, as we can perceive
<br />
it. The problem of defining what is a macroscopic world (by a suitable
<br />
projection operator) has not been solved yet. Although Everett and many
<br />
people still visualize the wave function as evolving in time and branching
<br />
in many &quot;daughter components&quot;, I think it is more probably a stationary
<br />
state (with null energy), containing all components at each moment. So time
<br />
does not really exist. However, a particular classical subcomponent is
<br />
linked to some other called &quot;past(s)&quot; and &quot;future(s)&quot; by the memory of all
<br />
recording devices it contains (all kind of clocks, brains...). These
<br />
particular links disappear at the Planck scale.
