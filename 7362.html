</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; First, I think that it's important to remove the qualifier &quot;identical&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; here. Would two copies cease to be identical if one atom were out of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; place?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I meant something more like &quot;running the same program&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Okay, that's fine.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; On another tack, you are the same person, etc., that you were
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; five minutes ago where strict identicalness isn't even close.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; From a third-person POV, why am I the same person? If you don't believe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; there's an objective truth about continuity of identity, isn't it just a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; sort of aesthetic call?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;When we say that you are the same person you were a few
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;minutes ago, of course, we are starting from common usage
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and going from there. Normal people value their lives,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and don't want to die, say, next week. Even legally, people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are regarded as having an identity that doesn't change much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;over time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Objectively, (i.e. 3rd person), there really *is* a fuzzy set
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of states that ought to be regarded as Jesse Mazur.
</em><br />
<br />MazEr!
<br />
<br />Any
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;intelligent investigator (or even a program that we cannot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;quite write yet) could examine each of the six billion people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in the world and give a &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; answer to whether this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is an instance of Jesse Mazur. Naturally in the case of duplicates
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(running on computers or running on biological hardware doesn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;matter) it may be found that there is more than one Jesse running.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It's *not* aesthetic whether, say, George Bush is you or not. He's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;definitely not! He doesn't have your memories, for the first thing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It's simply objectively true that some programs---or some clumps
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of biological matter---are Jesse Mazur and others are not. (Even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;though the boundary will not be exact, but fuzzy.)
</em><br />
<br />I disagree--George Bush certainly has a lot sensory memories (say, what 
<br />
certain foods taste like) in common with me, and plenty of 
<br />
life-event-memories which vaguely resemble mine. And I think if you scanned 
<br />
the entire multiverse it would be possible to find a continuum of minds with 
<br />
memories and lives intermediate between me and George Bush. There's not 
<br />
going to be a rigorous, totally well-defined procedure you can use to 
<br />
distinguish minds which belong to the set &quot;Jesse-Mazer-kinda-guys&quot; from 
<br />
minds which don't belong.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Second, suppose that someone loves you, and wants the best for you.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; The person who loves you...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; If she finds out that although dead on Earth, you've been copied into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; a body out near Pluto, (and have the same quality of life there), 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;she's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; once again happy for you.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; That's a pretty unhuman kind of &quot;love&quot; though--if a person I know dies, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I'm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; sad because I'll never get to interact with them again,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Then you don't know true love  :-)  (just kidding) because as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the great novelists have explained, truly loving someone involves
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;wanting what is best for *them*, not just that you'll get the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;pleasure of their company. Hence the examples where one lover
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;dies to save the other.
</em><br />
<br />Yeah, but that's because those guys only believed in a single universe! Do 
<br />
you think anyone would buy a story where someone sacrificed their unique, 
<br />
unbacked-up life to save copy #348 of 1000 copies running in perfect 
<br />
lockstep? Do *you* think this would be a good thing to do, even though it 
<br />
would mean the loss of unique information (all the person's memories, 
<br />
thoughts, wisdom etc.) from the universe in order to prevent a &quot;death&quot; that 
<br />
won't remove any unique information at all from the universe?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From a first-person POV, I do believe the concept of self-sacrificing 
</em><br />
unselfish love still makes sense in a multiverse, it's just that it would 
<br />
involve trying to maximize the other person's subjective probability of 
<br />
experiencing happiness in the future.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;This, then, is the big question: how may I appeal to your intuition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in such a way that you come to agree that benefit is strictly additive?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Let me resort to another torture experiment. Suppose that I invite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you into my house, take you down to the torture chamber, and allow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you to look through a tiny peephole inside the entire steel-encased
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;chamber. You see some Nazis torturing a little girl, and her screams
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are reproduced electronically so that you hear them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;You are appalled. You beg me to dissolve the chamber and put an end
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to the atrocity. But then I say the following peculiar thing to you:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;Ah, but you see, this is an *exact* molecular---down to the QM
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;details---reenactment of an incident that happened in 1945. So you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;see, since it's identical, it doesn't matter whether the little girl
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;suffers once or twice.&quot;
</em><br />
<br />Well, of course *I* would want to dissolve the chamber, because I think that 
<br />
dissolving this chamber will decrease the subjective first-person 
<br />
probability of having that experience of being tortured by the Nazis. I'm 
<br />
just saying it's not clear what difference dissolving it would make from the 
<br />
POV of a &quot;zombie&quot; like yourself. ;)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now contrive translated versions of that to programs, where a program
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;here is suffering exactly the same way that it's suffering on Mars.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Still feel that since one is taking place anyway, it doesn't matter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;whether a second one is?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The love of a mother who understood all the facts would not mislead
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;her into making the correct decision: all other things being equal,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(say that her daughter was to live happily in any case after 2007),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;she would judge that it is better for her daughter to suffer only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;one computation---here, say---than two, (say here and on Mars).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Each time that the girl's suffering is independently and causally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;calculated is a terrible thing.
</em><br />
<br />I don't see why it's terrible, if you reject the notion of first-person 
<br />
probabilities. You've really only given an appeal to emotion rather than an 
<br />
argument here, and I would say the emotions are mostly grounded in 
<br />
first-person intuitions, even if you don't consciously think of them that 
<br />
way. I suppose there's also the issue of having to *witness* a replay of 
<br />
horrible suffering in the present rather than just leave it dead and buried 
<br />
in the past, but in this case the argument for shutting down the chamber 
<br />
would be the same regardless of whether it was an actual simulation of that 
<br />
past torture chamber or just a very realistic holographic recording.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The real problem here is that when we talk about what's &quot;better&quot; from a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; first-person POV, we just mean what *I* would prefer to experience 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;happening
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to me;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Again, I think that the first-person point of view can lead to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;errors just as incorrect as those of Ptolemaic astronomy.
</em><br />
<br />And I think it's the universal third-person view that leads to those errors, 
<br />
since I think that the ultimate &quot;objective&quot; truth about reality takes the 
<br />
form of a measure on all possible observer-moments, a notion that you'd 
<br />
never think of if you tried to think purely in third-person terms and reject 
<br />
the first-person perspective.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; but if you want to only think in terms of a universal objective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; third-person POV, then you must define &quot;better&quot; in terms of some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;universal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; objective moral system, and there doesn't seem to be any &quot;objective&quot; way 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; decide questions like whether multiple copies of the same happy A.I. are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; better than single copies.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;You're right, and here's how I go about it. We must be able to decide
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(or have an AI decide) whether or not an entity (person or program)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is being benefited by a particular execution.
</em><br />
<br />But that's ignoring the main issue, because you haven't addressed the more 
<br />
primary question of *why* we should think that if a single execution of a 
<br />
simulation benefits the entity being simulated, then multiple executions of 
<br />
the same simulation benefit it even more.
