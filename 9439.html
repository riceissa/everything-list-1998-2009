Russell,
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Having said that, I still think it misses the point. The fact that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Parfit's thought experiments sometimes seem to have a degree of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; scientific plausibility is just a bonus that makes his writing more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; entertaining. Parfit's ideas on personal identity are squarely in
</em><br />
the
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; tradition of John Locke, who wrote about transfer of &quot;consciousness&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; from one person to another, suggesting that it is this consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (which importantly includes the donor's memories) which determines
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; identity rather than the physical body in which it happens to
</em><br />
reside.
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Clearly, this kind of mind transfer was a completely ridiculous
</em><br />
notion
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in the 17th century, and probably still is. But technical
</em><br />
feasibility
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (or indeed physical possibility) was not part of Locke's argument,
</em><br />
nor
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; was it used as ammunition against him by his philosophical
</em><br />
opponents.
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; His argument was that IF it were possible to transfer memory etc.
</em><br />
from
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; one person to another, THEN the recipient would feel himself to be
</em><br />
the
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; donor, even though he would notice that he had a completely
</em><br />
different
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; body. Opponents of this view argue that it is NOT the case that
</em><br />
transfer
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of memories etc. from one body to another - WERE it possible - would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; result in transfer of personal identity (see R. &amp; P. chap 10.82 for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Bernard Williams' thought experiment, for example).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My response to Locke's thought experiment is that the result would a
</em><br />
new
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person, as embodiment has a strong effect on one's psyche as well. I
</em><br />
would
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not even predict that the new person is in between those of the donor
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and donee, although obviously there would be some elements on common
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (memories of the donor for example).
</em><br />
<br />You're being too practical. That's fine for scientific speculation, but
<br />
it can be an impediment in trying to understand philosophers. If I say,
<br />
&quot;if I were God, I would get rid of all the flies&quot;, I am saying something
<br />
about my attitude to flies; the fact that me becoming God might be a
<br />
practical and probably a theoretical impossibility is beside the point.
<br />
Similarly, Parfit's thought experiments are designed to explore the
<br />
meaning of the term &quot;personal identity&quot;, not the likelihood that Star
<br />
Trek will become reality. Certainly, in the world we live in it is very
<br />
easy to come up with a reliable *practical* method for verifying a
<br />
person's identity, such as asking his wife, or via neuronal DNA
<br />
analysis, or whatever; but this does not really tell us what, in
<br />
essence, personal identity is. What if, by science or magic, a person
<br />
were perfectly duplicated? What if, by science or magic, incremental
<br />
changes were made to a person's mind so that his mental state came to
<br />
resemble that of a different person? Is it possible to arrive at a
<br />
definition of personal identity which would yield what everyone would
<br />
agree is the &quot;right&quot; answer in such cases? Parfit's conclusion is that
<br />
there is no such definition possible; no objective &quot;truth of the matter&quot;
<br />
regarding personal identity. What we are left with is something perhaps
<br />
disturbingly vague: what matters to us in survival is just the feeling
<br />
of psychological continuity, regardless of what physical processes take
<br />
place to bring about this feeling.
