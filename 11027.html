<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Assuming comp, I think that this is a red herring. To make this clear I  
<br />
use a notion of generalized brain in some longer version of the UDA.  
<br />
See perhaps:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/everything-list/browse_frm/thread/">http://groups.google.com/group/everything-list/browse_frm/thread/</a> 
<br />
4c995dee307def3b/9f94f4d49cb2b9e6? 
<br />
q=universal+dovetailer&amp;rnum=1#9f94f4d49cb2b9e6
<br />
<br />The generalized brain is by definition the portion of whatever you need  
<br />
to turing-emulate to &quot;experience nothing&quot; or to survive in the relative  
<br />
way addressed through comp. It can contain any part of the environment.  
<br />
Note that in that case, assuming comp, such a part has to be assumed  
<br />
turing-emulable, or comp is just false.
<br />
<br />Of course, if the generalized brain is the entire multiverse, the  
<br />
thought experiment with the doctor is harder to figure out, certainly.  
<br />
But already at the seventh step of the 8-steps-version of the UDA, you  
<br />
can understand that in front of the infinitely (even just potentially  
<br />
from all actual views) running UD, comp makes all your continuations  
<br />
UD-accessed. It would just mean, in that case, that there is a unique  
<br />
winning program with respect of building you. I doubt that, but that is  
<br />
not the point.
<br />
<br />By the same token, it is also not difficult to get the &quot;evolution of  
<br />
brain&quot; into the notion of generalized brain, so that &quot;evolution&quot; is  
<br />
also a red herring when used as a critics of comp, despite the  
<br />
possibility of non computationnal aspect of evolution like geographical  
<br />
randomization à-la Washington/Moscow.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would bet on computationalism too.  But I still think the conclusion  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that every
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical process, even the null one, necessarily implements all  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness is absurd.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK, but the point is just that comp implies that physical processes  
<br />
does not implement &quot;per se&quot; consciousness. They implements  
<br />
consciousness only as far as making that consciousness able to manifest  
<br />
itself relatively to its most probable computational history (among a  
<br />
continuum).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Reductio ad absurdum of what? Comp or  (weak) Materialism?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Bruno
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dunno.  A reductio doesn't tell you which premise is wrong.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Nice. So you seem to agree with the UDA+movie-graph argument, we have:
<br />
<br />not comp v not physical-supervenience.
<br />
<br />This is equivalent to both:
<br />
<br />comp -&gt; not physical supervenience, and
<br />
physical supervenience -&gt; not comp
<br />
<br />Now I agree that at this stage(after UDA) it would be natural to  
<br />
abandon comp but then computer science and the translation of the UDA  
<br />
in the language of a universal turing machine (sufficiently rich, or  
<br />
lobian) such an abandonment could be premature (to say the least).  
<br />
Incompleteness should make us skeptical in front of any intuitive and  
<br />
too rapid conclusion.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; That's generally useful; but when we understand little about  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something, such as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness, we should be careful about assuming what's  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;theoretically possible&quot;;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particularly when it seems to lead to absurdities.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Mmh.... If we assume &quot;theoretical possibilities&quot; and then are led to  
<br />
absurdities, then we have learned something: evidences against the  
<br />
theoretical assumptions. If the &quot;absurdities&quot; can be transform into  
<br />
clear contradiction, perhaps by making the theoretical assumptions  
<br />
clearer, then we have prove something: the falsity of the assumptions.
<br />
I think you know that, and you were just quick, isn't' it?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Stathis: In discussing Tim Maudlin's paper, Bruno has concluded
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that either computationalism is false or the supervenience theory is  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; false.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As I understand it Bruno would say that physics supervenes on number  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness supervenes on physics.  So physics is eliminable.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Note that Maudlin's arrives at the same conclusion than me: NOT comp OR  
<br />
NOT physical-supervenience. Mauldin's concludes then, assuming  
<br />
sup-phys, that comp is problematic (although he realized that not-comp  
<br />
is yet still more problematic). I conclude, just because I keep comp at  
<br />
this stage, that sup-phys is false, and this makes primary matter  
<br />
eliminable. Physics as a field is not eliminate of course, but is  
<br />
eliminated as a fundamental field. It is not so astonishing given that  
<br />
physics does not often seriously address the mind/body puzzle, and when  
<br />
it does (cf Bunge) it still uses the aristotle means to put the problem  
<br />
under the rug.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; That interpretation can be reduced to computation is implicit in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computationalism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The question is what, if anything, is unique about those computations  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that execute
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interpretation.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Interpretation are done by interpreter, that is *universal* (turing)  
<br />
machine.
<br />
Perhaps we should agree on a definition, at least for the 3-notions: a  
<br />
3-interpretation can be encoded through a (in general infinite) trace  
<br />
of a computation.
<br />
With the [Fi, ...] and Fu being an universal function, and thus an  
<br />
interpreter, a 3-interpretation of the program i on data j will be  
<br />
given by a infinite sequence 1Fu(&lt;i,j&gt;), 2Fu(&lt;i,j&gt;), 3Fu(&lt;i,j&gt;),  
<br />
4Fu(&lt;i,j&gt;), 5Fu(&lt;i,j&gt;); 6Fu(&lt;i,j&gt;), 7Fu(&lt;i,j&gt;), 8Fu(&lt;i,j&gt;), ... The  
<br />
number x in xFu(&lt;i,j&gt;) represents the number of steps of the current  
<br />
computation, and &lt;i,j&gt; is the output of a computable bijection from N  
<br />
to NXN.
<br />
We must be careful to distinguish this 3-notion of interpretation and  
<br />
any notion of human conscious interpretation which is a first person  
<br />
notion (see below).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Stathis: You're right that the correct mapping is the one in which  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; you and the bat share the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; environment. That is what interaction with the environment does:  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; forces us to choose
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; one mapping out of all the possible ones, whether that involves  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; talking to another person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; or using a computer. However, that doesn't mean I know everything  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; about bats if I know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; everything about bat-computations. If it did, that would mean there  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; was no difference
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; between zombie bats and conscious bats, no difference between first  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; person knowledge
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and third person or vicarious knowledge.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't find either of those conclusions absurd.  Computationalism is  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thought to entail both of them.  Bruno's theory that identifies  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; knowledge with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; provability is the only form of computationalism that seems to allow  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the distinction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in a fundamental way.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Careful: I don't identify &quot;knowledge of p&quot; with &quot;provability of p&quot;. I  
<br />
do identify &quot;knowledge of p&quot; with &quot;provability of p AND p&quot;. Cf: I apply  
<br />
Theaetetus' definition on &quot;provability&quot;.
<br />
The confusion here is easy because, concerning a correct lobian  
<br />
machine, knowledge of p and provability of p are equivalent (almost by  
<br />
definition), but, the correct lobian machine itself cannot know that.  
<br />
In case I am a correct lobian, only my own G* can prove that my  
<br />
knowledge and my provability abilities are identical, but G* can prove  
<br />
also that I cannot prove that, nor can I know that in any scientific  
<br />
way. I can intuit that or bet on that, but no more.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But my point is that this may come down to what we would mean by a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computer being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious.  Bruno has an answer in terms of what the computer can  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prove.  Jaynes (and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probably John McCarthy) would say a computer is conscious if it  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; creates a narrative
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of its experience which it can access as memory.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK, modulo what I say just above. And given that &quot;proving&quot; entails the  
<br />
existence of a narration I think I am close to Jaynes and McCarthy,  
<br />
Except that Jaynes thinks about a third person narrative about a third  
<br />
person self (like a memory can refer too by comp). I take into account  
<br />
the incompleteness phenomena which forces us to distinguish the  
<br />
many-person point of views.
<br />
The provability of p, written Bp for short, can correspond to Jaynes  
<br />
&quot;narration&quot;, but consciousness is nearer the notion of Bp &amp; p or Bp &amp;  
<br />
Dp &amp; p (Theaetetical knowledge).
<br />
<br />The big nuance between Bp and Kp = Bp &amp; p, is that the lobian machine  
<br />
can prove that knowledge is incorrigible (Kp -&gt; p), and cannot prove  
<br />
that provability is incorrigible (Bp -&gt; p).
<br />
<br />Proof: suppose that for any p, the correct lobian machine can prove  
<br />
that Bp -&gt; p. Then she will prove Bf -&gt; f. But, by elementary  
<br />
propositional calculus Bf -&gt; f is equivalent with NOT Bf. But &quot;NOT Bf&quot;  
<br />
is equivalent &quot;I don't prove the false&quot; which is equivalent &quot;I am  
<br />
consistent&quot;. So the correct lobian machine would prove its own  
<br />
consistency, which is impossible for any correct lobian machine by  
<br />
Godel's second incompleteness theorem. OK?
<br />
<br />Must go now ... (Comments on Peter and Russell will follow asap)
