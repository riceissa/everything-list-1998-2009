I recently happened upon a physics related blog and discovered that
<br />
there has been an active debate within the physics community for the
<br />
past few weeks, months and years about string theory and its relation
<br />
to multiverse concepts.
<br />
<br />The blog is &quot;Not Even Wrong&quot;, <a href="http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/blog/">http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/blog/</a>,
<br />
by Peter Woit, a mathematician and string theory skeptic at Columbia.
<br />
His blog takes its name from his opinion about string theory: that it
<br />
should not even be considered a part of physics, since it has failed
<br />
for decades to make any testable predictions.
<br />
<br />Recently things have heated up with the publication of a new
<br />
book by Leonard Susskind, the so-called &quot;father of string theory&quot;:
<br />
&quot;The Cosmic Landscape: String Theory and the Illusion of Intelligent
<br />
Design&quot;.  Depending on who you read, the book either finally exposes the
<br />
intellectual bankruptcy of string theory, or else displays its incredible
<br />
mathematical beauty, elegance and power.  The New York Times book section
<br />
recently had a scathing review of the book, which has triggered much of
<br />
the current discussion.  At this time the most recent blog post is here:
<br />
&lt;<a href="http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=348">http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=348</a>&gt; and it links to
<br />
others, but the topic is far from exhausted.
<br />
<br />The reason for such contrasting opinions seems to come down to multiverse
<br />
models and anthropic reasoning.  Apparently modern formulations of string
<br />
theory do not describe a single universe.  Rather, there are a nearly
<br />
infinite (or actually infinite, by some interpretations) set of possible
<br />
parameters, all of which could represent a universe.  Our observable
<br />
universe is just one example of those.  Susskind basically adopts
<br />
Tegmark's level 2 multiverse to propose that all of the other string
<br />
theory universes exist within an overall framework of cosmological
<br />
inflation.  The fact that we see a particular set of parameters is
<br />
explained on anthropic principles, that in the other universes either
<br />
there are no people, or they observe different parameters.
<br />
<br />To say that this reasoning is unattractive to many physicists would be
<br />
an understatement.  Anthropic reasoning seems to be one of the great
<br />
dividing issues within the physics community.  Anti-anthropicists see it
<br />
as basically a matter of giving up on physics.  If all universes and all
<br />
sets of physical laws exist, then there is no possibility of explaining
<br />
them, no deep underlying principles, and no scientific theory involved.
<br />
It is just a matter of cataloging observations and putting them into
<br />
some semblance of order.  Further, no powerful predictions are possible
<br />
since there are a virtually infinite number of models which match any
<br />
set of observations.  To these physicists, any physical constant or
<br />
property whose value is left up to the anthropic principle is one which
<br />
has departed from the realm of physics.
<br />
<br />On the other side there is a small but growing number of workers who
<br />
accept anthropic reasoning for at least some constants.  I'm not sure
<br />
exactly why they are OK with it, but I get the impression that it comes
<br />
down to the fact that there seem to be many physical constants that are
<br />
fine-tuned for life.  The alternative is that God created the universe
<br />
specially for mankind, which is problematic for many well known reasons.
<br />
(Apparently Susskind goes to some lengths in his book to discuss this
<br />
issue.)  I think another reason is that there are so many physical
<br />
constants, and they seem so arbitrary, that the chance that they will
<br />
just pop out of some simple theory is becoming more and more remote,
<br />
so that these physicists have pretty much given up on that.  Then there
<br />
is the fact that the level 2 multiverse (separate universes as bubbles
<br />
within a background of cosmic inflation) is pretty much compatible with
<br />
modern day physics, so there is a place for multiple universes.
<br />
<br />Apparently Hawking is something of an anthropicist, and there is some
<br />
discussion of this on the blog at
<br />
&lt;<a href="http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=347">http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=347</a>&gt;.
<br />
<br />I think that part of the reason why multiverse models are seen as
<br />
nonphysical is because physicists do not recognize or accept the concepts
<br />
we have explored of &quot;measure&quot;.  When Susskind writes about the so-called
<br />
&quot;landscape&quot; of string theory, each point representing a different model,
<br />
he and everyone else assumes that each point is equally probable, has
<br />
equal measure.  Given such an assumption of uniform measure, it would
<br />
indeed be difficult or impossible to make predictions.
<br />
<br />In many of our discussions of multiverse models, we have explicitly or
<br />
implicitly included the notion of measure, that some universes would be
<br />
more &quot;common&quot; or more &quot;prominent&quot; than others.  This is often linked to
<br />
extensions of Occam's Razor, so that universes with relatively simple
<br />
models would have higher measure than those that are more complex.
<br />
Kolmogorov complexity is one way of defining a measure with this
<br />
desirable property.  This provides, in principle, a quantitative way
<br />
of evaluating the measure of different universe models.  Applying the
<br />
anthropic principle we then derive the result that we should live in a
<br />
universe which is about as simple as possible (i.e. has as high measure
<br />
as possible) consistent with the evolution of life.
<br />
<br />One could then look at all of these string theory models, where no doubt
<br />
some of them are very much simpler than others.  The simpler ones would
<br />
be the universes where we are most likely to live, if life is possible
<br />
at all in them.  Therefore the (near) infinity of possible models should
<br />
not immediately be cause for dispair, but rather there is reason to hope
<br />
that a model that defines the universe we actually live in may well be
<br />
relatively simple, within the reach of a practical research program.
<br />
<br />Of course there are no guarantees of this.  It could be that even though
<br />
the complexity of our universe is small compared to infinity, it is still
<br />
large compared to what human research could hope to achieve.  We really
<br />
don't have much basis to decide at this point, other than that the various
<br />
attempts to explore relatively simple string theory models have all failed
<br />
to describe a universe like ours.  They do reveal universes with particles
<br />
and force fields, but not ones that closely resemble our universe.  And
<br />
usually these hypothetical universes instantly explode or otherwise behave
<br />
in a manner hostile to life.
<br />
<br />Of course, this level of analysis reminds us that there is no reason
<br />
a priori that a variant of string theory has to be the correct model.
<br />
As we know from Tegmark and Schmidhuber, among others, it is easy to
<br />
generalize into a much wider set of possible universes.  String theory
<br />
has the nice feature that it creates a well-defined &quot;particle zoo&quot;, i.e.
<br />
a set of particles with particular masses, charges and other properties;
<br />
and it is perhaps not so easy to pull that out of other models.  But there
<br />
are undoubedly at least some other ways to do it.  And the truth is,
<br />
we don't even know that the existence of particles as we observe them
<br />
is truly as fundamental as string theory assumes.  Particles could be
<br />
an illusion, a manifestation of some deeper underlying phenomena.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately I think that in fairness we still have to classify most of
<br />
these multiverse concepts as philosophy more than physics.  Although we
<br />
can come up with some in-principle predictions - such as that we will
<br />
probably never discover a universe model that is much simpler than our
<br />
own but which would evolve life - I don't know of any predictions that
<br />
one could make based on anthropic reasoning that could be tested today.
<br />
Physics is a science, and that means it needs to work with theories that
<br />
can be tested and disproven.  We are a long way from being able to come
<br />
up with any experiment that a working physicist in his lab could run
<br />
to see whether multiverse models are correct.  (And no, quantum suicide
<br />
doesn't count!)
<br />
<br />I also get the impression that Susskind's attempts to bring &quot;disreputable&quot;
<br />
multiverse models into &quot;holy&quot; string theory is more likely to kill
<br />
string theory than to rehabilitate multiverses.  Perhaps I am getting a
<br />
biased view by only reading this one blog, which opposes string theory,
<br />
but it seems that more and more people are saying that the emperor has
<br />
no clothes.  If string theory needs a multiverse then it is even less
<br />
likely to ever be able to make physical predictions, and its prospects
<br />
are even worse than had been thought.  A lot of people seem to be piling
<br />
on and saying that it is time for physics to explore alternative ideas.
<br />
The hostile NY Times book review is just one example.
