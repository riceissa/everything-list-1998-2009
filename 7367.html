<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; same here; if you are interested in knowing what the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; case is, and not merely what the appearances are, then you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; have to understand that you are a physical process, and it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; may so happen that you execute in different places, and in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; different times, and that overlaps are possible.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Certainly, this is the objective truth, and I'm very fond of the objective 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; truth. But when we are talking about first person experience, we are not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessarily claiming that they provide us with objective knowledge of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world; we are only claiming that they provide us with objective knowledge of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our first person experience.
</em><br />
<br />&quot;Objective knowledge of my first person experience&quot;, eh?  I'll
<br />
have to ponder that one!  Perhaps it will help if I contrast
<br />
it with subjective knowledge of my first person experience  :-)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I [may] have to say that we are two different people when we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are separated by time as well as space or across parallel
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universes. What I would say is that my successor tomorrow 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is potentially &quot;me&quot; if there is continuity of consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between all the intermediates between now and then.
</em><br />
<br />I'm skeptical of &quot;continuity&quot; requirements. Now I do not believe in
<br />
Greg Egan's equations in &quot;Permutation City&quot;: according to a premise
<br />
of the story, it order to obtain the you of tomorrow, there is a
<br />
short-cut alternative to just letting you run.  And that is to
<br />
determine the solutions of an immense number of differential
<br />
equations that do not in fact emulate your intermediary states.
<br />
If this were so, then it may be that you could discontinuously
<br />
skip past all of tonight and tomorrow's experiences, and just
<br />
start living by directly experiencing the day after that.
<br />
<br />It's easy to imagine this being possible; when I was a teen and
<br />
was faced with the loathsome task of mowing the lawn, I wondered
<br />
if it could be possible for me to just not have that experience
<br />
at all, but for my life to just magically resume after the chore
<br />
was completed (somehow).  I was aware that what I wanted was not
<br />
simply memory erasure.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The successor of my duplicate with the headache does not satisfy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this criterion and is therefore not potentially &quot;me&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />Well, are you sure?  What if he takes a memory-erasure pill
<br />
(that works much more perfectly than Midazolam) and thereby
<br />
becomes a past state that is identical to one of &quot;your&quot;
<br />
past states, and then evolves forward into states that you
<br />
definitely consider to be your natural successors.
<br />
<br />After people are uploadable, this could happen without much
<br />
fuss all the time. The interplay of and algebraic combinatorial
<br />
possibilities of *memory addition*, *experience*, and *memory
<br />
erasure* lead back to the notion that one is just a fuzzy set
<br />
in the collection of all persons or person-states.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Arbitrary though this criterion for continuity of identity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; may be, it is the criterion our minds have evolved with,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and calling it irrational will not change that fact.
</em><br />
<br />Well, some of this is involuntary, but some of it is not.
<br />
I've never seen how to shake *anticipation*, for example,
<br />
and suppose that we're just stuck with it, problems and
<br />
all. But actually I don't have any problem believing that
<br />
I *am* my duplicates, even those across the room, who are
<br />
just me seeing a different perspective of the room (and
<br />
perhaps having slightly different thoughts).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If we are to be strictly rational and consistent, it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is simplest to go to the extreme of saying that *none*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the instantiations of an individual are actually the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;same&quot; person, which is another way of saying that each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer moment exists only transiently. This would mean 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that we only live for a moment, to be replaced by a copy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; who only thinks he has a past and a future.
</em><br />
<br />Mike Perry, in his book &quot;Forever For All&quot; develops these
<br />
from the idea of &quot;day-persons&quot;, i.e., the idea that you
<br />
are not the same person from day to day. But that's 
<br />
certainly not a satisfactory way of extending our usual
<br />
notions into these bizarre realms; you and I want to live
<br />
next week because we believe that we are the same persons
<br />
we'll be then.  And the idea that we *are* fuzzy sets in
<br />
person space permits this.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; We die all the time, so death is nothing to worry about.
</em><br />
<br />On this definition, yes. But this is *such* an impractical
<br />
approach. We all know that it's bad for your neighbor when
<br />
he dies, despite us and him totally believing in the MWI.
<br />
We would like to avoid having to say that we die all the
<br />
time.
<br />
<br />Lee
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I actually believe this extreme view to be closest to the &quot;objective 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; truth&quot;, but I still make plans for the future and I still don't want to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;die&quot; in the more usual sense of the word. Being &quot;rational&quot; is completely 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; incapable of making any impact on my biological programming in this case, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and as you know, there are people in the world who hold being rational in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; much lower esteem than the members of this list do.
