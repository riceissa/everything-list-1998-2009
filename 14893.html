<br />
I am here providing a summary of my '10 big ideas' for Cog-Sci/AGI.
<br />
No justifcation is provided as of yet (that is, my purpose here is
<br />
merely to clearly and briefly state my 10 big ideas).  Their status at
<br />
this time is of entertaining speculation only.
<br />
<br />So here's the 10 big ideas:
<br />
<br />(1)  The extreme low entropy density at the beginning of time and the
<br />
predictable increase in entropy shows that the universe can be thought
<br />
of an RPOP [Really Powerful Optimization Process] (albiet an extremely
<br />
poorly optimized one).  This is NOT to say that the increase in
<br />
entropy is the purpose of the universe (that would be ludicrous),
<br />
rather than the increase in entropy shows that there is a universal
<br />
optimization pressure, and the universe can be thought of as an
<br />
integrated, time asymmetric system.  Thus, there are universal
<br />
terminal values.
<br />
<br />(2)  The universal terminal values are ultimately grounded in
<br />
aesthetics.  That is to say, there may be a huge myriad of worth-while
<br />
terminal values, but my claim is that these are all special cases of
<br />
'beauty'.  That is,  the creation of beauty is the actual purpose of
<br />
the universe (the thing being optimized by the universal RPOP).
<br />
<br />(3)  Bayesian reasoning is NOT the ultimate system of rational
<br />
calculation.  In fact, analogy formation IS.  Whereas, conventional
<br />
Bayesians would regard analogy formation as a special case of Bayes,
<br />
my claim is that the converse is actually the case... it is actually
<br />
Bayes that is a special case of analogy formation, and analogy
<br />
formation in the most general sense cannot be reduced to Bayesian
<br />
reasoning.
<br />
<br />(4)  The precise mathematics of analogy formation utilizes the
<br />
concepts of *category theory*.  Analogy formation is equivalent to
<br />
*ontology merging* - the mapping of a concept from one knowledge
<br />
domain, to another knowledge domain.  Ultimately,ontology/KR
<br />
[Knowledge Representation] is all of effective intelligence.  That is,
<br />
my claim is that all the puzzles of cognitive science/AI are merely
<br />
sub-problems of ontology/KR.  Theres a simple formula of category
<br />
theory which tells you exactly how to calculate the 'semantic
<br />
distance' between any two concepts and carry out the mapping between
<br />
them.  Bayes theorem is merely a special case of this formula.  This
<br />
formula is the *real* secret to the universe!
<br />
<br />(5)  A fully general purpose ontology results in the stratification of
<br />
reality into three levels - the *platonic* level (which is timeless,
<br />
and is basically equivalent the Tegmark universe), consisting of
<br />
*platonic archetypes* (abstractions); the *system* level, consisting
<br />
of reality as seen by an observers - dynamical systems with input,
<br />
processing and output; and the *artifact* level, consisting of static
<br />
*things* that are outputs of the system level above it.
<br />
<br />(6)  From (5) - There exist real *platonic mathematical forms*, which
<br />
are outside space and time (platonic level), *mathematical systems* ,
<br />
which are the implemented algorithms seen by observers inside space
<br />
and time, and finally *mathematical artifacts*, which are the
<br />
onotologies by which observers classify reality.
<br />
<br />(7)  Ontologies are the means by which we *reflect* on knowledge.
<br />
They are the *internal language of the mind* which we use to
<br />
*communicate* (map) logical concepts from one domain to another.  The
<br />
formula referred to in my claim (4) provides the solution to the
<br />
problem of goal stability - it tells you exactly how a mind can hold a
<br />
stable goal system under reflection - recall - this formula is not
<br />
Bayesian - instead it uses the math of category theory to show how to
<br />
map a concept from one knowledge domain (ontology) to another
<br />
knowledge domain (ontology).
<br />
<br />(8)  Consciousness is generated by the aforementioned *ontology
<br />
merging* (which, recall, I'm claiming is equivalent to *analogy
<br />
formation*).  It is simply the integration of concepts from different
<br />
knowledge domains.
<br />
<br />(9)  The ultimately non-Bayesian nature of true, general purpose
<br />
intelligence is a consequence of Occam's razor.  Occam's razar states
<br />
that the simple is favored over the complex.  Popper showed that there
<br />
are an inifnite number of theories compatible with any given finite
<br />
set of observations - successful induction requires an non-Bayesian
<br />
ingredient - this the means of *setting the priors* to reduce the
<br />
number of initial possibilities under consideration to manageable
<br />
number.  Occam's razor itself cannot be reduced to Bayes, because
<br />
judgements about what is simple and complex depend on *the semantics*
<br />
(logical meaning) of the theories under consideration, whereas Bayes
<br />
only deals with predication sequences - detection of externally
<br />
observable patterns.  Bayes only deals with *functionality*
<br />
(externally observable consequences) - full intelligence deals with
<br />
*semantics* (the meaning of concepts), and this goes beyond mere
<br />
Bayesian probability shuffling.
<br />
<br />(10) The universal terminal values (which, recall, I'm suggesting are
<br />
all sub-values of 'beauty'), are a consequence of (1)-(9). Recall,
<br />
that I said that I thought that all problems of Cog-Sci are merely sub-
<br />
problems of Ontology/KR.  But Onotlogy/KR is all about
<br />
*representations of things*.  And Occams razor says the simple is
<br />
favored over the complex.  In terms of representations of things, this
<br />
is just to say that some representations are more elegant than others
<br />
(which is the very definition of aesthetics!).  Thus, it follows
<br />
uiversal values are implicit in the very nature of successful
<br />
cognition itself.
<br />
<br />Yeah.  Thats it.  My genius stands or falls on my 10 big ideas ;)
