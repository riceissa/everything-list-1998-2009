Hi LZ!
<br />
<br />&lt;snip&gt;
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and the perfect benchmark behaviour to contrast the zombie
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and the human.So, I have my zombie scientist and my human
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; scientist and I ask them to do science on exquisite novelty.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; What happens? The novelty is invisible to the zombie, who
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; has the internal life of a dreamless sleep.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think you are confusing lack of phenomenality with lack of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; response to the environment. Simple sensors
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can respond without (presumably) phenomenality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So can humans with blindsight (but not very efficiently).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />No confusion at all. The zombie is behaving. 'Wide awake' in the sense
<br />
that it is fully functional. Doing stuff. I said it has the _internal
<br />
life_ of a dreamless sleep, not that it was asleep. This means that the
<br />
life you 'experience that is the state of a dreamless sleep - the nothing
<br />
of it - that is the entire life of the awake zombie.
<br />
<br />Want to partially 'zombie' yourself?  close your eyes. block your ears. I
<br />
know seeing black/hearing nothing is not blindess/deafness, but you get
<br />
the idea.
<br />
<br />Scientific behaviour demanded of the zombie condition is a clearly
<br />
identifiable behavioural benchmark where we can definitely claim that
<br />
phenomenality is necessary...see below...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The reason it is invisible is because there is no phenomenal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; consciousness. The zombie has only sensory data to use to do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; science. There are an infinite number of ways that same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; sensory data could arrive from an infinity of external
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; natural world situtations. The sensory data is ambiguous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That doesn't follow. The Zombie can produce different responses
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on the basis of physical differences in its input, just as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a machine can.
</em><br />
<br />I spent tens of thousands of hours designing, building, benchtesting and
<br />
commissioning zombies. On the benchtop I have pretended to be their
<br />
environment and they had no 'awareness' they weren't in their real
<br />
environment. It's what makes bench testing possible. The universe of the
<br />
zombies was the universe of my programming. The zombies could not tell if
<br />
they were in the factory or on the benchtop. That's why I can empathise so
<br />
well with zombie life. I have been literally swatted by zombies
<br />
(robot/cranes and other machines) like I wasn't there....scares the hell
<br />
out of you! Some even had 'vision systems' but were still blind.
<br />
<br />so....yes the zombie can 'behave'. What I am claiming is they cannot do
<br />
_science_ i.e. they cannot behave scientifically. This is a very specific
<br />
claim, not a general claim.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;- it's all the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; same - action potential pulse trains traveling from sensors to brain.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No, it's not all the same. Its coded in a very complex way. It's like
</em><br />
saying the information in you computer is &quot;all the same -- its all ones
<br />
and zeros&quot;
<br />
<br />yes you got it - all coded....I am talking about action potential pulse
<br />
trains. They are all the same general class. Burst mode/Continuous mode,
<br />
all the same basic voltage waveform, overshoot, refratory period...LTP,
<br />
LTD, afterhyperpolarisation.... all the same class for sight, sound,
<br />
taste, imagination, touch, thirst, orgasm etc etc... coded messages
<br />
travelling all the way from the periphery and into the brain. They are all
<br />
the same...and..
<br />
<br />None of it says anything about WHY the input did what it did. The
<br />
causality outside the zombie is MISSING from these signals. They have no
<br />
intrinsic sensation to them either. The only useful information is the
<br />
body knows implicitly where they came from..which still is not enough
<br />
because:
<br />
<br />Try swapping the touch nerves for 2 fingers. You 'touch' with one and feel
<br />
the touch happen on the other. The touch sensation is created as
<br />
phenomenal consciousness in the brain using the measurement, not the
<br />
signal measurement itself.
<br />
<br />Now think about the touch..the same sensation of touch could have been
<br />
generated by a feather or a cloth or another finger or a passing car. That
<br />
context is what phenomenal consciousness provides.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The zombie cannot possibly distinguish the novelty from the sensory
</em><br />
data
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and has no awareness of the external world or even its own boundary.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Huh? It's perfectly possible to build a robot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that produces a special signal when it encounters input it has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not encountered before.
</em><br />
<br />Yes but how is it to do anything to contextualise the input other than
<br />
correlate it with other signals? (none of which, in themselves, generate
<br />
any phenomenal consciousness, they trigger it downstream in the
<br />
cranium/cortex).
<br />
<br />re robot...now do science on a signal and use the signal to make a
<br />
statement about the natural world that generated/caused the signal
<br />
elsewhere away from/outside the robot. It can't. It's blind, deaf, can't
<br />
taste or smell or touch. Having the sensor transduction does not give it
<br />
sight... that is scientifically proven fact. EG There is a HUGE neural
<br />
sensory transduction/actuation system along the wall of your intestines,
<br />
of which you have no awareness at all, but is hammering away like a
<br />
factory squeezing and pushing all day...
<br />
<br />Put it this way.... a 'red photon' arrives and hits a retina cone and
<br />
isomerises a protein, causing a cascade that results in an action
<br />
potential pulse train. That photon could have come from alpha-centuri,
<br />
bounced off a dog collar or come from a disco light. The receptor has no
<br />
clue. Isomerisation of a protein has nothing to do with 'seeing'. In the
<br />
human the perception (sensation) of a red photon happens in the visual
<br />
cortex as an experience of redness and is 'projected' mentally into the
<br />
phenomenal scene. That way the human can tell where it came from. The
<br />
mystery of how that happens is another story. That it happens and is
<br />
necessary for science is what matters here.
<br />
<br />The main fact is that the zombie does not have sensation at all and that
<br />
as a result it cannot do science on the world outside the zombie. It's
<br />
doesn't even know there is a world to do science on. All it can do is
<br />
correlate measurements with each other, measurements that could have come
<br />
from anywhere and the zombie can never tell from where.
<br />
<br />I have great empathy for the poor zombie! Indeed I am starting to realise
<br />
that it may be my practical training which has enabled me to better
<br />
understand the zombie - more so than the norm... it seems to have made
<br />
certain things rather more plain to me than others.
<br />
<br />cheers
<br />
<br />Colin
