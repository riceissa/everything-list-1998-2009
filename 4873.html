<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK. I get your point. That &quot;supersolipsistic&quot; situation is rendered

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; berak apart with the accelerated expansion. The chances of every

out
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of of space-time problems altogether. 
</em><br />
<br />At a small (galaxy size) cross section the effect of inflation has 
<br />
not yet (for the time periods we can observe) reached the point of 
<br />
causing a breaking apart. Gravity is still dominant in those local 
<br />
systems. Either there is or there is not inflation, either all 
<br />
objects as a result of inflation are or they are not all moving away 
<br />
and increasing distance from from each other. Unless it can be argued 
<br />
that inflation is not universal then it follows that ALL particles, 
<br />
macroscopic and microscopic are inflating.
<br />
<br />But, might the affect on fundamental forces also be inflating in 
<br />
propertion to all other inflation repercussions!? If so, then another 
<br />
argument is needed for why the universe went from a slowing down 
<br />
expansion rate to a speeding up expansion rate. To imagine a cyclic 
<br />
expansion rate requires that a new fundamental force be discovered.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well we can and have measured the dark energy distribution via 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the luminosity distance of Type Ia supernovae and the CMB 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; background observations (recentlyWMAP) and it is smooth, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; uniform and &quot;tensional&quot;(=feels like a negative pressure). 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is not an inference: it is as direct evidence as you can get 
</em><br />
in
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the cosmological domain! 
</em><br />
<br />I'm not ready to agree fully accept that!&lt;grin&gt; We have measured that 
<br />
inflation is continuing, and in relation to observation of those 
<br />
supernovae the reality seems widespread and consistant. But that's a 
<br />
long ways from saying that the *distribution* of dark energy is 
<br />
uniform througout the entire universe.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Dark Energy, if indeed originated in the Big
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bang, could have had a very different distribution than and that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; part of the problem: we don't know why it resulted in such a small
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cosmological term if it is indeed the combined energy of all the 
</em><br />
vacua
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the interactions we know about... 
</em><br />
<br />But then we don't know why any particles have the mass and energy 
<br />
that they do have, either. Some say it was chance that they are as 
<br />
they are (and lucky for us that things chanced as they did!) But that 
<br />
argument belies that virtual particles seem to have rules they obey. 
<br />
We just don't know why the rules are as they are, we just see the 
<br />
game being played.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I addressed this point you keep making above. This is really not 
</em><br />
worth
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; worrying about. Collapse is a much more likely end for a particle 
</em><br />
than
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; supreme loneliness... 
</em><br />
<br />But how can you say that? You maybe have a thought that the universe 
<br />
is not really expanding, forever and for eternity, and at all points 
<br />
(even within subatomic points) within itself? What mechanism might be 
<br />
involved? But maybe I do not understand what you mean by &quot;collapse&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It isn't quite like that! If anything QM shows you that distant 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particles 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interact in some manner or better, exhibit non-local correlations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; beyond their time-like separation, so even between disconnected 
</em><br />
pices
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the Metaverse (Level 1 as the list lingo goes)there are residual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bonds that do not care about universal expansion... 
</em><br />
<br />And there be the rub. Spooky is a good term. That bonding phenomenon 
<br />
does seem to be empirical. The question remains to be answered 
<br />
regarding if *imposed* information can be exchanged with the 
<br />
phenomenon, and latest indications are that particles moving at near 
<br />
light speed have a problem maintaining the bond. Perhaps the bond is 
<br />
broken when the rate of inflation becomes great enough? If the bond 
<br />
gets broken then a particle can not interact as it otherwise could! 
<br />
There is no speed limit (such as the speed of light) being argued for 
<br />
an ever increasing space/time inflation rate for the universe, is 
<br />
there?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The worries that the Universe will reach a heat bath state left
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; people very worried 2 centuries ago. I think that all the dark 
</em><br />
stuff,
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ominous as it sounds is kinda reassuring that such end is quite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unlikely. But, if you want to be worried, I am sure you can find
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; plenty of reasons, still. 
</em><br />
<br />Empirical evidence is all that counts, reasonings must take it into 
<br />
account. My argument is that inflation must at some finite point in 
<br />
time result in no particle being able to exchange energy with any 
<br />
other particle in the entire universe - because the distance between 
<br />
all particles (and caused by space/time inflation) is then increasing 
<br />
at a rate faster than light. That's not the same as saying that a 
<br />
particle evaporated, although the end result seems the same! My 
<br />
arguement does not require that all particles be at the same energy 
<br />
potential, it only requires that they each not be able to know what 
<br />
potential any other is at and indeed be unable to know that any other 
<br />
particles exist whatsoever. The end result is a universe at zero 
<br />
energy, because there is no way to take a measurement (relativity 
<br />
will have become meaningless). This is not at all the same mechanism 
<br />
that they referred to 2 centuries ago!
<br />
<br />Mr. Leao, I very much appreciate your conversation. Understand that I 
<br />
do not attack, nor even suggest new ideas! I'm only trying to give a 
<br />
viewpoint (which might be a little unique to myself, granted! or an 
<br />
assembly of viewpoints that is ultimately differing in logic but 
<br />
meant to explain what already appears to have been put forth by many 
<br />
very highly qualified people (one of which I am not). While my 
<br />
arguments are circular, it is what makes them consistent. Break the 
<br />
logic at any point and if it can not be adjusted to agree with the 
<br />
empirical then it is faulty logic.  :)
<br />
<br />Your turn, sir. I really do look forward to your responses! It would 
<br />
be nice if others would comment on all we've both said, too.
<br />
<br />Ron McFarland
